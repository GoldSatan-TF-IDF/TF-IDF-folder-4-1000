bam bam bam it sounded like someone was knocking with a sledgehammer i rolled over and cracked a bloodshot eye i couldnt see a figure through the window but that wasnt surprising i could barely make out the lettering on the grimy glass garrett investigator confidential agent i had blown my wad buying the glass and wound up being my own painter the window was as dirty as last weeks dishwater but not filthy enough to block out the piercing morning light the damned sun wasnt up yet and id been out till the second watch barhopping while i followed a guy who might lead me to a guy who might know where i could find a guy all this led to was a pounding headache go away i growled not available bam bam bam go to hell away i yelled it left my head feeling like an egg that had just bounced off the edge of a frying pan i wondered if i ought to feel the back to see if the yolk was leaking but it seemed like too much work id just go ahead and die bam bam bam i have a little trouble with my temper especially when i have a hangover i was halfway to the door with two feet of leadweighted truncheon before sense penetrated the scrambled yolk when they are that insistent its somebody from up the hill with a summons to do work too sticky to lay on their own boys or its somebody from down the hill with the word that youre stepping on the wrong toes in the latter case the truncheon might be useful i yanked the door open for a moment i didnt see the woman she barely came up to my chest i eyeballed the three guys behind her they were lugging enough steel to outfit their own army but i wouldnt have been shy about wading in two of them were about fifteen years old and the other was about a hundred and five were invaded by dwarfs i moaned none of them was taller than the woman are you garrett she looked disappointed in what she saw no two doors down goodbye slam two doors down was a nightworking ratman who made a hobby of getting on my nerves i figured it was his turn in the barrel i stumbled toward bed with the vague suspicion that i had seen those people before i wriggled around like an old dog when youre hung over there is no way to get comfortable feather bed or creek bed just as i was getting reacquainted with being horizontal again bam bam bam i told myself i wouldnt move they would take the hint they didnt it sounded like the entire room was about to cave in i was not going to get any more sleep i got up again gingerly and drank a quart of water i chased it with skunky beer and clung to my temper precariously bam bam bam i dont make a habit of busting female heads i told the tiny woman when i opened the door again but in your case i think i can make an exception she was not impressed dad wants to see you garrett say thats wonderful that explains a gang of runts trying to break my door down what does the gnome king want the old codger said rose its obvious this isnt a convenient time for mr garrett weve waited three days a few more hours wont make any difference rose i should know a rose from somewhere but where mr garrett im lester tate and i want to apologize on roses behalf for bothering you at this hour shes a headstrong child and having been overindulged by my brother all her life shes blind to any desires but her own he spoke in the soft tired voice of a man who spends a lot of time arguing with a whirlwind lester tate i asked like in denny tates uncle lester yes its beginning to come back the family picnic at elephant rocks three years ago i came with denny maybe i had laundered my memory because rose had been an unspeakably nasty wench that day maybe it was all the hardware that made me forget your faces denny tate and i went back about eight years but i hadnt seen him in months so how is denny i asked maybe a little guilty dead barked sweet sister rose denny tate and i were heroes of the cantard wars that means we did our five years and got out alive a lot of guys dont we went in about the same time were barracked less than twenty miles apart but never met till later here in tunfaire eight hundred miles from the fighting he was light cavalry out of fort must i was fleet marines mostly aboard the imperial kimmswick out of full harbor i fought in the islands denny rode over most of the cantard chasing or running away from the venageti we both made sergeant before we got out it was a nasty war it still is i like it better now that its much farther away denny saw more of the worst than i did the fighting at sea and in the islands was sideshow stuff neither we nor the venageti wasted wizards on it all the flash and fury of sorcery got saved for the struggle on the mainland anyway wed both survived our five and had done part of them in the same general area and that had given us something in common when we met it was good enough till we got to know one another so thats why youre a walking arsenal what is it a vendetta maybe youd better get inside rose cackled like a hen laying a square egg uncle lester laughed too but it was a laugh of a different breed shut up rosie im sorry mr garrett the weapons are here to feed rosies hunger for drama she believes we dont dare enter this neighborhood unarmed lest the local thugs ravish her it was not a good dawn for me few of them are without thinking i cracked the thugs in my neighborhood have some taste she doesnt have to worry blame it on the hangover uncle lester grinned rose looked at me like i was dog flop she wanted off her shoe i tried to gloss over with business who did it what can i do about it nobody did it rose told me he fell off a horse and busted his head his neck and about ten other bones hard to believe a skilled horseman could go that way it happened in broad daylight on a busy street theres no doubt that it was an accident then what do you need me for especially before the sun is up thats for dad to tell rose said the shrew had a lot of anger in her anger that was there before i gave her cause bringing you in on it was his idea not mine i knew dennys old man modestly well enough to use his first name if i was the kind of snotnose who calls his friends parent by name instead of mister he ran a very successful cobblers business he denny and two journeyman handled the custom and commercial trade uncle lester and a dozen apprentices made boots under an openend deal with the army the war had been good to dennys dad they do say it is an ill wind indeed that blows no one any good well i was awake hair of the dog and scintillating conversation had reduced the pounding in my head to the tramp of ten thousand legions still there was a nagging guilt about not having made time to see denny before the old gal in black climbed on his back i decided to find out why the old man needed somebody in my line of work when there wasnt a doubt about how denny checked out let me get myself put together and well be on our way rose grinned wickedly i realized id fed her a murderous straight line i didnt stick around to hear her pounce on it willard tate was no bigger than the rest of his tribe a gnome he was bald on top with tasseled gray hair to his shoulders on the sides and longer in the back he was bent over his workbench tapping tiny brass nails into the heel of a womans shoe clearly he was at the top of his trade he wore square tanhageen spectacles and they dont come cheap he was engrossed in his work recalling his state since his wife died i figured he was working off grief mr tate he knew i was there i had cooled my heels for twenty minutes while they told him he drove one more nail with a single perfect tap looked at me over his cheaters mr garrett they tell me you made mock of our size i get nasty when somebody drags me out before the sun comes up thats rose if she has to see you in shell see you in the hard way i made a bad job of her keep her in mind as you rear your own children i said nothing you tell somebody you look forward to blindness more eagerly than to having kids you dont win any friends those that dont think youre lying think youre crazy do you have a problem with short people mr garrett about six flip answers never saw the air he was dead serious not really denny wouldnt have been my buddy if i did why is it important in a sideways sort of way did you ever wonder why the tates are so small i had never dwelled on it no its the blood the taint of elvish on both sides several generations before my time keep that in mind it will help you understand later i wasnt surprised id suspected it before the way denny got along with animals plenty of people have the taint yet most cover it up there is a lot of prejudice against the half elfin my hangover had improved but not much i had no patience can we get to the point mr tate you want me to do a job or what i want you to find someone he rose from his bench and shed his leather apron come with me i went he took me into the tate secret world the compound behind the manufactory denny never did that youve been doing all right for yourself i said we entered a formal garden the existence of which id never suspected we manage i should manage so good where are we headed dennys apartment buildings stood shoulder to shoulder around the garden from the street they looked like one continuous featureless warehouse from the garden i could not imagine how id ever thought that these houses were as fine as anything up the hill they simply didnt face the street and make temptingly dangerous statements i wondered if they killed the workmen when the job was done the whole tate tribe lives here yes not much privacy too much i think we all have our own apartments some have streetside doors dennys does tates tone said this is a significant fact my curiosity was definitely growing tates whole attitude indicated indignation at dennys having had secrets from his old man he took me to dennys place the air inside was stuffy and warm the way closed places get in summer nothing had changed since the one time denny had invited me in through the streetside door except that denny wasnt there that made a lot of difference the place was as plain and neat as a new cheap coffin denny had been a man of ascetic habits hed never hinted at the comforts enjoyed by his family its in the basement what is what i want you to see before i start explaining he collected a lantern and lit it with a long match which he kept burning moments later we were in a basement as spotless as the ground floor old man tate and his match went around lighting lamps i made like a cat too lazy to lick his own paws and just hung around with my mouth open tate wore a small smug smile when he faced me again well the cat that had my tongue could have fought a couple weights heavier than a snow leopard the only place you even hear about that much precious metal lying around is in stories about dragon hoards actually when my mind started working i saw it wasnt so much after all just more than id ever imagined i would see in one place a few hundred robbers working double shifts for four or five years might pile up as much where how i dont know most of the answers myself mr garrett my knowledge is limited to the notes denny left they were all written to himself he knew what he was talking about there is enough to fill in the outlines though i expect youll want to read everything before you start i nodded but did not hear him my friend denny the shoemaker with a basement full of silver denny whose only mention of money had been about the share he had taken when his regiment had overwhelmed a venageti treasure caravan fleeing the defeat at jordan wells how much i croaked i was not getting any better the little guy that sits in the back row inside my head started catcalling me i never thought wealth could have so much impact upon me sixty thousand marks in karentine coined silver the equivalent of eighteen thousand marks in coined silver of other states eight hundred fourounce bars six hundred twentythree eightounce bars fortyfour onepound bars one hundred ten pounds in larger bars just under one thousand coined goldmarks theres some billet tin and copper too a nice amount but it doesnt count for much compared with the silver not unless a couple copper sceats would make the difference between eating and starvation how did he do it dont tell me making ballroom slippers for fat duchesses nobody gets rich working i almost said honestly trading in metals tate gave me a dontbestupid look playing the changes in the shifting exchange rate between gold and silver buying silver when it was cheap against gold selling it when gold was cheap against silver he started with his prize money from the army he switched back and forth at the best points in the cycle thats what i meant when i said keep the elvish blood in mind we people of elvish ancestry have a feel for silver youre stereotyping yourself pop you understand what ive said how he came by it i dont want you to think its dishonest wealth i understand that did not make me think it was necessarily honest anyone with a knack for reading the shifts could get rich the same way silver goes up and down violently according to the armys fortunes in the cantard as long as we are plagued by sorcerers there will be an incredible demand for the metal ninety percent of the worlds silver is mined in the cantard under all the excuses and historical claims the mines are what the war is all about maybe if we could rid the world of magicians and their hunger for the mystic metal peace and prosperity would break out all over well tate asked well what will you do the job for us good question i thought i looked at tate and saw a momentary idiot a fool trying to twist me into doing something he feared id turn my back on if i knew the whole story pop would you make shoes if you didnt know the size if you hadnt even seen the person who was going to wear them without knowing anything about getting paid ive been real patient on account of you being dennys old man but im not going to play games he hemmed and hawed come on pop open the poke shake it out lets see if the little porker oinks or meows his expression became pained almost pleading im just trying to do right by my son trying to carry out his last wishes well put up a statue when does the clam open up or do i go home and finish sleeping off this hangover why do they always do this they bring you in to handle a problem then lie about it or hide it from you but they never stop screaming for results youve got to understand mr tate i dont have to understand anything except exactly what is going on why dont you start from the beginning tell me what you know what you want and why you need me and dont leave anything out if i take the job and find out you have ill get extremely angry im not a very nice man when i get angry have you had your breakfast mr garrett of course not rose wakened you and brought you straight here why dont we do that while i order my thoughts because theres nothing guaranteed to make me madder quicker than a stall he went red in the face he was not used to backtalk you talk or i walk this is my life youre wasting damn it a man cant i started toward the stairs all right stop i paused waited after denny died i came here and found all this tate said and i found a will a registered will most people dont bother to register but that didnt amount to anything remarkable so so in the will he names you and me his executors that damned sawedoff little runt id break his neck for him if he hadnt already done it himself thats it all the shufflefooting and coy looks is because he rung in an outsider hardly its the terms of the will that are embarrassing yeah he tell everybody what he thought of them in a way he left everything but our executors fees to someone none of us ever heard of i laughed that was denny so he made the money its his to give away i dont deny that and i dont mind believe it or not but for roses sake you know what he thought about her want me to tell you she is his sister not that he had any choice about it the nicest thing he ever said about her was shes a useless lazy whining conniving freeloader the word bitch came up a few times too but never mind i dont want to hear it so what you want is for me to find this mysterious heir eh and then what they want you to do some crazy things sometimes i could guess why denny registered his will a rose with thorns just tell her the bequest is here for the claiming get a statement of intent we can file with the registry probate already theyre harassing us about showing them that were doing something to execute the terms of the will that figured i knew those jackasses before the brewery gave me the consulting job i did investigations for them freelance to make ends meet you said her this heir is a woman denny never mentioned knowing any women all the time i knew him i had him figured for a complete asexual yes an old girlfriend from when he was in the army he never fell out of love it seems and they never stopped writing letters even though she married somebody else youll find your best leads in those letters you were in the cantard too so youll know the places she talks about the cantard thats where she is yes where are you going ive been to the cantard once i didnt get a choice that time this time i do find yourself another patsy mr tate mr garrett youre one of the executors and im too old to make that trip wont hold a shot of legal water pop an executor dont have to do squat if he didnt say he would and sign to do it up front goodbye mr garrett the law allows the executors to draw up to ten percent of the value of an estate to recompense themselves and to cover their expenses dennys estate will go on the up side of a hundred thousand marks that was a stopper something to make me think for about two winks five thousand aint to die for pop and i dont have anybody to leave it to ten thousand mr garrett ill leave you my side i dont want it i admit i hesitated first no ill pay your expenses out of my own purse that makes it ten thousand clear i stayed clammed was the old coot in training for a devils job what will it take mr garrett how come youre so hot to find this frail i want to meet her mr garrett i want to see the sort of woman capable of making a monkey of my son name your price even rich dont do you any good if the wild dogs of the cantard are cracking your bones to get at the marrow name your price mr garrett i am an old man who has lost the son he expected to follow him i am a wealthy man with no more need to cling to wealth i am a determined man i will see this woman so again i say name your price i should have known better hell i did know better id been saying so for ten minutes give me a thousand on account ill look over the stuff denny left and do some poking around at this end just to see if its feasible ill let you know what i decide i went back down the stairs and pulled up a chair behind the desk where dennys letters and notes were piled i have to get back to work tate called ill have rose bring you some breakfast as i listened to tales tiny footsteps fade away i couldnt help but weigh the possibility of dear rose slipping something poisonous into my food i sighed and turned to my work hoping this next meal wouldnt be my last the first thing i did was look for the stuff dennys family had missed misers always have something they think they have to hide a basement like that plain as it looked had a thousand crannies where things could be squirreled away just as i spotted it a little dirt fell from the underflooring overhead i cocked an ear not a sound somebody was doing a passable job of catfooting around up there i had my feet on dennys desk and was expanding my literary horizons when rose and my griddle cakes sneaked on stage i checked her over the top of the first page of a letter that somehow had a quality of déjà vu but i didnt pay much attention the smell of griddle cakes with wild honey tea hens eggs hot buttered bread and steamed boodleberry preserves was a bit distracting to a man in my condition rose was distracting too she was smiling snakes smile that way before they strike when her sort smile you had better check over your shoulder for a guy with a knife she placed the tray before me still smiling heres a little of everything we had in the kitchen i hope youll find something to suit when theyre nice to you you had better get your back against a wall your feet hurt no she gave me a puzzled look what makes you ask that the look on your face it has to be pain not a flicker of response except so the old man talked you into it did he i raised an eyebrow into what finding that woman of dennys plenty of vitriol pent up behind that smile nope i told him id go over dennys papers and look around town a little i would tell him what i thought thats all youre going to do it how much did he offer you to find her i put my best blank cardplaying face and stared into the starved ice marbles of her eyes i dont believe that stuff about windows of the soul ive seen too many lying eyes but beyond hers lay nothing but shattersharp flint and frosty iron ill give you twenty percent if you dont find her twentyfive if you find her dead blankfaced i started on my breakfast there was ham and sausage too the tea was so good i drained half the pot before i touched anything else i could be very generous she said turning sideways posing to show what she had she had the equipment all of it and plenty of it a prime little package but a package filled with rot denny said that you like small women some better than others i thought i make a point of trying not to be cruel to people rose the best i can do here is speak plain and say im not interested she took rejection well she ignored it im going with you you know with me where to the cantard ive got a flash for you lady im not doing any dirty work for you and you arent crossing the street with me i do thank you for bringing breakfast i need it and appreciate it now go away and let me see if theres any reason i should be fool enough to get into this at all im a stubborn woman garrett i usually get what i want if you wont help me youd better walk away from the whole thing people who get in my way get hurt unless youre out of here by the time i finish this cup of tea youre going over my knee and getting what your old man should have given you while you were still young enough to have some sense pounded into you she retreated to the stairway ill claim you raped me i grinned last refuge of the female scoundrel im not rich like you but i can afford a truthsayer go ahead lets see how your dad takes losing two kids in one week she started upstairs end of that game i went back and dug the dark package from the shadow between two floor joists anchored on the outside foundation it was not hidden every space along that wall was stuffed but the wrapping of this bundle was a cavalry saddle blanket dennys service meant a lot to him he kept every memento what he would wrap in his saddle blanket would be important too i dropped my seabag into the harbor as i strutted down the gangway the day i mustered out tells you how thrilled i was with the life of a royal marine the bundle contained a stack of military maps of the cantard most ours a few venageti both kinds are dangerous to have you could get arrested for spying the people who ask questions for the court dont stop till you confess with the maps were overlays of skin scraped transparently thin and several slim expensive bound journals i took the lot to dennys desk each of the overlays examined a critical battle of the past six years the names of captains commanders and outfits were noted one journal examined each battle commander by commander and unit by unit what the hell denny wasnt any war buff reading gave me a glimmer though for instance the table of royal officers count agar impulsive overly aggressive prone to act on inadequate intelligence margrave leon timid wants sure thing before offering battle easily rattled during engagement viscount noah vacillator excessively ferocious when engaged a spendthrift of men and material glory mooncalled best allaround commander under karentine colors excellent tactician able to train slowest and most uninspired men handicapped by low birth mercenary status and role in seigod mutiny while serving venageti side weakness is a consuming hatred of venageti warlords there was a venageti list too and an analysis of potential matches and mismatches if you were in the business of shuffling gold and silver it would be handy to know who would control the silver mines a few months down the road denny had been serious about trying to outguess fortune i smelted an old dead carp though denny drew fortyeight marks prize money and musteringout pay you dont turn fortyeight marks into a hundred thousand without cutting corners dennys business log contained some hints note from v an agent of stormlord atto inquired the cost of pd silver first tremor of preparation for new offensive z reported verbally harrow made port with pd silver in ballast must sell before mooncalled takes freemantle harrow southbound with pd granulated inside hollowed ballast billets biggest deal yet pray for fair weather letter from k warlord ironlock men firelords of the eastern circle third rite ordered to lare attack through the bled viscount blush defending buy coined silver v z and several others could be the cavalry cronies denny hung out with there were hints it was a tight group operation but k was no old army buddy i turned to the heir and lovers letters last about the time a cousin dropped in to ask what wanted for lunch whatever the rest of you are having with a quart of beer and tell old man tate i need him that was when i started the letters thats when the guy in the cheap seats decided i was going back to the cantard the rest of me fought the valiant fight for a long time you look like you saw a ghost tate said i looked up from the letter id been staring at for five minutes what oh yeah almost mr tate you told me it was honest money he did not say anything he had suspected it was something shady you had any unusual visitors sudden old friends of dennys asking questions no you will soon theres too much here for them to let it go be careful what do you mean it seemed an honest question so maybe he did not know the world well enough to read what denny had written i laid it out for him he did not believe me doesnt matter what either of us thinks the point is so far im interested enough to keep on ill need that thousand there are going to be heavy expenses from the start and a box i need a big box ill have lester bring the money from the office why do you want a box to pack all this stuff no say what youre not taking it out of here im taking it or im taking me away you want me to do a job you let me do it my way mr garrett pop youre paying for results not the right to mess with me get me a box then go pound nails in a shoe i dont have time for whining and games he hadnt recovered from what i had said about denny he did not have any fight left he took off the funny thing was he left me feeling guilty like i had been giving him a hard time just to puff up my own ego i didnt need that guilt so i ended up giving in and just letting everything go the way tate wanted strange how you can manipulate yourself when somebody outside cant i leaned back and watched dust fall from the underflooring as a pair of sneaky feet stole after tate i was still that way when the cousin brought lunch and beer i was busy inhaling that when uncle lester appeared with a fat moneybag and a big wicker chest i finished my beer in one long draft belched against the back of my wrist asked what do you think about all this uncle lester he shrugged aint my place to say hows that eh it began to sound like hogsatthetrough time all grunts and snorts did you read any of this stuff i asked yes care to comment looked like denny was dipping his toes in the shadows you could tell that better than me he was and he was an amateur a damned lucky amateur you ever have any hints that he was into anything nope unless you count that womans letters them writing back and forth like that all this time seemed a mite odd to me aint natural yes the boy was kin and hes dead and you dont want to speak ill of either one but he was a bit strange that boy always a loner fore he went off to the war id bet that woman is the only one he ever had if he had her he didnt look at one after he got back maybe he crossed lester snorted and gave me his best look of disgust like i didnt know about the tates and the elves back when though the cartha are the interspecies rage these days just asking i didnt think so he seemed to be a guy who just wasnt interested ive been in brag sessions when he was around he never had a story to tell lester smirked listened polite like way you might ifn i started telling stories about when i was a kid he had me it is not often garrett gets caught with nothing to say he grinned on that note ill be goin i grunted at his stern then i leaned back and closed my eyes and surrendered to the haunt that had me so distracted to the coincidence so long the devils themselves must have pulled it in kayean kronk maybe denny could spend all those years in love with a memory i gave it three hard ones before i broke the spell there was only one thing to do go see the dead man hes called the dead man because they killed him four hundred years ago but he is neither dead nor a man he is a loghyr and they dont die just because somebody sticks a bunch of knives into them their bodies go through the motions cooling out rigor mortis lividity but they do not corrupt not at any rate mere humans can detect loghyr bones have been found in the ruins on khatar island they are very similar to a humans when they are dry hey old bones dont look like the diet is working the dead man is four hundred fifty pounds of mean a little ragged around the edges where the moths and mice and ants have gotten to him he was parked in a chair in a dark room in a house that pretended to be both abandoned and haunted he smelled the corruption process is slow but it goes on you need a bath too a psychic chill set me shivering he was sleeping he isnt easy to get along with at his best and hes at his worst when newly awakened i am not sleeping i am meditating the thoughts hammered at my brain guess its all a matter of perspective the psychic chill became physical my breath clouded and my shoe buckles frosted over i hurried with a little propitiations that are necessary when dealing with the dead man the freshly cut flowers went into the big crystal bowl on the filthy old table before him then i lit candles his sense of humor insists there be thirteen of them all black burning while he is in consultation to my knowledge he is the only loghyr ever to allow his genius to be commercialized he does not need the candlelight to see visitors or flowers but he likes to pretend that he does aha i see you now garrett you pestilence cant you leave me alone every other day youre in here worse than the moths and mice its been five months chuckles and from the looks of this place youve been meditating the whole time a mouse that had been hiding beneath his oversized chair made a break for it the dead man snatched it with his mind and sent it flying out of the house moths exploded away from him he was incapable of doing malicious harm to bugs who wanted to eat him but could make life unholy hell for people with the effrontery to ask him to work you have to work sometime i told him even a dead man has to pay the rent and you need somebody to give you a bath and clean the place up not to mention getting the vermin out again a big shiny black spider crawled out of one piglike nostril on the end of his teninch trunk it did not like my looks it ducked back inside cheap flowers they were not i had given him absolutely no legitimate cause for complaint he couldnt banish me because he didnt want to work i knew the state of his finances his landlord had come to me about his last months rent must not be much of a client you have garrett you sneaking around after cheating wives again you know better i was out of all that thanks to him how much you owe me for a months rent already you have the smug content look of a man whose expenses have been guaranteed so how much can you soak your client before he squawks i dont know enough i think the way you look which is like a man who has a good fix on the pot at the end of the rainbow start reading what stop playing the idiot garrett youre too old you dragged that crate of stuff here so you could bore me that is the worst of being dead garrett it is damned boring you cannot do anything loghyr dont do anything when theyre alive read garrett your welcome is wearing thin i won sort of he listened while i gave him every word showed him every map a smooth professional report i stumbled only twice once over the name kayean once when he set a squeaking mouse whizzing playfully around my head it took a couple of hours and i got very dry but id prepared for that having been through it before as i downed a long draft of beer my head rang to very thorough as far as it goes what did you leave out nothing you got the whole show you are lying garrett and not very convincingly though perhaps you are lying more to yourself than to me you tripped on the womans name it has meaning to you well if you will lie to your best friend you will lie to yourself the dead man doesnt tell any tales it has meaning continue i knew a kayean kronk when i was in the cantard her father was one of the syndics of port fell i was nineteen when i met her she was seventeen i fell hard i thought she did too but the campaign in the islands came up and i only got to see her maybe two days a month because we spent most of our time at sea after about six months of that she started getting cool then i came in and there was a very kind letter asking me not to come see her she was in love the usual sort of thing i never saw her again i heard she was going with a cavalryman and her father disliked him even more than he had disliked me that was the last i heard of her till today i had a rocky few years after that it hit me pretty hard end of confession a long silence your friend never mentioned that womans name he never mentioned a woman an odd coincidence and a long one but not impossible it would be illuminating to know if he was aware of the identity of the womans previous lover how did you meet we met in a tavern where veterans hung out we had liked one another not one detail i could recall implied that he had knowledge of me through a third party i dont think he was the kind of guy who could stay around somebody who had been his lovers lover id bet his whole fortune that he didnt realize that i was the marine shed been seeing you may be betting it you realize that the amount of money involved is going to have a lot of people interested in this business thats why i came to you i need your advice my main advice you would ignore whats that leave it alone stick with the brewery work this could get you killed especially on the cantard end some very dangerous people have to be involved there if only peripherally how so who did the woman marry the dead man countered i dont know why do you think its important i will hazard to opine that it may become the crux of the affair why it is evident from the womans letters that she has access to information very restricted in nature and extremely dangerous to possess she passed along data not only on the present movements and future plans of your armies but on those of the venageti as well the implication is that she is in a unique position among you humans females are not permitted to assume the responsibilities of such a position as a career thus the further implication that she is mated to a man in such a position the dead mans mind speech has all the nuance of verbal communication once you learn to do without gestures and facial expressions he was crowing i could have figured that out soon enough about the time someone cut your throat you count upon your ability to bluff or battle your way through obstacles rather than thinking your way around them it is a failing common to your race all of you seem to believe that exercising your minds is shameful or painful and prefer instead to snatch up a sword at the first hint of he was off on his favorite crusade soon he would begin the paeans to the infinite superiority of loghyr reasoning and logic and wisdom i shut him out that can be done if he is distracted by musing upon his own magnificence if youre subtle and dont draw attention to what youre doing i hid behind my beer and counted silently having heard it all before i knew how long he needed to get it out of his system garrett so i miscalculated by a few seconds he probably cheated he knew me pretty well too but he was abnormally mellow he employed none of his usual childish devices maybe i had given him enough to crack the boredom of being dead yes pay attention i asked if you are determined to go ahead with this im not sure your body calls your mouth a liar i have this advice for you inasmuch as you mean to go ahead despite all reason do not go this one alone and do not permit emotion to get in the way of your usually strong instinct for your own best interest whatever else this woman may be or may have been she is not the girl you loved when she was seventeen no more are you that callow marine of nineteen if ever for a minute you allow yourself to believe that those days can be restored you are lost they are dead take it from an expert on being dead there is no way to get your health back you live on memories of what was and fancies about what might have been both can be deadly to the man who loses sight of the demarcation between them and reality end of speech end of speech were you listening i was listening did you hear me i heard it is well you are a pestilence upon my waning centuries garrett but you keep me amused i do not want to lose you yet be careful in the cantard you will not have me there to lift you out of the consequences of your folly it grates but i fear i would miss you insolence disobedience and all which was about the nicest thing he ever said to me i had to get out before we started getting maudlin i made a beer run before going back to give him his bath and his place a bit of cleanup it was past suppertime when i left the dead mans place the shadows were long and indigo the sky was turning colors you usually see only in elvish portraiture it had been a long day and there was a lot of it yet to go the first order of business would be to see the dead mans landlord and get him a few months ahead on his rent ill buy the place for him if i ever make the big strike though he could do that for himself if he wanted it would however take several months of concentrated work for him to earn enough money the very thought sends him into psychic spasms next step would be to look up morley dotes which id had in mind even before the dead man admonished me against following my usual lonewolf course he was right the cantard is no place to go alone a massive hand hurtled out of an alley mouth snagged my arm and yanked sometimes the city isnt so safe either i slammed into a wall and slid away from a fist i sensed more than i saw i threw a feeble right that was just a distractor while i unloaded a girlish shin kick the mountain of muscle and gristle before me waltzed back far enough for me to take in its true dimensions they were awesome saucerhead tharpe hey garrett man if id knowed it was you id never have taken this job shucks i bet you say that to all the boys aw dont be that way garrett we all got to make it the best way we know how i caught a glimpse of a familiar short person watching from across the street i dragged out a fat purse containing part of the largesse her uncle had bestowed upon me earlier hey come on garrett you know you cant bribe me to lay off im really sorry thiss got to be you and me but i got paid for the job where would i be if it got around that i could be bought off id be out of work im very very sorry garrett but i got to do what i got paid to do i had expected no luck but it had seemed worth a try i said id be the last guy to ask you to welsh on a deal saucerhead gee im glad i was scared you wouldnt understand i want you to do a job for me saucerhead theres five marks in it yeah id feel a whole lot better about this if i could do something for you what is it that woman across the street the one that sicced you onto me when were done here i want you to take her down to the bazaar strip her down naked bend her over your lap and give her thirty good whacks on the backside then turn her loose and let her walk home naked naked she wouldnt get out of the bazaar garrett theres another five in it if she gets home all right but without finding out youre looking out for her saucerhead grinned its a deal garrett he stuck out a palm the size of a snowshoe i dropped five marks into it saucerheads hand dipped into a pocket i hit him up side the head with the purse i put everything i had behind it then i ran like hell for two steps he gave rose her moneys worth fulfilling his contract to the letter i tried to defend myself of course and actually did pretty well not many hang in there a whole minute against saucerhead tharpe i even gave him one he might have remembered for the next ten minutes always thoughtful is saucerhead tharpe after he put my lights out he tucked my purse underneath me just in case somebody came along before i woke up then he went along to the next job on his agenda i hurt everywhere i had about two acres of bruises saucerhead had found places to hit that i didnt know i had all body and soul wanted was to go lay up for a week but mind knew it was time to find morley dotes not even saucerhead tharpe would have messed with me if id had morley dotes along morley is the best at rough and tumble and by his own admission the best at most everything else some people would like him and saucerhead to square off just to see how it would come out but neither of them will swat a fly without getting paid first and saucerhead isnt dumb enough to take a job on morley nor is morley vain enough to contract on saucerhead neither cares much about who might come out best which says something about their professionalism the obvious place to look for morley was a place called morleys joy house the name is one of his bad jokes it is a hangout for the elfin the cartha and breeds the fare is vegetarian and nonalcoholic the entertainment is so impenetrable and dull that the existence of a dead loghyr might be exciting by contrast but morleys kind of people enjoy it the place went silent when i stepped inside i ignored an arsenals worth of deathlooks as i limped to the alleged bar morleys barman gave me the onceover he grinned revealing pointy darkelf teeth you have a knack for making people mad at you garrett you ought to see the other guy i did he came in for some sprouts wasnt a scratch on him conversations picked up behind me the barman was being as friendly as darkelves ever are that made me a marginally acceptable lower lifeform presence tolerated like that of a beerdrinking dog in a human tavern words around already huh everybody who ever cared about you one way or the other already knows the whole story slick the way you evened things up yeah thats out too howd it go she made it home i figure thats one quail that wont ever mess with you again garrett he cackled in that way they have that gives you chills and makes you wonder if you will ever wake up from the nightmare next time shell get somebody to cut your throat the possibility had occurred to me id made a mental note to rummage up some of my more interesting gimmicks and armaments in the general course of business i find being fast on my feet protection enough so i load myself down with hardware only in special cases this case looked like it was getting pretty special the dead man had warned me wheres morley up he pointed hes busy i headed for the stairs the barkeep opened his mouth to yell at me then thought about it that might start a riot in his friendly voice he said hey garrett you owe us five marks i turned around and gave him the fisheye saucerhead said youd knock it off his tab a grin like that ought to be bronzed and saved for posterity it got bigger that big goof isnt as dumb as he looks is he i dug down carefully my back to the crowd no point in showing what i was carrying and having the boys who were high on lettuce getting fancy ideas nope i flipped the five coins and headed upstairs before he could get back to trying to stop me i hammered on morleys private door no response i pounded again rattling hinges go away garrett im busy i shoved through the door which was not locked somebodys wife squealed and dove into another room a fistful of clothing trailing otherwise i caught nothing but a flash of fancy tail it was not one i recognized morley did his best to look elfhaughty in nothing but his socks and a snarl he could not bring it off despite being half darkelf your timing is lousy as usual garrett not to mention your manners how did you know it was me magic magic my ruddy red you have trouble making food disappear if you call that silage you eat food ahah watch your mouth you owe me one apology already i dont apologize my mother makes excuses for me how did you know it was me voice tube from the bar you look awful boy saucerhead must have sold that gal his top of the line what did you do to her wouldnt lie cheat and steal for her and turned her down when she tried to bribe me with the big bribe he laughed you never learn next time diddle the gal and walk shell sit around wondering what went wrong instead of sending cutthroats after you his grin vanished what do you want garrett ive got a job offer for you not something foolish involving saucerhead tharpe i hope no ive got a job i need some backup on i can thank saucerhead for reminding me that if i dont get it soon my health might suffer whats in it for me ten percent of a hundred thousand marks plus expenses youre expenses he whistled soundlessly his pucker bringing his dark hatchet features to even more of a point what do we have to do take out one of the venageti warlords youre closer than you think i have to go into the cantard and find a woman who just inherited on the up side of a hundred thou i have to talk her into either coming here to claim it or waiving her claim in favor of whoever is next in line that doesnt sound so tough except for the part about the cantard there are some people around who might feel that the money was not the deceaseds to bequeath there are some in the deceaseds family who feel a strong reluctance to let so large a fortune go to a stranger there is the possibility of similar difficulties on the legatees end its possible her relationship with the legatee was shall we say imprudent i love it when you talk dirty garrett and i love what money does to you humans its the only thing that saves you from being totally tedious i did not have anything to say to that people do get silly about money i take it your principal has his own ax to grind in this or hed be with the keepitinthefamily faction could be is he as nebulous as you are could be you interested could be i winced he grinned suppose i just follow you around for a while youre a chatty sort of fellow ill let you know when youve said enough to let me make up my mind oh happy day the pleasure of his company without having to pay for it all right who said anything about not paying for it i did no play no pay you got an attitude problem garrett all right what are you going to do now go wrap myself around a couple of pounds of steak he turned up his nose all that red meat is why you people have such a peculiar odor where should i meet you i raised an eyebrow matter of some unfinished business he said evenly i glanced at the door to the other room i see ill be back morley had pecked around the edges till id about lost the restored good humor brought on by beer and a fully belly you have a basic character flaw garrett i think its a selfimage problem ninetynine people out of a hundred will say any damned fool thing that pops into their heads and not worry about how other folks will see it with you every damned word is a contract with the gods i scowled up the street there were lights inside my place you can talk without feeling youve committed something garrett hell you should do like me believe every word you say like it was godsmouth when you say it then forget it in the morning the appearance of sincerity counts for more than actual truthfulness people only need to believe for a few minutes at a time they know the name of the game you take that lady i was with tonight am i in love with her is she in love with me not bloody likely she wouldnt be seen in public with me but i still had to say all the words i dont know how he got onto that he rambles i ignored it mostly you on the payroll or not he looked at my place company looks like could it be friendly my friends have better manners i thought youd admit you dont have any friends are you going in yes you behind me or not temporarily anyway my cash position isnt what it should be ive suffered several financial setbacks lately dguni races again you want to get rich quick garrett come down to the pond and see how i lay my bets then bet the other way no matter what bug i pick it zips out to the middle then skitters in circles while the plodders head straight for the other bank either that or it gets eaten the race is not always to the swift only elves would bet on the nearrandom results of waterspider races ready go ahead the door was unlocked how thoughtful there were four of them two sat on my bed the other two occupied my only two chairs i recognized three as cavalry veterans from dennys crowd the one called vasco might be the v of dennys notes they were trying to look tough i guess they were tough inside their heads they had survived the cantard but they did not have the tough look that comes from growing up on the streets come on in guys i said make yourselves at home fix yourselves a drink my place is your place vasco said see if hes armed quinn hes armed morley said behind me take my word for it one of my guests chuckled look vee a darko breed in mans clothing amateurs morley said amateurs i agreed but the pros all start out as amateurs some have to learn their business the hard way what he meant was anybody on the shady side of the law who knew what they were doing should know who he was vasco made a gesture that restrained the character with the intemperate mouth he said i figure you have some idea why were here garrett but therere a couple points i want to make sure you understand amateurs i said again pros know when to take their losses that money didnt belong to denny garrett not more than a third of it anyway pros dont put all their eggs in one basket and they dont put the basket where they cant get at it if i was you boys id find a new line of business without dennys contacts your old one is going to turn into a crapshoot vasco winced i knew too much weve got that angle covered garrett all we need to do is get hold of dennys papers and study up on his style there werent any secret codes or anything the other end doesnt have to know that hes gone might be workable at that maybe they were not so dumb after all those records and notes and letters might be a silver mine what did you do with them garrett so we get to the crux eh yes ill lay it out we can take the loss on the silver if we get the papers and you stay away from the cantard end we aint going to like it but we can take it my recommendation to you is pocket your retainer and walk next best thing if you think you have to make a show is leave town for a while then come back and say you couldnt find her or fake up a waiver and forge her chop sounds good i said a practical solution to all our problems they looked relieved trouble is when i got out of the marines i decided i wasnt going to let anybody else run my life ever again you guys were in the army you know how it is it stunned them momentarily then vasco said you look like youve had a bad day already garrett i wouldnt want to give a man bruises on his bruises maybe you could reassess your position you had your say i made my position clear youd better be leaving im not usually this tolerant of uninvited guests vasco sighed my old drill sergeant used to sigh that way when a recruit was particularly stubborn about learning quinn watch the breed i set myself id picked my first move already stand aside garrett that same sound of exasperation filled morleys voice its time for a little of that old elfin magic vee take him quinn when morley goes into action he seems to grow about six extra limbs he uses them all so fast you hardly see them move and when he isnt kicking or punching hes biting headbutting hipjugging or kneedropping he opened by leaping up and giving quinn the heels of both feet bap bap right between the eyes he flew to another victim without touching down quinn folded his cards and went to dreamland vasco came after me i learned that you do not duke it out with a guy almost as good as you are when your whole body is stiff and sore from the last whipping you took he got me into a clinch that turned into a giant bear hug on the floor he kept trying to bang his forehead off my temple i got my teeth into his ear and chomped that discouraged him he threw himself away from me from flat on my back i flicked out a heel and clipped him at the base of the skull he went wobbly i jumped up seized the moment by the scruff of the neck and seat of the pants and ran him out the door to the accompaniment of appropriate oldtime remarks about seedy little army types who failed to acknowledge the natural superiority of their overlords the marines a great glassy crash sent me hurtling back inside to help morley he had polished off his share he was eyeballing quinn grab the other end and help me throw him out you broke my window im charging you double rate for this one garrett you provoked them im not paying you squat you threw somebody out my window you never heard a word i said about truth and sincerity you had a perfect chance to close it all down when vee suggested you take the retainer and run but no bad garrett has got morley dotes behind him he can run his mouth like a fool and provoke them all to hell i would have said the same thing if you werent here he cocked his head and looked at me like a bird looking at a new kind of bug death wish suicidal tendencies know what causes that garrett diet thats right your meatheavy human diet you need more roughage you dont get enough roughage your bowels tighten up when your bowels tighten up you get these dangerous selfdestructive mood swings somebody is going to get his bowels loosened up you had to go and throw somebody through my window didnt you will you quit with the damned window you know how much that window cost you got any idea not a candle to what this job is going to cost you if you dont stop complaining all right next time ill ask them pretty please to go out the door like nice little boys come on lets run it off run run where why to work off this nervous energy to get rid of the combat juices flowing inside us five miles ought to do it ill tell you how far im running im running all the way over there to my bed then im not moving except to breathe youre kidding the shape youre in if you dont stretch those muscles then cool them out right youre going to wake up so stiff you wont be able to move tell you what you run my five miles for me ill consider forgiving you for the window i crashed onto the bed i could use about a gallon of icecold beer morley didnt answer me he was gone bam bam bam morning is wonderful its only drawback is that it comes at such an inconvenient time of day a time when the early birds of the world are aflame with their mission of bringing the joys of dawnwatching to the nations and to me in particular bam bam bam two mornings running i wondered if i had offered unwitting insult to the seven grand devils of modrel i went through all the usual cursing and threatening none of it helped morley would crow when he saw me i was as stiff as he wanted it took me three minutes to put my feet over the side and sit up the first thing i saw was a mottled green face half a yard wide staring through the broken window i said something intelligent like gleep the face grinned it was a groll a hybrid of human troll and the beast that talks that is never named in polite company i grinned back grolls are slow of wit and often quick of temper its giant toad mouth opened and spilled some of that hairraising bass which is their excuse for speech i did not catch what it said it was not meant for me anyway the banging on the door stopped hello yourself i croaked and dragged myself up onto my feet i figured id better open up before his patience went and he let himself in through the wall there was another one outside the door it looked exactly like the other one big wide and ugly i guessed it would stand twenty feet high in its socks if it ever wore socks it didnt wear much else except a loincloth a utility belt and an empty pack harness the loincloth did not do much to preserve modesty so from here on i have to call them both he with a capital h mules would go gibbous with envy both grolls noted my amazement and grinned thats the sense of humor such creatures have id invite you in if youd fit i said one is polite to grolls at all times irrespective of ones prejudices otherwise one finds oneself reassessing ones attitude while being squished between warty green toes a short one stepped around the big one i expect ill fit he said and i could use a drink actually who the hell are you dojango is the name actually these are my brothers marsha and doris brothers were triplets actually he responded to my unspoken question but with different mothers actually triplets with different mothers right i didnt ask making sense out of the things human folks tell me is brain strain enough what the hell are you doing here morley dotes sent us actually what the hell for actually one of the big grolls growled at me i used my fingers to sculpt a friendly smile to help in the cantard the villain himself morley dotes had sneaked on stage so you decided you want the job eh at the moment there are certain advantages where my creditors are concerned to my being both employed and being out of town morley replied and you thought youd gather all your friends under the umbrella of that advantage like maybe my principal wouldnt think of putting a bottom in my expense pot if you would use half that vaunted detective brain of yours you would bless my vision its too early in the morning for me to remember my name enlighten me o illustrious one consider mules mules what the hell do mules have to do with it were going into the cantard no one will risk loaning or renting us mounts or pack animals well have to buy on the other hand wages for doris and marsha will run about what it would cost for a brace of good mules and they can carry twice the load twice as long and theyre a hell of a lot more use in a fight that made sense good sense but what about friend dojango morley sighed yes dojango roze well garrett they wont break up the set i do believe i scowled you sticking me with deadwood dojango can lift a blade he can sniff out water and find firewood he can understand doris and marsha if you keep an eye on him he can cook an edible meal without burning anything too badly im trying not to slobber in anticipation i scanned the triplets who had different mothers they grinned groll good fellowship they figured morley had sold me dotes said keep dojango away from the juice and hell do all right everyone knows breeds cannot handle their booze dojangos grin became apologetic how much is this road show going to burn me morley tossed out an outrageous figure i slammed the door and went back to bed he had one of the big triplets lift him so he could yell numbers through the broken window i faked a mean snore till some interesting integers began rattling around behind me in fact morley was so pliable i began wondering how bad his creditor situation was i did not need more complications than i already had its your diet that makes you so stubborn you know that dont you garrett all that red meat filled with the juices stirred by the terror of the murdered beast and you never exercising so you sweat them out of your own body i figured it was something like that morley that too much beer and not enough green leafy veggies cattails garrett the white hearts down near the roots of the young plant diced into a tossed salad not only tasty but informed with an almost mystical capacity for lightening the burden of guilt lying upon the carnivores soul horsepucky when i was in the marines we raided an island where the venageti promptly cut us off from our ships and drove us into a swamp cattails were a mainstay of our diet till the fortunes of war shifted i dont recall them doing anything remarkable for the temperaments of our sergeants and corporals who seemed carnivorous enough to eat their own young rather the opposite in a geometric progression i know we all took it out on the venageti when the time came maybe i did not start eating cattails young enough morley i did a job for a professor at the university one time he was always spouting whocares facts like one time when he said there are two hundred fortyeight different kinds of fruits vegetables greens and tubers that people eat hogs will only eat two hundred fortysix of those they wont touch green peppers and they wont touch cattail hearts which goes to show you that hogs have more sense than people no point trying to salvage you is there youre determined to suicide the slow way are the boys hired theyre hired i hoped i would not be sorry how soon can we leave you in a hurry morley you need to get out of town fast that why youre being so agreeable about going into the cantard dotes shrugged a shrug was answer enough considering morleys talents and reputation it would take somebody heavy to have enough clout to scare him in my mind somebodies that heavy narrowed down to a crowd of one the big guy himself the kingpin since when is kolchak into bug racing morley he popped down out of the window his voice lingered behind him youre too damned smart for your own good garrett its going to catch up with you someday ill be in touch come on you lummoxes dojango put that back doris he sounded like a muleteer trying to get a wagon started i went back to bed thinking id better use some of tates money to get a new window put in maybe a flashy piece with my name leaded in colors this old universe hasnt got one notion of the meaning of the word mercy where im concerned i just got to snoozing when the door began shivering like a drumhead again going to have to do something about this i muttered as i hit the floor like maybe move and not tell anybody i opened up and found uncle lester and the boys outside you guys decide to forget the whole thing i hope i noticed that two of the kids had gotten into something rough they showed plenty of bruises and bandages and one had an arm in a sling what happened unfriendly visitors willard wants to talk to you about it all right im on my way i took just long enough to make myself presentable gulp some water and pick up the leadweighted headthumper willard tate was in a state he waited wringing his hands all my life i have heard that expression except for a maiden aunt whose every breath was an act of high drama id never seen it before what happened uncle lester was a clam maybe he was afraid if i knew too much id turn around tate pumped my hand with both of his thank you for coming thank you i didnt know what else to do what happened i asked again as he clung to my hand with one of his and dragged me like a stubborn child uncle lester and the boys tagged along i spotted a palefaced rose watching as we crossed the garden headed for dennys apartment tate did not tell me he showed me the place was a wreck the apprentices were still cleaning up several of them wore bandages and bruises some wise soul had barred entry from the street by nailing boards across the doorframe tate pointed the body lay in the middle of the room belly down one hand stretched toward the door what happened i asked again third time was a charm it happened around midnight i had the boys in watching just in case because you made me nervous the way you talked five men broke through the street door the boys were smart odie came and woke everybody up the others hid and let the burglars go downstairs so we ambushed them when they tried to leave we just wanted to capture them but they panicked and started a fight and they werent shy about trying to hurt us and now were stuck with that i knelt to look at the dead mans face he had started to puff up already but i could still see the cuts and scrapes he had picked up flying through the window at my place did they get away with anything i did a count uncle lester said the gold and silver is all there they werent after gold or silver huh all the tates are brilliant but they hide their light under a bushel maybe its a business reflex they were looking for dennys papers his letters to the woman i took care of hiding most everything but there could have been something i overlooked those papers might be worth more than any amount of metal they could haul out of here old man tate looked dumbfounded so i told him about my little chat with dennys partners he did not want to believe me but thats trading with the enemy when you take the costume off it and look it straight in the face i know my son mr garrett denny wouldnt betray karenta did you hear me say anything about treason i thought it though mainly in the context of what happened to folks foolish enough to get caught trading with the venageti i have no moral reservations about that the war is a struggle between two gangs of nobles and wizards trying to grab control of mines likely to give their possessors near mastery of the world their motives are no higher than those displayed in squabbles between street gangs right here in tunfaire being karentine i would prefer the gang running my country to win i love being with a winner everybody does but it doesnt hurt my feelings if somebody besides the lords makes a little profit from the squabble i explained that to tate the problem is the connection is still alive i said and some pretty tough boys want to keep it that way meaning they dont want you and me meddling do you follow me and they want dennys papers and letters and whatnots so they can keep contact with the woman you catch on fast pop theyll let their claim to the metals go for the papers and denny will live on forever in letters he never wrote he thought about it there was a part of him that wanted to grab the big score while it was there for the grabbing but there was a part of him that was crazy stubborn too maybe if he had been a little poorer but somewhere along the way he had made up his mind and set it in concrete changed circumstances would not budge him i will meet this woman mr garrett its your neck i said and tried to time a meaningful pause and your familys that could be one of the boys on the floor attracting flies i got to him that time he puffed up his face got red his eyes bugged out which is a sight in the half elfin his mouth opened he began to shake but he did not let it get hold of him somehow he turned it off after half a minute he said youre right mr garrett and its a risk due more consideration than i have given it if as you say those men were army friends of dennys who survived the cantard its damned lucky several of the boys werent killed instead of that poor fellow like you said they panicked they just wanted to get away but next time theyll be looking for trouble youre sure therell be a next time coming so close to getting caught already you dont seem to understand the stakes mr tate in eight years denny and those guys built a handful of prize money into a hundred thousand marks plus whatever fun they took along the way but i did not mention that the old boy did not need all his illusions stripped think what they could have done with another eight years and that kind of capital gotten into a crunch probably too much wealth draws attention though i suppose denny knew that and planned accordingly perhaps i do not mr garrett im only a shoemaker my interest is fathers and sons and a family tradition that goes back more generations than can be counted a tradition that died with denny he was an exasperating old coot i think he understood plenty he just didnt give a damn anymore youre certain they will return then breathing fire pop then it behooves me to take steps the step you ought to take is to come to an accommodation not with those swine they and that woman seduced my son away i shut him out and gave my whole attention to the basement as far as i could tell nothing had changed it seemed likely then that they had found nothing i might have missed huh im sorry i missed that he gave me a look that said he knew why but you could not get him to talk nasty at spears point i asked if you knew someone i could retain as a guard for the premises no i did know someone me but i was up to my nostrils with long cold lonely nights waiting for something that never happened or that was really lethal when it did wait a thought maybe i do the people who are supposed to make the trip to the cantard with me i could do us both a favor by parking them here morley too if it put him out of the heat tate looked startled youre going to go you sounded so dead set against it im still against it i think its about as smart as raiding a rocs nest i dont even see any point to it but i told you id look into it i havent really made up my mind yet either way he smiled he grinned i was afraid he would try to slap me on the back and maybe loosen one of my kidneys but he restrained himself a very restrained kind of guy old man tate he got very serious what can you do about that mans body mr garrett i figured we were going to get to that nothing what nothing hes not my problem the old boy gulped air then the sly merchant came tippytoeing forward you want to hold me up for a bonus all right how much dont bother you dont have enough im not putting a finger on that stiff its not my responsibility and i dont do that kind of work my advice is call the magistrates and let them handle it youll be clear he was killed during a breakin no i dont want anyone nosing into family business then have your boys take him and dump him in the river or an alley somewhere down the hill there are bodies in the river most mornings in the alleys too unless they were someone important they caused little comment tate saw that he could not reach me through my lust for wealth he gave that up you go ahead here then send those men here as soon as you can i have work to do keep me posted he ducked out i poked around and wondered if the evil gleam in tates eye meant he thought he could put the corpse off on morley and the triplets the flooring did its dust drop i had noticed it several times before tate left i figured my sweetheart rose was eavesdropping again i ignored her look as i might i could not find anything missing i settled back to give the whole business a think it was obese with potential trouble and i was getting near the point where i had to make a real decision the local end of it would take care of itself there was nothing to investigate at this end at the other end i did not want to think about that end yet it would be unpleasant no matter how smooth it went it would be unpleasant just traveling to and revisiting the cantard a door opened and shut overhead a moment later women began talking the one with the quarrelsome voice had to be rose i wondered who the other one was a delightful aroma preceded her down the basement stairs she proved to be a fiery little redhead with long straight hair jadegreen eyes a few freckles and high firm breasts that thrust boldly against a ruffled silk blouse there was nothing between that blouse and her but my daydreams where have they been hiding you i asked jumping up to take the tray she carried who are you im tinnie and youre garrett and the last time you saw me i was just a spindlelegged kid she looked me right in the eye and grinned her teeth looked sharp and white i wanted to stick out a hand and let her take a bite could still be on spindles for all a guy can tell from that skirt it fell to her ankles her grin got sassy you could get lucky and get a look sometime you never know my kind of luck came down the stairs right then tinnie youve done your job get out we ignored rose i asked youre not dennys sister are you he never mentioned you cousin they dont talk about me im the one who causes trouble oh i thought rose took care of that rose is just obnoxious that doesnt bother them i do things that embarrass them rose just makes people mad or disgusted i make the neighbors whisper behind their hands rose simmered and reddened tinnie winked at me see you later garrett yeah i wish that little bit was enough woman to make a man sit up and howl at the moon she had a sway as she sashayed past rose and started up the stairs when you got down to it and ignored the personality of a black widow spider rose was not something the dogs barked at either she was another small package with its contents all in the right places and only prime materials had been used rose could move with a sway that promised fireworks if she wanted but her fireworks were the kind that blow up in a mans face we eyed each other like a couple of tomcats about to square off we both decided what she had in mind wouldnt work any better this time she got flustered because she didnt know what else to do ought to have a backup plan when you jump in on something i told her like saucerhead tharpe youre right garrett damn you anyhow how did you get so old being as stubborn as you are by guessing right most of the time you wouldnt be a bad kid if there was room for anyone else in your world for a few seconds there i got the feeling she wished there was someone else in her world then she said too bad we couldnt have met under other circumstances yeah i said not feeling it she would be trouble no matter what the circumstances that was how she was made we dont have any common ground at all do we not very much not unless you had some feeling for your brother i was fond of denny how about you i had touched something at last it isnt fair him dying like that he was about the nicest guy i ever knew even if he was my brother that cantard bitch easy i snapped it which gave me away enough to make her gawk and wonder whats in this for you garrett besides a chance to line your pockets nobody goes to the cantard without more reason than money i thought about morley dotes when she said that i thought about me i wondered about me garrett tough guy cant reach him no emotional handles but i was on the brink of doing something no moron in his right mind would do like old man tate i wanted to see this woman who could put a halter on denny rose and i traded stares she decided i wasnt going to give her a thing be careful garrett dont get yourself hurt look me up when this is over it wouldnt work rose it could be fun giving it a look she sashayed up the stairs she did look good from that perspective maybe seconds after the door slammed while common sense was fighting for its life a copperwreathed face peeped at me from the head of the stairs dont even think about it garrett i wouldnt love you anymore then tinnie vanished too i gulped some air and said duh a few times then got my dogs under me and went galumphing off on the trail she was gone when i got upstairs i was alone with the dead guy dennys friend there was no sign of rose or tinnie when i looked into the garden i closed the door and took a quick look through the dead guys pockets some vulture had beat me to it there wasnt a thing left old man tate got the body out somehow dropped it in the river i guess i didnt ask and didnt hear a thing about it a lot of people never heard from again take that one last swim i got morley and the triplets installed at dennys place morley thought it was a great idea that being the case i spent the evening hanging around his place nicked by dagger looks from the breeds hoping i would catch a flash to illuminate his eagerness to join a fools quest i didnt catch anything brighter than candlelight all i found out was that i wasnt the only guy watching you get a sixth sense after enough years mine pegged two heavyweights in the first fifteen minutes one was human and looked like he could give saucerhead a fight the other was so ugly and stayed in his shadowed corner so deep that i couldnt tell what he was a breed for sure probably with some troll and kobold in him but more than that he was as wide as he was tall his face had been rearranged several times probably for the better the bartender knew i had something going with morley he stayed civil i asked about the men i had picked out dont know them the ugly one was in here last night first time sat in that corner all night nursing a beer he brought with him i wouldve thrown him out if he hadnt bought a meal that wouldve been a show to see i took a pint of the water that passed for beer there and tipped him to take the sting out of the crack think theyre the kingpins boys not unless theyre from out of town that was what i thought i didnt recognize them either but they looked like trouble on the hoof well no skin off my nose as long as they were not interested in me i gave it up at morleys place after the pint there were better places to put an ear to the ground i went and hung out in some of them i didnt find out a thing curious i headed for my place wondering if the glazier had gotten started yet i felt no shame at all charging the replacement window to tate the new window was in place and lettered as pretty as a blonde in her birthday suit but i strolled by without admiring it putting a slouch in my shoulders and a shuffle in my walk maybe i wouldnt go home after all there were problems one was that somebody was waiting in the breezeway beside the ratmans even without seeing the glow of his pipe i could smell the weed he was smoking the other was that there was somebody waiting inside whoever that was had all the lamps burning using up oil at a rate to curdle my liver i knew a heavy weed smoker another friend of dennys another old soldier name of barbera who smoked so much that most of the time he didnt know if he was in this world or the next a pathetic case he was always in trouble because folks could talk him into anything he had been one of dennys charities no doubt dennys other pals thought it would be a giggle to hop him up and sic him on me i faded into a shadow down the block and took a seat against a wall that needed tuckpointing the view of my place was as scenic as a garbage dump a lot of nothing happened for a long time unless you count the flares as my lurker lighted up or the passing of drunks so far gone they were unafraid of the nighted streets only after we started getting some aromatic moonlight did anything interesting happen and that was just a couple guys checking in with the weed man they passed me by without seeing me but i got a look at them vasco and quinn my old pals so they meant to do me dirty eh i didnt move though i thought about knocking some heads i was beginning to wonder about that lamplight vasco and quinn had made no effort to talk to whomever was inside so maybe that whomever wasnt one of them who then my friend the ratman came home from his shift at the graveyard drunk as usual in my less charitable moments ive wished he would get lost in one of the graves he digs he shuffled up to my new window glanced inside whatever he saw it was interesting he watched for a minute when he moved on he cast furtive looks around he didnt see anyone watching that must have given him courage he slipped over and tried the door it opened barbera came blazing out of the shadows he climbed all over the ratman when he had him pounded down to about three feet high he took off headed my way a little message for me from dennys pals misdelivered i reckoned they needed an answer i stepped out of the shadows as barbera lumbered past he caught me from the corner of his eye i said hi there and smacked his ear with my sap as his eyes grew big and he tried to turn he did not go down but his knees got wobbly and his eyes glazed i kicked him low punched him high with my left bounced the sap off his forehead he wobbled a little more they need a lot of pounding when theyre hopped i gave him all he needed and then some and when he no longer knew what planet he was on i snagged the seat of his pants and walked him into an alley where i gave him a few more taps with my sap then i took his pouch of weed a while later i paid a halfdwarf halfgoblin wino to deliver it to vasco with the word that he had not gotten his moneys worth that taken care of it was time to see about my intruder i didnt do any seeing when i got back to where i could see my place a troop of tates were going inside stepping over the groaning ratman like he was something that fell behind the horse in a moment they marched back out with an angry tinnie so there you go exactly my kind of luck if i found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow id break my leg running toward it and have to lie there watching some other clown walk away with it while i did my groaning i let the street clear then i went and got a bucket of beer and locked myself inside nobody disturbed me id planned to surprise everybody by showing up at the tate place at the crack of dawn ready to travel but i had a dream about loghyr bones maybe it was the beer that beer was green but i knew better than to ignore it it could be a summons from the dead man the worst thing about going out in the morning is that the sun is there it slaps you right in the eyes when you go back inside you cant see squat squat was what i saw when i went into the dead mans place it was as dark as a crypt in there about time garrett did you come via khaphé that wasnt a dream eh no what do you want i do not have the resources to follow all your adventures from afar if you want my help and advice you have to report to me occasionally i figured that was as near as he would get to saying he owed me i would take what i was given what do you need details of what you have seen and learned since your last visit so i gave it to him without leaving anything out he pondered awhile buy yourself some poison rings garrett carry a boot knife that was not the advice i expected why are you known for such things no do the unexpected i hiked all the way over here for that it is the best i can do given the information you make available make it my fault just like him i did him a few odd jobs cleaned the place up some and burned some sulfur candles to make the vermins lungs more robust i wondered what morley thought about breathing air its kind of hard to inhale green leafy vegetables then i took the dead mans advice i stocked up on lethal hardware i even picked up a few sneakypetes i recalled from my marine days let them come after me now i thought im ready for anything horses they are one of the little unpleasantnesses to be endured during any lengthy journey unless you want to walk morley dotes had high praise for that sort of exercise which meant it hurt personally i have very little interest in voluntarily inflicting pain or discomfort upon myself i went to an outfitter i knew a black giant they called playmate he was human but must have had a little mixed blood somewhere he stood nine feet tall the colorimpregnated clan scars on his cheeks gave him a ferocious look but he was a sweetheart as gentle as a human being could be those gruesome features brightened when he spotted me crossing the yard of his place he came at me with arms spread wide grinning like i was going to rig out a battalion i ducked his hug he could crush you in his enthusiasm had he possessed the killer instinct he would have made one hell of a professional wrestler i had done him some good on a skip trace awhile back my getting the guy to pay up saved playmate from bankruptcy so he owed some good fortune to me but this greeting was not that much more warm than what he gave strangers who wandered in off the street what can we do for you garrett name it and its yours on me long as you need it i need a couple of horses and camping gear for five for three or four months you got it going out to try your hand at trapping business that bad i have a job its taking me out of town three four months is a far piece out and back where you going he was headed for his stable where a whole clan of fourlegged assassins awaited my advent with malice bubbling in their blood the cantard horses and i do not get along i can ride but just barely when i have to im a city boy and never saw much need to hang around with beasts that have it in for me playmate slowed down he gave me one of those looks you save for your crazy cousin when he says something totally stupid the cantard garrett youre a great man and i have complete faith in you if any civilian could get into and out of the cantard alive it would be you but im not so confident of my animals i dont want you to give me anything playmate ill buy what i need no risk to you dont give me that tone of voice garrett what tone i didnt intend the guy any grief we entered the digs of their satanic majesties the horses twenty pairs of big brown evil eyes turned my way i could almost hear them sizing me up in their secret language plotting misery this is thunderbolt playmate said indicating a big black stallion with wicked teeth a spirited animal partly battletrained no playmate shrugged moved on to a roan how about hurricane here fast and smart and a little unpredictable like you you should get along great complementary personalities no and no storm no fury no nothing with a firebreathing name to live up to i want an old mare on her last legs with a name like daffodil and a temperament to match thats disgusting garrett are you a man or a mouse squeak me and horses dont get along the last time i rode one he tricked me by turning around while i was getting on then he stood there laughing at me behind my back horses dont laugh garrett theyre very serious creatures you hang around me youll see them laugh if you have a problem with animals why make the trip overland catch a river barge down to leifmold then take a coaster south it would save you six hundred hard miles why not it never occurred to me thats why not sometimes you stumble into a rut so deep you cant see over the edges i didnt want to go to the cantard really so id developed the habit of thinking about getting in and out fast the quickest way from one place to another is usually the shortest the shortest haul from tunfaire to the cantard is straight overland a ham of a hand slapped me on the back garrett you look like a man whos just had a religious revelation i have and the first saint of my new church is going to be saint playmate as long as the job dont call for a martyr have faith my friend and make lots of donations thats all this church will ask most of them only ask for the offerings i tell you i almost started my own church once no i was scoping it out when i thought i was going to lose the stable i figure a man my size tricked up in the right outfit would make a hell of a prophet and in a city as godridden as tunfaire people are always looking for something novel wouldnt have thought you so cynical me cynical perish the thought come back when you need a horse garrett morley and the triplets were sitting around looking smug when i showed up at the tate place with my travel bag on my shoulder you guys earned your keep or are you just in practice for the next time the grinning death comes through morley stopped gnawing a carrot long enough to say we thumped some heads this morning garrett doris bobbed his head and chortled something in dialect morley said he just claimed he broke twenty heads himself hes exaggerating there werent more than fifteen guys involved i recognized some of them secondraters whoever hired them was trying to get by on the cheap he got what he paid for i wondered if any of them had recognized morley did they get away with anything a lot of bruises and a few fractures i mean anything physical that isnt physical enough for you damn it you know what i mean testy in the morning arent we you didnt pay a bit of attention when i explained about fiber morley no nothing thank you whats in the bag my travel gear were headed out today you have some reason to hang around not really you just caught me by surprise that was the idea the arrangements are made you guys are ready to go well head for the boat from here and hide out there till we pull out boat what are you talking boat morley was ghostspooked pale the triplets looked green around the gills which was something for doris and marsha who were a lovely shade of pale lime to begin boat morley croaked again boat well barge down to leifmold then catch a coaster headed south well stay with it as far as we can then well put ashore and finish what we have to overland we mix with water worse than oil does garrett nonsense all the great navigators were elvish all the great navigators were crazy i get seasick watching the waterspider races which may explain why i cant bet them worth squat probably not enough starch in your diet he looked at me with hurt puppy eyes lets take it overland garrett not on your life i dont get along with horses so we walk the triplets can carry whos paying the wages morley he did nothing but scowl right the boss says we take boats as far as we can then we do it the hard way you have your boys pick up and pack up we head out in fifteen minutes i went and hunted up pop tate and told him id be doing the job and would be leaving the city shortly we dickered awhile about expense money to end up with what i wanted i had to give him what he wanted a pretty complete outline of my plans i could change them of course i dont like letting people in on everything it subverts my reputation for being unpredictable the river barge binkeys sequin reminded me of a shopkeepers wife she was middleaged middle class a little run down a little overweight extremely stubborn and set in her ways needing masterful coaxing and cajoling to get her to give her loving best but also faithful and warm and unsinkably optimistic in her care for her children morley hated her at first sight he prefers them sleek lean taut and fast master arbanos her skipper was an oversize gnome of that ethnic minority the ignorant sometimes confuse with hobgoblins after he got us settled in what with a smile of selfmockery he called the cabin he pulled me aside and told me we wont be able to sail till morning hope that dont throw you off schedule no but being naturally nosy and suspicious i wanted to know why cargos late best part that is twentyfive cask of the tunfaire gold that they dont trust nobody but me and my brother to get down the river unbruised tunfaire gold is a premium wine with a reputation for traveling poorly so here i sit he complained with eight ton of potato two ton of onion three ton of pigiron billet and forty hogshead of navy salt pork turning to mold while i wait for them to baby that spoiled grape juice down from tagend if i didnt get paid more for hauling that than the rest put together id tell them what to do with their tunfaire gold poison you bet i would cargo manifests how thoroughly exciting no problem for us as long as we get there in a reasonable amount of time oh wont be no problem with that well get there almost the same time we would have we will why well be going out with the tide with an extra five knot of current running where the river is usually slowest i just thought you might be in a hurry to move at this end what with the way your friends are keeping out of sight down with the codfish smell the way i hear tell you landsider dont favor fish odor too much i had not mentioned the stench being the naturally courteous guy that i am but now that you bring it up what wait one of the tate cousins or nephews was limping down the dock checking ships with mad eyes he was covered with dried blood people stepped out of his way and stared after him he spotted me staggered faster i went to meet him mr garrett they got tinnie and rose they said if we dont give them dennys papers he collapsed i caught him lifted him up and carried him aboard binkeys sequin master arbanos gave me an appalled look before he started complaining i tossed him a couple of marks his personality shifted like a wolfmans under a full moon you would have thought he was the boys mother a draft of brandy bubbling in the gut got the kid into a state to tell his tale rose and tinnie as was their custom had gone out to do the afternoon marketing lester and the usual cousins and nephews and some kitchen help had accompanied them again as was customary when they were returning with the servants and two boys lugging vegetables and whatnot disaster had struck in the form of vasco and a halfdozen thugs they grabbed rose and tinnie before we could drop the groceries and get our weapons out uncle lester was the only one who was able they killed him mr garrett you all do them any damage the kid wouldnt have been in such bad shape if they hadnt tried i needed to know how much blood was in it to tell if the women had a chance some he admitted i dont think we killed anybody we had to back off first thats when they said we could have them back if we gave them dennys letters and notebooks and stuff well they had no real reason to commit murder the blood was balanced one of their lot for uncle lester a trade could be made the problem was they would find out i was headed south if i had much to do with the exchange i grinned sounds bad to me morley said thought you were staying out of sight i wondered how long he had been sitting on that sack of onions listening not that he had heard anything he shouldnt he shrugged they tell you where to get in touch i asked the kid yes the iron old man tate himself materialized i thought he never left the family compound he stormed aboard shaking all over he was winded from his hike and so damned mad he couldnt do anything but sputter sit down pop i said im working on it already he plopped onto another bag of onions giving morley a curt nod master arbanos winced but kept his yap shut heres the lay i said weve got to make the trade tate sputtered but nodded then wheezed if it was just rose id be tempted to tell them to go to hell right look i put the papers and whatnot in a box and moved them out of your place so those clowns wouldnt get them when they broke in i didnt figure them for this anyway what we have to do now is set the exchange up in such a way that we get the women back in one piece i think i can do that but youll have to trust me on it tate started sputtering again morley said hes the expert mr tate permit him to exercise his expertise his tone was more diplomatic than what i usually manage im listening tate glared at me master arbanos what time are we going to take off tomorrow five minutes after the seventh hour right mr tate you go over to the iron i snapped my fingers at the kid iron goblin he said the iron goblin tell whoever meets you there that hes to deliver the women here at five after the seventh hour tomorrow morning or no deal ill tell them where they can get the papers when the women look like theyll get back to their own people okay in fact if master arbanos will provide me pen and paper ill write the instructions tate wanted to argue he always wanted to argue the old goat would disagree if you said the sky was blue i let him simmer while i scratched a note master arbanos was going to get rich selling me favors just pretend youre me i told tate when i finished i folded the note and handed it to him dont argue with them tell them thats it take it or leave it but theyll take it they wont expect me to trust them they would know id try to set up something so they cant mess us around and theyll check around about me theyll find out that ive done a couple of these things before and held up my end every time that was true as far as it went but this time a snatch and switch was not the whole story this time the snatch was part of something bigger i was starting to take things personally too tate got his spleen out and yakked his fear into submission then took my note and marched off we got the kid cleaned up and bandaged and sent him home vasco didnt want to play the game my way though he brought the women when he came to argue he came on time too which told me that he would do it my way if i didnt bend he left rose and tinnie fifty feet up the dock guarded by a halfdozen men and marched aboard still in there pitching to get your throat cut arent you i asked his lips tightened but he refused to be baited the sergeants teach you to control your temper down in the cantard he looked around did not see anything to disturb him he should have been disturbed it had been all i could do to restrain morley who wanted to bushwack the bunch and leave them floating in the river before you start i told vasco youd better realize that ive got no special need for those women i dont have any for dennys papers either which is why ill make the trade where are the papers garrett where are the women right there you cant see i dont see them on the boat you dont get squat till i think its too late for you to screw me over why would i do that i dont know you havent shown a lot of sense so far you wont needle me into doing something stupid garrett i dont have to you do fine without me get those women over here master arbanos was ready to cast off what guarantee do i have that youre not cheating us i ticked off points one i always play these things straight you know my reputation two i dont need the papers for anything three i know who you are so i dont have to mess with you now i can come for your head whenever i want it keep talking tough garrett youll get burned maybe youll send barbera after me his mouth tightened even more he jerked around jumped to the wharf gestured at his goons they released the women i waved them toward sequin they came forward slowly i guess they thought blood would fly any second vasco stopped a few steps from the edge of the wharf so where are the papers garrett i didnt have anything to say he was still between me and the women i just sort of looked around like a bored sightseer thats when i spotted the two guys from morleys place big one and ugly one not together but both hanging around relaxed just part of the crowd eyeballing the goingson i backed up a couple of steps like i was giving the gals room to jump aboard i whispered down to morley who was crouched between onion sacks take a peek at the guy sitting on the cotton bales give garrett vasco said i ignored him the women had a few yards to go yet even roses sour face had begun to show some hope master arbanos began letting lines go morley whispered i see him what about him who is he how the hell should i know i never saw him before i did once the other night hanging around with the big guy over there leaning against those navy pork barrels i started to tell him where and when then decided it might be wise to save a little something for my old age i dont know him either morley said give garrett vasco had just about decided i was going to cheat him he started after the women run i yelled at them and to vasco theyre in a box in an abandoned house on the way of the harlequin half a block west of wizards reach its your ass if they arent garrett anytime you think you can take a piece of it vasco anytime the boat began to drift away from the wharf the women took my advice sprinted and jumped a delectable bundle of goodies plopped into my arms morley popped up and caught rose making suitable purrs at the advent of unexpected treasures i tossed him a sneer vasco trotted away barking orders at his troops i couldnt restrain a chuckle whats so funny tinnie asked she made no effort to peel herself from me i thought about pushing her away sometime next week just imagining what might happen when they try to collect those papers you mean you lied to them the wharf was fifteen feet away now ugly one got down off the cotton bales he paid us no special attention and i had trouble paying him any either tinnie would not hold still oh no i told him the truth i just didnt tell him all of it amateurs morley said taking a break from rose who was doing to him what tinnie was to me they had any professional smarts at all theyd know thats the dead mans place slick garrett remind me not to get on your wrong side youre so slick youd slide uphill i glanced at the two men on the wharf and wondered i told you i was going with you garrett rose crowed as if she had planned the whole thing she got over her frights fast you might think i told her you might think i figured to have master arbanos put in a mile or two down and get shut of those females damn that tinnie was merciless i decided i liked her about then old man tate came charging out the dock too late for anything but the byebye master arbanos where are you going to put in so we can get rid of these women i figured id yell the news across to tate leifmold leifmold all the way down to the coast he would not relent he was deaf to offers of money on this he had a reputation a schedule and a tide and he would waste none of them for any puny bribe i could pay rose grinned wickedly while i argued tinnies smile was more promising the trouble with that damned boat was that there was no privacy you started a little handholding and ear blowing and there was doris or marsha or dojango or some damned crewman exercising his eyes it nearly drove morley and me crazy rose seemed plenty willing to be friendly with him of course he had the authentic golden touch i guess eating your vegetables is good for something leifmold was not that long a journey the first chance i got i pulled morley aside and asked how are we going to ditch those two bad choice of words garrett though i understand your frustration does our principal have reliable associates in leifmold i dont know why not i never had any reason to ask too bad now we have to try to charm it out of those girls he did not sound optimistic rose laughed at us when we tried to get some word out of her tinnie just pretended she was deaf morley and i went off to the stern and brooded together alone cant do it garrett he grumbled after a while uhm i grunted no way uhm skirts in the cantard worse than poison what i hear we go in there with women were dead guaranteed i know but we cant just run off on them either he gave me a look if it wasnt poor business sense in this case id say you were too romantic baggage is baggage there isnt anything any one of them is sitting on that you cant get from another one there was a lot of traffic on the river most of it taking advantage of the tide and most of it faster than binkeys sequin but there was one gaudy yachtlike vessel back upstream that seemed to have us on a leash i dont know how a guy with your attitude has your luck the yacht boasted a sail of red and yellow stripes it had sleek lines it smelled of wealth which meant power it could have passed us easily but it just hung back they want to be treated that way garrett if you dont treat them like rats they have to admit that theyre responsible for their own behavior and you know women they never want to admit they get a kick out of messing around how about trying this angle if master arbanos is willing im listening we tie them up just before we make port he hides them out while hes loading and unloading then he takes them back to tunfaire just part of the cargo sounds good to me when you talk to him ask about that boat with the striped sail i had wondered if hed noticed master arbanos held me up the man was a buccaneer but i was between a rock and a hard place and he knew it i paid in the end it all came out of tates pocket anyway i asked about the striped sail ship he looked at me like i was a moron sorry i forget you are not a riverman that is typhoon personal vessel of stormlord thunderhead everyone on the river knows it it runs to leifmold and back all the time showing the stormlords colors oh my oh my oh my i murmured the stormlord never sails her himself she is just for show her master is a bitch cartha with the temper and moral of an alley cat she has had trouble with everyone on the river some say she will strike the striped sail and hoist the black one by night what does that mean that some think she turn river pirate when no one is looking is it just talk or is there something to it bless me but wouldnt it be my kind of luck to be aboard a barge pirates were stalking the gods have a fellow especially assigned to complicate my life who knows there are pirate i have seen their leaving and he wanted coaxing they dont leave any witness which is why i never accept any cargo they find attractive little wheels and gears clicked in my mind like the works in a waterclock a clock running a little slow perhaps what sort of cargo might attract a pirate working from a vessel belonging to one of the stormlords what was this whole business about silver sweet silver the fuel of the engines of sorcery one more complication why the hell not every other angle had been covered hadnt it i gave master arbanos a generous portion of the metal sugar he assured me my will would be carried out where the women were concerned they would be treated like royalty and on sequins return to tunfaire he would deliver them to old man tate personally i could ask for nothing more master arbanos crewfolk all of them his relatives moved the night before we were due to reach leifmold they caught the gals asleep such caterwauling and cursing i never rose i expected to be less than polite but tinnie id had pegged as at least half a lady she turned out to be the louder of the two at least that went off without hitches the sea lay on our left leifmold climbed steep hills a mile to our right we were waiting to pick up a pilot whose expertise would be needed if binkeys sequin was to negotiate the traps laid for venageti raiders morley was loafing in the bows come here he said beckoning languorously he was nibbling a raw potato stolen from the cargo i gave it a disgusted look not bad if you sprinkle a little salt on he said and good for you no doubt of course take a gander round the harbor there i did and saw what he meant the stripedsail yacht was warping into a dock she had passed us in the night and had pulled rank to get the first available pilot needs keeping an eye on i admitted you read that guy dennys papers did he mention stormlord thunderhead anywhere no but a couple other wizards got memorialized im willing to look for an indirect connection when you consider the possibility of wizards being involved in anything the smart thing to do is to assume the worst so chances were striped sail had nothing to do with us but i would take the paranoid approach on the off chance the women raised all kinds of holler when we tied up but nobody paid them any mind morley and doris and marsha and i went off looking for one of several coasters recommended to us by master arbanos morley left dojango to watch the stormlords yacht no one there ought to recognize him even if they were up to no good our luck was in we found a ship called the gilded lady planning to put out next morning her master was amenable to our buying passage morley started looking grey around the edges you handled the river all right no waves on the river garrett lots of waves along the coast and the ship running parallel to them his eyes bugged lets not talk about it lets find someplace to put up then get out on the town theres a place down here even better than mine dont you ever tell anybody i admitted that that youve really got to try im not in a roots and nuts mood morley looking a long voyage in the eye i need something with more body body dont you care what youre doing to your body i promise youll like this place give you a little something different all that red meat is going to kill you anyway we did red meat the other day morley but since you bring up selfabuse lets do some calculating who is more likely to die young me eating what i want or you messing around with other guys women youre talking apples and oranges now buddy im talking dead is what im talking he did not have a rejoinder for fifteen seconds then he said only ill die happy so will i morley and without hunks of nut stuck between my teeth i give up he said go ahead commit slow suicide by poisoning yourself that was my plan a tavern sign caught my eye it had been a dry trip down the river im going to tip a few doris and marsha recognized a beer joint when they saw one too they grunted back and forth morley started trading gibberish with them oh my did all the triplets have an alcohol problem i said as soon as we find a place for the night somebody better check on dojango at least so he knows where to find us morley reached a compromise with doris and marsha they can have one bucket each thats all bucket theyre big boys garrett so i noticed we marched into the tavern it was early yet so there was no crowd still a silence fell and grew so deep i knew we had walked in where we were not wanted ive never let that stop me i tossed a coin on the bar a mug of brew for me and a bucket apiece for the big boys and my buddy here will have whatever you can stomp out of a parsnip coldeyed stare we dont serve their kind well now they dont speak karent very well so when you look at them there theyre still smiling but i dont think theyll keep on smiling if i have to translate that for them you know how grolls are when they get mad he thought about arguing he might have had there been forty or fifty more people to back his play but doris and marsha had begun to get the drift their smiles vanished and their faces grew mottled we want beer i said not your women he did not laugh he headed for the tap not many people are fool enough to make a groll mad they do get mean not bad beer i said quaffing my third while doris and marsha nursed their milk pails and serving it up didnt break one bone did it the barman wasnt interested in bantering most of his regulars had deserted him we followed their example about fifty sullen men had gathered outside their mood looked ugly i told morley i ought to pay closer attention to what neighborhood im in i like the way you think garrett half a brick thrown by somebody named anonymous arced toward us it had some arm behind it doris or maybe it was marsha stabbed a paw out and snagged it he looked it over for a second then he squeezed it and let the powder dribble between his fingers that impressed me but not the mob so he snapped off the timber from which the taverns sign hung he stripped the sign off and flailed the timber around like a switch that got the message across the mob began to evaporate morley asked could a mule do that no we were more circumspect in selecting a place to spend the night so where the hell is he i demanded there wasnt a shadow of dojango morley looked bleak he had been looking bleak for a while i thought maybe i should buy him a bunch of carrots or something he muttered guess well have to scout the alleys and taverns im going to take a gander at that ship catch me on the pier when you find him morley said something to the two remaining triplets they grunted and moved out i marched on down to where i could get a look at that stripedsail ship there wasnt much to see a few men lugging things off then lugging other things on it wasnt hard to understand why dojango bugged out watching is boring work it takes a patient guy to lurk for a living a man came out on the rear deck leaned on the rail hawked spat into the harbor interesting he was big one from morleys place and the pier he began scanning the waterfront almost as if he had heard me then he shrugged and went into a cabin curious maybe dojango would have stayed on the job if he had seen that guy before i lazed in the shade wishing i had a keg to nurse and wondering what was taking morley so long nothing else happened except that the stevedores finished loading and unloading i heard a soft scuff behind me maybe at last but when i looked i saw big one he was not in a friendly mood i dropped off the bale where id been loafing did this call for lethal instruments he walked right up and wacked the bale with a short club no accusations no questions nothing but business i leaned out of the way and let him have one in the gut it did as much good as gutpunching a barrel of salt pork that club was meant to scramble my brains i feared i hauled out a knife i did not get to use it the cavalry arrived in the guise of doris or marsha the groll picked big one up by one arm and held him out like a doll a slow grin spread over his green face then he casually heaved him over the bales into the harbor big one never made a sound they would have heard me cussing fifty miles away doris or marsha as the case may have been beckoned me to follow i did grumbling i could have handled him probably about like i had handled saucerhead by pounding my body off his club till it broke this case was doing wonders for my selfesteem dojango was not fallingdowndrunk he was climbingthewallsandhowlingatthemoondrunk marsha kept him under control while doris explained what happened on the waterfront or doris did while marsha did i passed my thoughts afterward bad business morley said his sense of humor had deserted him bad business indeed but i had gone up against wizards before you can handle them if your footwork is deft they have more handles than your ordinary street tbug the big thing is theyre all as crooked as a hens hind leg they are in the middle of every stew of corruption but they go for a squeakyclean public image its smart to keep some tarnish in your trick bag and be ready to spread it around well be out of here tomorrow our worries will be over our worries will be over about the time i learn to handicap the dgumi races meaning never or maybe a little longer im beginning to wonder if we ought not to reexamine your diet morley such unrelenting pessimism must have some deficiency at its base the only deficiencies bothering me are of good luck financial wherewithal and female companionship i thought you and rose as you said she wants something for nothing she had a chance at a onceinalifetime experience and she tried to sell herself to me as if she had something special as if a woman with her attitudes could ever develop whatever talent she did have ill never understand you people what you do to your women what i do to them isnt any different than what you do to yours roses problems are hers i do get tired of hearing folks blame their faults on everybody else whoa garrett come on down off your stump sorry i was just thinking how i was going to spend tomorrow say what listening to dojango groan and moan and heave his guts over the side while he blames his drinking problem on his mother or somebody morley grinned dojango gripped the rail and made an awful noise as he sacrificed to the gods of the sea a soft whimper followed what did i say i asked we were twenty feet from the quayside morley was a little green himself his trouble was all anticipation the ship wasnt even noticeably rolling the ships master approached he had time for us now that the vessel was turning toward the channel he said i spoke to the harbor master this morning the war situation is quiet were clear all the way to full harbor if you want to stay with the ship that far of course we do morley groaned dojango whimpered something about throwing himself overboard and ending it all i grinned and set to dickering for the extra passage halfway out of the channel the groll portion of the triplets began gabbling at morley when we went to see what they wanted we found we were overhauling binkeys sequin the tate girls were out on deck they spotted us as we slid past on the starboard side i get the feeling theyre upset about something morley said he smiled and waved women have no sense of proportion i said i grinned and waved too wag a little tail at you and youre supposed to eat out of their hands i looked at tinnie and wondered if it might be worth it they blistered the air i wondered if my personal sacrifices could be parlayed into a bonus from old man tate we swooped past sequin and dashed for the mouth of the channel master arbanos vessel was a dark lump in the distance as we began our turn to the south ill be damned it was a morning for meeting old friends a river scow entering the leifmold channel carried vasco and his buddies that damned dead man i muttered he could have banged them around a little at least they hadnt spotted us i got everybody out of sight so it would stay that way i had counted on the dead man to stall them longer than he had now i worried had they done something i would regret keep an eye on these pirates morley grumped they might murder us while were laying in the scuppers puking our guts out the ship had completed her turn she was rolling in the offshore swell morley had no call to worry the ships crew treated us perfectly the journey was almost without event once the stormlords striped sail passed us wallowing and struggling through seas she was not designed to face she did not seem interested in us and was not to be seen in the harbor at our first port of call once we saw a royal manofwar farther out and another time a masterhead lookout yelled down that he had a venageti sail in sight nothing came of either sighting we entered full harbor eight days after departing leifmold no striped sail was to be seen there either for once i felt a little optimistic were here morley growled the next morning what now he had stoked up on biscuits baked with lard and served with greasy gravy it was the nearest he could get to a vegetarian breakfast now i try to pick up the womans trail her family should still be here they ought to know something it sounded too simple even to me but sometimes things go your way it would be sweet if i could find her at her dads place make my pitch and head out with her yea or nay full harbor had changed and not changed new buildings new naval facilities new streets laid out after the cleanup from the big venageti attack three years ago same old whores and stews and pawnshops and overpriced inns and tailors preying on the loneliness of young sailors and marines far from home and in the shadow of death the gods know i wasted enough of my own time and pay in places like that reformers keep talking about shutting them down they wont the boys would have nothing left to fill their time i expected commentary from morley dotes he disappointed me in a pleasant way you humans are a despair that this is the best a soldier can expect maybe it was his human side talking we are the only race that goes in for war habitually in a big way the others especially the elves and dwarfs have the occasional brawl but seldom more often than once a generation and then usually only a single battle not much sorcery winner take all plenty of them get in on our doings as auxiliaries they can be useful but are unreliable they have no concept of discipline youre right lets find ourselves a base then get to work we drew plenty of stares being civilians and them being what they were i didnt like the attention mine is a business where i dont want to be remembered we found a place that would accept civs and breeds without devouring the income of ten years it was about as sleazy as a place could get i bribed the owner to keep alcohol away from the triplets then morley and i hit the streets full harbor on the map looks something like a lobsters head lying between its arms the city proper and its naval facilities sits at the end of a fortified neck of land the arms reach out and shield the bay from the worst stormdriven seas the citys location makes it very defensible the venageti have managed to penetrate it only twice each time losing the entire force committed the farther you get from the waterfront and naval facilities the more civilized the city becomes there are some low wooded hills just inside the neck of the peninsula right behind the narrows wall they harbor the homes of the citys welltodo no lords reside in the city they refuse to risk themselves or their properties where the venageti might show up with the unpredictable suddenness of a tropical storm theyre funny that way plenty willing to trek all over the cantard risking themselves for glory and personal gain but i dont understand them any more than i understand frogs but im handicapped by my low birth kayeans father had been one of the syndics who dwelt in the hills with a wife four servants and eight kids kayean was the oldest memories returned bringing a certain nostalgia as i guided the rented carriage up and down pacific lanes whatre you looking all moonyeyed about morley demanded we had left the triplets at the inn an action the wisdom of which i still doubted though morley assured me he had not left a farthing between them remembering when young love first love right here in these hills i had not filled him in on every little detail a bodyguard did not need to know all the sordid angles im a bit of a nostalgic romantic myself but i never figured you for one garrett me the knight in rusty armor always clanking out to rescue undeserving maidens or to do battle with the dragons of some lunatics imagination i dont qualify you see romantic images though why should you mind working for nuts if they have money to spend you can milk a man with an obsession like a spider milks a fly i dont work that way i know you really want to rescue maidens and champion underdogs and lost causes as long as you get enough grease to keep the joints in the armor from freezing up i like a beer sometimes too youve got no ambition garrett thats whats wrong with you you could write a book about all the things youve found wrong with me morley id rather write one about the things that are right itd be a lot less work just a short little fable hes kind to his mother doesnt beat his wife his kids never have to go in the snow barefoot sarky today arent we im off my feed how much longer are we going to be looking for the ghosts of mighthavebeen not only sarky but a little too perceptive i supposed i might as well confess im not being romantic im lost lost i thought you said you knew these parts like the back of your hand i did but things have changed all the trees and bushes and stuff that were landmarks have grown or been cut down or then well just have to ask somebody wont we yo he shouted at a gardener clipping a hedge whats the name of the guy were looking for garrett the gardener stopped working and gave us the fisheye he looked like a real friendly type poison you with his smile klaus kronk the first name was pronounced claws with a soft sibilant but morley took it for a nickname he climbed down and approached the gardener tell me my good fellow where can we find the syndic claws kronk the good fellow gave him a puzzled look that turned into a sneer lets see the color of your metal darko morley calmly picked him up and chucked him over his hedge hopped over after him and tossed him back thumped on him a little twisted limbs and made him groan then said tell me my good fellow where can we find the syndic claws kronk he wasnt even breathing hard the gardener decided that at least one of us was a psychopath he stammered directions thank you morley said you have been most gracious and helpful in token of my appreciation i hope you will accept this small gratuity he dropped a couple of coins into the mans palm closed his fingers over them then rejoined me aboard our conveyance take the first left and go all the way to the top of the hill i glanced back at the gardener still seated beside the lane a glint of mischief sparked in his swelling eyes you think its wise to make enemies out here morley we wont get any comebacks from him he thinks im crazy i cant imagine why anybody would think that about you morley we had only one turn left to make a cemetery flanked both sides of the road you know where you are now morley asked a landmark like this ought to be plenty memorable more memorable than you know i think our gardener friend got us well see in a minute i turned between the red granite pillars that flanked the entrance to the kronk family plot hes dead were about to find out he was his was the last name incised in the stone of the obelisk in the center of the plot got it during the last venageti incursion judging from the date i said fits what i remember about him too he would get out and howl for karenta what do we do now i guess we look for the rest of the family hes the only one whos established residence here he lifted one eyebrow i can find my way from here kayean and i used to walk up here at night to uh in a graveyard nothing like tombstones to remind you how little time you have for the finer things in life you humans are weird garrett if you want an aphrodisiac theres one that the sidhe tribes of the benecel river basin make from the roots of something like a potato plant itll keep your soldier at attention for hours not only that but when you use it youre guaranteed theres no way youre going to become a papa vegetarian sexual aids some people take good things too far starting from the cemetery i was able to find the kronk place with only one miscue from the lane the place next door looked more like the one i remembered than the correct one we were partway up the flagstones when i spied the peacock cages under the magnolias about turn and march i said one house shy of our mark i recalled how if kayean was not very careful sneaking in and out those peafowl would raise six kinds of hell and there went the evening if it happened on the sneakout side her old man knew what was going on but was never quick enough to catch her she had been fast on her feet i explained that to morley as we retreated to the lane how the hell did a slob like you ever meet a quail living in a place like this i met her at a party for bachelor officers the admiral put on all the most eligible young ladies of full harbor were there he gave me an overly dramatic look of disbelief i confessed i was there waiting tables it must have been animal magnetism and the air of danger and forbidden fruit surrounding an affair with a member of the lower classes he said it deadpan i could not decide whether i should be irritated or not whatever it was it was the greatest thing that had happened in my young life hasnt been much since to eclipse it either like i said a romantic and there he let it lay lot of changes since i was here i said the place has been completely done over you sure its the right one yeah all the memories assured me that it was we had walked these grounds under the watchful chaperonage of a patient and loving mother who had seen the whole romance as a phase and would not have believed her eyes if she had walked in on us in the cemetery morley took my word for it we were still fifty feet from the door when a man in livery stepped outside and came to meet us he dont look like hes glad we dropped by morley grunted he dont look like your average houseboy either he didnt he looked like a saucerhead tharpe who was past his prime but still plenty dangerous the way he fisheyed us said that fancy clothes or not we were not fooling him can i help you gents id decided to go at it straight ahead almost honest and hope for the best i dont know were down from tunfaire looking for klaus kronk that seemed to take him from the blind side he said and just when i thought id heard all the gags there was we just a little bit ago found out he was dead so what are you doing here instead of heading back where you came from if the guy you want is croaked the only reason i wanted to talk to him was to find out how i could get in touch with his oldest daughter i know shes married but i dont know who to i thought maybe her mother or any others of the family who were still around might be able to point me in the right direction any of them here he looked like it was getting too complicated for him you must be talking about the people who used to live here they moved out a couple years ago the changes all seemed recent enough to support his statement you have any idea where she is why the hell should i i didnt even know her name till you told me thank you for your time and courtesy well have to trace her some other way what you want this machuska for anyway while i considered his question morley said throw it in the pond and see which way the frogs jump we represent the executors of an estate of which she is the principal legatee i love it when you talk dirty lawyer morley said he told our new buddy she inherited a bundle in a ventriloquists whisper he told me hit him with the number so we can see how big his eyes get it looks like around a hundred thousand marks less executors fees his eyes did not get big he didnt even bat one instead he muttered i thought i heard every gag there was again so i repeated myself for him thanks for your time and courtesy i headed for the lane next stop morley asked we ask at the houses on either side the people who lived there knew the family they might give us something if theyre not gone too what did you think of that guy ill try not to form an opinion till ive talked to a few more people we had a less belligerent but no more informative interview at the next house down the lane the people there had only been in the place a year and all they knew about the kronks was that klaus was killed during the last venageti invasion you make anything of that i asked as we turned the rig around and headed for the peacock place of what he said kronk was killed during the venageti thing not by the venageti an imprecision due entirely to laziness no doubt probably but thats the kind of detail you keep an ear out for sometimes they add up to a picture people dont know theyre giving you like brush strokes add up to a painting the peacocks raised thirteen kinds of hell when they discovered us they crowed like they hadnt had anything to holler about for years my god i murmured she hasnt changed a bit she was always old and ugly morley asked staring at the woman who observed our approach from a balcony on the side of the house hasnt even changed her clothes careful with her shes some kind of halfhulder witch a little man in a green suit and red stocking cap raced across our path cackling something in a language i didnt understand morley grabbed a rock and started to throw it i stopped him whatre you doing theyre vermin garrett maybe they run on their hind legs and make noises that sound like speech but theyre as much vermin as any rat but he let the rock drop i have definite feelings about rats even the kind that walk on their hind legs and talk and do socially useful things like dig graves i understood morleys mood if not his particular prejudice the old witch i never heard her called anything else grinned down at us hers was a classic gaptoothed grin she looked like every witch from every witch story youve ever heard there was no shaking my certainty that it was deliberate a mad cackle floated down the peafowl answered as though to one of their own spooky morley said thats her image her game shes harmless so you say that was the word on her when i was here before crazy as a gnome on weed but harmless nobody who harbors those little vipers is harmless or blameless you let them skulk around your garden they breed like rabbits and first thing you know theyve driven all the decent folk away with their malicious tricks we were up under the balcony now i forbore mentioning his earlier response to a gardeners bigotry it wouldnt have done any good folks always believe their own racism is the result of divine inspiration incontestably valid my dislike for rat people is of course the exception to the rule of irrationality underlying such patterns of belief the old witch cackled again and the peafowl took up the chorus once more she called down he was murdered you know who was i asked the man you were looking for private garrett syndic klaus they think no one knows but they are wrong they were seen werent they my little pretties how did you you think you and that girl could sneak through here night after night running to that cemetery to slake your lusts without the little people noticing they tell me everything they do and i never forget a name or a face did i say they were vermin morley demanded lurking in the shadows of tombstones watching you and probably laughing their little black hearts out because there is no sight more ridiculous than people coupling maybe i reddened a little but otherwise i ignored him who killed him i asked and why we could name some names couldnt we my little pretties but to what purpose there is no point now could you at least tell me why he was killed he found out something that was not healthy for him to know she cackled again the peafowl cheered her on it was a great joke didnt he my little pretties didnt he what might that have been the laughter left her face and eyes you wont be hearing it from me maybe that machuska kayean knows ask her when you find her or maybe she doesnt i dont know and i dont care that was the second time that day id heard kayean called machuska and only the second time id heard the word since i had gotten out of the marines and the cantard it was a particularly spiteful bit of venageti gutter slang labeling a human woman who has congress with members of other species a word like our own koboldknocker is a like nickname can you tell me where she is no i dont know could you tell me where i might find some of her family i dont know maybe they all went to join her maybe they went somewhere to escape their shame she cackled but she didnt put much heart into it the peafowl didnt either their feeble response was pure charity is there any way you can help me i can give you some advice i waited watch out who you play with among the headstones especially if you do find kayean she might show you one with her name on it time to get out of here i told morley in case its catching he agreed i thanked the old witch we backed away in spite of her efforts to cling to our company was that worth it morley asked absolutely a little fellow in green and red jumped into our path he removed his cap and bowed then rewarded morley with a grandiloquent obscene gesture he raced into the bushes giggling this time i didnt interfere with morleys rock throwing lurk behind tombstones would they the giggles ended with an abrupt yipe i hope i broke his skull morley growled whatre we going to do now go back to the inn and eat check on the triplets guzzle some beer think spend the afternoon trying to turn something up in parish or civil records like what like who she married if she was married here she was a good orthodox girl she would have wanted the whole fancy formal show it might be easier to trace her through her husband if we knew his name i dont want to be negative garrett but i have a feeling the girl you knew and are looking for isnt the woman were going to find i had the same sad feeling where the hell are they morley roared at the innkeeper how the hell should i know the man roared right back obviously used to rough trade you said dont give them anything to drink you didnt say nothing about nursemaiding them or keeping them off the streets if you ask me they looked like they was growed up enough to go out and play by themselves hes right morley calm down i didnt want him getting so stirred up hed need to run ten miles to work it off i had a feeling it would be smart if we stuck together as much as we could assuming the old witch knew what she was yakking about somewhere there was a killer who might get unnerved by our poking around i repeated myself calm down and think about it you know them what are they likely to be doing anything he grumbled thats why im not calm but he took my advice and sprawled in a chair across the table ive got to find some decent food or something female you see whats happening to me i didnt get a chance to put in my farthings worth dojango came ambling in looking like a rooster on parade he had his hands shoved into his pockets his shoulders thrown back and he was strutting calmly i cautioned morley doris and marsha each had a hide with the look of old scuffed shoes but they were grinning too strutting was too much for them the ceiling was only twelve feet high morley did very well he asked whats up dojango we went out and got in a fight with about twenty sailors cleaned up the streets with them calmly i told morley hanging on to his shoulder from the looks of dojango compared to his brothers his part in the fight must have been mostly supervisory morley suggested maybe youd better tell it from the beginning like start with what made you go out there in the first place oh we were going down to watch the harbor in case anybody interesting came in like the guys on that stripedsail ship or the ones that snatched garretts girlfriends or even the girls themselves morley had the good grace to look abashed and we were headed back here when we ran into the sailors doris or maybe marsha rumbled something morley translated he says they called them bad names he kept a straight face so besides making the streets safe from marauding namecalling sailors did you accomplish anything we saw the stripedsail ship come in one guy the one marsha threw in the drink in leifmold got off he hired a ricksha we figured we would be too obvious if we tried to follow him so we didnt try but we did get close enough to hear him tell the ricksha man to take him to the civil city hall full harbor has two competing administrations one civil one military their feuding helps keep city life interesting good work morley grouched worth a beer dojango asked morley looked at me i shrugged they were his problem he said all right how about two what is this a damned auction morley and i mounted the rig he asked where to now peerless investigator i figured on hitting the civil city hall next but dojango changed my mind i dont want to run into that guy again if i can help it your caution is commendable if a bit out of character keep an eye peeled for a decent place to eat get up i told the horses keep an eye out for a pasture where morley can graze i dont understand it we went into the church and there was nothing going on every day seems like a holy day of obligation for the orthodox from what ive seen a priest in his twenties with a face that did not yet need shaving asked us how may i help you gentlemen he was unsettled we werent ten feet inside the door but already we had betrayed ourselves as heathen we had overlooked some genuflection or something earlier id decided to deal straight with the church without telling everything of course i told the priest i was trying to locate the former kayean kronk of his parish because she had a very large legacy pending in tunfaire i thought somebody who works here or your records might help me trace her can we talk to your boss he winced before he said ill tell him youre here and why ill ask if hell see you morley barely waited until the kid was out of earshot if you want to get along with these people you should at least try to fake the cant how do you do that when you dont have the foggiest what it is i thought you said you and the gal used to come here for services im not a religious guy i slept through them most of the time the venageti must not have made it this far during the invasion why do you say that look at all the gold and silver there arent any orthodox among the venageti they would have stripped the place and sent the plunder out on the first courier boat the priest came hustling back sair lojda will give you five minutes to argue your case as we followed him he added the sair is accustomed to dealing with unbelievers but even from them he expects the honor and deference due his rank ill be sure not to slap him on the back and ask if he wants a beer i said the sair was the first to ask for my credentials i made my pitch while he examined them he did not give us the full five minutes allotted he interrupted me you will have to see father rhyne he was the kronk family confessor and spiritual adviser mike take these gentlemen to father rhyne what are you grinning about i asked morley as soon as we were out of the presence when was the last time you had a priest take less than three hours even to tell you to have a nice day oh he was a driedup little peckerwood wasnt he watch your tongue morley he was right the sairs face had reminded me of a halfspoiled peach that had dried in the desert for six months father rhyne was a bit remarkable too he was about five feet tall almost as wide bald as a buzzards egg but had enough hair from the ears down to reforest fifty desert craniums he was naked to the waist and appeared to be doing exercises i have never seen anyone with so much brush on his face and body couple of minutes more men he said he went on sweating puddles all right throw me a towel mike trying to shed a few stone he told us what can i do for you i sang my song again complete with all the choruses i wondered if i would run out of bottles of beer on the wall before i picked up kayeans trail he thought for a minute then said mike would you get the gentlemen some refreshments beer will do for me me too i chirped ah another connoisseur a gentleman after my own heart morley grumbled something about brewing being an unconscionable waste of grains that could be stoneground and baked into highfiber breads that would give thousands the bulk they desperately needed in their diets father mike and father rhyne both looked at him like he was mad i didnt contradict their suppositions i told father mike see if you cant track down a rutabaga if it doesnt put up too fierce a fight squeeze it for a pint of blood and bring that to him a glass of cold spring water will be sufficient morley said coldly sufficiently i decided not to ride him so hard once our guide stepped out father rhyne confessed i wanted mike out of the way for a while he has a tendency to gossip you dont want this spread around any more than need be so youre looking for kayean kronk why here the kronks were a religious family this was their parish i know she was married some time ago but i dont even know her husbands name it would have been in keeping with her character to have had a big parochial wedding if she did and it was here then the grooms name would be on record she was not married in the church not this parish or any other there was something very odd and ominous about the way he said that is there any chance you could give me a useful lead or two either toward her or a member of her family who might be willing to help he eyed me a full half a minute you seem like an honest enough fellow if not entirely forthright but i expect our trades are a little alike in that respect you satisfied the sair who has the eye of a buzzard when it comes to judging character ill help however i can as long as i dont have to violate the sanctity of the confessional all right how can you help me i dont know i cant tell you where to find her is that privileged knowledge no i dont know what about the name of the guy she married i cant tell you that either privilege or dont know six of one half dozen of the other all right ill worry about getting a dozen out of that later can you tell me where i can get in touch with any of her family no before i could ask he raised a staying hand and said ignorance not privilege the last i heard of any of the kronks was about two years ago her brother kayeth had been decorated and brevetted major of cavalry for his part in the victory at latigo wells morley stirred just the slightest yes another cavalryman it might or might not mean something kayeth was younger than kayean which meant he was younger than denny and me which meant their periods of service might not have overlapped at all idiot they didnt need to overlap for them to have met if denny was her lover after me do you recall what unit he was with no no matter that should be easy to find out when was the last time you saw kayean he had to think about that i figured he was having trouble remembering i was wrong he was debating proprieties he gave me an exacttotheminute time and date slightly more than six years ago and added that is when she ceased to exist in the eyes of the church huh morley said he means she was excommunicated garrett father rhyne nodded what for the reasons for excommunication are revealed only to the soul to be banished from grace wait a minute i was confused are we talking about the same woman take it easy garrett morley said excommunication dont necessarily mean she turned into some kind of religious desperado they do you in because you wont let them extort your whole fortune or if youre a woman because you wont come across that was a deliberate provocation father rhyne took it better than i expected i have heard that sort of thing happens up north not here this is a church militant here in this archdiocese the priest who tried that would find himself staked like a vampire the reasons for kayeans excommunication were valid within the laws of the church i stepped in before morley rendered his opinion of laws that judged him to be without a soul and therefore beyond the protection of its golden rules thats not really the sort of information thats likely to help me father unless the reasons for her excommunication have some bearing on where she is now father rhyne shook his head but with just enough hesitance to show he was not sure my job and my only job is to find the woman so i can tell her she has inherited a hundred thousand marks once i tell her im supposed to ask if she wants it if she does im supposed to escort her to tunfaire because she has to claim it in person if she doesnt want it i have to get a legal deposition to that effect so that others down the list can benefit from the legacy thats it thats all nevertheless you have a personal interest glass door garrett that is what they call me see right through me the guy who died was a good friend of mine i want to see what kind of woman would get him to leave her everything when he hadnt even seen her for seven years a twitch of a smile worked one corner of rhynes mouth i stopped confused morley said in the shadows behind the tombstones that did it of course rhyne had been kayeans confessor hed never say a word but he remembered sins confessed that included a marine named garrett all right we know where we stand we know what my job is ive asked the questions i think are pertinent and a few that werent and some that were probably impertinent and i think youve answered me fairly can you think of anything you could volunteer that might be helpful hang on a second garrett morley said he drifted to the door as soundlessly as a cloud and jerked it open father mike almost fell over id wondered what had been keeping him ah that beer at last father rhyne had on a big jovial hosts grin but his eyes were not smiling just put the tray down and go about your duties mike ill talk to you later father mike went out looking like he hoped later would never come rhyne chose to pretend that nothing untoward had happened he poured beer from a monster of a pitcher into enormous earthenware mugs morleys water was in a blownglass tankard of equal size id barely taken my first sip before father rhyne parted from his mug and said ahh he wiped his mouth with the fur on the back of his forearm then belched like a young thunderhead he poured himself a pint chaser before he hoisted it he said what information can i volunteer i can tell you that you wont find her in full harbor i can tell you to walk very carefully because i can infer without absolute certitude that there might be people who wouldnt want you to find her i can tell you not to look for the image that lives in your memory because you will never find her i finished my brew thank you good beer we make it ourselves will there be anything more no well something from off the wall ive heard her father was murdered any comment he got a very evasive look its possible his expression told he would clamp his jaws on that cryptic statement i returned my mug to the tray morley followed my lead he had downed enough water to show he appreciated the stuff in quantities too small to rock a boat we headed for the door i said thanks for everything sure if you do find her tell her we havent stopped loving her even if we cant forgive her that might help our gazes locked and i knew that fat little hairball did not mean we at all i also knew the whole thing was as chaste and courtly as any perfect knights affection for his lady in an old roman ill do that father another one morley said when we got outside ive got to meet this woman there was not an ounce of sarcasm in his tone are we making any headway morley asked as we climbed aboard the rented rig oh yes weve eliminated some legwork like making the rounds of every orthodox parish in full harbor weve added a visit to the army office at the military city hall to see if they will help us locate major kayeth kronk i did not look forward to that theyd probably assume we were venageti spies what now we can try that we can try the civil city hall too though i dont think wed get much there or we could go back to the inn and i could lay around staring at the ceiling and wondering what a sensible young woman can do to get herself excommunicated that doesnt sound productive and butting heads with the army even to get them to tell us to get out and leave them alone is likely to be an allday job the civil city hall it is then we were headed up the steps when a voice roared hey you two we stopped turned near the rig stood a city employee the type who carries weapons and is supposed to protect citizens from their neighbors villainies but who spends most of his time forcefeeding his purse and sparing the reputations of the wealthy and powerful this yours yes you cant leave it here we dont want no horse apples tracked all over the hall despite his friendly way of putting it his position had merit i marched down the steps have you a suggestion what i can do with it he did not know who we were we had come in a fancy rig we were well dressed morley looked a bit like a bodyguard i wore a look of cherubic innocence a suspicion slithered through his slow wit i had handed him that straight line so he would stick his foot in his mouth then i would choke him on it we usually ask visitors to leave their conveyances in the courtyard behind the hall sir i could move it back there for you if you like thats very thoughtful of you id appreciate that very much i dug out a tip about one and a half times the going rate for such a task enough to impress not enough to arouse resentment or suspicion thank you sir we watched him drive into a narrow passageway between one end of the hall and the city jail slick garrett what you should have been a con man you sold him using nothing but intonation bearing and gesture slick it was an experiment if hed had two ounces of brain to rub together it wouldnt have worked if he had two ounces of brain hed be making an honest living i think morleys attitude toward socalled civil servants is as cynical as mine the next public employee we encountered on a more than whichwaydowego basis had two ounces of brains just barely i was digging through what passed for vital statistics in full harbor and finding that four of the kronk children were not listed at all morley in pursuit of an inspiration of his own dug through the property plats and brought one over he sat on the floor reading it twoounces appeared out of nowhere and bellowed what the hell do you think youre doing research i replied in my reasonable voice get the hell out of here why reasonable again of course that got him for a moment both ounces went stumbling after something with more authority than a bottomrung city flunkys because i said so morley dealt himself a hand these are public records legally open to public inspection that left twoounces armed only with bluster because he didnt know for sure im going to call some guards and have you wise guys thrown out on your asses that wont be necessary morley closed the plat book no need for a scene the matter can wait till after youve explained to the judge tomorrow morning judge what judge the judge whos going to ask you why a couple of honest investigators like ourselves sent down from tunfaire cant look at documents any vagrant off the streets of full harbor has a right to see he went off to return his plat book twoounces stared at me while i neatened up after myself i think he saw nothing but potential disaster there is no man so insecure as a bottomlevel functionary in a sinecure he has held for a long time hes done nothing for so long that nothing is all he can do the prospect of unemployment is a mortal terror ready morley asked returning when you are lets go see you in the morning friend the man turned slowly to watch us go his face still drained but the poison had begun to creep into his eyes it was the hatred and power greed that make vicious liars out of people who tell you theyre public servants howd i do morley asked as we pushed out the front door he was grinning not bad maybe one slice too much ham he wanted to debate but i cut him short you learn anything not unless you care that the house was sold by madame kronk a decent interval after the date on that memorial obelisk to a character with the unlikely name of zeck zack for what seems like a reasonable market price you ever heard of him no you find out anything only that the civil city administration keeps pretty loose track of whos dying and being born oh so with those kronks being prominent imagine what theyve got on ordinary real folks i shrugged you leave no stone unturned till you find a trail wheres that clown who took the carriage probably at the nearest swill pit guzzling your tip then well just get it ourselves were big boys we can handle it we turned into the alley between the hall and the jail it was clean for a city alley probably because of where it was but gloomy because of the hour morley saidwe could probably find a judge we could bribe to back us with that guy i dont think old man tate would buy it when it showed up on my expense sheet a large somebody stepped out of the wall a dozen feet ahead his appearance was vague in that light morley said behind you let out a screech and flung himself through the air i whirled ducking just in time a club whipped the air where my head had been i gave the guy a kick in the root of his fantasies then clipped him on the cheek as he bent to pray behind him was a guy who was more surprised than me i jumped and grabbed his arm tried giving him a knee he tried to pull a knife while he stared over my shoulder a big wad of fear in his eyes i figured morley was about finished behind me my man tried to knee me and i tried to knee him again and sometime during our dance he decided he really ought to get the hell out of there he twisted away and started hiking i was satisfied i turned to check behind me morleys man was out morley himself was bent double holding up a wall puking his guts out his man must have gotten in a good one my first was down thrashing and twitching and making disgusting handsaw noises the light was too poor to be sure but i thought his color looked bad what did you do to him morley croaked kicked him maybe he swallowed his tongue morley went down on one knee he moved gingerly the guy finished up with one wild convulsion then he was done literally morley trailed fingertips over the corpses cheek one of my rings had cut him the cut had a nasty color i looked at my hand so did morley the poison chamber on one of the rings had been torn open by the force of the blow well have to get rid of him morley said fast before somebody stumbles in here ill get the rig you drag them to the side so they dont get run over he ran away as fast as he could i wondered if i would see him again it might be in his interest to find a back way out and just keep on going he returned but it seemed like hed been gone for about twenty hours he tied off the traces and clambered into the back of the rig hoist him up here i hoisted morley pulled when the cadaver was in morley set it up with its back against the drivers seat people will see him you just worry about driving ill handle this ive done it before i had done my share of driving that day horses and i can enjoy an armed truce while they are in harness but this was too grand an opportunity for that devil tribe to revert to the war rules youd better handle the traces ill be busy back here get moving before somebody comes or the other one wakes up i climbed up and took the traces were just a bunch of guys out on the town dont hurry but get us out of this section fast make up your mind i snapped but i knew what he meant at first morley sat back with his arm around his buddy slurring some song so thickly that garrett could only understand about every third word later he started cussing the corpse out telling him what a fool damned nogood he was for getting blasted before the sun even went down you ought to be ashamed of yourself what am i going to tell your old lady howre we supposed to have any fun dragging you around you ought to be ashamed later still once we were in an area where a bunch of drunks in a carriage were as unusual as eggs under a hen morley stopped rambling and asked who were those guys garrett any idea no think it was a robbery you know better the place the timing the behavior of that clerk the disappearance of the guard from out front all say it wasnt off the stripedsail ship one of them went to the hall i doubt it only a local could set up something like that so fast weve obviously stepped on a toe somewhere why my guess is it was a warning whipping a saucerhead job pound us around awhile then tell us to take the next boat home but we blew up in their hands thats what i figure then the real questions are who sent them and why do we make him nervous him i dont think we need to count the old witch do you no nor the church people probably i guess well have to find out who zeck zack is too bad we cant ask this guy here you checked him dry as a bone its time we started thinking about how to break up the party we cant dump him in the drink here after dark marines watch the shores like hawks in case venageti agents try to sneak in they never catch anybody but that doesnt stop them i did my share of watching in my time i was very young and very serious about it my successors would be just as young and just as serious morley saidfind the busiest sleaziest cathouse you can we go in drunk with him between us we find a dark corner in the waiting room squat order drinks for three tell the madam not to bother our buddy because hes dead drunk take our turns at the trade then get out they wont bother him till the crowd thins out because theyll want to roll him by then theyll have forgotten us and hell be their problem suppose we run into somebody who knows him there are risks in everything if we dump him here in an alley whoever sent him will know what happened my way hell have to wonder that was blockshaush in the ring wasnt it he used the elvish name for the poison on our side of the line we call it black sauce yes good by the time his boss finds him itll be too late for even a master wizard to tell he was poisoned he sounded very thoughtful i knew what he was thinking he was wondering what other uncharacteristic surprises i had in store he was thinking i was tight with the dead man and that was probably why i was carrying poison he was wondering just how much and what kind of advice the dead man had given me i figured a little worry would do him good it might take his mind off his stomach for a while we ditched our friend morleys way i expected tribes of his buddies to swarm but it came off smooth the guys boss would never really know what had happened who was his boss why did he want to discourage me from doing my job i packed a lunch knowing it would be a long day of runaround at the military city hall because they would not let morley in i told him to go find out what he could about zeck zack the triplets i sent to watch incoming harbor traffic again but be careful i told dojango they might decide to take you in to ask if youre venageti spies actually that possibility occurred to us yesterday dojango told me weve lived on the fringes of the law long enough to know when were pushing our luck maybe so maybe so i hefted my picnic basket and went to work first there was a clerk then a senior clerk then various sergeants followed by a couple of lieutenants who gave me to a captain who admitted he did not think i would have much luck before he dropped me in the lap of a major one and all checked my bona fides before sending me on sometimes twice i kept a smile on my mug stayed polite and kept my tongue on a tight rein i could play the game i figured i would earn every mark i would gouge from tate for that day besides it was all part of the plan outlast the bastards the major was halfway human and he even looked like he might have a sense of humor he apologized for the shuffle and i offered to share my lunch you packed a lunch sure ive dealt with the army before if it was something complicated i would have brought a blanket and an overnight bag you get in the craw of the system and stay there disturbing routine somebody is going to go out on a limb take a chance tell you what you want to know or make a decision to throw you out just to get you out from under foot i get paid exorbitantly for letting people give me the runaround so i dont mind for a moment i thought i had misjudged him he was not pleased kneejerk response give him credit he gave it a think before he came back youre a cynic arent you occupational hazard the people i meet leave my faith in human nature mostly negative right lets try again with the understanding that ill be the man who ends your quest with an answer or by having you booted out you want some way of getting in touch with major kayeth kronk cavalryman the only one of the womans family of whom i have been able to catch wind i want to ask if he knows where i can get in touch with his sister the simple obvious thing for the army to do is tell me hes out at fort whatever id go interview him but it wont work that way the army will act on the perfectly reasonable assumption that the entire venageti war council has been holding its collective breath for years waiting to discover the majors whereabouts so any communications will have to be managed the hard way you are a cynic im also right not so probably whats your hard way i write him a long letter explaining the situation and asking him to meet me here or if thats impossible to respond to a list of questions the weakness of the method is that i end up having to trust the army both to deliver the letter and to get the reply back to me my cynical side tells me that thats too much to expect he looked at me from a face of stone he knew i was setting him up for something and was trying to figure out how i was boxing him in thats probably the best youll get if that it isnt the armys problem but we do help with family matters where we can any help i get will be appreciated even if it isnt much help he had not figured any angles yet which might mean that he did not know how a headquarters really worked ill check with my boss you check with me tomorrow morning just to be safe bring your letter with you unsealed but ready to go that took care of the aboveboard i figured id been around long enough and had explained my problem to enough people for the word to have spread throughout the headquarters so i thanked the major shook his hand and said i would be heading back to my inn did he want to keep the rest of the lunch no i dawdled through hallways i loitered in corners finally he found me he being the first staffer to convince himself that i was not a venageti agent and therefore safe and therefore maybe he could pick up a small gratuity by telling me where i could find the man i wanted that had been the whole point of taking the runaround fort caprice i asked back he nodded i crossed his palm with silver we both got out of there i went off disappointed major kronk did not at least now belong to the same outfit that denny and his buddies had dojango and his brothers got back to the inn before i did when i arrived they were eating like they meant to use up my expense money before the end of the week dojango reportednothing to report actually nothing came in today but we did bribe a piermaster to let us go down there mornings and wait for the rest of our family to arrive quite a coup i thought actually quite a coup i agreed i forbore asking where they had gotten the wherewithal to grease a piermaster nothing about those boys was going to surprise me anymore and i have yet to report half their tricks morley wandered in an hour after i did any luck garrett i found out where her brother is stationed you some zeck zack an interesting character nothing secretive about him supposedly everybody knows him nothing obvious to connect him with your kronk people hes a centaur an auxiliary veteran who was given citizenship for his service hes some sort of middleman between the centaur tribes and the merchants of full harbor the darkest rumor about him is that he indulges in a little night trading he likes to play with human women the bigger and fatter the better cant hang a guy for that i said demonstrating my vast tolerance lucky me as proven by the prevalence of accidents like morley and his buddies crossrace contact is a sport too popular for us to go lynching the players morley went onhe does own the house but hes never there because hes never in the city but theres more oh you have a gleam in your eye probably because i finally found a decent place to eat and got a wholesome meal inside me no its more an i know something you dont kind of gleam youve got me but he sat on it till i threatened to take him for a boat ride all right yesterday somebody decided we were too snoopy and deserved a thumping had those guys on to us before we started we bumped a sore tooth somewhere unless our friends from the stripedsail ship were behind it or vasco is in town without us knowing it i added that too but i thought id start with the folks wed talked to the downlane neighbor and old witch no chance the guy at zeck zacks surly as hell no help maybe but i couldnt be sure i bribed the vermin to keep an eye on the place so come on you went to the church i asked around before i dropped in you remember what you said about the gold and silver yes that church was inside venageti lines for thirteen days afterward the sair was praised for talking the venageti into sparing the church then he and his flock talked the army into releasing a hundred twenty prisoners of war as a counter gesture everyone thinks hes a great man full of compassion for the enemies of his church i already knew but he wanted me to ask so i did but you know different eh what do you know morley a third of those soldiers he sent home all supposedly common infantry were venageti officers who could have been ransomed or put to the question they surrendered at the church after exchanging uniforms with dead soldiers at the order of the chief venageti undercover agent in full harbor the sair you got it you go on like you were there i talked to somebody who was i raised an eyebrow i do that very well its one of my outstanding talents i took father mike for a walk after i assured him that i have no interest in politics and would not use what he told me against him he told me about it hes the old boys helper are all the priests in on it just the two the old boy sent the others to safety when the venageti began closing in i guess you can figure why fewer witnesses so the old boy sicced the dogs on us because he thought we might dig something up on him no wait a minute father mike was very positive who then if you eliminate everybody always room for another player in the game i didnt get to talk to the hairy priest nor to anybody the others mentioned us to and everybody admitted they did though they couldnt remember to who except that crazy witch and at her place we had the vermin listening in theres no telling who they reported to yeah this needed some thought youve still got the gleam in your eye you must have gotten around like a bolt of lightning us breeds can move when we need to hybrid vigor so your friend kronk died at that church the day it was liberated father mike was vague about details kronk was one of the dozen partisans the venageti took prisoner father mike didnt think he knew about him and the sair but he could have he doesnt think kronk was killed while the venageti were still in control the body wasnt found till six hours after the army moved in but two others died at the same time i have the names of the surviving prisoners if you decide to go howling off down that path thats not what im here to do but give me the names and well keep them in mind in case we keep stumbling over some of them i see the gleam has gone out does that mean the well is dry yes what now now i write a long letter to major kronk for another majors benefit while all this information simmers marinates you mean im sure youll soak your brain in a few gallons of beer i did not feel up to repartee too much to digest tomorrow morning i see my major then we do a few more interviews if we dont strike something hot the day after were off into the cantard maybe we can bribe a priest to pray for a break morley said im here but im not thrilled about going out there and i am there were breaks they were mixed to say the least i went to see my major right after i breakfasted three eggs gently fried in the grease of a half pound of bacon slowly cooked to a crisp a mountain of griddle cakes on the side heavily buttered and buried in strawberry jam morley was despondent he began holding a wake for my health he went out when i did on the trail of roots and berries barks and grasses that would hold still long enough for him to prey upon them the triplets headed for the waterfront to wait for their relatives i sincerely hoped they had none anywhere i figured my luck was running so hot a platoon would descend on me like orphans left on the church steps i didnt have to wait long or put up with much before i was told i could see the major my outlook began to improve the major took my message after a rudimentary greeting checked it for messages to the venageti war council saidthis looks acceptable it will go out in the next courier pouch headed the right direction not going to test for invisible ink he gave me one of those good hard stares they practice in front of the mirror when theyre shavetails i let it slide off youre cocky today arent you its a personality defect i spent five years on the inside of the service its hard to take it seriously when it doesnt have a noose around your neck do you really care if your letter gets delivered i didnt tell him i never expected it to get beyond the nearest trash receptacle he gave me a reassuring pat on the shoulder and said dont bother us anymore well let you know when theres an answer i couldnt tell him id brought it in only for forms sake but he could figure that out for himself i see that you dont care about this letter someone on the staff obviously took pity and told you for a suitably warm expression of gratitude i remained silent i see he said i thought so you neednt be surprised not only can a few of us think therere some mostly majors and colonels who can figure out how to lace their own boots in the morning but i wont ask you about it if youll answer a few questions about something else why say im looking for a fresh viewpoint on something shoot ill start with a list of names when you hear one you know tell me what you know about him or her thats all for now go ahead i scored three and a half out of maybe thirty one was zeck zack one was a venageti commander my outfit had fought in the islands who later participated in the attack upon full harbor the third was a dwarfish sharpie who had been executed for misappropriation fraud and profiteering which basically meant he had gotten caught stealing from the army without paying kickbacks to the right officers the half was a name i knew i had heard somewhere sometime but could not remember where or when or in connection with what as far as i knew zeck zack was the only character there who was still alive i lied about recognizing one more name that of a man who had been imprisoned with klaus kronk the day he had died is that all i could see no connection among the names on the list maybe there was none really or maybe it would have been obvious to someone who knew who the hell all those people were just about you seem to be what you pretend youve been doing a lot of poking around have you stumbled across anything that might interest a man in my position he assumed i knew what his position was i did now no i lied i had figured to do my patriotic duty by reporting the sair sometime after arriving i had made an unconscious decision to pass would you consider doing a little work for karenta while youre doing the job you have already wouldnt cost you much time and shouldnt take you out of your way no he looked like he wanted to argue i did my socalled patriotic chore i declared five years of my life making sure their gang of thieves didnt get one up on our gang of thieves there is no way im getting onto that treadmill again a thought occurred to me that happens occasionally he saw it spark yes i might work a trade i had the priest to sell if you tell me where to find kayean kronk i cant oh i never heard of her till you came in yesterday shes no one whos ever interested this office i guess thats that then thanks for your time and courtesy i headed for the door garrett drop by when you get back from fort he glared at me like id almost tricked him into revealing the emperors secret name drop by when you get back we may have a story or two to swap all right i got out before he decided to look at me a little closer it was too nice a morning just to head for the inn to pick up morley so we could visit the civil city hall again it seemed a day made for lying around sniffing a clean seabreeze i headed for the waterfront the triplets probably needed help watching for their relatives anyway they would be so hard to spot i found them doing exactly what i planned to do sprawled in the sun atop a mountain of army grain sacks awaiting transport to the forts in the cantard id never have spotted them from the harbor side i clambered up with a cold keg under my arm i sent it around once before i asked hows it going dojango any sign of the family the keg was half weight by the time it got back to me i took a good long guzzle before i passed it on actually garrett your timing is perfect come here he drew on the keg before he moved they had shifted a few sacks so they formed a parapet of sorts they could watch from concealment yet could claim the shifted sacks made pillows for the grolls if anybody asked some of your cousins i think actually a ragged old coaster lay about thirty feet in the lee of the only pier space available lee was the very operative word the ship was taking the breeze on her beam about fifty guys were pulling on hawsers trying to haul her in she was not coming in fact she was winning the tugofwar why dont i go trade this empty in on a full keg dojango asked yeah why dont you i gave him some money a guy could work up a powerful thirst watching that much grunting and cursing and sweating and yelling for help the ship was interesting because vasco quinn and some other old friends were stomping around her deck in a storm of frustration i thought about canceling fort caprice and just watching them instead on the chance they would lead me to kayean i looked at that from a couple of angles then rejected it they had not come to full harbor to see kayean they had come to keep me from seeing her i studied the stripedsail for a while it seemed deserted except for the short and wide thing who was napping in the shade cast by the low sterncastle dojango arrived with the keg we soon had another dead soldier dojango ventured the suggestion that we send for reinforcements again i sadly fear we have to go to work do your cousins know your brothers not by sight actually but they must know youre traveling with grolls they arent the only grolls in the world i stripped down while i explained what i wanted to do i think its insane actually but it might be fun to watch his part would be to observe and guard the valuables tell the boys below a gust caught the coaster she heeled men yelled four or five went into the water they know what to do lets go i tumbled down the front of the pile doris and marsha tumbled after me grinning their great goofy groll grins they trotted to the ends of a couple of hawsers and started heaving i grabbed another i wish i could say my strength made the difference that coaster fought like a granddaddy trout but in she came vasco and quinn must have gotten my stage directions they spotted me as the dock hands started swarming around doris and marsha trying to slap their backs somebody yelled i faked big eyes as men came leaping onto the wharf i lit out i did not see dojango atop the sack pile as i raced past that meant nothing had changed at the stripedsail ship i whipped that way with a herd of boots pounding behind me hard right turn onto the yachts gangway short wide and hideous opened his eyes and hit his feet i made the deck before he could head me off then he spotted the pack behind me he stopped i did not i pulled straight ahead and dove over the far rail i groaned on the way down the water was so slimy id be lucky if i didnt bounce we joined up again back at the inn after i ordered a keg to celebrate dojango told me what he had seen vasco quinn and four others had chased me that i did not need to be told they had started up the gangway when they had spotted short wide and hideous they had stopped dead then they had scattered like roaches surprised by a sudden light they didnt even go back to their boat for their stuff dojango said he laughed and drew himself another beer what about the guy on the yacht what did he do he ran inside and and nothing actually nothing happened at all something will i prophesied we killed the keg while we waited for morley morley was a long time showing when he did i knew he had not been running from anything unless it was himself he wasnt scared of anything else a little trot to settle your meal i asked started out that way i came back here you werent in yet so i thought id get in five or ten miles while i had time ive gotten out of training since we left tunfaire he seemed a little pallid for morley dotes something happen you get yourself into trouble not exactly let me catch my breath tell me what you did i did he seemed mildly amused by my gambit on the waterfront your turn i said first a conclusion then two sets of facts which may support it my conclusion is youre in over your head garrett we keep cutting the trails of people with big clout and theyre starting to notice and the facts my run took me out near the narrows i decided to see if my tribute to the vermin had earned me anything but scorn wonder of wonders they had something zeck zack is back in town he arrived early this morning the comings and goings started an hour later i gave them a bonus and told them to keep an eye on him one set of facts morley how about the set that has you spooked he did not argue which was proof enough that he was nervous i decided to drop in on father rhyne i figured id go in the back way so i wouldnt inconvenience anybody what with a rowdy service going on in the main hall he was stalling getting to the point which meant it was something that did not please him he came up dead garrett sitting at his writing table dead as a man can get still not cold killed i dont know i didnt see any wounds but that leaves plenty of room plenty of room for sorcery or poison he didnt seem like the kind of guy who drops dead coincidentally after people come around asking questions that only he can answer especially when you consider the fact that his boss and father mike have turned ghost he meant they had vanished when sometime after breakfast the prune was at first services father mike was at breakfast when i mentioned to somebody that father rhyne didnt look too healthy neither of them could be found nobody saw them leave maybe they decided they couldnt trust you not to be a tattletale maybe father rhyne did try to leave a message however he died i dont know who he meant it for but since youre looking for a married woman i grabbed it he gave me a wad of paper i smoothed it out on the table there were just two words on it printed big in a very shaky hand blood wedding what does that mean i dont know garrett i do know this rhyne was number four theyre dropping like flies around us he was right four deaths three of them on the manslaughter level the burglar in dennys apartment uncle lester and the thug from the alley beside the civil city hall and now one unexplained it does seem that way any change in plans no lets go see the boys at city hall inspired by a silver memoryjostle the guard outside frankly admitted that he had been paid to disappear for an hour he gave us an excellent description of an ordinary guy who could have been right there on the street with us i suspected he was the guy who had gotten away in the alley the clerk was not pleased to see us in fact he tried to take a sudden unauthorized leave of absence morley was on him like a wolf on a rabbit we took the committee into the records room to confer he claimed almost as much ignorance as the guard but he said they had come to see him again awhile after we busted up the ambush to ask about us the clerk said they talked it over and decided we were not the people they had expected confederates of a man who had been there earlier they had jumped the wrong people so who the hell were we the words investigators from tunfaire had done nothing to cheer them up we turned him loose then and headed for the inn he wasnt coming across with everything i said hes on somebodys pad hes more scared of them than he ever could be of us we roomed in what could hardly be classified as a room it was a converted stable attached to the inn it was not elegant which was why we spent a lot of time in the common room we took it because it was the only place the grolls could quarter comfortably that night we retreated there earlier than usual none of us being in the mood for the jostle of the evening trade when all the neighbors came to guzzle and swap lies besides i wanted to get an early start in the morning i still had to turn the carriage in and pick up mounts the rest of our outfitting we had managed to get in whenever we were not off chasing chimeras it looked like a quiet evening not even dojango felt much like talking he had a hangover and morley wouldnt let him near any hair of the dog breeds just dont handle their alcohol well a subtle change in the roar from the common room caught my ear though i couldnt pin down exactly what it was morley caught it too he cocked an ear frowned dojango see whats happening dojango went out he was back in about four blinks six guys rousting the innkeeper they want you and garrett actually they look plenty bad too morley morley grunted then he grumbled and growled and snarled and barked in grollish doris and marsha sat down on either side of the door several feet away dojango came over and got behind morley morley told me lets get as far from the door as we can give them plenty of room to come in if they come the grolls skins began changing color they faded into the landscape i didnt know they could do that they dont brag about it ready dojango i need a drink actually i need one bad actually youll be all right kaboom the door exploded inward and a couple of saucerhead tharpe types came mincing after it their fearless leader followed a rear guard of three more muscle wads came in after him the storm troops spread out so the boss could eyeball us from between them he stopped he didnt like what he saw we were waiting for him morley said a few words doris and marsha growled back our guests looked around one of them said oh shit morley smiled at the head invader and asked shall we go ahead with it then uh we just dropped in to deliver a message how thoughtful i said what was it so long you each had to memorize a whole word and dont you guys find all that wood and iron a little encumbering the streets arent safe at night ill bet they arent it isnt that safe inside some places either dont overdo it morley told me whats the message i doubt theres much point my delivering it considering the circumstances but i insist here i am visiting a strange city where i didnt think i knew anyone and someone is sending me greetings its exciting and im curious dojango go get a keg and some mugs so we can entertain properly dojango gave our visitors a wide berth leaving they did nothing after he left i guess the shift in odds wasnt encouraging i rescued a small philter packet from my duffelwhat was that message again the voice seemed small for the man when he saidget out of full harbor if i have cause to get in touch with you again youre dead thats not what id call neighborly and he doesnt bother to say who he is or why hes concerned for my health or even if ive done something to offend he began to simmer despite the situation morley was right a slice too much dojango came with the keg and mugs tap it friend id like to talk to a man so interested in me hed send you around just to find out why if nothing else who sent you he set his jaw id expected that i opened the packet id gotten and tapped bits of its contents into the heads of the beers dojango drew this is a harmless spice guaranteed to put an elephant out for ten hours and a man for twentyfour i gestured dojango got hold of his nerve and took a mug to a man near one of the grolls the thug refused to take it morley barked something marsha or doris snagged man and mug and put the contents of one inside the other with less trouble than a mother getting milk down a toddler then he stripped the thug to the altogether and tossed him out our only window if the man had any sense at all he would get himself hidden fast before the drug took hold folks in full harbor have very strong feelings about public nudity caught he could end up spending the rest of his life in the cantard mines the rest of the muscle decided it was time to go the other groll held the door until his brother came to help after things settled down i asked who sent you youre a dead man a thought which will comfort and warm you during those long nights in the mines i gave dojango another mug this time the other groll took a turn feeding baby i keep going till i get that name youre last if i have to do you you get a short dose just enough to make you forget who and where you are but not enough to put you down so you dont go wandering into trouble for heavens sake switz one of the thugs said as i handed dojango another mug we arent getting paid enough for this hes got us by the balls shut up another said you aint going to see me in no mines shut up it can be fixed bull you know damned well he wouldnt bother hed say we deserved it he dont have that kind of pull anyway shut up one of the grolls snagged the loudest complainer wait a goddamned minute he yelled at me it was zeck zack that sent us i was startled i made use of my reaction who the hell is zeck zack fearless leader groaned morley gestured the grolls put our man down but did not turn him loose i said we wont be sending the rest of you after all but im still going to need you sleeping set yourselves down someplace comfortable well serve up the brew the leader saidyoure dead meat trask i bet ill last longer than you the other thug replied while they bickered i got everything settled i got the three to drink their beer we settled back for a listen to our songbird one thing he said the first guy you threw out hes my brother you get him back in here or i dont say nothing morley morley sent dojango and doris trask was able to tell us almost nothing we didnt already know he had no idea why zeck zack wanted us thumped and run out of town he had not seen the centaur only switz saw or heard from zeck zack he didnt know if the centaur was in town or not probably not because he almost never was i asked a lot of questions and got almost nothing more zeck zack shielded his infantry from troublesome knowledge about himself you kept your part of the bargain with one proviso that benefited your brother the brother was back inside and redressed sloppily so ill keep mine with a proviso that will benefit me dojango is going to tie you up just tightly enough so it will take you a couple of hours to get loose when you do take your brother and get lost dojango did the honors he had been sneaking some off the keg and was getting braver by the minute not bad for improvisation morley said yeah thought so myself what now we strip the other three and dump them where theyre sure to get got then we go see a centaur named zeck zack morley didnt like it but he went along he was making top money and staying out of the hands of his creditors and what more could a guy want cabbages and cattail hearts morley led the way down the old path from the cemetery to the house i knew the trail but he had the night eyes each fifty paces he stopped and asked the darkness hornbuckle he didnt get an answer until we neared the waking radius of the peafowl i was amazed by the grails for all their height and mass they moved through the woods with more stealth than a human sit morley said when tittering answered him at last we sat diminutive forms pranced around and among us morley gave each a piece of sugar candy the most certain bribe there is they wanted more he promised it if they scattered to do our scouting for us ill bet morley hated himself he certainly looked disgusted as he tucked the rest of the candy inside his shirt i asked can we trust them not much but they want the rest of the candy i dont plan to run out till were on our way again after that we stayed quiet waiting i got itchy between the shoulder blades that feeling you get when someone is watching or you think someone is that scalawag hornbuckle flipped morley a mock salute how many four two humans very nervous one centaur worried and grumpy one other theyre awaiting a report from someone and that someone is late sugar not yet are there wardspells alarms booby traps dangerous guard animals none any reason for us to fear they are wicked creatures all silence the peafowl so we can pass sugar all the sugar i have when we come out you might not get out why not titter they are wicked creatures very wicked especially one all right morley took out his candy one piece for you a half piece for each of your friends the rest if we come out tell me the best way to get to them their boy switz did it to us so we did it to them kaboom one groll after another went through the huge double doors of the ballroom then morley then me then dojango to guard our rear it was thoughtful of them to have waited in the only room where the grolls would have space to maneuver the ceilings were eighteen feet high they scattered like squeaking mice when the cat pounces doris and marsha each snagged a man morley streaked between them pursuing a shadowy something that crashed through a window at the far end of the ballroom where the hell was the centaur there he was a onecritter cavalry charge i managed a leg whip that tangled some fetlocks or forelocks or whatever theyre called it was a sin what his hooves did to the carpets and flooring impetus flung me against something made of mahogany or teak very hard and very immovable i practiced exhaling a bushel more air than any human being normally inhales somebody was hollering help morley i got him morley help i staggered to my feet dojango had him all right zeck zack was about average for his tribe about the size of a small pony he was not built to carry a hundred thirty pounds of dojango on his back his problem was complicated by dojango having his arms and legs wrapped around his skinny chest he couldnt breathe he staggered around banging into things then went down on his knees i got a choke rope on him pried dojango loose then looked around the grolls had their men subdued morley was coming back from the window emptyhanded and looking puzzled i caught my breath straightened my clothing and led zeck zack into a better light where morley patted him down for hardware and other lethal surprises the centaur remained glassyeyed what happened i asked morley i dont know i got there three seconds after it went through the glass and there was nothing not a sign of it what was it i cant even tell you that i never got a good look the grolls brought the two men over and plunked them down on the floor they were in a playful mood after events at the inn they had plucked these birds too did you see me morley dojango bubbled did you see me i mean actually i took the damned thing down did you see me morley yes i saw shut up dojango morley seemed troubled he kept looking toward the broken window well youve got him garrett are you going to do something with him yeah all right i looked at zeck zack i have a problem mr zeck centaurs stick their family names up front figuring their antecedents are more important people keep trying to whip me and i cant figure out why zeck zack had nothing to say hed heard me though all right im going to tell you a story then you can tell me one if i like yours we can part as friends still no reaction i had a feeling zeck zack was tough and had been through the narrow passage before he was cool enough he would do what had to be done once upon a time up north a guy died he left everything to a gal he knew when he was in the army his father hired me to come find her and see if she wanted the legacy a simple job a kind i do all the time only this time i get people ambushing me and sending thugs to work me over and nobody anywhere giving me a straight answer so you might say im a little fussed i gave him a chance to comment he did not i hadnt thought he would people are trying to push me so now im pushing back im asking questions i want answers whats with this woman kayean thats worth knocking heads he had nothing to say whats in this to die for are you ready to die for it i got a reaction that time just a flicker around the eyes he didnt think i looked the killer type but he didnt know me so couldnt be sure hes starting to listen garrett morley said but we ought to convene this somewhere else the one that got away could bring reinforcements i have faith in sugar as an alarm potential you know anything about centaurs ive never dealt with one a little theyre vain avaricious mean in most senses of the word miserly overall not much to recommend did i mention that most of them are thieves and liars where are their pressure points did i mention cowardly youre on the right track with that rope strangle him slowly hell come across i dont want to do it the hard way nobodys been hurt yet id rather talk work something out where we could get off each others backs and get on with finding the woman im tired of this job too many people are interested in us and i dont know why zeck zack sort of nibbled at the bait he spoke for the first time piping i almost laughed at his voice can you prove youre what you say you are if you were nothing more there would be no difficulty between us a wedge morley told dojango tie up those guys so doris and marsha can have their hands free one of the two was the greeter who had thought we were hilarious gagsters he looked the worse for wear the grolls helped form a circle around zeck zack once they were free of their babysitting chores i handed over every piece of documentation i had he examined it all minutely meanwhile morley got antsy zeck zack said this is all silly enough to be true ill give you the benefit of the doubt for the moment morley said garrett were running out of time choke him that would do you no good zeck zack said i might tell you many interesting things but i would tell you nothing of value my position is exposed therefore i am allowed to know nothing of importance however i do know one thing of value to you if you are what you say you are i waited i know someone who knows someone who could bring you facetoface with the woman yeah did i mention treacherous morley asked one more test of sorts zeck zack said i will recite a list of names phrases places you tell me if you know or have heard of them i have an ear for the truth ive lied successfully to men who thought that many times go ahead i scored a mere one half on this one the same half i scored on the army list zeck zack was amazed by what he heard with his ear for the truth you could just be what you say he gave me a squinteyed look yes it might even make sense i think i know what is happening it should be put to the test he did some thinking the rest of us did some waiting morley with very poor grace zeck zack askedwhere can i leave you a message i used my best raised eyebrow not trusting me you will of course remove from your present lodgings i will not possess sufficient manpower to locate you again quickly i am going to attempt to arrange for you to see the woman and complete your mission if i am successful i must be able to get that word to you i had a strong feeling he meant to do just what he said though not out of any inclination to make my life easier he had motives i couldnt fathom everyone but me seemed to have shadowed motives the innkeeper where were staying now well leave him feeling kindly toward us i removed the choke rope im going to play a hunch a long shot and take a chance on you centaur maybe because im getting desperate if youve been bullshitting me to get your behind out of a bind or if youre planning on taking another crack at me you have a problem indeed i do as i said i am exposed and vulnerable as you have demonstrated tonight i thought i would leave everything on that very unsatisfactory note morley who had been eager to evacuate some time ago now jumped all over me for wasting half a night come on morley its time to go we sat on a patch of grass not far from the witchs house surrounded by little folk stoned on sugar only a couple were sober enough to titter occasionally morley had turned from argumentative to reflective you know what made it interesting garrett that list sixteen items but six of them were the same thing a name translated into six different languages curious especially because it isnt a name either of us recognizes in any of its forms what was that he rattled off a jawbreaker id give you the karentine but it wouldnt make any sense try it anyway karentine is all i speak therere two possible translations dawn of nights mercy or dawn of nights madness that doesnt make sense i told you it wouldnt what language uses the same word for mercy and madness dark elfin oh i glanced toward the centaurs house not a thing had happened since our departure i looked at the witchs place a light burned in an upperstory window it hadnt been burning when wed come down the path why dont you guys head on up to the cemetery ill catch up in a few minutes theres something i want to check out i expected morley to give me an argument he didnt he just grunted got to his feet got the triplets moving and vanished into the night somebody small with a mansized grin had passed out leaning against me i tilted him over gently patted his shoulder when he mumbled something rose and headed for the house i prowled around looking into windows im up here private garrett good i was hoping to see you but i was a little leery of waking you i couldnt see her she laughed her laughter was mostly merriment but it also carried a trace of mockery she didnt believe me but she knew i didnt expect her to how can i help you private garrett you could start by not calling me private garrett im out of the marines id just as soon forget them then you can tell me if you know anything about somebody named dawn of nights mercy or dawn of nights madness she was silent so long i feared she had deserted me then she threw down the dark elvish gobblewhat morley had used applying a distinctly interrogative inflection thats right gobblewhat is not a person mr garrett it is a prophecy and an unpleasant one from your point of view the name gobblewhat is dark elfin but the prophecy is not it is an echo a rumor an aspiration out of a deeper night being what she was she naturally stoked the drama on her declamation then clammed up leaving her answer obscure i tried asking questions that was a waste of time she was done talking about gobblewhat she closed the subject by saying that was spur of the moment what did you really want there was no point playing games are you still in business id like to buy a few of your special tools she ripped off a firstclass witchs cackle it was hilarious i grinned the peafowl even got into the act though their mirth was confused and sleepy go around to the front door she told me youll find it unlocked when i rejoined morley and the triplets i carried five tiny folded pieces of paper i had hidden each carefully each bore a potent and potentially useful spell i was still repeating the witchs instructions to myself basically all i had to remember was to unfold the papers at the appropriate moment though a couple required a whispered word at the right time morley said so you survived the trail i was about to go looking for you what now we go back and get what sleep we can then early tomorrow we hit the road for fort caprice i thought you were going to let the centaur do the finding for you contrary to the false notion formed earlier i dont trust him to do anything if he comes through fine meantime i go on looking he expects us to hide from him i cant think of a better place than out in the cantard two birds one stone morley was as thrilled as i might have expected i had to ask didnt i fort caprice was a bust it was four days out of full harbor pushing hard all the way shielded every step by more luck than any five fools deserved not only did we not encounter one of our own karentine patrols but we didnt fall in with venageti rangers or representatives of any of the nonhuman races of the cantard most of which are at least marginally involved in the war their loyalties shift like a chameleons color according to where they think the most profit lies fort caprice was not in the heart of the caldron though the richest silver country lay a hundred miles farther south major kayeth kronk proved to be brevetcolonel kronk now at the tender age of twentysix i did not remind him that we had met before though im sure he remembered me before we reached the end of our short interview i told him i was looking for his sister kayean and told him why and he told me that he didnt have a sister kayean and that was all he would say about it when i kept after him he got stubborn then he got mad and had a couple of soldiers show me the street we poked around among the hangerson fort caprice had acquired like fleas ticks and worms to a hound and found out nothing more interesting than which men were watering their wine and which women would send you away with something you hadnt had when you arrived so we made the fourday journey back to full harbor with fools luck cleansing the way ahead of us again it was a lovely time to visit the cantard i hoped the centaur would come through so i wouldnt have to do it again that would be tempting fate a bit too far we were out of full harbor nine days all told the major from the military city hall was waiting at the gate through the narrows wall there was nothing magical about it once i realized that without sorcery a trip to fort caprice takes a predictable amount of time he cut me out of my herd any luck he asked zip zero zilch what can i do for you i have another list of names and getting my reaction is important enough for you to lay in wait for me out here maybe fire away he did i knew five of the twelve names this time father mike father rhyne sair lojda martello quinn and aben kurts of dennys old crowd i admitted knowing the latter two only as friends of a friend saying i thought they were in shipping then i asked what ties this together whats up all these people and three more for whom we have no names have died or disappeared during the last eleven days im certain you would recognize more if you saw them imelo clark was a guard at the civil city hall egan rust was a clerk there you interviewed them i was not sure you had any connection with kurts and quinn but since you did then i assume theres also one with laught and the three unknowns all of whom seem to have come off a yacht from tunfaire what the hell are you trying to say dont get your hackles up garrett youre safe you were out of town during the excitement in fact the only time i place you or yours near anyone at a critical time is father rhyne im satisfied your associate found him dead i didnt say anything my thoughts were pounding off in twenty directions what the hell was going on it seems apparent that in most of these cases someone is cleaning up after you its a wonder you havent been turned invisible yourself thoughtlessly i admitted its been tried a couple times he wanted details he demanded details i gave him some without mentioning centaurs or dead men or much else that would do him any real good he thought it was crafty of us setting the one group up for a career in the mines he observed i have a feeling that there are a lot of things you wouldnt tell me no matter how nicely i ask like where the others from tunfaire fit in i wouldnt be even a little shy about telling you that if i knew whats the story on them anyway kurts and quinn had died the evening we left full harbor they had been found in an alley on the far south side at first it had looked like they had fallen foul of robbers laught identified because his name and that of the yacht were stitched on the inside of his jumper died later that night in the graveyard where kayean and i had played when we were kids at almost the same time a tremendous explosion and fire had consumed the yacht no one knew how many had died in that the unburned remains of the yacht had sunk it was a miracle the whole waterfront hadnt gone up thats pretty rough stuff i said the stakes must be big i dont want to sound dumb or impertinent but whats your interest seems to me its a civil problem gaudy as it is full harbors reason for existing is military anything gaudy could effect the citys military situation garrett im convinced you know things i want to know but im not going to press you when you feel like baring your soul drop in and ill trade you the name of the man she married meantime ill just use you as a stalking horse yeah i waved byebye but my heart was not in it i was pondering that equinederived chestnut morley and the triplets joined me who was that morley asked i told him he asked he have anything interesting to say i told him all that too gang warfare and vampires he mused what a city vampires several people claim they were attacked this week its all the talk you know how those stories get going people will see vampires in every shadow for a month we slept at the same inn we couldnt be safer elsewhere and the quarters were the best available for grolls the innkeeper had five messages for me they were from zeck zack had come at a rate of one daily and had become increasingly strident i got the impression he wanted to see me tomorrow is soon enough i told morley tonight im going to lay around and ruminate and drink beer to get the cantard dust out of my throat im not much closer to the woman but im starting to see the outlines of the other stuff except for vasco and his crowd i dont think it has anything to do with silver i think three or four conspiracies with completely alien or only marginally overlapping goals have collided here maybe with the woman being the link i dont think im the only one going around wondering who the hell are those guys what do they want i let it go there morley could chew on it if he wanted i snuggled up with my beer and tried to let my mind go blank some might say i did not have to work very hard zeck zack turned up next day he got righteous with me do i work for you i asked he looked around a lot of unfriendly faces were turned his way centaurs are not popular which is probably why zeck zack spent so little time at his city house he desisted though he kept simmering he handed me a sealed letter your instructions are in there you are to come alone have you been smoking weed what i dont go anywhere alone people have been dying around this town four of them right out around your place you will go alone or they will not let you see her then ill find her my own way morley walked in then coming back from grazing he slapped zeck zack across the rump a familiarity and indignity that almost sent him into paroxysms morley said there was another vampire thing last night garrett sounded like the real article remind me to wear my highcollar shirt when i go barhopping tonight his pursed lips told me he had something more on his mind but wouldnt say what until i got rid of the centaur i told zeck zack you see its dangerous to wander the streets alone i will put it to them they are going to be very irritated with both of us they have gone to a great deal of trouble to make the woman available but perhaps for that reason they will accede to your petition i did my eyebrow trick my petition right check it out you know where to find me he extended a hand the instructions they will have to be changed i gave them back he left giving me a couple of dark looks he wanted me to come to the meet all by myself on the lonesome i told morley just me facetoface with them whoever they are whoever they have him peeing down his leg and he has a reputation for being a tough bastard i noticed he had a case of nerves whats up the place is being watched somebody followed me out and back i didnt give it a good scout because i didnt want them to know theyd been made but i spotted two more i figured thats iceberg damn the works a whole crew and now they know im dealing with zeck zack spilled milk who do you figure for it that army bastard i dont know why vasco or the stripedsail crowd wouldnt have the resources the centaur doesnt need to know every breath we take he hopes he has us on the hook maybe the major needs a closer look maybe though i dont even know his name and id rather not id just as soon get on with the job im getting paid to do morley nodded its getting thick i find myself looking forward to the trip home in my more insane impatient moments i slouched in my seat i guess we spend the day on inandout getting a scout on how many and how good they are we can make like were getting ready for another trip out of town we can eat the food on the way home if the meet goes down and i get what i need well have to work a way for all of us to shake them too yeah this thing couldnt get any more complicated if you hired three wizards to knot it up i was wrong of course it could get more complicated and it did morley the triplets and i spent the day running the bird dogs and scoped out both daytime and nighttime routines for shaking them though it looked like there would be at least twenty of them on us around the clock it isnt hard to shake watchers when you know theyre around especially in a city as crazy as full harbor morley had gone out for supper i was having mine with dojango in the common room his brothers were in our quarters where they felt more comfortable dojango wasnt a bad sort to pass the time with if you made allowances he knew more crude stories than anyone id ever met though he didnt deliver them very well actually further complication waltzed through the door saucerhead tharpe i groaned and spiney prevallet dojango said of the guy who was the last of the four to enter doris marsha he could put a snap in his voice when he wanted it carried over the commonroom noise the two in the middle need no introduction my old flames tinnie and rose tinnie stomped past saucerhead who was giving the grolls the onceover and not liking what he saw i said i see the venageti didnt get you and i thought their sailors had an unfailing eye for the finest she halted in a widespread stance within slapping range but her fists settled on her hips youre a brassballed sonofabitch garrett you know that yeah ive heard that talk too and its true so dont think you can flatter me have a nice trip how long you been in town i kept one eye on rose who looked as vicious as an entire pack of wolves circling in for the kill saucerhead and spiney with better sense and no emotional investment put their hands in their pockets and kept them there had supper yet sit down my treat it isnt the unicorn gambit but the food sticks to your ribs you you tinnie stammered dont you sit there and act like you didnt do anything dont treat me like one of your flapping old army buddies you bastard the fire was fading from her eyes she had become conscious of the silence surrounding us of all the staring eyes and knowing smirks youre not being very ladylike i noted sit down my one true love let me ply you with food and spirits bought with uncle willards money of course its a legitimate business expense a smile flirted with her lips despite her determination to be angry she plopped into the chair morley usually inhabited dojango would you scare up enough seats for the rest of our guests he looked at me like i was crazy but he did it youre lucky you got here when you did an hour from now this place will be standing room only hello saucerhead i paid your fee against your account at morleys place all right yeah sure thats what i wanted how you doing garrett he was embarrassed to be seen in the company of two real live women what was it going to do to his reputation not so good ive fallen right into the middle of the damnedest thing i ever saw civilized behavior begets civilized behavior rose decided to play the game and was the perfect lady as dojango held her chair rose i said youre looking lovelier than ever it must be the sea air and a change of diet i looked at tinnie not roots and berries i hope tinnie winked i faced spiney prevallet mr prevallet ive heard of you but dont think weve ever met garrett no we havent ive heard of you too and that was all he had to say for the evening it was enough to set my teeth on edge his voice was neutral but as cold as the bottom side of a coffin if morley and saucerhead are the best at what they do spiney prevallet is crowding them and hes said to be less squeamish and less choosy about the jobs he takes the landlord himself came to take orders men like him have a sixth sense he wanted to size up the trouble before it happened i smiled at him a lot youve had trouble rose asked she sounded hopeful a little more youd say ive been trouble everybody i talk to turns up dead that got their attention i gave them an edited and censored account of my adventures somehow i forgot to mention zeck zack i was still talking and wondering how to get rid of them in case the centaur showed when morley walked in he never batted an eye he walked up behind rose who had her back to the door and trailed his fingertips lightly up the side of her neck a miracle i would have sworn the pirates would have tinnie cut in garrett already used that line only with him it was venageti sailors then add plagiarism to his list of sins morley placed a small box on the table before me that fourlegged wonder of a cook sent you this kelp salad since youve already eaten maybe you should save it for a snack i peeked despite his warning kelp salad all right he gave it to you to bring over he knew we had company and didnt want to intrude i dont have much use for kelp but since he went to all the trouble morley kept stroking roses neck and shoulders he nodded once to tinnie ignored spiney and saucerhead completely if as i suspected the kelp concealed zeck zacks instructions for making the meet we had a problem i expect that had morleys undivided attention did you bribe master arbanos somehow i asked tinnie that little water rat he did exactly what you told him to he handed us over to uncle willard personally im sorry i missed that youre going to get your chance to take part in a reenactment how did you manage rose saidour good uncle lester bestowed a small legacy on each of us i see women with their own money do tend to get independent dont they that box of salad sat there staring at me begging to be opened and i hadnt one idea how to get rid of them why are you here tinnie rose i understand a hundred thousand marks makes for a big greed morley was over talking to the grolls now i hoped his mind was more fertile than mine i have a grudge to settle with a certain bastard who had me tied up and shipped like a sack of turnips after he had the brassballed gall to get you out of the hands of kidnappers what can you do with a churl like that i countered she had the grace to redden morley came over and begged dojango for his seat which was next to rose with bad grace dojango gave way and joined his brothers i saw it then and morley knew when i knew he gave me the ghost of a smile and went to work charming rose dojango ducked through the door to our quarters five minutes later i developed an irresistible need for the loo i grabbed my box and promised to be right back i trickled fingers through tinnies hair she slapped my hand but it was only a pat dojango was waiting out the window night course morley says youd better read your instructions and dump them down the loo first i had that much sense i didnt figure he needed reminding though whos next morley he comes to see why youre taking so long hes worried then doris goes then me marsha stalls and distracts them by keeping them from getting through the door sounds good if it works i ambled up the lane toward the orthodox cemetery where we were to meet at the kronk family plot convenient that zeck zack or his messenger was supposed to take us to the meet from another plot just two hundred yards away come midnight i reached the place where the first man to arrive was supposed to lie in the weeds for anybody following the rest morley im clean dojango came out of the darkness not morley what took so long i had more tails than an uighur all pros took awhile to shake them wheres morley pushing sugar doris and marsha at the plot they just got here too they almost forgot they were having fun trotting around town watching the humans huff and puff trying to keep up the ladies you and morley better forget those two and take up kicking beehives mad huh furious actually morley came back from his pandering just in time garrett lets go check something out he marched off through the graveyard his destination proved to be a decrepit mausoleum he examined its door i couldnt see what he saw he grunted hunh maybe they knew what they were talking about marsha open it up the groll obliged there was no sound of seals breaking there was almost no sound at all curious in a door that should have been unmoved for generations then the stench rolled out i considered a crack about ducking the stampeding buzzards but desisted death is no joke we need a light morley dojango said i figured we would i borrowed a lucifer stone from my bitty buddy hornbuckle he removed it from its protective sack it was a young one burning bright i didnt want to go inside but i did i stayed only as long as i could hold my breath which was long enough to get an education it was pretty bad but i did recognize what was left of father mike the sair and the clerk from the civil city hall i had no idea who the others were marsha closed it up we walked to the kronk plot in silence finally morley saidsomebodys garbage dump who put them there soldiers i quote hornbuckle soldiers without livery i see i saw a great deal it had nothing to do with finding kayean but a lot to do with a nameless major morley saidon no evidence at all ill bet you fifty marks your major was part of the outfit that liberated the church the day your girlfriends father died no bet not even at ten to one a man in the majors position wouldnt quietly dispose of the top venageti agent in his territory not when he could bring him in and harvest all sorts of rewards not unless that agent could name some very interesting names like maybe that of an agent even better placed than he investigators from tunfaire you had to say he thinks were the kings men and were looking for him what other reason for the interest in people named kronk or the emperors men i shook my head my poor sweet silly kayean she had to make the worst choices in fathers and husbands morley frowned husbands you dont even know who he is i dont have to to know hes somebody zeck zack and his bosses want to keep us away from it cant be her theres no evidence that shes anything but a woman carrying on a profitable correspondence with an old flame morley grunted what about your major you know me id rather negotiate like with the centaur or i just let them ride and hope for the best like with vasco and his bunch ive only killed two men since i got out of the marines and one of them was by accident but i think somebody is going to have to chop the head off this snake before it crushes us all we scouted the terrain thoroughly there was no sign the centaur planned anything cagey but that wasnt especially reassuring zeck zack came for us himself which said something about his relationship to the shadow folk behind him youre early he accused so are you i told them i needed time to scout you for treachery in truth i wanted time to talk you trust us then as much as one dares given the circumstances your claims received independent corroboration from persons who had no wish to further your mission who i believe they called themselves quinn and kurts so i had to reorganize my notions about who had done what to whom that bloody night mr garrett ive gone to a great deal of trouble on your behalf for myself as well i admit for it could mean my neck if the knowledge of the movement of certain letters reached the wrong persons but still on your behalf i have saved your lives by convincing them that the surest way to handle you is to let you get your affidavit you might also note the removal of two deadly enemies which improves your odds you want something sir besides me not mentioning any letters a subject i wouldnt mind chatting about just to satisfy my curiosity there must be something else call it a hunch yes i might as well be direct there is so little time so in my youth i was guilty of shall we say a mortal indiscretion a certain gentleman acquired proofs sufficient to place me in extreme jeopardy should they come to the attention of either my employers or the karentine military he used the threat to compel me to perform tasks that only worsen my chances of living to old age the whereabouts of the evidence is known only to him he does not allow me to get anywhere near him you however could walk right up to him i get the picture i had no intention of skragging anybody for him but i played the game out i wanted him to stay my buddy who he wanted to get cagey come on i dont agree to anything till i hear a name he had made up his mind to tell me if i pressed he did a priest named sair lojda at the orthodox church at i know him morley and i exchanged glances so the centaur didnt know that the sair had gone invisible far be it from me to respect a dead villain so much i failed to profit from him youve got a deal buddy hes dead meat right now if i see the woman get what i want and leave in one piece ill show you the body before the sun comes up pact pact and sworn good lets go theyll be getting impatient zeck zack led us down the trail to his house the peacocks raised twelve kinds of hell im going to roast the lot someday the centaur said every damn night they wake me up with that whooping he took us in through the tradesmans entrance kayean used to sneak out then it was through servants corridors to the front antechamber dark as hell in here morley complained what have you got against light centaur if it was bad for him and the triplets it was worse for zeck zack and me we had no night eyes at all there was a ghost of light in the antechamber it leaked in from the ballroom it was just enough to betray the form of a man awaiting us the centaur said at this point you must shed all your weapons indeed everything youre carrying that is made of metal past this point you may go armed only with the weapons given you by nature i started shucking i could smell the end of the chase i would give zeck zack the benefit of the doubt damn its cold in here dojango muttered he was right and here id thought my teeth were chattering because i had to go in there armed only with the weapons given me by nature i announced im ready zeck zack said step up and let the man doublecheck mr garrett he made no apologies i stepped forward a pasty face the color of grubs appeared before me for a moment eyes of no color stared into mine they were filled with an old hopelessness he patted me down smoothly and efficiently professionally he did only one thing unprofessional he slipped something into my pocket it was done slickly he touched me just heavily enough to make sure i noticed then he went to frisk morley one lone candle illuminated the ballroom it sat with a quill and inkwell on an otherwise barren table at the chambers geographical center the table was four feet wide and eight feet long long side toward me two chairs faced one another across it i went and stood behind the one on my side dropped my credentials and all the legal stuff on the table shivering i shoved my hands into my pockets and waited i hadnt imagined anything i palmed a folded piece of paper i checked the disposition of my troops morley was to my left my weak side two steps out and one back dojango was the same to my right the grolls were behind me morleys nose twitched and pointed three times three beings shared the room with us all in front one came floating out of the darkness she was beautiful and something else ethereal a poet might have said spooky is good enough for me she moved so lightly she seemed to float her gown whispered around her gauzy and voluminous it was as white as any white ever was her skin was so colorless it almost matched her apparel her hair was the blond called platinum her eyes were ice blue and without expression except they narrowed as she neared the light as though it was too bright her lips were a thin wound vaguely purpled by the cold she wore no makeup youre kayean kronk i asked when she halted behind her chair she inclined her head in a barely perceptible nod lets sit then lets get it over with she pulled her chair back and drifted into it i glanced at morley and dojango as i settled they were staring into the darkness as rigid and fierce as trained wolves on point i didnt know dojango had it in him i looked across the table she waited her hands folded i gave her the whole thing denny dying leaving his bundle her having to come to tunfaire with me if she wanted to claim the legacy or having to execute a sworn and sealed affidavit that would renounce and abjure in perpetuity all claims upon the estate of denny tate while i tried to talk what morley called dirtylawyer talk i shuffled and referred to my papers and used that to cover unfolding the thing that had been deposited in my pocket it was a note of course it said come take her out soon please while there is still a chance for her redemption i shivered and tried to convince myself that it was the cold i read on and under the guise of jotting notes jotted a note open the enclosure only in her presence do so elsewhere and all hope dies i folded in one of the charms i had obtained from the old witch handsatthedoor had not removed those if he had detected them at all i got the paper into a pocket and concentrated on concentrating on that spooky woman i tried to sound incredulous are you honestly rejecting one hundred thousand marks less fees of course in silver a ghost of a hint of revulsion feathertouched her eyes as she nodded it was the only emotion she betrayed during the interview very well i wont pretend to understand but ill draw up the affidavit i began scratching slowly on a piece of paper one of my associates will witness my signature one of your companions will have to witness yours again she nodded i completed the thing signed morley i need your chop he came and gave me it he was still as taut as a drawn bowstring i pushed the paper ink and pen across is that satisfactory she considered the paper just long enough then nodded collected everything floated up and drifted away into the darkness i put my papers and such together rose waited behind my chair soon enough the apparition drifted back she placed the signed affidavit on the table just beside the candle thus there was no possibility of physical contact as there might be if she offered it to me directly i gathered it up and tucked it away i thank you for your time and courtesy madame i will trouble you no more i headed for the anteroom i noted that neither morley dojango nor the grolls turned around to retreat there are times when not having night eyes can be a blessing slipping my counternote to my correspondent was easy zeck zack was so anxious to get us out of his house and so eager to get himself out too that he was blind in half a minute he was fussing unmercifully trying to get us moving down the dark halls before we had recovered half of our hardware the peafowl carried on like wild dogs had them surrounded and help would come only if they yelled loud enough to rattle the clouds i sympathized lately i felt the same way but if i yelled they would know where i was and start closing in as we approached the witchs house the air quivered a cackle fluttered down like gaunt soggy snowflakes out of everywhere and nowhere she asked did you enjoy your taste of the prophecy mr garrett more soggy cackle morley and the boys might not have heard zeck zack glanced at the house puzzled i just put my head down and marched not wanting to think about it the centaur was determined to stick with us i expected him to press on the matter of sair lojda and he didnt disappoint me he started in halfway to the graveyard i told him wait and refused to listen morley picked the spot to squat the one we had used before keeping our date with zeck zack morley sat down so did i morley said we need to talk yeah zeck zack grumbled this is where you tell me how sorry you are cant keep your half of the bargain no morley said we can deliver on that fast enough to make your head spin the problem is you didnt deliver i looked at morley he explained you gave her the paper upside down she didnt turn it she couldnt read its reasonable to assume that your kayean could she could youre right that wasnt her didnt begin to resemble her they just plain didnt know i knew her zeck zack looked upset i didnt bother to ask i did say one question old horse when you bought that house was it your idea theirs or the priests the priests one cycle of coincidence unmasked did he find what he was afraid might be hidden there no did you im sure you looked he was regaining his balance he grinned i took that place apart i needed some back leverage i can take that as a no right garrett morley said is that paper going to satisfy you itll get you your ten percent thats not what i said id do i havent found her yet he grunted i couldnt be sure in that light but thought he seemed relieved and pleased then we have plans to make things to do and our butts to cover he rose your pal there jacked us around but maybe he didnt have any choice i say we deliver our half maybe hell suffer a fit of gratitude come on there was an edge to his voice i didnt like im not sure zeck zack followed morley maybe he just didnt want to go back down to that house or maybe he thought he would get to watch the priest die morley hiked straight to the mausoleum wed visited earlier open it up marsha marsha obliged zeck zack noted the little giveaway details that said the tomb was in use you already did it before you dumped him here morley gave him the lucifer stone see for yourself pardon us if we dont join you weve been in there once already tonight we dont have your iron stomach their gazes locked right then zeck zack would have murdered him cheerfully the odds didnt favor him he spun raised the stone stamped inside morley said something in grollish marsha slammed the door morley a little night trading i told you the first time i reported on him like a little innocent smuggling i thought what do you want to bet he procures for them i had known morley a long time though not well id seen him angry but never out of control and never eaten up with hatred you know what we walked into down there dont you garrett i know and father rhynes last message and kayeans excommunication made sense of a sort so did the attacks and rumors of attacks morley calmed down something had to be done he could have trotted straight down there and told them we werent taken in hell be all right for a while we already know he has a strong stomach we can turn him loose later if you want anyway a few days in there might incline him to tell us how to find her ill know how to reach her soon enough though morley gave me the fisheye i didnt elucidate you sure you know what youre doing there wasnt anything in your deal about digging her out of a nest of the night people i know i knew only too well and i am cursed with an imagination capable of conjuring up the worst possibilities if we blow it and get taken me and the triplets are just dead we dont have enough human blood to be any use to them but you i said i know morley back off we have the major to worry about he knows we were in touch with the centaur i expect he knows the priest was blackmailing zeck zack with the priest gone that leverage is gone so are we meaning we might have learned something that made us run for cover hes going to tear this town apart hes going to have guys sitting on every way out we cant stay here when the sun comes up the sextons will start planting the days crop of stiffs theyll wonder what were doing hanging around we cant go back to the inn everybody will be watching that dont get yourself in an uproar weve got the woods to hide in weve got ourselves a night trader who knows ways to get people and things in and out of town i say lets worry about our friends of the nest and let your major worry about himself morley had a point of sorts though he didnt realize it the more the major scurried around looking for us the more likely he was to draw the attention of superiors who might want to know what was going on and few if any of the men he commanded would be venageti operatives their suspicions dared not be aroused he had to juggle carefully i wakened to an itchy nose tittering and the harumphharumph of grollish laughter i opened my eyes something brown and fuzzy waved in my face behind it was one of the little folk seated in the crotch of a bush i controlled my temper and got my forequarters upright leaning against a tree i was stiff and sore from sleeping on the ground no doubt morley would argue that it was good for me where the hell are morley and dojango the only answer i got was some big grollish grins and titters from the undergrowth all right be that way sugar a tiny voice piped if id had any you would have swiped it while i was sleeping with those great beasties watching over you the one in the bush asked i didnt feel like arguing morning is always too early for anything but selfpity and even thats usually too much trouble is there anyone in or around the centaurs house you have to strive for precision with those folk human or otherwise sugar no sugar bye now so no pay no play little mercenaries i considered going down and burglarizing the centaurs kitchen but i wasnt hungry enough to bet that zeck zacks masters had done the rational thing and gotten the hell out the minute my affidavit and i departed besides i didnt feel like getting up and doing anything i sat there trying to reconcile the kayean who dwelt among the nightmares with the kayean i had known i shuffled through what i remembered from her letters to denny nothing there but the occasional hint that she was not happy never a word about her whereabouts or circumstances she hadnt been proud of herself no sense worrying about it that would give me nothing but a headache and the heebiejeebies she could explain when i got to her morley showed up around noon staggering under a load of junk whats all that i demanded you planning an invasion wheres dojango what the hell have you been up to taking bids on your butt from vasco rose and your major it was hot going till they got up to a quarter mark here he dumped half his load beside me i noted a sack that looked like it might contain comestibles i hit it first what is all this stuff raw materials for the arsenal well need if were going into a nest after your lady theyd smell metal hardware ten miles off you any good at flaking stone arrow points i dont know ive never tried he looked exasperated didnt they teach you anything practical in that marine corps of yours three thousand ways to kill venageti im a tool user not a toolmaker i guess the load falls on doris and marsha again he gobbled grollish and gave the big guys a bunch of stuff two minutes later snarling and rumbling they were chipping out arrowheads with a touch as delicate as a mouses they were good and they were fast morley said theyre put out they say its dwarfs work they want to know why they cant just make themselves some tenfoot clubs and go in and break skulls grolls are slow sometimes i could whittle a bit so i set to making myself a sword from an ironwood lath its a good hard wood that will almost take an edge but wont hold one the way steel will so i gave myself only one the backstroke side i channeled and set with waste from the arrowhead flaking that gave me a vicious tool time rolled by i shed my troubles in my concentration on my craftsmanship have mercy garrett morley snapped do you really have to put in the blood gutters i looked at the thing in my hand i sure was doing it up purple i tried it for balance close needs a little more work a little more polish to lessen the drag during the cut and you call me bloodthirsty id rather carry a saber come off it one time were going to use this stuff finish it up i cut some bolts there fletch them and sharpen them ill harden and poison the tips when im done here he was removing metal parts from crossbows and replacing them the reworked weapons wouldnt hold up but like he said it was just the one raid old man tate is going to pee blue vinegar over the expenses why poison it wont do you any good i dragged bolts glue feathers and thread together and started in because not everybody we meet is going to be immune true the bloodslaves would fight ferociously to defend their chances of someday joining the order of masters you know anything about the nests in the cantard garrett who knows anything about any of them anywhere true they wouldnt survive but there are rumors because of the military situation they dont have to be as circumspect in the cantard plenty of easy prey too nobody misses a soldier here or there the nests are supposed to be bigger than usual because of that when i was stationed down here there were supposed to be six nests that got reduced when some karentine agents snatched a venageti warlords daughter and let it out that she had been carried off to a nest the warlord forgot everything else went off to the rescue found the nest and cleansed it and got himself killed for his trouble while his army was busy hunting night people one of ours was sneaking up behind them and thats all i know except to guess that theyre happy to see so much silver leaving this part of the world they would know everything about silver wouldnt they they would know everything about what everyone was doing thats for sure which explains how kayean was able to make denny rich silver is as poisonous to the night people as cobra venom is to humans it kills them fast and makes it stick not much else does other metals bother them to a lesser degree speaking of sneaks morley said dojango appeared burdened with poles and bowstaves and whatnot he was tipsy he said its set for tomorrow night how much did you have morley demanded dont worry cousin i came here clean actually theyll have the horses and gear waiting at an abandoned mill they said is three miles up something called north creek they said theyd only wait one night they said they would take the animals and stuff out tomorrow morning and bring them back the next day if we dont show they seemed a little nervous about being out in the countryside actually guess well have to resurrect our centaur sit down and start turning those dowels into arrows garrett you know this north creek yes i was tempted to ask who he thought was in charge but kept my mouth shut morley had taken care of things that needed doing dojango started making arrows some interesting news started going around just before i came back up about the time we were taking a peek into that tomb last night glory mooncalled unsupported actually attacked indigo springs indigo springs i asked thats a hundred miles farther south than the armys ever gone and he tried it without wizards dojango smirked he not only tried it he pulled it off actually caught them sleeping killed warlord shomatzozha and his whole staff in the first assault then wiped out half their army the rest ran off into the desert barefoot wearing nothing but their nightshirts good hunting for the night people morley grumbled and unicorns centaur slavers wild dogs hippogriffs and any other kind of critter that wants a piece of them dojango added this is going to mean problems morley if we have to spend much time out there how come if its true its an unprecedented disaster for venageti arms when glory mooncalled changed sides he swore vengeance on five warlords for years hes been waltzing them around the cantard making fools of them now hes struck deep into traditionally safe territory and stomped one of the five the way id stomp a bug so so the venageti are going to start flailing around like a boxer with blood in his eyes hoping they hit something karentine forces will begin to move trying to take advantage every nonhuman tribe in the cantard will be out trying to profit from the confusion in a week itll be so hairy itll be worth your life to squat to poop if you dont have somebody to stand guard then wed better move fast hadnt we morley asked a sentiment with which i agreed wholeheartedly but my sneak to the bloodslave guarding the things in zeck zacks ballroom had paid no dividends yet and i doubted that my revelation would come for days if at all zeck zack was as cooperative as a centaur could be after his sojourn with the dead he didnt balk until having led us from the city via an underwall smugglers tunnel he discovered that he had been enlisted in our enterprise for the duration morley was in a puckish mood but sir surely you see all your caterwauling is without foundation if you will reflect seriously you cannot help but confess the rectitude of our position if we were to release you as you so unreasonably insist you would dash back through the tunnel and instantly set about wreaking evil upon us imagining us to be the authors of your ill fortune rather than assuming that onus yourself as is the fact i had arrayed my army in squad diamond with a groll out front another behind dojango on the right and morley on the left nightblind i marched at the heart of the formation ready to rush to any quarter suddenly threatened zeck zack stumbled along between morley and me it wasnt long before the centaur surrendered to the inevitable he betrayed a hitherto sequestered facet of character and began arguing with morley in the same florid language and overblown overly polite formulations the men who had brought our horses and gear were thrilled to see us our advent meant they couldnt just take everything back and sell it again nor they decided after eyeballing the grolls could they murder us and do the same we parted ways immediately upon delivery they were of the school that maintains wandering around at night could get you killed we kept moving on the hypothesis that the wise man puts ground between himself and people who want to kill him not a lot of ground those horses had heard of me and just to make trouble they insisted that the sensible thing to do was stay put nobody was out to kill them nobody behind them anyway their attitude didnt improve when the sun rose and they found themselves headed into the cantard morley accused me of anthropomorphizing and exaggerating the natural reluctance of dumb beasts to go into unfamiliar territory it just goes to show they had him fooled theyre crafty in their malice unicorns under the skin having had no revelation i set a course due west thither lay the most barren territory in the karentine end of the cantard the desert of colorful buttes and mesas people in tunfaire picture when they think of the cantard i decided to head there because it seemed a logical place for the night people to have established a nest it was so inhospitable as to be repugnant to most races there were no discovered resources to bring exploiters with their guardians ample prey existed close by especially when there were zeck zacks to do the rounding up our second day out morley began to suspect that i was not sure of my course he went to work on the centaur theres no point to it morley i said they wouldnt be stupid enough to trust him doris grumbled something from behind us i could now tell the grolls apart i had made them wear different hats what i asked he says theres a dog following us uhoh trouble probably well have to ambush it to find out watch for a place where the wind is toward us three possibilities suggested themselves the dog could be a domestic stray seeking human company damned unlikely it could be an outcast from a wild pack that meant rabies or most unpleasant and most likely it could be an outrunner scouting for game marsha found a likely bunch of boulders on the lower slope of the butte we were rounding he headed up a steep twisting alley between into shadows and clicky echoes morley dojango and i dismounted and followed rehearsing the balky animals in the vulgates of several languages what did i tell you about horses morley doris hunkered between rocks and started blending in keep going morley theyre sight as well as scent hunters itll need to see movement morley grumbled marsha grumbled back surly but continued climbing a bit later there was one brief squeal of doggie outrage from below canceled by a meaty smack the horses were not reluctant going downhill lazy monsters doris had squashed the mongrel good he stood over it grinning as though he had conquered an entire army troop yech i said looks like a rat run over by a wagon lucky he missed its head i squatted examined ears well damn what morley asked it was an outrunner a trained outrunner see the holes through the ears punched there by unicorn teeth theres a hunting party somewhere within a few miles of us theyll track the dog when he doesnt turn up that means we have to leave enough nasty surprises to discourage them because we arent going to outrun them if they take our scent how many one adult male and all the females of his harem that arent too pregnant or cluttered up with young maybe some adolescent females that havent run away yet anywhere from six to a dozen if they do catch up concentrate on the dominant female the male wont get involved he leaves the hunting and heavy stuff to the womenfolk he saves himself for giving orders mounting females killing his male offspring if they stray from their mothers and trying to kidnap the most attractive females from other harems sounds like a sensible arrangement somehow i figured youd feel that way wouldnt killing the boss break up the harem the way i hear if that happened theyd just keep coming till they were dead or we all were that is true zeck zack said a most despicable beast the unicorn natures most bankrupt experiment but one day my folk will complete their extermination he shut up having recalled that the rest of us held a different view of the identity of natures most bankrupt experiment we hurried on after a while zeck zack resumed talking so he could explain some of the nastier devices his folk used to boobytrap their backtrails some were quite gruesomely ingenious he had contributed nothing but carping before his sudden helpfulness suggested the proximity of unicorns scared the tailfeathers off him after pausing at a brackish stream to water and gather firewood we scrambled up several hundred feet of scree around the knees of a monster monolith of a butte and made camp in a pocket that couldnt be approached in silence by a mouse the view was excellent none of us with our varied eyes or even with the spyglass could see anything moving in the twilight we settled down to a small sheltered fire being in the mood myself we broached one of the baby kegs and passed it around it held only enough for a good draft each for me zeck zack dojango and sips for the grolls yech was my assessment drinking that was the second mistake ive made in this life i wont be so forward as to ask what the other might have been morley said suspecting it might have been being born he smirked i presume beer jostled on the back of a pack animal in the hot sun loses something you might say what possessed you dojango a slicktalking salesman we sat around the fire after eating mostly watching it die down occasionally assaying a story or a joke but largely tossing out notions about how we might deal with the unicorns if it came to that i didnt contribute much id begun to fret about my revelation something must have gone wrong there had been time for them to reach the nest i felt had the bloodslave betrayed himself had he been found out without him prospects were poor we could wander the cantard looking until we were old men at some point i would have to admit defeat and head north with my false affidavit i supposed wed give up when our stores were depleted to just enough for the overland journey to taelreef the friendly port nearest us after full harbor going back into the shadow of the majors claw seemed plain foolhardy from there in the desert one of the grolls was telling morley a story morley kept snickering i ignored them and began drowsing hey garrett you got to hear this story doris just told me itll tear you up i scowled and opened my eyes the fire had died to sullen red coals casting little useful light even so i could see that morleys words didnt fit his expression another one of those longwinded shaggydog fables about how the fox tricked the bear out of berries then ate them and got the runs and diarrheaed himself to death that had been the most accessible of the grollish stories so far and even it had lacked a clear point or moral no youll get this one right away and even if you dont laugh a lot so you dont hurt his feelings if we must we must we must he moved over beside me in a low voice he said it starts out like this were being watched by two of the night people laugh i managed without looking around sometimes i do all right doris called something to marsha who responded with hearty grollish laughter it sounded like they had bet on my response and marsha had won doris and marsha are going to jump them maybe they can handle them maybe they cant dont look around when im done telling the story were going to get up and walk toward doris chuckle and nod i think i can manage without the stage directions i chuckled and nodded when doris moves you follow him and do whatever needs doing ill go with marsha dojango i slapped my knee and guffawed he watches the centaur zeck zack had backed himself into a tight place where nothing could come at him from behind his legs were folded under him his chin rested upon his folded arms he appeared to be sound asleep ready morley asked i put on my hero face that said i was a fearless old vampire killer from way back lead on my man im right behind you big laugh i heehawed like it was the one about the bride who didnt know the bird had to be cleaned before it went into the roaster morley pasted a grin on and rose i did so too and tried shaking some of the stiffness out of my legs we walked toward doris doris and marsha moved with astonishing swiftness i had run only two steps when i glimpsed a dark flutter among the rocks doris hit it a great thrashing and flailing started another broke out behind me i didnt look back when i got there doris had the vampire in a fierce bear hug facing away from him sinews popped and crackled strong as he was the groll was having trouble keeping the hold blood leaked from talon slashes on his hide the blood smell maddened the vampire further his fangs ripped the air an inch from the grolls arm let that devil sink one and doris was done for it would inject a soporific venom capable of felling a mastodon i stood with a knife in one hand and silver half mark in the other wondering what to do whenever a foot flailed out at me i tried to cut the tendon above the heel suddenly there was a flicker of light dojango was feeding the fire doris pushed the vampires ankles between his knees i flung forward trying to drive my blade into one of the devils knees to hobble it it twisted half an inch my point hit bone and cut downward through flesh harder than summer sausage a wound to the bone a foot long and when i was done about three drops of liquid leaked out the vampire loosed one flat shrill keen of pain and rage its eyes burned down at me trying to catch mine with their deadly hypnotic gaze i slammed the half mark into the wound before it could start healing it was done so quickly deftly and instinctively that even now it amazes me the vampire froze for many seconds then dead lips peeled back and loosed a howl that terrified the stones and must have been audible twenty miles away immortality betrayed i clamped both hands on the wound to keep the coin in place the night beast bent back like a man in the last throes of tetanus hissed gurgled shook so violently we barely held on the flesh beneath my hands began to soften around the coin it turned to jelly it oozed between my fingers doris threw the thing down the fire painted his great green face in light and shadow patches of hatred the vampire lay among the rocks still hissing clawing at its leg it was a very strong one the poison should have finished it sooner but theyre all strong or they couldnt be what they are doris snagged a boulder twice as long as me and smashed the things head for several seconds i watched flesh turn to jelly and slide off bones then as though the vampires end was a signal my revelation came i knew a direction when daylight came if daylight came morley and marsha were embattled still doris was on his way to help he collected his tenfoot club as he went i shook all over and went to help myself somehow as we approached the second vampire broke loose it hit the ground then hurled itself through the air in one of those hundredfoot bounds that have led the ignorant to believe they can fly the leap brought it straight toward me i dont think it was intentional i think it jumped blind with the fire in its eyes but he saw me as he came his mouth opened his fangs gleamed his eyes flared his claws reached he or it it had been male when it was alive it could still sire its own kind but did it deserve doriss club met him with a solid whump the vampire arced right back the way he had come and fell at marshas feet marsha bounced a boulder off him before he could move if he could have moved i didnt go on i headed for the fire and another of those skunky kegs and hopefully some unsober reflection dojango was shaking worse than i was but he was on the job feeding the fire with one hand keeping a crossbow aimed at zeck zack with the other he didnt look up to see who or what was coming toward him another twentymile shriek shredded the fabric of the night i make it twelve i said one lame if i stare through this glass anymore my eye is going to fall out morley took the spyglass studied the unicorns playing around the water course and pretending they didnt know we were nearby morley handed the glass to dojango he told zeck zack one of your traps worked the centaur wasnt talking to us this morning i retreated to higher ground a better view and contemplation of last nights revelation which remained with me it amounted to a direction a line on which kayean and i were points the trouble was the line ran through me so i had no certain idea which of the two ways pointed toward kayean and which ran away the old witch hadnt mentioned that problem i favored going southeast that would put the nest nearer full harbor and the roads toward the war zone it also put a large promising mesa astride the line hey i called down somebody bring me the glass morley came grumbling up who was your butt boy yesterday a genie but somebody threw his beer keg on the fire last night i trained the glass on the mesa asked what took you so long with that thing last night i was trying to get it to talk it was a new one barely up from being a bloodslave not born to the blood i thought it might crack hey the stallion and two of the mares are taking off so they were they headed up our back trail at a grand gallop the other unicorns moved out of sight behind the scruffy trees lining the watercourse i swung the glass did you learn anything we can use nothing youd find interesting what is it somebody coming right up our back trail too far to tell for sure but it looks like a big party he took the glass fortune thou toothless grinning bitch here we are treed by unicorns and there id give you odds comes your major friend no bet till theyre close enough to show faces you want a sure thing dont you ive never had a gambling debt hanging over my head he scowled and returned the glass the male unicorn was back he and the trained dogs lurked behind the living screen bordering the creek waiting for us to make a break the females had moved to a tributary dry wash a mile away answering a question i told morley theyll jump out and try to panic the horses which isnt hard unless the horses are well trained if they succeed theyll pick off a few eat the horses where they fall and carry the riders back to those who missed out on the hunt if the horsemen regroup and come back at them theyll just scatter and wait people arent going to bother carrying off dead horses they ought to be close enough to see something i raised the glass the riders were close enough to pick individuals from the dust but not close enough to distinguish features id guess fifteen horsemen and two wagons see what you think he watched awhile grunted they ride like soldiers looks like we trade bad trouble for worse at least they seem to know where theyre going i know where im going too that mesa back the way we traveled for an entire day when were you struck by this marvelous revelation i ignored him he didnt need to know the riders passed the female unicorns hiding place going to hit them from behind i took the glass back well what do you know did you check that lead wagon no can you think of two women who might be roaming the cantard with saucerhead tharpe what give me that damned thing he looked that stupid bitch hell your pal vasco and his boys are there too regular reunion of the garrett appreciation society looks like theyre prisoners i count ten soldiers and one officer my turn at the glass showed me he was right thats my major noname this puts me in a moral bind yeah i cant let those women get hurt the hell they asked for it what would they do if they were up here and you were down there i didnt get to answer that one the unicorns burst out of the dry wash at first it seemed their strategy was perfect the soldiers horses darted every direction then suddenly they were all facing the rush the soldiers held leveled lances the groups crashed together the unicorns broke first running for the wash one soldier and two horses were down the unicorns had lost no one but they had collected the majority of wounds an arrow smacked into the shoulder of the slowest she stumbled went down on her knees before she could rise soldiers with lances overtook her major noname called something taunting he sent five men to plink arrows into the wash angered the unicorns came roaring out in another brief mixup another soldier another unicorn and two more horses died noname held his ground and mocked the attackers the soldiers who lost their mounts took replacements from their prisoners he do have a hate for unicorns i think morley said here comes the boss female after orders im going back down give me the high sign if he tells her to take the dogs with her will do the major was expecting a fight he made a makeshift fort of his wagons and baggage off his pack animals put all the extra animals inside the barricade armed his prisoners and had them wait on the wagons i wondered what he told them the male unicorn was either stupid or had lost a favorite they do become mercurial when that happens i signaled morley i thought i knew what he had in mind i didnt like it but i could see no alternative so the dogs went howling toward the majors group the unicorns charged behind a fine merry dustup got started the male unicorn didnt want to watch morley proved that by racing from the foot of the scree to the watercourse unchallenged zeck zack was after him before he was halfway across there is nothing on four legs faster in the short run than a motivated centaur the unicorn heard hoofbeats he popped up to see what was happening it was too late zeck zack was all over him and showed us he had handled a unicorn oneonone in younger days it didnt last long all the while i was bounding down the slope it was moveout time everything and everyone was ready when i got down i scrambled aboard my horse for once we agreed on absolutely everything we were a team with a single mind that mind said make tracks i got out ahead of the crowd so i could lead by example i steered around the base of the butte so we were headed east again until we reached a point where i could see the battleground that journey took an hour and a half we halted i raised the spyglass nothing moved except the vultures from that lower angle of vision it was hard to tell how great the disaster had been i could distinguish one wagon on its side a vulture perched on a wheel somebody ought to take a closer look i said staring at zeck zack he nodded without comment he borrowed a couple of javelins and trotted off the morning had wrought marvelous changes in him he might be back in the army i told morley dotes just grunted i added dont forget somebody thought enough of him to get him karentine citizenship it isnt what you were its what you are garrett and that creature is the worst kind of night trader the kind that sells your kind to them yeah zeck zack circled the mess a few times closing in then he raised a javelin and beckoned knowing i had the glass on him lets go it was grisly the dogs were all dead so were most of the unicorns and a dozen horses but there was not a human cadaver to be seen they went on the centaur said i told morley for a venageti he sure sticks tight to karentine field doctrine challenge unicorns when you can carry away your dead poison the flesh of the animals you leave behind every dead animal had been cut dozens of times each cut was stained a royal blue where crystalline poison had been rubbed into the wound no one was going to profit from dead army animals i counted eight slain unicorns they had kept at it until the dominant female had been killed the survivors would be in bad shape unicorns in that part of the cantard would seek easier prey for a while i raised the glass and searched the base of the butte there they were looking back at us see them morley asked yeah burying their dead cant make out anybody special except saucerhead zeck zack took a cue from that and galloped off toward the butte shadow where the major was returning the earths children to her trying to ingratiate himself morley said so youll be a little loose on the rein when the time comes when do you figure hell run when we start into the nest we wont dare waste time chasing him and with us keeping them busy his chance of making it would be good this is his country and he can still pick them up and put them down when he wants i watched dojango for a minute he was collecting souvenirs he had cut the dew claws off a unicorn had knocked out some of its razor teeth and was trying to figure how to take its horn that would bring fifty marks bounty in full harbor and more as a curio in tunfaire what are you going to do about it morley asked let him run i wont have any more use for him zeck zack came prancing back he reported that four soldiers and the major had survived and four other men as well i knew about saucerhead one of the others sounded like vasco the remaining two could have been anybody survived dont mean unscathed either the centaur said they got cut up pretty good what about the women not much scathing there a little frayed around the edges as anyone would be after that morley muttered bet we can thank that dope saucerhead for that zeck zack went right on one of them kept screaming at me to tell you she going to crack your eggs fry them and feed them to the unicorns when the boss soldier tried to shut her up she bit him and gave him a knee in his eggs my lovely little rose what a wonderful wife shell make some poor sod well lets go i urged my mount to face east our unity had begun to unravel she does bounce back doesnt she morley said in a tone that sounded suspiciously like admiration you just going to ride off yes the major isnt going to make prisoners of anybody again thats going to turn into a threeway marriage of convenience thatll be as rowdy as those marriages get but theyll take care of each other do you think you could get doris and marsha to pull a wagon we might have a use for it the one wagon was not damaged just overturned and lacking a team its army we wouldnt want to get caught with it we wont he spoke to the grolls they responded in what sounded like impolite terms he told me they want to collect unicorn horns those could be more use than any wagon stick one of them in the heart with a horn and its all over sure as silver and they cant smell horns coming deal then wagon for horns those people back there are going to be burying and bickering for a long time the grolls took the deal crash down went the wagon onto its wheels the grolls scampered from unicorn to unicorn perhaps dreaming of buying a brewery a pair of adolescent females outraged by the trophy taking and not too badly injured charged out of the wash it was disconcerting watching the absentminded way the grolls clubbed them to death we didnt try for the nest mesa that day i wanted to go in early when they had settled for the day not late when they were about to awaken once they were soundly asleep while the sun was high it was almost impossible to wake them even the elder bloodslaves would have trouble responding so legend went we got out of sight of our pursuers then went to work hiding our trail and laying false scents zeck zack worked hard making himself useful he knew all the tricks he even had the grolls handcarry the wagon two miles off to leave false wheel marks we set up for the night atop the corpse of a small butte not more than two miles from the face of the nest mesa my head throbbed with the nearness of kayean from that vantage i could see most of the scrap facing the mesa and our backtrail no fire tonight zeck zack said as i crouched behind the spy glass trying to tell what kind of luck the major was having also scatter a little and stay near the stones that got the hottest during the day that is how they find their prey from a distance through their warmth it would be wise too to keep too much metal from accumulating in one place you wouldnt give them a holler would you to score a few points ive never been known for an inclination toward suicide i am known to be quicktempered rash foolish sometimes even stupid but not suicidal i enjoy the good things in life too much wearing a distant look he echoed himself too much you might remember that the major wants you as much as he wants me your blackmailing priest was a buddy of his and you know it i added he has to get out of the cantard before he can cause me any grief he has to get through tonight last night he was too strong for them tonight he wont be especially if they havent fed for a while and they have not the two who came to full harbor could not restrain themselves though their attacks put them at great risk why would they spot him more quickly than us eleven humans are easier to find than one oh the day was getting on toward failing those who were tracking us were having no luck and seemed now to be more interested in settling for the night there the centaur pointed a darkness was rising from the mesa face i shifted the glass bats a billion bats and coming up from a point right on the line through my head my mystical connection with kayean morley came in from scouting around for a city boy he caught on fast i repeated the centaurs advice he gave zeck zack the fish eye then nodded curtly makes sense dont sleep too soundly tonight garrett right with us here on the lip of it id be lucky to get the old forty winks you never admit it to the guys youre with but you get scared damned scared and this time there might be a bigger stake than just death i could be dead and have to keep walking if you ask me the difference between a hero and a coward is that a hero finds some damnfool way to con himself into going ahead instead of doing the sensible thing they never did give me much credit for sense i did sleep because a hand shaking my shoulder woke me up morley i heard it before he told me a hell of a row over by the foot of the mesa gods how i had wanted to run over and warn them when they had chosen to camp less than a mile from the gate to the nest but like zeck zack i am not renowned for my suicidal tendencies as morley said the women were at little risk and they were the only ones we had to give a damn about still i had a soft spot for saucerhead tharpe saucerhead was implausibly romantic he deserved preservation as the last of a knightly breed i got up where i could see just as the last of two campfires yonder died not two minutes after that the screaming and banging stopped and about two minutes after that somebody finally said something dojango guess we dont have to worry about the army anymore no i guess not nobody got any more sleep i stared at the stars and wondered about the size of certain mouths and about how much rose vasco and the major had yakked it up among themselves between them they had enough to work out what i meant to do did they have guts enough to stay buttoned up on the chance i might get them out going to have to be careful work over there tomorrow morley said sometime in the wee hours he didnt have to ask if i was awake he knew just as i knew that he and the others were awake and hanging onto something silver we started the crossing two hours later than id originally planned that gave the sun two more hours to get up and glare at the gate to the nest two more hours for the night people to sink more deeply into slumber two more hours for us to prepare and two more hours for us to get crazier with fear every instinct screamed get out of there morley spent that time rechecking every damned thing we would carry flares fire bombs spears crossbows swords knives unicorn horns the list was endless i watched the gate through the spyglass looked for secondary outlets and helped the triplets polish off the last few kegs of beer zeck zack mapped a convoluted route across that would be out of sight of spying eyes the grolls once the beer was gone amused themselves by bringing enough water to do the horses for a couple of days dojango rigged up hitches they could pull if we didnt come back not much was said the few lame jokes that were told got rollontheground laughs anything to ease the tension morley distributed the lethal instruments and flares and rehearsed everyone on using them we packed it all up filled canteens drank too much water and finally the sun was high enough to suit me lets go morley muttered wish i knew if they knew we were coming then we might not have to leave all the metal hardware especially the silver he was talking to no one but himself my own contribution to nonconversation was i havent been so loaded down with junk since we landed on malgar island id been scared witless that day too now those venageti looked like friendly puppies the centaurs route took us to the wasted camp he knew we wanted to know we had an idea of course wed watched the vultures circle for hours we heard them squabbling first then we heard the flies out on the cantard those sidefliers of death get so thick they sound like swarms of bees then we pushed between boulders and saw it i guess it was no more gruesome than any other massacre but the bodies were so badly torn by attackers vultures wild dogs and whatnot that we had to count heads to find out that only four of the majors party had been left for the carrion eaters two pastyskinned blackclad bloodslaves had been left too but they remained untouched even the flies and ants shunned them nobody said anything none of the dead could be identified there was nothing to say we went on fear perhaps tempered by the rage that makes men hunt down the maneater be it wolf rogue tiger or one of them nearer the gate we spread out morley and i flanking the hole and doing a cautious scout for surprises nothing seemed untoward we assembled closer to the cave bat reek rolled over us there was no sign of vampires but i had a bit of red hair twisted around my finger it had come off a thorn bush nearby morley and i went in first each with a sword and unicorn horn dojango followed with flares and fire bombs the grolls backed him with spears and crossbows zeck zack was rear guard because we expected him to turn ghost on us anyway he wouldnt have to stumble over anybody when he decided to leave we would change up on weapons and tactics if we reached the nest proper i gave a signal we all closed our eyes excepting the centaur he counted a hundred silently snakehissed eyes barely cracked we mousefooted into the mouth of hell we advanced a few steps stopped listened morley and i knelt to let the triplets have more freedom to support us we continued in that fashion the deeper we sank into the darkness the more frequently we paused by right of better eyes dojango should have been in my place but morley feared his nerves werent up to it i agreed dojango had buckled down and tightened up a lot but he wasnt ready for the front line gods the stench in that hole the first hundred feet werent too bad the floor was level and clean the ceiling was high there was daylight at our backs and there was no sign that anyone was waiting for us then the floor dropped and turned right the ceiling lowered until the grolls had to duckwalk the darkness tightened and filled with the rustle and flutter of bats disturbed within a few yards we were saturated with the filth that was the source of the stench the air grew chill zeck zack hissed we stopped i was amazed that he could move so quietly on hooved feet id assumed he was hellbent for wherever already the hiss was the only sound the centaur handed something forward it gleamed through dojangos fingers as he passed it it was the lucifer stone morley had given the centaur before shutting him in that tomb an iron chill dragged its claws up my back by the stones light i saw morley entertaining the same question was the centaur announcing payback time burying us here would solve several of his problems i watched morley struggle with the urge to kill zeck zack he put it down barely he gave me the stone because i had poorer eyes i folded it into my right hand under my fingers against the grip of my wooden sword i could lift a finger or two and leak light when i needed it onward already the sun freedom and fresh air seemed a thousand years and miles behind us progress slowed as we examined every cranny for ambushers it looked like a driedout corpse mouth open eye sockets empty hair gray and wild one buzzard claw came reaching out of a crack at me i fell away throwing a wild backhand stroke with the stoneset edge of my sword bone parted like dry sticks the thing that had pushed those old bones leaped out a grolls spear drove through it dull eyes stared into mine as it pitched forward onto the unicorn horn i raised to meet it cold stale awful breath washed my face again i saw that look i had seen on that butte about a century ago immortality betrayed it tried to sink fangs into my throat they werent yet well developed its disease was not far advanced i was terrified anyway a dojango toe connected with its head i grabbed the lucifer stone and got up neither old bones nor the bloodslave did but brothers of the latter had come for the party too they had no weapons but tooth claw ferocity and a conviction of invincibility none of that did them any good morley and i held them dojango retreated behind his brothers and lit a flare the night people made little squeaks and pawed at their eyes a moment later it was over there were only four of them plus somebody who had been dead for years it had seemed like a battalion morley and i inspected each other for wounds he had one shallow gash but waved off attention he wasnt human enough to have to worry the enemy had been met he had been overcome in the opening encounter our nerve solidified our fear came under control dojango was proud of himself he had proven he could think despite his terror we regained our breath and went on without the centaur zeck zack there was no telling when he had deserted probably during the excitement when he was sure no one would notice him going behind us the flare burned out the bats began to settle down the air grew colder the second bunch were more difficult than the first though they were no more successful they were bloodslaves farther along the scarlet path harder to kill but as vulnerable to blinding and more sensitive to the power of the unicorn horn they did make us work up a sweat the third bunch was bad they let us know we were near the nest they were bloodslaves who had slipped past all the perils of snares and pitfalls and were so far advanced in the disease that they were on the verge of joining the masters which meant they were almost as fast and strong and deadly as the two we had destroyed on the butte after we skewered one with a horn it was almost impossible to touch the other three even with them flareblind in the darkness where they dwelt they had little use for sight they ignored their pain and used their ears one got past me and morley the grolls pinned him with their spears then finished him with unicorn horns dojangos fearfevered arm gave us the other two he hit them with fire bombs we finished them while they thrashed in the flames and screamed and thats it for the element of surprise morley said if ever there was one yeah they were the first words spoken since our entry underground save a soft grollish curse from doris on breaking a unicorn horn pinning a bloodslave the fires died we readied ourselves not far now i guessed morley grunted the odds have got to be better i said morley grunted again some conversationalist he looked odd in the glow of lucifer stone was he going to flake out he got himself organized inside stepped forward whacking the flat of his sword with his horn and listening to the echo after about fifty steps there was no echo i let light leak between my fingers no cave wall no ceiling dojango give doris a flare the groll knew what to do they threw for height and distance we were on the platform overlooking a floor about forty feet below manmade stairs ran down a widening sweep below nearly a hundred creatures faced us and started screaming pawing at their eyes the dozen or so in white made me think of maggots on a dead dog marsha snapped a spear down the stairs it hit a youngster who had been rushing up when the flare ignited he tumbled how do you figure chewing it now that youve bitten it off morley asked he shivered in the cold sure wont do any good to change our minds we have to keep pushing keep them panicked he growled at the grolls i looked out along the line that began in my head and saw a halfdozen women in white some leading children born to the blood i couldnt pick her out morley seemed to be looking for someone too there they are dojango indicated cages to one side a score of prisoners stared at us most of them forlornly the flare was almost out but the grolls had shed and opened their packs and were pasting the crowd with fire bombs dojango was assembling a powerful lamp morley and i snatched bows and scattered arrows wherever it looked like the panic was fading i told morley like the pregnant lady told her guy its time we took steps i started down the stair again armed with sword and unicorn horn straining against the weight of my pack of lethal confections morley elected the same weapons and snuggled his pack a little tighter dojango chose to bear horn and crossbow his pack was empty so he left it the grolls shrugged their packs back on but didnt arm themselves with anything but their clubs which they had dragged in through all the difficulties of the entry cave tied to their belts and trailing like fat stiff tails prisoners first morley asked i wouldnt even if they could be trusted theyd get in the way straight ahead where the women are going that will be where the masters hole up we reached the cavern floor the grolls went ahead swinging their clubs muttering to himself morley minced around an ankledeep pool of filth he flicked a toe at a night creature some were trying to fight back now tinnie and rose added shrieks to the uproar in a free second i saluted them with my sword they didnt appreciate the gesture morley kicked a human thighbone out of his path you ever wondered what bloodslaves feed on while the disease is running its course no and i dont want you to tell me we climbed toward the gap through which the females had fled it was a hole maybe four feet tall and three wide it was clogged with bloodslaves trying to reach the protection of their masters the grolls hammered them with all the passion of miners whod hit a gravel reef and you wanted to bring mules morley crowed dojangos crossbow thunked creaked thunked again as he sniped at a hero with designs on the lamp we had left at the entrance the night people began to press in not good armed or not there is only so much that can be done against such numbers i still had a few tricks folded up my sleeves and tucked into my boots but i wanted to hoard those as long as i could the grolls opened the hole morley spoke to them they threw oncehuman trash aside and wriggled through i followed with the lucifer stone morley came last nothing tried coming through after us well we made it to the heart of the nest just like the heroes in the old stories only that was the hard part for them the hard part is just beginning for us the brides of blood had ranged themselves before the stone biers of their lovers who had not awakened there were fifteen of them in only four had the disease run its full course one of those i had faced across a table in full harbor in a house where i had loved another in whom the disease was only a few years along and still reversible beside her stood a man whose face betrayed him as he who had passed me a note she shuddered when she met my gaze slipped her hand into his well did you ever want to cry from the hole behind us dojango said theyve got the lamp and the fires are out dont look like theyre up for breaking in here though figure we got troubles enough already she here garrett yeah cut her out of the herd and lets get on with it i beckoned kayean she came eyes downcast towing the man the other brides and the eight or so bloodslaves with them hissed and shuffled the tip of morleys unicorn horn intercepted kayeans man and rested on his throat where is he clement kill him here dotes dont take him back if i dont take him back theyll kill me where is he which was all very interesting what the hell was going on back there the bloodslaves pointed past the brides hiding with the children you wont get him out without waking the masters he stared at me eyes filled with appeal take her out before they wake up an excellent suggestion and one i would have loved to have put into effect except that though unspoken we had come in knowing that if we went out again we would be leaving them dead behind us it had less to do with emotion than necessity if we left them alive they would be after us as soon as the sun went down there would be no outrunning them and they dared not let us go they would have the karentine army all over them as soon as we reported the location of the nest we need to talk morley later come out of there valentine something stirred hissed back among the biers the hissing formed words but just barely come get me i said folks things are going to get nasty in a minute some are going to die the real death you dont want it to be you im taking volunteers to sneak out to the big cavern we pull this off you can migrate to another nest and if we didnt we would be their midnight snack after a few seconds one of the newer females started toward us eyes downcast most male bloodslaves become what they are by choice few women do they are selected and collected for the masters by night traders like zeck zack one of the old females objected she tried to stop the deserter dojangos bolt hit her square in the forehead driving four inches into her brain she fell and flopped around the bolt wasnt enough to kill her but plenty to scramble her mind i let the volunteer through anybody else the old females looked at the fallen one listened to the creak of the crossbow rewinding hissed back and forth and decided to leave us to the mercy of their masters one by one the crowd departed the little ones too they have no loyalty to one another at all kill that thing morley snapped he repeated himself in grollish marsha thumped the flopping woman till she stopped valentine come out hissing again i raised the lucifer stone overhead so i could look at this creature who so interested morley dotes then a lot came together i knew that face valentine permanos six years back the kingpins chief lieutenant one valentine permanos and his brother clement had vanished with half the kingpins fortune there had been rumors about them running to full harbor morley would have to come across with more numbers to make it all add up but i saw enough of the edges to relax with my allies lets do it garrett dotes said getting a twohanded grip on his unicorn horn valentine permanos began shaking one of the still forms his face was a horror they say the swiftness of the diseases progress depends a great deal on the will of its victim this one was much farther gone than his brother he wanted to become one of them i recalled old rumors that he had been dying a slow death when he scooted on the kingpin morley drove his horn straight into the heart of the first vampire he reached so did i the body shuddered its eyes opened for a moment and filled with that look of betrayal then glazed over morley did another one so did i he got a third i lined one up morley cursed dojango throw me another horn thats a hundred marks morley whats wrong with the one you got actually its stuck in his goddamn ribs now throw me another horn i moved to my fourth victim my shakes were going away six more after this one over the hump we would be headed out in a few minutes i drove the horn down with no warning the one valentine was shaking flung itself toward me i twisted away dojangos hasty bolt ripped its face open morley whacked it with his horn the ceiling was so low the grolls had to stay on their knees still doris managed to bounce his club off the vampires chest the monster leaped back from whence it had come eyes burning amazed hissing something we werent meant to understand i noted the huge ruby pendant it wore then grabbed morleys shoulder and kept him from pursuing it get back here now i backed up thats the bloodmaster himself touch me everybody touch me what the hell do it hands clasped onto me close your eyes i palmed a sweaty slip from my sleeve ripped it open i counted to ten expecting claws and fangs to rip me with each beat i opened my eyes they were all up now they had their hands to their temples and their maws open in soundless screams they swayed back and forth with the madness two minutes i yelled less than two minutes to finish it lets go i admit i did less than charge headlong i didnt completely trust the old witchs magic and the bloodmaster looked like he was less than incapacitated it was gruesome work work in which i take no pride even though it was them we slaughtered and threw behind us so the grolls could hammer their heads to pulp we didnt get through it easily either for even in their two minutes of madness they knew they were being attacked i picked up a dozen shallow claw gashes that would require careful attention later morley nearly got his throat ripped out because out of some weird nobility he tried to leave the bloodmaster for me groll clubs hammered that old monsters skull and not a second too soon dojango was yelling about goingson in the big cavern where the crowd had decided to get involved after all morley was busy trying to get his prisoner sewed up i yelled at the grolls to turn around then threw kayean and her guy out of the way so they wouldnt get stomped doris chucked dojango back started stabbing with his club driving the bloodslaves back i heard a sharp whine turned morley was pulling a unicorns horn out of clements chest i snarled that wasnt necessary i glanced at kayean wondering if she was going to go now she sank down beside clement and held his hand again i faced the hole shucked my pack and pitched a few fire bombs past the grolls that drove the bloodslaves back lets go i ordered i glanced back morley was on his way dragging his prisoner kayean was rising reluctantly her face as cool as the death shed nearly become but dojango damn you dojango what the hell are you doing hey garrett you know what a genuine bloodmasters bloodstone is worth look at this sucker it must be three or four thousand years old three or four thousand years for that long the monster had preyed upon humanity i hoped they had a special place for him where they stoked the fires especially hot i dove through the hole behind the grolls and scattered the rest of my fire bombs and arced a couple of flares into the crowd the screaming picked up again i dropped to one knee wooden sword ready while the grolls flailed around with unprecedented fury a hand dropped onto my shoulder i glanced up into sad gentle possibly forgiving eyes morley plopped pack and prisoner on the other side of me and started flinging his bombs i heard dojangos crossbow thunk morley asked what the hell did you do in there garrett later i know sorcery when i smell it what else do you have up your sleeve lets free the prisoners and start hiking the denizens of the pit had faded back but they were gathering before the steps of the tunnel to the world they had not given up if they stopped us their way of life would remain secure they could wait until one of their borntotheblood children was old enough and tough enough to make himself bloodmaster an arrow arced down out of the gloom and thunked into marshas shoulder someone had gotten to the gear we had left at the entrance to the cavern what was merely a nuisance to a hidethick groll could be lethal to the rest of us move it i snarled your meat up top dojango rose and tinnie howled like an alley full of cat fights we pushed over to the cages most of the captives were as colorless as their captors the night people didnt drain them quickly like a spider most were too far gone to realize what was happening i was surprised they were even alive as somebody had said the cantard had been too quiet for the hunting to be good hello saucerhead i ignored the womens cage are you going to be as stubborn as usual i dont want to leave you here give it to saucerhead not much brains but plenty of spunk he worked up a grin no problem garrett im unemployed i got fired on account of i couldnt keep us from getting into this fix he had enough wounds to show hed damned well tried he was blue with the cold the arctic chill id hardly noticed in my frenzy to get in and get out youre free to take a job then consider yourself on retainer you got it garrett how about you vasco still think you can get rich by stopping me look here this is dennys girl how much longer you figure she would have been good a year maybe if you were lucky all your buddies died for nothing dont preach at me garrett dont push just get me out of here ill bury my own dead his teeth chattered how about you spiney i never had any quarrel with you garrett i got none now good enough there were two karentine soldiers in with them they were the worse for wear too i didnt think it worth my time to ask if they would give me any grief meantime morley chatted up the ladies they were in a separate cage rose was ready to deliver the moon if we would just get her out me was the word i heard not us lovable thoughtful familyoriented rose tinnie behaved with as much decorum as the circumstances allowed i decided to give her a closer look if we ever got out of there think we ought to turn them loose morley asked up to you they might slow us down it takes longer to tell than it took to happen even so dojango decided hed had enough you guys quit jacking around or my brothers and i walk without you he had the bloodstone and several unicorn horns and though he was feeling wealthy he was also worried about living to enjoy his gains his crossbow thunked an instant later an arrow hissed overhead hes got a point morley morley spoke to the grolls they opened all the cages with a few wellplaced club strokes over dojangos protests morley and i passed out unicorn horns the grolls tossed our last few flares onto the steps and we headed for freedom freedom was a coy bitch our first charge looked like it would carry through but they swarmed threw everything at us utterly determined to keep the secret of the nest and i mean threw everything filth bones rocks themselves and some were almost as tough as their masters we lost every one of the older prisoners who had tagged along they were unarmed and as slow as men in a syrup bath one of the soldiers fell vasco took a wound but managed to keep his feet i collected another assortment of scratches saucerhead went down and had trouble getting up when doris grabbed him and started carrying him the monsters swarmed all over him i thought he was a goner for sure when i saw he was still alive i had to overcome selfdisgust for momentarily wishing hed died so we wouldnt have to drag him out then the night people fell back and were silent i wondered why noting there were only about thirty of them left willing to fight then i noticed that the last two flares were about to die in moments they would have us in their element darkness time then for another one from up my sleeve one i had expected to have to use earlier than this everybody get in close here leave something sharppointed out face uphill and close your eyes there were those who wanted to ask questions and those who wanted to argue i lied those who dont do what i say are going to end up blind morley snapped orders in grollish the triplets did what i wanted that damned doris was up and lugging saucerhead again the last flare died rustle and scrape as the night people began moving this one was actually in my boot not up my sleeve i said close your eyes and ripped the paper open a blast of sulfurous air overrode the stench of the cavern light slammed through my eyelids night people shrieked i counted to ten slowly eyes open lets move the enveloping light had waned to a tolerable glare the old witch had said it was good for several hours the light was much like that of the sun the night people found it excruciating if they didnt get out of it quickly it would destroy what served them as sanity we went up the steps i ripped rags off a fallen bloodslave threw them over kayean to shield her from the light she was already in pain morley and dojango wanted to stop and play with the bows we had left get out while you can i snarled our luck has been too damned fantastic already lets not push it marsha grabbed dojango and started dragging everybody else started hiking when he saw he would have to play alone morley grabbed his booty and joined the retreat there was no respite the tunnel was one place the night people could escape the light and once free of its maddening influence they became rabid terrible enemies again nevertheless we outran them to the mouth of the world what the hell is this stuff morley growled as we struggled through the webbing or netting or wire that had materialized in the mouth of the cave during our time below how the hell should i know just get through it i was fussing over kayean she hadnt spoken a word yet but she was whining like a baby at first i thought it was fear of going out into a world she hadnt seen in years then i realized it was because the tangle we were in was wire and the metals touch hurt who put it there my money was on zeck zack but where had he gotten the wire and what did its presence mean to us we broke out it was broiling summer hot out there midnight morley groaned we were down there longer than i thought keep moving lots to do yet we were halfway down to the desert floor when the screaming started behind us there was pain in it but it was mostly frustration and rage dojango gasped they say those things can recover from almost anything you think any of the masters will come around i told the truth i dont know well tell the army first chance we get we hustled across to our camp there was a threequarter moon so the going was quick though kayean kept whimpering at the brightness so did morleys prisoners as we climbed to our camp dotes said well have to pack them in moist earth and wrap them up good to protect them from the sun we have to do some talking too i suppose so what happened to the major tinnie do you know she was sticking as close to me as kayean was the one who arrested us i dont know i guess he got killed when the vampires attacked vasco did you see what happened to him i was too busy anybody rose said i thought i saw them carry him away but maybe i was wrong he wasnt in the cages when you showed up maybe they ate him dojango suggested we have the right number of bodies morley said then he gave me a sudden odd look as though he suspected me of knowing something i hadnt shared i did but i hadnt shared it only because it had hit me just minutes before i whispered that name that kept turning up on those haveyouheardof lists the one id heard but couldnt remember i remembered and a legendary venageti agent supposedly a shapeshifter also supposedly caught and killed but if he was why are some folks with venageti connections so interested in him i dont know and i dont think i want to know all im interested in now is moving myself from this godforsaken here to there where i can sit down to my first healthy meal in a month but i suppose we have to protect ourselves you think we rescued him theres a chance which one take your pick not the women no one would know the other had changed id vote for someone about his size always assuming hes still with us always assuming that we were pleasantly surprised to find our camp as we had left it unplundered and the horses uneaten and patiently waiting morley sent marsha off for a load of moist earth he assumed the job of sentinel the rest of us doctored one another when i was satisfied that i wouldnt succumb to the disease through my wounds i hunted for dotes he was perched on a boulder contemplating the desert between our camp and the mesa he said you havent said a word to her ill talk to her when she wants to talk for now im satisfied with her letting me bring her out after what you did to clement its time you explained the latest moves in morleys game i suppose otherwise youll badger me incessantly you knew that six years ago the kingpins number one walked with half his plunder old news i also heard that he and his brother ran off to full harbor it took them a couple of years to find that out the kingpin sent some men down they must have stirred things up the same way we did something happened to them they only got one report back it said valentine wasnt in full harbor anymore and that after a fast romance his brother had married a local girl named kronk she had gone off with her husband when he followed his brother wherever then you knew all along who she married yeah but telling you wouldnt have helped you find her his trail was already covered i controlled my anger so the kingpin sent you down here not exactly i volunteered when you asked me to join up with you it was like the answer to a virgins prayer an honesttogod miracle the kingpin was ready to list my name with those sleeping among the fishes it was an out i went and told him the story and said i would get valentine if we could call it even he bought it he wants valentine a lot worse than he ever wanted me so i went ahead and hooked up with you betting the longest odds i ever played hoping you could find the woman and she would have lasted longer with clement than she did with you or your buddy for a while we stared at the desert shapes moved there but none came our way they didnt have the fully developed senses of their masters finally morley started talking again i didnt have the foggiest where it was going till we walked into that place of zeck zacks and found those vampires waiting then it clicked the evidence was there all along i knew valentine back when he was dying a slow death and he had no more conscience than a shark for him it was the logical way to dodge death he probably took the money in case he needed to buy his way in knowing him he probably figured on being bloodmaster within fifty years so the loose ends begin to come together but theres still one big one hanging out who were the people on that ship with the striped sail what were they doing why were they interested in us i had an idea and i thought morleys confessions lent it strong circumstantial support but i meant to reserve that it might prove useful i wasnt convinced that those people were out of the game why take valentine back i asked for the kingpins peace of mind and mine i dont want him doubting for a minute i glanced out at the desert what are they doing those who had come out of the nest behind us were scampering around like blind mice i dont know but ill give you another loose end zeck zack not much we can do about him i should have cut his throat and you criticize me for what red meat does to me marshas back lets pack our prizes what are we going to feed them let them get hungry theyll eat what we give them he dropped off his boulder where do we go now back to full harbor take a peek through the centaurs tunnel see how much excitement there is about us i hate to leave our stuff if we dont have to buying new would stretch the budget too far that innkeeper probably sold everything already well see keep a watch on our friends just in case the major is with us i had a couple tricks up my sleeve yet one of which would probably give me the major but i didnt want to use them if i didnt have to magics of the sort i had gotten from the old witch were too precious to squander we packed our prizes as morley dubbed them in the earth marsha brought wet them down bundled them up and loaded them on the wagon tired though we were i wanted to be traveling with first light before i folded my blanket over kayeans face she met my gaze directly for the first time and rewarded me with a feeble smile the nineteenyearold marine was still alive he could be touched vasco and saucerhead also went into the wagon with a moderately carvedup soldier on the drivers seat doris insisted he was capable of helping marsha pull fine let him if he wanted let him bleed to death i wasnt his mother mrs garrett taught her boys never to argue with grolls we put the women on horseback everyone else would walk like it or not we were ready to head out when morley summoned me to his boulder bring the spyglass when i got there i heard it it came from the direction of the cave i trained the glass there was barely enough light the ones who came out cant get back inside oh my isnt that sad then he muttered something else and pointed oh my twice or thrice i said i guess this means we slip out the back door yep papas coming home jodie goes out the window and keeps moving fast it wont take him long to figure we got out again i could hear them now as well as see them i never saw so many in one mob before he must have rounded up his whole tribe i guessed there were at least five hundred centaurs their advance was a movement of precision to be envied by any cavalry commander they changed directions and formations as easily and quickly as a flock of birds and with no more apparent signaling lets not sit here talking about it while they just prance up and grab us good thinking we got moving zeck zack and his people didnt interfere with us at all though im certain their scouts knew where we were we hastened eastward as fast as we could hoof it with me sort of hanging around the rear staring at backs wondering which if any was the major news of glory mooncalleds adventure had reached every cranny of the cantard the land was coming to life three times we went into hiding while soldiers passed they were all headed south the smallest lot were venageti rangers no telling what they were up to when they heard and decided to head home i didnt care as long as they didnt want to include me in their game of kings morley and i both watched our companions more closely than we did the rangers the major if he was with us didnt give himself away not that i expected him to but i wasnt missing any chances we kept on until everyone was stumbling and kept on still what zeck zack might want to do with us we had no idea but he had no cause to be friendly and there were the other perils of the cantard which glory mooncalled had conjured to life like a shower livens the plants of the desert it seemed we couldnt go five miles without some sort of alarm the nights were more friendly than the days we reached the abandoned mill without falling into misfortune i began to feel optimistic well rest here a day or two i announced some of my comrades by circumstance wanted to argue i told them take it up with the grolls if you can whip them go do what you want i wasnt feeling a bit democratic the only wouldbe sneakoff was rose i had to give the little witch credit for being stubborn and determined no matter what she was going to keep after dennys legacy until she got it she worked on morley but he had reached a state where he had nothing on his mind but watercress sandwiches she worked on saucerhead but he had signed on with my squad and the gods themselves couldnt have moved him until i released him she worked on vasco but he was completely introspective interested only in going home she worked on spiney prevallet but he said hed had his fill of pie in the sky by and by and told her to go to hell she decided to take the future by the horns herself i caught her with a sharpened piece of firewood trying to decide the best place to stick it into the bundle containing kayean im afraid i lost my temper i sprawled her across my lap and applied the stick to her posterior morley said you should have left her with her spiritual family she gave him a look to sear steel i think his remark hurt her more than the spanking though a person of her temperament was the sort to turn the thrashing into a grudge worth nursing for years it sent her off to sit alone and reweave her skein of selfjustification come the next night while we were waiting for dojango to come back with a report on our standing in the city she decided to go her own way morley reported her defection shall we let her go i guess not chances are shed get herself enslaved or killed and i have an obligation to her family we know she wont learn from experience so theres no point letting her suffer for educations sake and if she did get through shed just set us up for something unpleasant tinnie was sitting beside me her shoulder half an inch from mine wed been rehashing those things men and women talk about when they have other things on their minds you really ought to ditch her garrett morley sighed tinnie said his conscience wouldnt let him and neither would yours morley dotes he laughed conscience what conscience im too sophisticated to have one and garrett is too simple i said go get her morley and put hobbles on her once he had gone tinnie asked would he really let her pay him no nevermind red we talk that way but its just talk rose was not fighting when marsha lugged her back into the circle of light cast by our fire the fight was out of her morley came to report she ran into something out there we scared it off she wont say what it was but you might consider a double watch and maybe a prayer for dojango right i took care of it and resumed my seat considering rose across the fire feeling moody tinnie touched my arm and said garrett when we get home if we get home is soon enough to talk about when we get home it came out more curt than id intended she fell into a silence as sullen as my own dojango waited until afternoon to return his report was exactly what i wanted to hear nobody in full harbor was the least interested in a band of nosies from tunfaire nothing unusual had taken place while we were away all the talk was about glory mooncalled and the epic dustup taking shape down south our things were still at the inn being preserved by an innkeeper who felt kindly disposed because we had left him the clothing and possessions of those thugs wed thrown into the streets mothernaked or so he says dojango editorialized actually well watch him lets get it packed up i want to hit that tunnel as soon after dark as we can did you make the other arrangements no trouble theyll be delivered to the back door of the inn they should be waiting when we get there what about shipping complications shouldnt be any actually its done all the time every ship headed north carries a few for families that can afford it strictly routine actually good morley one problem left and tonight would be the time for it to make itself apparent we wandered away from the others slowly keeping our backs toward them you have any candidate in mind he asked pressed id have to call vascos name but hes the only one i know well enough to know hes not acting normal and hes got good enough reasons you have a move in mind a test right after we come out of the tunnel i want dojango marsha and saucerhead to go through first you and me and doris will bring up the rear if we load the rest down with what has to be carried theyll be surrounded and have their hands full when it happens you could go to work for the kingpin scheming like that ive got to bring it off before its any good this isnt some stupid kid we can pluck like some ripe pear hes going to have moves and plans of his own we wouldnt have it any other way would we we ventured back during the afternoons course we passed the word on the nights festivities though some were not pleased with my dispositions they were all realistic enough to understand that i would put people i trusted most where they would do the most good that was the disposition we assumed when we broke camp except for having the grolls take turns pulling the wagon i told saucerhead he could ride until we neared the wall but he insisted that he had healed enough to hike vasco and the wounded soldier also hoofed it saying they wanted to keep loose morley and i trudged along eating everybodys dust a time or two i moved up to make sure kayeans wrappings were holding after the second check i dropped back and said ive noticed you havent done anything to keep your prize from starving kayean threw up almost everything i gave her when i unwrapped her i had to make certain her hands and feet were bound i had clipped her claws first chance after we had come out of the nest she still had her teeth and the hunger was upon her though when she was rational she was game enough in battling the disease you also notice hes gone into the long sleep that gets them when theyre starving hell last till we make tunfaire and thats all i need much as i disliked the deed itself i now suspected that morley had done the best thing by killing clement clements death had freed kayean without a word having been exchanged i somehow understood that she had marched through the doorway to hell only because that was the pathway her husband had taken and she was a witherthougoest kind of lady for his part i think clement made his move sixty percent out of conscience and remorse forty percent out of spite kayean wasnt wearing white because she was his bride one of the masters had taken her from him i hoped she hadnt been forced to bear one of their soulless brats i didnt believe any woman could recover from that it all went perfectly with rescuees carrying our prizes into the tunnel it was spacious enough for the wagon but i didnt want to be found roaming the streets with army property i couldnt explain having we could hire something on the other side morley and i were fifty feet from the tunnels end with doris behind us when it happened up ahead marsha started booming his lungs out damn it morley swore he translated ambush nine men one woman stripedsail bunch they must have made dojango while he was in town i wanted to hold on to this forever i said dipping into a boot grab on to me tell doris too beyond the tunnels end rose started yelling garrett help morley morley muttered shut up you stupid bitch stupid she figures she just solved her whole problem for nothing roses yelling stopped with a smack so loud we heard it back in the tunnel against the wall i said they held onto me i ripped the paper spell open two seconds later four guys with swords galloped into the tunnel ready for anything they looked around and didnt find it one yelled aint nothing in here i didnt hear the reply they withdrew what now morley breathed as long as we move slowly and dont make any noise or any sudden moves they wont see us or know where we are well slide out and see whats going on what was going on was that the two thugs i knew from the stripedsail ship with a woman who appeared to be in charge and seven other men had my folks lined up against a wall in the storage basement where the tunnel began marsha they kept contained with a ballista almost as heavy as a field piece in half a minute their questions made it obvious they were after a specific person but didnt mind trampling a few others along the way my folks just looked at them baffled except rose who put on a great crying act i gathered that tinnies was the hand that had reddened her cheek well morley whispered we can take them if doris gets that ballista we dont need any blood in it well bluff you go over there and yell for everybody to freeze when doris busts up the ballista ill put a knife to the ladys throat take these i gave him a couple of throwing stars from my collection of ungarrettlike weapons he needed no further explanation he told doris what to do we parted i drifted toward the lady commander no doubt the woman about whom master arbanos had been so dubious dojango had begun yammering at her explaining that everyone else in the several parties that had gone out of the city had been killed by unicorns or vampires what the hell was that asked one of the men at the ballista whirling around skipper is this place haunted a ballista went up in the air and shattered against the joists supporting the floor above morley yelled everybody freeze i laid the edge of my knife on the womans throat and whispered this is your friendly spook dont even breathe fast good now i suggest you have your boys put down their tools doris pounded three or four men out of sheer youthful exuberance morley tripped and headkicked ugly one when he took a notion to turn on me the lady gave the order and added youre interfering with royal business ill have your not at all i have a damned good idea what youre looking for and ill be happy to help you find it i just dont want my people getting chewed up while youre getting your man do you have some way to pick him out of a crowd pick who out oh she wanted to play coy are you the only person ever born with a brain this is your stalking horse talking i figured your crowd out a month ago i lied i backed her up a careful five steps and in plain voice vented the moments inspiration i also figured out that big one there is on the other side he tried to kill me in leifmold which would have just ruined your whole scheme big one started moving toward the nearest weapon two throwing stars hit him followed in an instant by a grollish fist the woman said that explains one hell of a lot i thought we were snakebit all right what do you want garrett for me and mine to be left the hell alone take your man if you can pick him out im all for that because i dont like what hes got planned for me hell ill narrow it down for you ive been working on it i know who hes not if hes anybody he could have been killed out there a lot of men were i gave orders the women saucerhead dojango and marsha the latter three lugging kayean and valentine moved to one side i said do your shopping among whats left will you let me go why not you dont seem to be a suicidal lady youre going to find out if you call me lady one more time morley snickered youve made a friend for life garrett what she had to say to him does not bear repetition she asked me whats in those bundles what i came after i turned her loose morley was flickering around the edges because of too many hasty movements so was doris i had stayed slow though so i figured i was still good i tiptoed after the woman who was not a lady she examined the crop dipped a hand into a pocket brought out an amulet built around a piece of amber with an insect embedded spiney prevallet went from somnolent indifference to explosive fury so suddenly i would have been astounded if id had time he knocked the amulet away with one hand and seized the womans throat with the other i pricked the wrist of that hand with my knife sliced his cheek then got back out of the way because that pardon the expression lady was going to work i found a part of me glad the villain had not been vasco spiney ran for it the woman snagged her amulet and raced after him her minions those still upright did nothing because they werent sure what we would let them do fade morley suggested yes dojango was many things some of them things i didnt like but he was not stupid the moment he saw some folks preoccupied he started getting other people out of there spiney tried for the exit himself and ran headon into a grollish fist the woman jumped him immediately forced the amulet into his mouth while he was still groggy he began to change i have heard that a shapeshifter has no true shape of its own that it does not even have a sex as we know it but just splits into unequal masses when it comes time to reproduce i dont know spiney changed into the major then into a character who looked vaguely piratical then into a woman vaguely familiar apparently regressing through identities assumed in the past everyone else was out i wasnt curious enough to stay and see the ultimate form the venageti agent assumed i had no reason to presume any excess of good will on the part of the stripedsail people it was a dawnthreatening hour when we reached the inn i had let the soldiers go their ways betting they would be so happy to get back alive that theyd cause no immediate grief morley and i had an argument he thought we should have fed them to the stripedsail gang who would have kept them busy answering questions while we got out of town a brief interview with the innkeeper confirmed my suspicions in that direction he had kept our quarters open and had maintained our gear intact at the behest of the stripedsail crowd who had hoped we would come back so they could catch our trail again which they had done with dojangos visit i slept like the dead for five hours then went out looking for transportation home my luck was limited i went back and announced first ship with room enough for all of us doesnt leave till day after tomorrow the glory mooncalled situation has the fainterhearted civilians heading north the scow i did find is a garbage pail but the next best chance means waiting more than a week i did not mention that even this sleaziest of transports had stretched my remaining expense money to its limit wed all get hungry if it was a very long passage home i sat beside morley ill never take another job that takes me out of tunfaire even if theres a hundred thousand in it for me speaking of money when are we going to get paid its not critical to me because i didnt sign on for the pay but the triplets did and theyre starting to wonder itll have to wait till i can corner tate and gouge him again i committed what i had left to getting us home theyre trusting you garrett dont disappoint them you know me better ill get my money out of tate one way or another and you guys will get yours dojango where are those boxes hed just come in you didnt drink up that money i gave you did you actually i just came to tell you theyre here on a wagon out back the landlord is having a fit that they might upset his customers if we bring them inside morley grumbled ill go have a fit of dancing on his head we put our prizes into their caskets that night they were the standard cheap shipper coffins folks from up north bought to bring their sons home from the war dojango admitted that he had gotten some drinking done he had gotten a buy on the coffins because the long quiet spell in the cantard had caused a depression in the full harbor casket industry i was irritated but didnt press after dark i took my prize out and got her cleaned up before i installed her in her coffin tinnie helped with the trickier parts and kayean wasnt too much trouble she didnt do any screaming i wondered what sorcery went into the creation of those white gowns kayeans refused to be damaged and soil would not cling morley was less fastidious he put some fresh dirt in the other box unwrapped his prize dumped it in began nailing the lid down he had to ask marshas help when the pounding wakened valentine and he started screaming and trying to break out wed just gotten him quieted down and the landlord off our backs again when zeck zack came calling the centaur came alone and started out friendly enough he pranced in looked us over asked did you bring her out mr garrett yes may i see her i havent seen her since she followed her idiot husband into shadow her and her damned twisted sense of what is right i should have stopped her somehow might have been nice morley and saucerhead gave him ferocious scowls tharpe didnt know him at all i feared there would be sparks but he disarmed them by saying i never laid a hand on her and i never would despite my reputation and not just because her father was a friend of mine as morley had observed before another one i opened the casket she was sleeping the centaur looked for a while then backed off thats enough close it can she be cured mr garrett i think we reached her in time she fought it all the way i think shes got enough left good then we can get down to business someone among you took something from the nest that rightfully belongs to my people that drew some puzzled looks the bloodmasters amulet his symbol of power the nests bloodstone i dont know who started laughing first he gathered his dignity like a cloak gentlemen i went through years of hell and humiliation in order to find that gateway so my folk could cleanse that nest and gain enough booty and bounty money to migrate out of the cantard you can have your two bloodslaves one of them i owe and the other isnt worth enough to make a difference but everything else in that hole is mine we exchanged looks dojango was getting nervous i didnt want to start anything but i wasnt going to tolerate the centaurs tone either youve got more balls than brains if you think you can walk in here talking like that you could get yourself hurt i dont have any swords hanging over my head now mr garrett and i have friends in town who will be happy to help me recover my property now thats an interesting coincidence i said just yesterday i made a new friend a lady down from tunfaire rounding up the venageti priests friends i wasnt going to mention your name he stared at me a moment decided my bluff needed calling go ahead meantime get that bloodstone out to my place before sundown tomorrow or find kayean a new guardian hes insane morley said you should have let me kill him when i wanted to its going to be trickier doing it here zeck zack said a large group of my friends are waiting in the street theyd rather not disturb anything in such a public place but they will come in if im not out in a reasonable time go on i said get out before i call your bluff he went but left an admonition to get the bloodstone to him by next sundown or else dojango asked youre not going to give it to him are you garrett morley snarled were going to give it to him all right only it aint going to be what he wants i said take it easy morley think hes trying to set us up i know and its going to be a shame to abort his scheme because its a wowser for a creature as mentally handicapped as a centaur weve got plenty of time lets get some sleep and worry about it tomorrow i woke up very late and what dragged me from dreamland was saucerhead tharpe and the grolls stomping in i popped up id been left alone with the women and vasco i checked myself for knife wounds wherere morley and dojango what have you guys been up to around somewhere saucerhead said in his slow way i think morley said something about getting something decent to eat we took the coffins and most of our stuff down to the ship so wed be ready to go tomorrow morning i grumbled a bit and went for a breakfast of my own i didnt worry much until afternoon rolled around and still there was no sign of morley or dojango i started fisheying saucerhead who had something on his conscience and was doing a poor job of hiding it then i found the bodies actually they werent bodies they were kayean and valentine bundled up and concealed under some odds and ends and junk and straw left from when the place had been a stable then i knew what morley had done saucerhead looked relieved he told me he said just sit tight and pretend theyre around somewhere if anybody asks two minutes later i noticed that my last paper spell fold was missing i couldnt guess what morley planned to do with it since there was no way he could know what would happen when he opened it i tried fifty lines of reasoning but fixed on none of them there was no predicting a darkelfin breed like morley when afternoon gave way to evening i started prowling the grolls got restless too and might have gone off if they hadnt the strictest of orders my game of tease with tinnie lost its savor rose got nervous because everyone else was though she didnt know what was going on only saucerhead was able to relax i have to fight the temptation to say that it was because he wasnt smart enough nothing happened until just before midnight when one of zeck zacks friends came to chide us for not having delivered i told him were right here waiting whenever he wants a piece of us tell him hed better bring a box lunch because its going to take awhile to get the job done the messenger departed a little flustered i wondered how the centaurs nerves were doing out in the graveyard or wherever he was planning to take us when we tried sneaking up on him i was willing to bet hed planned for every contingency but us sitting tight i hoped morley hadnt walked into any of his plans two hours later the handful of people left in the common room began buzzing i went to find out why rumors were flying about a large fire out in the narrows hills one of the mansions there morleys opening move i presumed there was nothing more for another three hours then dojango stumbled in wounded pale barking in grollish he flopped down as doris and marsha stamped out well i demanded theyre going to pick up the coffins i looked him over tinnie helped she had a fair touch with wounds that all you have to tell me morley sent me back cause i got hurt actually hes still out there working them if that critter gets out of this alive it sure wont be on the cheap and that was all he would say awhile later the grolls came tramping back in with the coffins the landlord was right behind them raising hell about our bunch stomping back and forth through the common room during quiet hours im never leaving tunfaire again i promised myself once more and snarled quit your bitching youve made a bundle because of us playing all the sides and well be out of your hair in an hour anyway do us all a favor and make yourself disappear i looked so nasty he had no trouble getting the hint we refilled and sealed the coffins and gathered what remained of our possessions for tinnie and rose and vasco and saucerhead tharpe that meant no work at all their adventures had left them with nothing but the clothing on their backs i wondered if i ought to put a burr under dojangos saddle recalling how meticulously he had gone over the ruins of their last encampment salvaging coins and jewelry the night people had discarded i decided the wiser course was to keep everyone dependent upon my charity we marched out to the sighs of the landlord and his crew we reached and boarded our ship without suffering misadventure time passed the tide turned the sailors prepared to cast off and still there was no sign of morley where the hell is he dojango he said dont worry he said go ahead he said dont hold up anything on his account dojango said it but he didnt feel it he wanted to do something i didnt believe it morley dotes wouldnt sacrifice himself for anyone here he comes saucerhead said the deck crew was paying out the last lines fore and aft he was coming for sure in that sort of wild sprint only elfin can manage zeck zack was thirty yards behind and gaining fast perfect dojango whispered perfect like hell morley wasnt going to make it without help i looked around for a weapon and couldnt find anything now dojango said and actually the stripedsail woman and her crew materialized from amid the freight on the pier they all carried ready crossbows morley whipped past zeck zack skidded to a halt stood there shuddering morley leaped from the pier to the ship teeth glistening in a grin is this the one the woman called the very one darling morley gasped the gang closed in on the centaur you damned fool i yelled at morley you could have been killed but if youll notice i wasnt the passage north was slower than it had been going south the winds were less friendly but it was almost as eventless there was a spot of trouble one night when rose tried pushing kayean over the side but she collected only bruises for her trouble there were no encounters with pirates privateers venageti or even karentine naval vessels we made leifmold and i almost believed the gods had decided to lay off me for a while roses assault on kayean was due to my lack of foresight i was taking her out of her box at night giving her the chance to breathe real air and face the real light of the stars foodwise i had gotten her to where she could keep down small amounts of lightly browned chicken flesh id left her on deck to fetch some and had gotten into an argument with tinnie who felt i should be apportioning my time somewhat differently rose made her move and took her lumps in my absence i found out what was happening only when one of the ships night watch told me rose needed saving i got there in time though kayean almost crossed the line and surrendered to the hunger rose crawled away into the comforting arms of a morley getting back to his cynical ways i calmed and fed kayean and we sat in the starlight awhile watching the wake luminesce and the flying fish leap she finally spoke where are you taking me her words were barely intelligible down in the nests it is said they dont allow their brides to talk she was rusty no one had told her what was going on id just snatched her and dragged her along giving her as much control of her destiny as shed had while she was in the pit so i told her the story and i wound up saying i think you ought to grab it denny wanted you to have it and right now its the only thing youve got going in this whole world she gave me a look that took me back in time i had to take her down and put her away before i did something foolish i returned to the deck to watch the sea unscramble my brain morley came out of the darkness and settled beside me after a while he said i have a statistic i want you to consider garrett of all the guys who have loved her only one is still alive then he was gone the superstitious halfbreed later i took advantage of tinnies conciliatory mood to lay my haunts for a while fate had us overhaul binkeys sequin running up the leifmold channel and i cut a deal with master arbanos even before we made the quay he was vastly amused to see me saddled with rose and tinnie again we laid over three days in leifmold waiting for master arbanos to offload a cargo of army supplies and take on twentyfive tons of smoked cod morley split his time between getting fat eating green leafies and keeping rose too busy to get into trouble the triplets sold one of their unicorn horns and went on a toot i think vasco spent his time thinking about doing himself in the rest of us just waited with me lending a thought or ten to my routine once we reached tunfaire i still had to get myself and my associates paid we tied up at sequins place on the tunfaire waterfront late in the afternoon which pleased me to no end eager as we were to escape the smell of fish and visit old haunts there were things morley and i had to get done before our return became known keeping control until sunset was less difficult because it was only for a short time after hard dark fell we all trooped off and slithered around the citys back ways to the back door of morleys place where everyone and everything willing and unwilling went into temporary hiding i sneaked off to get some advice from the dead man while morley worried about how he was going to consummate his arrangement with the kingpin he had asked saucerhead and me to be his bodyguards when the meet went down for which he would gladly pay your standard fees as soon as garrett delivers me my wages for the last couple of months i figured he had delivered above and beyond the call if mainly to save his own hide and i could do him a favor in return saucerhead signed on because hell do any damned fool thing as long as hes getting paid i swear i did not know what he was going to pull the dead man acted like id just stepped out half an hour ago and had just given him time to work into a comfortable snooze before i came clanging and banging after having fulfilled his reputation for being cranky he asked for my story for five hours i gave it to him he didnt interrupt often as he didnt need more information for anything he thought my precautions against getting stiffed by willard tate would prove needless but supposed they would hurt nothing we talked tough at each other a little while i cleaned up around there then i hightailed it back to morleys to grab thirteen winks before i walked into the tates den news from the cantard was all the talk when i got back you miss a lot when youre traveling it seemed that when all the armies and half armies and whatnots had turned up at indigo springs for the big soirée that would determine who kept the water hole glory mooncalled was gone without a trace except a friendly note to the venageti warlords on his list i liked the guys style i was grinning when i went to work on the tate gate by dawns early light ill get a little of my own back here a sleepy apprentice finally opened up he was too addled to recognize me hows the arm looks good i need to see the old man its you i think so last time i looked it was worldfamous me back with the goods from the wars he dashed away which is something people dont ordinarily do yelling all the way i closed the gate behind me and waited i have to admit that willard tate was a lot sharper at that hour than i will ever be by the time the kid led me in there were steaming cups of tea set out his first words were sit down breakfast will be ready in ten minutes he looked at me expectantly i set my accounts down beside my tea got comfortable took me a sip and said ive got her tinnie and rose too if you want them that old man was downright spooky he glanced at what id placed on the table considered my choice of words gave a nod that said he understood the situation and asked what is she like like nothing you ever imagined like nothing i ever dreamed either even in a nightmare he reached for the accounts may i i pushed them toward him tell me about it while im looking at these the version i gave him was more tightly edited than the one the dead man had gotten but i didnt leave out anything he needed to know to say he was surprised would be putting it mildly to say he took it all well would be understating the short version took two hours and skirted the worst behavior of females surnamed tate i think he caught wind of what i left out though when i finished he said ive checked and you have a reputation for being honest with your expenses bizarre and substantial as these are i suppose theyre justified considering the advance covered almost everything but salaries i informed him between us were maybe a hundred out of pocket mainly because of the cost of bringing the girls home tate grunted shoved the accounts back youll have the balance before you leave and my executors fees thats in the hands of the probate when can i expect delivery tonight but very late probably after midnight i have to help morley with something first morleys business had gotten lost in the editing all right i guess it will have to do then he let me in on why he was being so understanding would you be interested in taking another job after youve recuperated from this one i raised an eyebrow you know the major portion of our business is army boots the most expensive component of a boot is sole leather army specs require thunderlizard hide for soles we have our own contract hunters and tanners trustworthy men all i thought but of late the shipments have been short i saw where he was going and shut him out i had turned out to be crazy enough to go into the cantard but i will never be the screaming sort of psychotic who goes into thunderlizard country besides id made myself a promise never to leave tunfaire again and i never break a promise to myself without my selfs prior permission i let him talk when he ran dry i said i would give it a think and got the hell out with my expense money knowing i would shriek a big no the second i had my executors fees in hand morley had set his meet on wooded creekside ground at the boundary between the real world and the high city of the dukes and barons and stormwardens and whatnot it was a place often employed for such encounters any uproar as might be caused by treachery would bring an army of high city protectors down on everyone over the years the formula and etiquette of a brookside have become fixed as proposer morley set the time of the meet and the size of each party he picked an hour after sundown and four people it would take four of us to lug valentines coffin dojango saucerhead and i would back him the kingpin on agreeing got to pick which end of brookside was his and could come early if he wanted to check the grounds for signs of treachery morley was not permitted an early survey the kingpin agreed to meet an hour after sunset i was helping carry a coffin uphill into a situation that seemed to me to be of no special value to either of the principals the kingpins reputation said he was good for his word if hed made promises to morley he would keep them i couldnt understand why he had agreed to the meet unless his hatred for valentine had overcome his good sense morley dotes was a tough and tricky independent known to be in need of money and tunfaire boasted a dozen men willing to pay large sums for the kingpins life we went up with morley and dojango in front me and saucerhead in back so we bigger guys got most of the weight we parked the coffin carefully morley stayed beside it the rest of us fell back ten steps and kept our hands in plain sight after a while a shadow left the poplars opposite us and came over to morley hes in the box yes open it morley lifted the lid carefully from the foot end looks like it could be him hard to tell in this light morley slammed the lid shut go get a torch then he kicked the coffin this guy isnt going anywhere the kingpins man went away i hoped saucerhead and i were back far enough not to be recognized i was getting a bad bad feeling there was some talk in the woods then somebody struck a spark a torch flared saucerhead said lets get out of here garrett and began backing up i noted that dojango had already vanished morley was easing away from the coffin i drifted with saucerhead got myself behind a nice bush tharpe kept going morley held up about five feet from my side of the box the kingpin and his troops marched up open it said the boss of bosses one of his boys got the job done gods he looks weird another said the kingpin asked what did you do to him dotes morley replied nothing he did it to himself right the kingpin tossed morley a bag major gold from the sound when it hit morleys hand were quits dotes and then the boss of bosses just had to do it he just had to bend down for a closer look youre right morley said youre absolutely right a bone white arm shot up unclipped claws closed in the flesh of an exposed throat a fanged mouth rose to feed the smell of blood bringing the fever on the monster so powerfully it could think of nothing for the hunger the kingpins bodyguards started to do their jobs i started to make tracks morley passed me before id gone a hundred yards he was chuckling which made me even angrier we had one hell of a blowout about it and it might have gotten violent if saucerhead hadnt been there agreeing with everything i said it was the talk of the morning the vampire found surrounded by four dead men feeding so gorged it couldnt defend itself when the uphill protectors arrived they hacked it to pieces then burned the pieces and coffin on the spot they threw the victims into the fire too just to make certain the infection didnt spread we were in the clear but that didnt alter my attitude toward morley meanwhile meanwhile i made a delivery of females to the tate compound as finelooking a set as ever i have seen a pity they had so many nonvisual defects between them though i meant to see tinnie again tate at the gate mate actually as dojango would say tates at the gates mates about fifteen of them including the old man himself such huggings and kissings and tearsheddings and backpattings i am amazed red i said when a lull in the action gave me a chance to get a word in to tinnie youd think they were glad to see you guys tinnie was getting twothirds of the attention but that left plenty for rose only the old man remained aloof when the crest of the storm passed he forced his way to me and asked where is she mr garrett on the wagon he looked he saw nothing but the box youve got her in a coffins did you pay any attention at all last night she cant go wandering around in her condition all right all right suddenly he was a very nervous irresolute little man come on pop youre doing all right get some muscle to do something useful you did get a place ready yes now he was my old aunt wringing hands kayean had become an important bridge to the son he had lost when you looked at it up close you kind of had to feel for rose the living child whose return he hadnt bothered to acknowledge maybe she thought if she got her hands on all that money he would notice her dont expect a lot pop she cant do much but sit and stare at things nobody else sees and probably just as well he didnt know about kayean and me before kayean and denny i was not the boy to clue him but i did admit ive got an emotional investment here too i want you to know something you try any fanciness you treat this woman less than perfectly and you wont have to worry about boot soles and thunderlizard hides anymore i got a little too intense he backed off and gave me the look you give the nut on the corner preaching that pixies are the secret masters and if we dont do something theyre going to run off with our sisters and daughters then he formed a crew of cousins and apprentices and got the coffin moving he had done a room all right nary a window and as lightproof as you could get one very pale consecrated candle burned on a mantel over a fireplace before a large mirror a very black very huge very fat very wrinkled and very old woman sat to one side the tools of her trade on a table beside her i recognized her the mojo woman mama doll tunfaires leading authority on the diseases of the undead maybe i owed somebody an apology a couple of the boys got in ahead with sawhorses the pallbearers deposited the coffin mama doll moved her bulk like it was all the work in the universe first this part of her then that then another got under way like the sailing of a ship of a thousand parts before anyone could mess with the coffin lid she slapped a hand down right above where kayeans would be folded over her heart she rolled her eyes and mumbled to herself for a minute then backed away and nodded while the boys unfixed the lid she grabbed protective amulets from the table a big leadup to a big anticlimax when they lifted the lid kayean did nothing but keep on sleeping i had to go shake her to wake her up it was evident kayean was in control and safe to be near out willard tate ordered everybody get out relatives and apprentices hurried mama doll moved at her usual lugubrious drift garrett stayed where he was the boss turned on me out move me pop i can call the boys i can break both your legs before they get here thats enough kayean said her voice little more than a whisper she touched my arm wait outside a ghost of a smile touched her lips light as a moths kiss i can break his legs if he asks for it her touch was slightly heavier her voice softer thank you for still caring and the boy marine was alive again only two things you can do in a situation like that be a goof or get the hell out i got there was light outside when tate left he was a wrungout exhausted old man he found me blocking his path in a hurried mumble meant to get it over he told me things kayean was going to stay where she was for a while part of her inheritance would be used to buy a home and part invested to create a living so she would be free of worries when mama doll declared her cured of the rest of the fortune she wanted ten thousand given to vasco and the remainder divided among dennys other heirs so rose would make out after all she is in and of the family mr garrett by virtue of my sons love for her you need not be concerned for her we tates take care of our own i guess youre all right mr tate thanks i stepped aside he limped off to his bed she was lying on the bed cold and corpselike in the light of the lonesome candle but at least she was in a proper bed and not laid out in that goddamned coffin i collected the rooms only chair and positioned it silently i stared at her for a long time wrestling with the kid marine i touched her hair which had begun to show a hint of color when i could stand no more i rose bent and brushed those cold lips with mine for the last time i headed for the door i heard a sigh when i glanced back she said goodbye garrett and smiled a real smile i never slowed down i went and wrapped myself around a barrel of beer each year on the anniversary of the day i brought her out of the nest a courier brings a package the gift is never niggardly i know where she lives i never go up that way the probate coughed up my fees four days after i delivered denny tates heir i got in touch with tinnie the redhead and i did some celebrating she was along when i went to visit the dead man she invited herself and she made it stick redheads are stubborn witches she looked at his place and said its a dump garrett its his home its still a dump how do you feel almost broke and kind of good about myself smug selfsatisfaction id call it come on try your witchcraft on him see how far it gets you he woke up the way he always wakes up cranky garrett again i demand that you cease your infernal pestering then he noticed tinnie what is that creature doing here he has no use whatsoever for females of any age or species an attitude i find too parochial but theres no convincing him and i doubt there would be even if he was still alive i tolerate too much from you garrett i reap the gallridden harvest of my indulgence youre going to have to indulge me a lot more now old bones or you might find yourself camped in the street youre talking to your new landlord here after half a minute he asked you bought this place you spent the money from the tate business on it ah that genius still worked yes call it an investment in my future the pestering has just begun for the first time in our acquaintance i had caught him without a comeback the silence stretched i started the housekeeping while he stewed
