let me kill him cara said her boot strikes sounding like rawhide mallets hammering the polished marble floor the supple leather boots kahlan wore beneath her elegant white confessors dress whispered against the cold stone as he tried to keep pace without letting her legs break into a run no cara exhibited no response keeping her blue eyes ahead to the wide corridor stretching into the distance a dozen leather and chainmailclad dharan soldiers their unadorned swords sheathed or crescentbladed battleaxes hooked on belt hangers crossed at an intersection just ahead though their weapons werent drawn every wooden hilt was gripped in a ready fist as vigilant eyes scrutinized the shadows among the doorways and columns to each side their hasty bows toward kahlan only briefly interrupted their attention to their task we cant just kill him kahlan explained we need answers an eyebrow lifted over one icy blue eye oh i didnt say he wouldnt give us answers before he dies he will answer any question you have when im finished with him a mirthless smile ghosted across her flawless face that is the job of a mordsith getting people to answer questionsshe paused as the smile returned to widen with professional satisfactionbefore they die kahlan heaved a sigh cara thats no longer your jobyour life your job now is to protect richard that is why you should let me kill him we should not take a risk by letting this man live no we first have to find out whats going on and were not going to start out doing it the way you want caras smile humorless as it was had vanished again as you wish mother confessor kahlan wondered how the woman had managed to change into her skintight red leather outfit so fast whenever there was so much as a whiff of trouble at least one of the three mordsith seemed to materialize out of nowhere in her red leather red as they often pointed out didnt show blood are you sure he said that this man those were his words yes mother confessor his exact words you should let me kill him before he has a chance to try to bring them to pass kahlan ignored the repeated request as they hurried on down the hall wheres richard you wish me to get lord rahl no i just want to know where he is in case theres trouble i would say that this qualifies as trouble you said that there must be two hundred soldiers holding weapons on him how much trouble can one man cause with all those swords axes and arrows pointed at him my former master darken rahl knew that steel alone could not always ward danger that is why he had mordsith nearby and at the ready that evil man would kill people without even bothering to determine if they were really a danger to him richard isnt like that and neither am i you know that if there is a true threat im not shy about eliminating it but if this man is more than he seems then why is he so timidly cowering before all that steel besides as a confessor i am hardly defenseless against threats that steel wont stop we have to keep our heads lets not start leaping to judgments that may be unwarranted if you dont think he could be trouble then why am i nearly running to just keep up with you kahlan realized that she was a half a step ahead of the woman she slowed her pace to a brisk walk because its richard were talking about she said in a near whisper cara smirked youre as worried as i of course i am but for all we know killing this man if he is more than he seems could be springing a snare you could be right but that is the purpose for mordsith so where is richard cara gripped the red leather at her waist and stretched her armorbacked glove tighter onto her hand as she flexed her fist her agiel an awesome weapon that appeared to be nothing more than a fingerwidth footlong red leather rod dangled from a fine gold chain at her right wrist ever at the ready one just like it but no weapon in kahlans hands hung on a chain around kahlans neck it had been a gift from richard a gift that symbolized the pain and sacrifice they had both endured he is out behind the palace in one of the private parks cara gestured over her shoulder the one that way raina and berdine are with him kahlan was relieved to hear that the other two mordsith were watching over him something to do with his surprise for me what surprise kahlan smiled surely hes told you cara cara snatched a glimpse out of the corner of her eye of course he has told me then what is it he also told me not to tell you kahlan shrugged i wont tell him that you told me caras laugh like her smile before bore no humor lord rahl has a peculiar way of finding out things especially those things you wish him not to know kahlan knew the truth of that so whats he doing out there the muscles in caras jaw flexed outdoor things you know lord rahl he likes to do outdoor things kahlan glanced over to see that caras face had turned nearly as red as her leather outfit what sort of outdoor things cara cleared her throat into her armored fist he is taming chipmunks hes what i cant hear you cara waved an impatient hand he said that the chipmunks have come out to test the warming weather he is taming them her cheeks rounded as she huffed with seeds kahlan smiled at the thought of richard the man she loved the man who had seized command of dhara and had much of the midlands now eating out of his hand having a fine afternoon teaching chipmunks to eat seeds out of his hand well that sounds innocent enough feeding seeds to chipmunks cara flexed her armored fist again as they swept between two dharan guards he is teaching them to eat those seeds she said through clenched teeth out of raina and berdines hands the two of them were giggling she aimed a mortified expression toward the ceiling as she threw her hands up her agiel swung on the gold chain at her wrist mordsith giggling kahlan pressed her lips tight trying to keep from breaking into laughter cara pulled her long blond braid forward over her shoulder stroking it in a way that provoked in kahlan an unsettling memory of the way shota the witch woman stroked her snakes well kahlan said trying to cool the other womans indignation maybe its not by their choice they are bonded to him perhaps richard ordered it and theyre simply obeying him cara shot her an incredulous look kahlan knew that any of the three mordsith would defend richard to the death they had shown themselves prepared to sacrifice their lives without hesitation but though they were bonded to him through magic they disregarded his orders wantonly if they judged them trivial unimportant or unwise kahlan imagined that it was because richard had given them their freedom from the rigid principles of their profession and they enjoyed exercising that freedom darken rahl their former master richards father would have killed them in a heartbeat had he even suspected that they were considering disobeying his orders no matter how trivial they were the sooner you wed lord rahl the better then instead of teaching chipmunks to eat out of mordsith hands he will be eating out of yours kahlan exhaled in a soft lilting laugh thinking about being his wife it wouldnt be long now richard will have my hand but you should know as well as anyone that he will not be eating out of it and i wouldnt want him to if you regain your senses come see me and i will teach you how cara turned her attention to the alert dharan soldiers men at arms were rushing everywhere checking every hall and looking behind every door no doubt at caras insistence egan is with lord rahl too he should be safe while we see to this man kahlans mirth withered how did he get in here anyway did he come in with the petitioners no a professional chill settled back into caras tone but i intend to find out from what i gather he just walked up to a patrol of guards not far from the council chambers and asked where he could find lord rahl as if just anyone can walk in and ask to see the master of dhara as if he was a head butcher that anyone can go to if they want a choice cut of mutton thats when the guards asked him why he wanted to see richard cara nodded i think we should kill him realization wormed up kahlans spine in a cold tingle cara wasnt simply an aggressive bodyguard unconcerned about spilling the blood of others she was afraid she was afraid for richard i want to know how he got in here he presented himself to a patrol inside the palace he shouldnt have been able to get inside wandering around unfettered what if we have a hithertounknown breach in security wouldnt it be better to find out before another comes without the courtesy of announcing himself we can find out if you let me do it my way we dont know enough yet he could end up dead before we find out anything then the danger to richard could become greater all right cara said with a sigh we will do it your way as long as you understand that i have orders to follow what orders lord rahl told us to protect you as we would protect him with a toss of her head cara flicked her blond braid back over her shoulder if you are not careful mother confessor and needlessly endanger lord rahl with your restraint i will withdraw my permission for richard to keep you kahlan laughed her laughter died out when cara didnt so much as smile she was never entirely sure when the mordsith were joking and when they were being deadly serious in here kahlan said its shorter this way and besides i want to see what petitioners are waiting in view of our strange visitor he could even be a diversion to draw our attention away from someone elsethe true threat caras brow twitched as if she had been slighted why do you think i had petitioners hall sealed and ringed with guards you did it surreptitiously i hope theres no need to frighten the wits out of innocent petitioners i told the officers not to frighten the people in there if they didnt have to but our first responsibility is to protect lord rahl kahlan nodded she couldnt argue with that two heavily muscled guards bowed along with twenty others nearby before pulling open the tall brassbound doors leading to an arched passageway a stone rail supported by fat vaseshaped balusters ran along the white marble pillars the barrier separating the petitioners in the hundredfootlong room from the officials passageway was symbolic rather than teal skylights thirty feet overhead lit the waiting room but left the length of the passageway to the muted golden light of lamps hung in the peak of each small vault in its ceiling it was a longstanding custom for peoplepetitionersto come to the confessors palace to seek any number of things from settlement of disagreements over the rights of peddlers to coveted street comers to officials of different lands seeking armed intervention in border disputes maters that could be handled by city officials were directed to the proper offices matters brought by dignitaries of the lands if those matters were deemed to be important enough or could be handled in no other way were taken before the council petitioners hall was where officers of protocol determined the disposition of requests when darken rahl richards father had attacked the midlands many of the officials in aydindril had been killed among them saul witherrin the chief of protocol along with most of his office richard had defeated darken rahl and being the gifted heir had ascended to master of dhara he had ended the bickering and battling among the lands of the midlands by demanding their surrender in order to forge them all into a force capable of withstanding the common threat from the old world from the imperial order kahlan found it unsettling to be the mother confessor who had reigned over the end of the midlands as a formal entity a union of sovereign lands but she knew that her first responsibility was to the lives of the people not to tradition if not stopped the imperial order would cast the world into slavery and the people of the midlands would be its chattel richard had accomplished what his father could not but did so for entirely different reasons she loved richard and knew his benevolent intent in seizing power soon they would be wedded and their marriage would unite the midlands and dhara in peace and unity for all time more than that though it would be a personal fulfillment of their love and deepest desire to be one kahlan missed saul witherrin he had been a capable aide with the council now dead too and the midlands now a part of dhara matters of protocol were in disarray a few frustrated dharan officers were standing at the railing attempting to minister to the petitioners needs as she entered kahlans gaze swept the waiting crowd analyzing the nature of problems brought to the palace this day by their dress most appeared to be people from the surrounding city of aydindril labors shopkeepers and merchants she saw a knot of children she knew from the day before when richard had taken her to watch them playing a game of jala it was the first time she had seen the fastpaced game and it had been an entertaining diversion for a couple of hours to watch children play and laugh the children probably wanted richard to come watch another game he had been an ardent supporter of each team even if he had picked one team to cheer over the other kahlan doubted it would have made any difference children were drawn to richard seeming to instinctively sense his kind heart kahlan recognized several diplomats from a few of the smaller lands who she hoped had come to accept richards offer of a peaceful surrender and union into dharan rule she knew the leaders of those lands and was expecting them to heed her urging to join with them in the cause of freedom she recognized too a group of diplomats from some of the larger lands that had standing armies they had been expected and later that day richard and kahlan were to meet with them along with any other newly arrived representatives to hear their decision she wished richard would find himself something more suitable to wear his woods clothes had served him well but he now needed to present a more fitting image of the position he found himself in he was so much more than a woods guide now having served nearly her whole life as a person of authority kahlan knew that it often smoothed matters of leadership if you matched peoples expectations kahlan doubted people who needed a woods guide would have followed richard if he hadnt dressed for the woods in a way richard was their guide in this treacherous new world of untested allegiances and new enemies he often asked her advice she was going to have to talk to him about his clothes when the people assembled saw the mother confessor striding into the passageway conversation stilled and they began going to a knee in deep bows despite the fact that she was of an unprecedentedly young age for the post there was no one of higher authority in the midlands than the mother confessor the mother confessor was the mother confessor no matter the face of the woman who held the office people bowed not so much to the woman as to that ancient authority matters of confessors were an enigma to most people of the midlands confessors chose the mother confessor to confessors age was of secondary consideration though she was chosen to preserve the freedoms and rights of the people of the midlands people rarely saw it in those terms to most a ruler was a ruler some were good some were bad as the ruler of rulers the mother confessor encouraged the good and suppressed the bad if a ruler proved bad enough it was within her power to eliminate them that was the ultimate purpose of a mother confessor to most people though such far removed matters of governance simply seemed the squabbling of rulers in the sudden silence that filled petitioners hall kahlan paused to acknowledge the gathered visitors a young woman standing against the far wall watched as all those around her fell to one knee she glanced in kahlans direction back to those kneeling and then followed suit kahlans brow tightened in the midlands the length of a womans hair denoted her power and standing matters of power no matter how trivial they might seem on the surface were taken seriously in the midlands not even a queens hair was allowed to be as long as a confessors and no confessors hair was as long as that of the mother confessor this woman had a thick mass of brown hair close to the length of kahlans kahlan knew nearly every person of high rank in the midlands it was her duty and she took it seriously a woman with hair that long was obviously a person of high standing but kahlan didnt recognize her there was likely to be no man or woman in the entire city other than kahlan who would outrank the womanif she was in fact from the midlands rise my children kahlan said in formal response to the tops of the waiting bowed heads dresses and coats rustled as everyone began coming to their feet most keeping their eyes to the floor out of respect or needless fear the woman rose to her feet twisting a simply made kerchief in her fingers watching those around her she turned her brown eyes to the floor as most of the others were cara kahlan whispered could that woman there with the long hair be from dhara cara had been watching her too she had learned some of the customs of the midlands though caras long blond hair was about the length of kahlans she was dharan they didnt live by the same customs her nose is too cute to be dharan im serious do you think she could be dharan cara studied the woman a moment longer i doubt it dharan women dont wear flowerprint dresses nor are the dresses they do wear of that cut but clothes can be changed to fit the occasion or to fit in with local people the dress didnt really fit the local dress of aydindril but it might not be so out of place in other more remote areas of the midlands kahlan nodded and turned to a waiting captain motioning him over he leaned his head close as she spoke in a low tone there is a woman with long brown hair standing against the wall in the back over my left shoulder do you see who im talking about the pretty one in the blue kirtle yes do you know why shes here she said she wished to speak with lord rahl kahlans brow drew tighter she noticed that caras did too what about she said that shes looking for a mancy somethingi didnt recognize his name she said hes been missing since last autumn and she was told that lord rahl would be able to help her is that right kahlan said and did she say what business she has with this missing man the captain glanced to the woman and then brushed his sandy hair back from his forehead she said that shes to marry him kahlan nodded it could be that shes a dignitary but if she is im embarrassed to admit that i dont know her name the captain glanced at a tattered list with scribbles all over it he turned the paper and scanned the other side until he found what he was looking for she said her name was nadine she gave no title well please see to it that lady nadine is taken to a private waiting room where she will be comfortable tell her that i will come speak with her and see if i can help have dinner brought to her along with anything else she might require give her my apology and tell her that i have something of vital importance that i must attend to first but i will come see her as soon as i am able and that i wish to do what i can to help her kahlan could understand the womans distress if she really was separated from her love and was searching for him kahlan had been in that situation herself and knew well the anguish ill see to it at once mother confessor one other thing captain kahlan watched the woman twisting her kerchief tell lady nadine that there is trouble about what with the war with the old world and that for her own safety we must insist that she remain in the room until i can come to speak with her post a heavy guard outside the room place archers at a safe distance down the hall to either side of the door if she comes out insist that she must return to the room at once and wait if you must tell her that it is by my command if she still tries to leavekahlan looked into the captains waiting blue eyeskill her the captain bowed as kahlan swept on through the passageway cara right at her heels well well cara said once outside petitioners hall at last the mother confessor comes to her senses i knew i had a good reason for allowing lord rahl to keep you you will make him a worthy wife kahlan turned down the corridor toward the room where guards held the man i havent changed my mind about anything cara considering our strange visitor im giving lady nadine every chance to live every chance i can afford to give but youre mistaken if you think ill balk at doing whatever it takes to protect richard besides being the man i love more than life itself richard is a man of vital importance to the freedom of the people of both dhara and the midlands theres no telling what the imperial order would try in order to get to him cara smiled sincerely this time i know he loves you the same thats why i dont like you going to see this man lord rahl may separate me from my hide if he thinks i allowed you near danger richard is one born with the gift i too have been born with magic darken rahl sent quads to kill the confessors because there is little danger to a confessor from one man kahlan felt the familiar yet distant anguish of their deaths distant because it seemed so long ago though it had been hardly a year for months in the beginning she had felt as if she should be dead along with her sister confessors and that she had somehow betrayed them by escaping all the traps laid for her now she was the last with a flick of her wrist cara snapped her agiel into her fist even a man like lord rahl born with the gift even a wizard even a wizard and even if unlike richard he knows how to use his power i not only know how to use mine i am very experienced at it i long ago lost count of the number as kahlans words trailed off cara considered her agiel rolling it in her fingers i guess there is even less than little dangerwith me there when they reached the richly carpeted and paneled corridor they were seeking it was thick with soldiers and bristling with steel from swords axes and pikes the man was being held in a small elegant reading room close to the rather simple one richard liked to use for meeting with officers and for studying the journal he had found in the wizards keep the soldiers hadnt wanted to risk an escape attempt and had simply stuffed the man in the room nearest to the spot they found him pinning him down until it could be decided what was to be done kahlan gently took the elbow of a soldier to urge him back out of the way the muscles of his bare arm felt as hard as iron his pike pointed toward the closed door could hardly have been more steady had it been embedded in granite there had to be fifty pikes likewise aimed at the silent door more men gripping swords or axes hunkered beneath the pike points the guard turned as kahlan tugged on his arm let me through soldier the man gave way others glanced back and began moving aside cara shouldered her way ahead of kahlan pushing men out of the way they did so reluctantly not out of disrespect but out of concern for the danger that waited beyond the door even as they moved aside they kept their weapons pointed toward the thick oak door inside the windowless dimly lit room smelled of leather and sweat a lanky man squatted on the edge of an embroidered footstool he seemed too spare should he make the wrong move to permit all the steel aimed at him to find a virgin patch to penetrate his young eyes dithered among the steel and grim glares until he caught sight of kahlans approaching white dress his tongue darted out to wet his lips as he looked up expectantly when the burly soldiers in leather and chain mail behind him saw kahlan and cara forcing their way into the room one of them landed the side of his boot on the small of the young mans back pitching him forward kneel you filthy cur the young man dressed in an outsized soldiers uniform that looked to have been scrounged together from dissimilar sources peered up at kahlan then over his shoulder at the man who had kicked him he ducked his head of disheveled dark hair and shielded it with a gangly arm expecting a blow thats enough kahlan said in a quietly authoritative tone cara and i wish to speak with him all of you wait outside please rahl sent quads to kill the confessors because there is little danger to a confessor from one man kahlan felt the familiar yet distant anguish of their deaths distant because it seemed so long ago though it had been hardly a year for months in the beginning she had felt as if she should be dead along with her sister confessors and that she had somehow betrayed them by escaping all the traps

had kicked him he ducked his head of disheveled dark hair and shielded it with a gangly arm expecting a blow thats enough kahlan said in a quietly authoritative tone cara and i wish to speak with him all of you wait outside please the soldiers balked reluctant to lift a weapon from the young man cowering on the floor you heard her cara said out but an officer began you doubt that a mordsith is capable of handling this one scrawny man now go wait outside kahlan was surprised that cara hadnt raised her voice mordsith didnt have to raise their voices to get people to follow their orders but still it surprised her considering caras nervousness over the young man before them the men began withdrawing turning sideways to eye the intruder on the floor as they filed out the door the knuckles of the officers fist around his sword hilt were white as he backed out last he gently closed the door with his other hand the young man looked up from under his arm to the two women standing three strides away are you going to have me killed kahlan didnt answer the question directly we have come to talk with you i am kahlan amnell the mother confessor mother confessor he straightened on his knees a boyish grin swept onto his face why youre beautiful i never expected you to be so beautiful he put a hand to a knee and began to rise caras agiel was instantly at the ready stay where you are he froze staring at the red agiel before his face and then lowered the knee back onto the fringe of the crimson carpet lamps on the fluted mahogany pilasters supporting shallow pediments over bookcases to each side of the room cast flickering light across his bony face he was hardly more than a boy can i have my weapons back please i need my sword if i cant have that then id like my knife at least cara heaved an irritated sigh but kahlan spoke first you are in a very precarious position young man none of us is in the mood to be indulgent if this is some kind of prank he nodded earnestly i understand im not playing a game i swear then tell me what you said to the soldiers his grin returned as he lifted a hand gesturing casually toward the door well like i was telling those men when i was fists at her side kahlan advanced a stride i told you this is no game youre only alive by my grace i want to know what youre doing here and i want to know right now tell me what you said the young man blinked im an assassin sent by emperor jagang im here to kill richard rahl can you direct me to him please chapter now cara said in a dangerous voice can i kill him the incongruous nature of this harmlesslooking skinny young man kneeling seemingly helpless in enemy territory surrounded by hundreds thousands of brutish dharan soldiers saying so openly and confidently that he intended to assassinate richard had kahlans heart hammering against her ribs no one was this foolish she realized only after the fact that she had retreated a step she ignored caras question and kept her attention riveted on the young man and just how do you think you could accomplish such a task well he said in an offhanded manner as he exhaled i had designs on using my sword or if i must my knife his smile returned but it was no longer boyish his eyes had taken on a steely set that belied his young face thats why i need them back you see youll not be getting your weapons back disdain powered the dismissive shrug of his shoulders no matter i have other ways to kill him youll not be killing richard you have my word on that your only hope now is to cooperate and tell us everything of your plan how did you get in here his smirk mocked her walked walked right in no one paid me any mind theyre not too smart your men theyre smart enough to have you under their swords cara pointed out he ignored her his eyes remained locked on kahlans and if we dont let you have your sword and knife back she asked then what then things will get messy richard rahl will only suffer greatly thats why emperor jagang sent me to offer him the mercy of a quick death the emperor is a man of compassion and wishes to avoid any undue suffering he is basically a man of peace the dream walker but also one of iron determination im afraid ill have to be killing you too mother confessor to spare you the suffering of whats to come if you resist i have to admit though that i dont like the idea of killing such a beautiful woman the grin widened rather a waste kahlan found his confidence grating to hear him claim that the dream walker was compassionate turned her stomach she knew better what suffering he spread his hands i am but a grain of sand the emperor does not share his plans with me i am but simply sent to do his bidding his bidding is that you and richard are to be eliminated if you dont let me kill him mercifully then richard will be destroyed im told that it wont be pleasant so why dont you just let me get it over with you must be dreaming cara said his gaze shifted to the mordsith dreaming maybe youre dreaming maybe im your worst nightmare i dont have nightmares cara said i give them really he taunted in that ridiculous outfit what are you pretending to be anyway maybe youre dressed like that to scare the birds away from the spring planting kahlan realized that the man didnt know what a mordsith was but she wondered how she could ever have thought he looked hardly more than a boy his demeanor was one of age and experience this was no boy the air crackled with peril remarkably cara only smiled kahlans breathing stilled when she realized the man was standing and she couldnt recall seeing him come to his feet his gaze shifted and one of the lamps went dark the remaining lamp cast harsh flickering light against one side of his face letting the other side hide in shadow but for kahlan that act had brought his nature his true threat out of the shadows this man commanded the gift her resolve to spare a possible innocent unnecessary violence evaporated with the heat of need to protect richard this man had been given a chance now he was going to confess all he knewhe was going to confess it to a confessor she had but to touch him and it would be over kahlan had walked among the thousands of corpses of innocent people slaughtered by the order when she had seen the women and children in ebinissia butchered at jagangs command she had sworn undying vengeance against the imperial order this man had proven himself to be part of the imperial order and the enemy of free people he did the dream walkers bidding she focused on the familiar flush of magic deep within herself always at the ready a confessors magic wasnt released so much as her restraint on it was simply withdrawn the act was faster even than thought it was the lightning of instinct no confessor enjoyed using her power to destroy a persons mind but unlike some confessors kahlan didnt hate what she did what she was born to it was simply part of who she was she didnt maliciously use what she was given but used her magic to protect others she was at peace with herself with what she was and what she could do richard was the first to see her for herself and care about her despite her power he didnt irrationally fear the unknown fear what she was instead he had come to know her and to love her confessors power and all for that reason only he could be with her without her power destroying him when they shared their love she intended to use that power now to protect richard and for that reason it was as close as she ever came to valuing her ability she had but to touch this man and the threat would be eliminated retribution was at hand for a willing minion of emperor jagang keeping her gaze firmly fixed on the man kahlan held up an admonishing finger to cara hes mine leave this to me but when his squinting gaze sought the remaining lamp cara swept between them the air cracked as she backhanded him with her armored glove kahlan nearly screamed in rage at the interference sprawled across the carpet the man sat up looking genuinely surprised blood ran down his chin from a split in his lower lip his look changed to genuine displeasure cara towered over him what is your name kahlan couldnt believe that cara who had always professed to fear magic seemed to be deliberately provoking a man who had just shown his command of it he rolled away from her and into a crouch his eyes were on kahlan but he spoke to cara i dont have time for court buffoons with a smile his gaze flicked to the lamp the room plunged into darkness kahlan dove for the spot on the floor where he hunkered she had but to touch him and it would be over she caught only air before hitting the empty floor in the pitch black she wasnt sure which way he had darted she snatched wildly trying to net a part of him she needed but to touch him and even his thick clothes wouldnt protect him she seized an arm and only an instant before releasing her power realized that it was the leather cara wore where are you cara growled you cant get away give it up kahlan scrambled across the carpet power or not they needed light or they were going to be in a great deal of trouble she found the bookcase against the wall and felt along its lower ledge until she saw a faint sliver of light coming from beneath the door men were banging on the other side calling out wanting to know if there was trouble her fingers skimmed up the edge of the molded stile of the door toward the handle as she lurched to her feet she stepped on the hem of her dress and tripped stumbling forward landing on her elbows with a bonejarring thud something heavy smashed into the door where she had almost stood a moment before and crashed down onto her back the man laughed in the darkness as she flailed to shove the thing off her arms whacked painfully against the sharp edges of the stretcher bars of a chairs legs she grappled an upholstered armrest and rolled the chair off to the side kahlan heard the air driven from caras lungs with a grunt as she slammed into a bookcase on the other side of the room the men on the other side of the door pounded into it trying to break it down the door wasnt budging as books across the room were still tumbling and thudding to the floor kahlan sprang up and groped for the handle her knuckles struck the cold metal of the lever she slapped her hand over it with a shriek she was thrown back from a sudden flash and landed on her bottom like sparks from a flaming log struck with a poker a shower of flashes from the handle filled the air her fingers stung and tingled from touching the shield small wonder the men couldnt open the door as she regained her feet recovering from the shock kahlan could see again by the flickering sparkles of light that still slowly drifted toward the floor suddenly cara could see too she snatched a book and flung it at the man near the center of the small room he ducked into a squat quick as a slap cara spun catching him off guard the air resounded with a hard thud as her boot nailed his jaw the blow drove him backward kahlan took aim to leap for him before all the sparks extinguished and it went dark again you die first he railed in rage at cara ill have no more of your trifling interference youll taste my power the air at his fingertips lit with glimmering flashes as he leveled his full attention on cara kahlan had to deal with the threat now before anything else went wrong but before she could leap for him his curled fingers twitched up with a contemptuous sneer he thrust one hand toward cara kahlan expected cara to be the one on the floor next instead the young man crumpled with a cry he tried to stand but collapsed with a shriek hugging himself as if he had been stabbed in the gut the room went black again kahlan reached for the door lever taking a chance that whatever cara had done to him had broken his shield wincing against the pain she feared might still be waiting she seized the handle the shield was gone relieved she twisted the lever and yanked the door open light from behind the crowd of soldiers pierced into the dark room confounded faces peered in kahlan didnt need a roomful of men getting themselves killed while trying to save her from things they didnt understand she shoved the closest man back he has the gift stay out she knew that dharans feared magic they depended on the lord rahl to fight magic they were the steel against steel they often said and lord rahl was supposed to be the magic against magic give me a lamp men to each side simultaneously snatched lamps from brackets beside the door and held them out kahlan grabbed one and kicked the door shut as she turned back to the room she didnt want a pack of musclebound weaponwielding men to get in her way in the wavering glow from the lamp kahlan saw cara squat down on the crimson carpet beside the man he clutched his arms across his abdomen as he vomited blood her red leather outfit creaked as she rested her forearms on her knees she was rolling her agiel in her fingers waiting once his retching had ceased cara snatched a fistful of his hair her long blond braid slid across the back of her broad shoulders as she leaned closer that was a big mistake a very big mistake she said with silky satisfaction you should never have tried to use your magic against a mordsith you had it right for a moment but then you let me make you angry enough to use your magic whos the fool now whats a mordsith he managed between gasps cara twisted his head upward until he cried out your worst nightmare the purpose of a mordsith is to eliminate threats like you i now command your magic its mine to use and you my pet are helpless to do anything about it as you will soon learn you should have tried to strangle me or beat me to death or to run but you should never ever have tried to use magic against me once you use your magic against a mordsith its hers kahlan stood transfixed that was what a mordsith had done to richard that was how he had been captured cara pressed her agiel against the mans ribs he shivered as he screamed blood soaked through his tunic in a spreading stain now when i ask a question she said in a quiet authoritative tone i expect an answer do you understand he remained silent she twisted the agiel kahlan winced when she heard his rib pop he flinched and gasped holding his breath unable to scream kahlan felt as if she were frozen in place unable to move a muscle richard had told her that denna the mordsith who had captured him had liked to crack his ribs it made each breath agony and screaming which she soon provoked excruciating torture it also left the victim that much more helpless cara rose stand the man staggered to his feet you are about to find out why i wear blood red leather unleashing a mighty swing launched with an angry cry cara clouted his face with her armored fist as he went down blood sprayed across the bookcase as soon as he hit the floor she straddled him a boot to each side of his hips i can see what youre envisioning cara told him i saw the vision of what you want to do to me naughty boy she stomped a boot down on his sternum that was the least of what you will suffer for that thought you had better learn real fast to keep ideas of resistance out of your mind got it she bent and drove her agiel into his gut got it his scream sent a shiver up kahlans spine she was sickened by what she was watching having once felt the profoundly painful touch of an agiel but worse knowing that this was what had been done to richard and yet she didnt make a move to stop it she had offered this man mercy if he had had his way he would have killed richard he had promised to kill her too but it was that threat against richard that kept her silent and prevented her from stopping cara now cara said with a sneer she jabbed her agiel against his cracked rib what is your name marlin pickard he tried to blink away the tears a sheen of sweat covered his face blood frothed at his mouth as he panted she pressed her agiel against his groin marlins feet kicked out helplessly as he wailed the next time i ask a question dont make me wait for an answer and you will address me as mistress cara cara kahlan said in a quiet tone still seeing the vision of richard in place of the man there is no need to cara looked over her shoulder glaring with cold blue eyes kahlan turned away and with trembling fingers wiped a tear as it rolled down her cheek she lifted the glass chimney of the lamp on the wall and used the one she held to light it when the wick took to flame she set her lamp down on a side table and replaced its chimney it was frightening to see the cold look in those mordsith eyes her heart pounded at the thought of how many weeks richard had seen only cold eyes like that looking back as he begged for mercy kahlan turned back to the pair we need answers nothing more im getting answers kahlan nodded i understand but we dont need the screams along with them we dont torture people torture i have not yet even begun to torture him cara straightened casting a glance to the shivering man at her feet and if he had managed to kill lord rahl first would you wish me to leave him be then yes kahlan met the womans eyes and then i would have done worse to him myself worse than you could even conceive of but he didnt hurt richard a cunning smile curled the comers of caras mouth he intended it the canon of the spirits says that intent is guilt failure to successfully carry out the intent does not absolve the guilt the spirits also mark a distinction between intent and deed it was my intent to take care of him in my way was it your intent to disobey my direct order cara flicked her blond braid back over her shoulder it was my intent to protect you and lord rahl i have succeeded i told you to let me handle it hesitation can be the end of you or those you care about a haunted look passed across caras face iron quickly repossessed her countenance i have learned never to hesitate is that why you were provoking him to get him to attack you with his magic with the heel of her hand cara wiped the blood from a deep cut on her cheek a cut marlin had given her when he had struck her and slammed her into the bookcase she stepped closer yes she took a long lick of the blood from her hand while watching kahlans eyes a mordsith cant take a persons magic unless they attack us with it i thought you feared magic cara tugged the sleeve of her leather straightening it down her arm we do unless it is specifically used by the one who commands it to attack us then its ours you always claim not to know anything about magic and yet now you command his you can use his magic cara glanced down at the man groaning on the floor no i cant use it like he uses it but i can turn it against himhurt him with his own magic her brow twitched sometimes we feel a bit of it but we dont understand it the way lord rahl understands it and so we cant use it except to give them pain kahlan couldnt reconcile such contradictions how she was struck by how much caras emotionless expression was like a confessors face the face kahlans mother had taught her showing nothing of the inner feelings about what had to be done our minds are linked cara explained through the magic so i can see what hes thinking when he is thinking of hurting me or fighting back or disobeying my orders because it contradicts my wishes since we are linked to their minds through their magic our will to hurt them makes it happen she looked down at marlin he suddenly cried out anew in agony see i see now stop it if he refuses to give us answers then you can do what it takes but i wont sanction doing anything that isnt required to protect richard kahlan looked up from marlins torment to caras cold blue eyes she spoke before she thought did you know denna everyone knew denna and was she as good at at torturing people as you me cara said with a laugh no one was as good at it as denna thats why she was darken rahls favorite i could hardly believe the things she could do to a man why she could with a glance at the agiel hanging at kahlans neckdennas agielcara suddenly caught the meaning behind kahlans questions that was in the past we were bonded to darken rahl we did as we were commanded we are bonded to richard now we would never hurt him we would die to keep anyone from hurting lord rahl her tone lowered to a whisper lord rahl not only killed denna but he also forgave her for what she did to him kahlan nodded so he did but i have not though i understand how she did as she was trained and commanded and her spirit has been a comfort and an aid to both of us and i appreciate the sacrifices she has since made on our behalf in my heart i cant forgive her for the horrifying things she did to the man i love cara studied kahlans eyes a long moment i understand if you ever hurt lord rahl i would never forgive you either nor would i ever grant you mercy kahlan held the womans gaze likewise it is said that for a mordsith there is no worse death to be had than by the touch of a confessor a slow smile came to caras lips so i have been told its fortunate were on the same side as ive said there are things i wont i cant forgive i love richard more than life itself every mordsith knows that the worst pain comes from one you love richard need never fear that pain cara seemed to consider her words carefully darken rahl never had to fear that kind of pain he never loved a woman lord rahl does i have noticed that where love is concerned things sometimes have a way of changing so that was the heart of the matter cara i could no more hurt richard than could you i would lay down my life first i love him as do i cara said if in a different way but with no less ferocity lord rahl freed us in his place anyone else would have had every mordsith put to death he instead has given us a chance to live up to his expectations cara shifted her weight to her other foot as her eyes withdrew their cold assessment perhaps richard is the only one of us to understand the good spirits principlesthat we cant truly love until we forgive another their worst crimes against us kahlan felt her face flush at caras words she never thought of a mordsith as having such depth of understanding in matters of compassion was denna a friend cara nodded and has your heart forgiven richard for killing her yes but thats different cara admitted i understand the way you feel about denna i dont blame you in your place i would feel the same kahlan stared off when i told dennaher spiritthat i couldnt forgive her she said that she understood and that the only forgiveness she needed had already been granted she told me that she loved richardthat even in death she loved him just as richard had seen in kahlan the woman behind the magic he had seen in denna the person behind the fearsome persona of a mordsith kahlan could understand dennas feelings at having someone finally see her for herself perhaps the forgiveness of one you love is the only thing in life that really mattersthe only thing that can truly heal your heart heal your soul kahlan watched her finger as she traced the scoop of a curled leaf carved in the banding of the tabletop but i could never forgive anyone who hurt him and have you forgiven me kahlan looked up for what caras fist tightened on her agiel kahlan knew that it hurt a mordsith to hold her agiel in her handpart of the paradox of being a giver of pain for being mordsith why should i have to forgive you that cara looked away because if darken rahl had commanded me instead of denna to take richard i would have been as merciless as she as would berdine or raina or any of the rest i told you the spirits mark a distinction between the might have been and the deed so do i you cannot be held responsible for what others have done to you any more than i can be held answerable because i was born a confessor and no more than richard can be held guilty because that murderous darken rahl fathered him still cara didnt look up but will you ever truly trust us you have already proven yourselves in richards eyes and in mine you are not denna nor responsible for her choices with a thumb kahlan wiped oozing blood from caras cheek cara if i didnt trust you all of you would i allow berdine and raina two of you to be alone with richard right now cara glanced again to dennas agiel in the battle with the blood of the fold i saw the way you fought to protect lord rahl as well as the people of the city to be mordsith is to understand that you must sometimes be merciless though you are not mordsith i have seen that you understand this you are a worthy guardian to lord rahl you are the only woman i know worthy of wearing an agiel though to you that may sound reprehensible in my eyes it is an honor that you wear an agiel its ultimate purpose is to protect our master kahlan offered a sincere smile understanding cara just a little bit better than she had before she wondered what the woman behind the appellation had been like before she was captured and trained to become a mordsith richard had told her that it was a horror far beyond anything that had been done to him in my eyes too because richard gave it to me i am his protector as are you in that way we are sisters of the agiel cara smiled her approval does this mean that youll follow our orders for a change kahlan asked we always follow your orders with a wry smile kahlan shook her head cara nodded toward the man on the floor he will answer your questions as i promised you before mother confessor i wont practice my skills on him any more than is necessary kahlan squeezed caras arm in sorrow and sympathy for the warped role the womans life had been twisted into by others thank you cara kahlan turned her attention to marlin and the problem at hand lets try it again what were your plans he glared up at her cara shoved him with a foot you answer truthfully or ill start finding some nice tender places for my agiel understand yes cara squatted down fanning her agiel before his face yes mistress cara the sudden threat in her tone seemed to annul everything she had just said it frightened even kahlan wideeyed he swallowed yes mistress cara thats better now answer the mother confessors question my plans were as i told you to kill richard rahl and you how long ago did jagang give you these orders nearly two weeks well there was that it could be that jagang had been killed at the palace of the prophets when richard destroyed it that was what they had been hoping anyway perhaps he had given the orders before he was killed what else kahlan asked nothing else i was to use my talent to get in here and kill the both of you thats all cara landed a kick on his cracked rib dont lie to us kahlan gently pushed cara back and knelt beside the choking gasping young man marlin dont mistake my distaste for torture as a lack of resolve if you dont start telling me what i want to know she whispered im going to go for a long walk and then to dinner and im going to leave you in here all alone with cara crazy as she is ill leave you alone with her and then when i come back if you still think to hold out on me im going to use my power on you and you cant even imagine how much worse that will be cara cant even come close to what i can do she can use your magic and your mind i can destroy it is that what you want he shook his head as he clutched his ribs please he begged tears welling up again dont ill answer your questions but i dont really know anything emperor jagang comes to me in my dreams and tells me what to do i know the cost of failure i do as im told he paused to gasp a sob he told me to to come here and kill you both he told me to find a soldiers uniform and weapons and to come kill you both he uses wizards and sorceresses to do his bidding kahlan stood puzzling over marlins words he seemed to have reverted to being hardly more than a boy something was missing but she couldnt imagine what it could be it made sense on the surfacejagang sending an assassinbut something deeper didnt tally she paced to the side table with the lamp and leaned a hip against it with her back to marlin she rubbed her throbbing temples cara inched close are you all right kahlan nodded this worry is just giving me a headache thats all maybe you could have lord rahl kiss it and make it better kahlan chuckled silently at caras concerned frown that would work she waved her hands in the air as if shooing a gnat trying to chase away the doubts it doesnt make any sense the dream walker trying to kill his enemy doesnt make sense well think about it she glanced over her shoulder to see marlin hugging his ribs and rocking on the floor his eyes even when they were filled with terror and even as now when he wasnt looking her way for some reason made her skin crawl she turned back to cara and lowered her voice surely jagang had to know that one man even a wizard would fail at such a task richard would recognize a man with the gift and besides there are too many people here who would be only too ready to kill an intruder but still with his gift he might have a chance jagang wouldnt care if the man was killed he has an abundance of others to do his bidding kahlans thoughts flicked about trying to pick out the nettle of a reason behind her itching doubt even if he managed to kill some of them with his magic there are still too many a whole army of mriswith failed to kill richard he can recognize one with the gift with magic as a threat he doesnt know how to command his magic much as you dont understand how to control marlins beyond giving him pain with it but his guard would be up at the least this just doesnt make any sense jagang is far from stupid there has to be more to it he must have some plan to this something more than were seeing cara clasped her hands behind her back as she took a deep breath she turned marlin his head came up his eyes at attention what was jagangs plan to have me kill richard rahl and the mother confessor what else kahlan asked what more was there to his plan his eyes flooded i dont know i swear i told you as he ordered me i was to get a soldiers uniform and weapons so i would look like i belonged and could get close i was to kill you both kahlan wiped a hand across her face were not asking the right questions i dont know what else there could be he has admitted the worst of it he told us his goal what more could there be i dont know but theres something still itching at me kahlan sighed in resignation maybe richard can reason this out he is the seeker of truth after all hell figure out what it means richard will know the right questions to ask so that kahlans head suddenly came up her eyes wide she advanced a long stride toward the man on the floor marlin did jagang also tell you to announce yourself when you arrived yes once inside the palace i was to give my reason for being here kahlan stiffened she snatched caras arm and pulled her close while keeping her eyes on marlin maybe we shouldnt tell richard about this its too dangerous i have marlins power hes helpless kahlans gaze darted about hardly hearing what cara had said we have to put him somewhere safe this room wont do she put a thumbnail between her teeth cara frowned this room is as safe as anywhere he cant get away hes safe in here kahlan took her thumb from her mouth as she stared at the man rocking on the floor no we have to find someplace safer i think weve made a big mistake i think were in a lot of trouble chapter let me just kill him cara said i have but to touch him in the right place with my agiel and his heart will stop he wont suffer for the first time kahlan seriously considered caras oftrepeated request though she had had to kill people before and had ordered the execution of others she dismissed the impulse she had to think this through for all she knew that could be jagangs true plan though she couldnt imagine what good it would gain him but he had to have some scheme to what he had ordered he wasnt stupid he had to know that marlin would be captured at the least no kahlan said we dont know enough yet for all we know that could be the worst thing we could do we cant do anything else until we think it through carefully weve already walked into a swamp without pausing to think about where we were going cara sighed at the familiar refusal then what do you wish to do i dont know yet jagang had to know he would be captured at the least yet he ordered it why we have to figure this out until we do we have to put him somewhere safe where he cant escape and hurt anyone mother confessor cara said with exaggerated patience he cannot escape i have control of his power believe me i know how to control a person when i have domination over their magic i have had an abundance of experience he is incapable of doing anything against my wishes here let me show you she threw open the door surprised men reached for weapons as they gazed around the room in silent professional appraisal with the extra light from beyond the door kahlan could see the true extent of the mess a spray of blood crossed the bookcase at an angle blood soaked the crimson carpet the spongy reddish blotch extending past the perimeter of gold banding marlins face was a bloody sight the side of his beige tunic was dark with a wet stain you cara said give me your sword the blondhaired soldier drew his weapon and handed it over without hesitation now she announced all of you listen to me im going to give the mother confessor here a demonstration of the power of a mordsith if any of you go against my orders you will answer to meshe gestured back to marlinjust like he did after another glance at the miserable man on the floor some men nodded and the rest voiced their consent cara pointed with the sword at marlin if he can make it to the door you all are to let him gohe is to have his freedom the men grumbled objections dont argue with me the dharan soldiers fell silent a mordsith was trouble enough but when she had command of a persons magic she was something altogether beyond trouble she was dealing in magic and they had no desire to stick their finger in a cauldron of dark sorcery stirred by an angry mordsith cara strode over to marlin and held the sword down to him hilt first take it marlin hesitated then snatched the sword when she frowned in warning cara looked up at kahlan we always let our captives keep their weapons its a constant reminder to them that they are helpless that even their weapons will do them no good against us i know kahlan said in a small voice richard told me cara motioned marlin to his feet when he didnt move fast enough for her she punched his cracked rib what are you waiting for get up now go stand over there after he had moved off the carpet she grasped the corner and flung it aside she pointed at the polished wood floor and snapped her fingers marlin scurried to the spot grunting in pain with each step cara snatched him by the scruff of his neck and bent him over spit marlin coughed blood and spat on the floor at his feet cara hauled him up straight seized the neck of his tunic and yanked his face close she gritted her teeth now you listen you know the kind of pain i can give you if you displease me do you need another demonstration he vigorously shook his head no mistress cara good boy now when i tell you to do something that is what i wish you to do if you do otherwise if you go against my orders my wishes your magic will twist your guts like a washrag as long as you continue to go against my wishes the pain will only get worse i wont let the magic kill you but you will wish otherwise you will beg me to kill you in order to escape the pain i dont grant my pets requests for death marlins face had gone ashen now stand on that spot of your spit marlin moved both feet onto the red splat cara gripped his jaw in one hand and pointed her agiel at his face my wish is for you to stand right there on that spot of your spit until i tell you otherwise you are never to so much as lift a finger to harm me or anyone else ever again that is my wish do you understand do you fully understand my wishes he nodded as best he could the way her hand clamped his jaw yes mistress cara i would never hurt youi swear you want me to stand on my spit until you give me permission to do otherwise tears welled up anew i wont move i swear please dont hurt me cara shoved his face away you disgust me men who break as easily as you disgust me ive had girls last longer under my agiel she muttered she pointed behind those men wont hurt you they will do nothing to stop you if you get to the door against my wishes you are free and the pain will be gone she glared at the soldiers you all heard me didnt you if he reaches the door hes free the soldiers nodded if he kills me hes free this time they didnt agree until cara yelled her order again cara turned her hot glare to kahlan that includes you if he kills me or if he makes the door hes free no matter how improbable kahlan wouldnt agree to such a thing marlin wanted to kill richard why are you doing this because you need to understand you need to trust my word kahlan forced out a breath get on with it she said without agreeing to the terms cara turned her back to marlin and folded her arms you know my wishes my pet if you wish to escape this is your chance you reach the door and youre free if you want to kill me for what ive done to you nows your chance for that too you know she added i dont think ive seen nearly enough of your blood when were done with all this nonsense im going to take you somewhere private where the mother confessor wont be around to intercede on your behalf im going to spend the rest of the afternoon and night punishing you with my agiel just because im in the mood im going to make you regret the day you were born she shrugged unless of course you kill me or escape the soldiers stood mute the room exuded a heavy silence as cara waited with her arms folded marlin carefully looked around studying the soldiers kahlan and caras back his fingers worked on the hilt of the sword drawing it tighter into his grip his eyes narrowed as he considered watching caras back he finally took a small tentative step to the side to kahlan it looked as if an invisible club had whacked him in the gut he doubled over with a grunt a low groan wheezed from his throat with a cry of effort he dived for the door he hit the floor screaming he clutched his abdomen with both arms as he writhed with fingers curled in agony he threw himself out flat on the floor and tried to claw his way to the door it was still a goodly distance each inch he gained racked him with ever worse convulsions of pain kahlan winced at his panting screams in a last desperate effort he snatched up the sword again and staggered to his feet straightening partially lifting the sword above his head kahlan tensed even if he couldnt make his arms do his bidding he could fall and cleave cara the risk to cara was too great kahlan took an urgent step forward as marlin bellowed and tried to bring the sword down to hack at cara cara watching kahlan held up an admonishing finger stopping kahlan where she stood behind her martins sword clattered to the floor as he crumpled holding his stomach as he shrieked he crashed to the floor his distress obviously growing precipitously with each moment as he writhed on the polished wood floor like a fish out of water what did i tell you marlin cara asked in a quiet voice what are my wishes he seemed to grasp the meaning of her words as if they were from a person yelling as he threw a lifeline to a drowning man his frantic gaze hunted the floor finally he saw it he clawed his way to the spot of his spit moving as quickly as the racking pain allowed at last he managed to stagger to his feet he stood fists at his side still shaking and screaming both feet marlin cara said casually he looked down and saw that only one foot was on the spit he jerked the other closer onto the red spot he sagged and finally fell silent kahlan felt herself sag with him his eyes closed panting dripping sweat he stood trembling with the lingering effects of the ordeal cara lifted an eyebrow to kahlan understand kahlan scowled cara scooped up the sword and marched it over to the door as one the soldiers all backed up a step she held the sword out hilt first reluctantly its owner retrieved it any questions gentlemen cara asked in an icy voice good now stop banging on the door when im busy she slammed the heavy door in their faces marlins lower lip sucked in and out over his teeth with each panting breath cara put her face close to his i dont recall giving you permission to close your eyes did you hear me say you could close them his eyes opened wide no mistress cara then what were they doing closed marlins terror quavered through his voice im sorry mistress cara please forgive me i wont do it again cara she turned as if she had forgotten kahlan was even in the room what kahlan tilted her head in gesture we need to talk you see cara asked when she had joined kahlan at the table with the lamp you see what i mean he cant hurt anyone he cant escape no man has ever escaped a mordsith kahlan lifted an eyebrow richard did cara straightened and let out a noisy breath lord rahl is different this man is no lord rahl mordsith have proven themselves unerring thousands of times no one but lord rahl ever killed his mistress to reclaim his magic and escape no matter how improbable richard has proven that mordsith arent infallible i dont care how many thousands mordsith have subjugated the fact that one escaped means that its possible cara im not doubting youits just that we cant take chances somethings wrong why would jagang throw this lamb in a wolfs lair and specifically tell him to announce himself but its possible jagang was killedhe might be dead and we have nothing to fearbut if hes still alive and anything goes wrong with marlin here it will be richard who pays the price jagang wants richard dead are you so stubborn that youre willing to put richard at risk for the sake of your pride cara scratched her neck as she considered she took a quick glance over her shoulder at marlin standing on the spot of his spit his eyes wide open sweat dripping off the end of his nose what do you want to do this room has no windows we can lock and bar the door where can we put him that would be safer than this room kahlan pressed her fingers over the burning ache under her sternum the pit kahlan twisted her fingers together as she came to a halt before the iron door marlin looking like a frightened puppy stood silently in the center of a knot of dharan soldiers a ways back up the torchlit hall whats the matter cara asked kahlan flinched what i asked what was the matter you look like youre afraid the door is going to bite you kahlan pulled her hands apart and made herself put them at her sides nothing she turned and lifted the ring with the keys from the iron peg in the coarse stone wall beside the door cara lowered her voice dont lie to a sister of the agiel kahlan mimicked a quick smile of apology the pit is where the condemned await execution i have a half sistercyrilla she was the queen of galea when she was here when aydindril fell to the order before richard liberated the city they threw her in the pit with a gang of about a dozen murderers have a half sister she still lives then kahlan nodded as the mists of memories swirled before her minds eye but they had her down there for days prince harold her brother my half brother rescued her when they were taking her to the block to be beheaded but shes never been the same since shes withdrawn into herself on rare occasions she comes out of her stupor and insists that the people need a queen able to lead them and that i become the queen of galea in her place i agreed kahlan paused she screams inconsolably if she comes awake and sees men cara hands clasped behind her back waited without comment kahlan gestured to the door they threw me down there too her mouth was so dry that it took two attempts before she could swallow with those men who had raped her she surfaced from the memories and sneaked a quick glance at cara but they didnt do to me as they did to her she didnt say how close they had come a sly smile came to caras lips how many did you kill i didnt stop to take an exact count as i escaped her brief flitting smile wouldnt stick but it scared the wits out of mebeing down there alone with all those beasts kahlans heart pounded so hard at the memory that it made her sway on her feet well cara offered do you want to find another place to put marlin no kahlan took a purging breath look cara im sorry im acting this way she peered briefly at marlin theres something about his eyes something strange she looked back to cara im sorry its not like me to be so jittery youve only known me a short time im not usually so apprehensive its just that i guess that its just because its been so peaceful for the last few days ive been separated from richard for so long and its been bliss being together we were hoping jagang was killed and that the war was ended we were hoping he was in the palace of the prophets when richard destroyed it he still might have been marlin said its been two weeks since jagang gave him orders lord rahl said jagang wanted the palace he was probably with his troops when they stormed it hes no doubt dead we can hope but im so afraid for richard i guess its affecting my judgment now that things have come together im terrified that its going to slip away from me cara shrugged as if to dispel kahlans need for apology i know how you feel now that lord rahl has given us our freedom we have something to fear losing maybe thats why im so jittery too she flicked her hand toward the door we could find another place there have to be other places that wont touch painful memories for you no protecting richard comes above all else the pit is the safest place in the palace to keep a prisoner we have no one else down there now its escapeproof im fine cara lifted an eyebrow escapeproof you escaped the memories repressed kahlan smiled with the back of her hand she gave caras stomach a dismissive slap marlin is no mother confessor she glanced back up the hall at marlin but theres something about himsomething i cant put my finger on something strange he frightens me and he shouldnt not with you controlling his gift you are right you shouldnt be concerned i have complete control of him no pet has ever slipped from my control ever cara lifted the key ring from kahlans hand and unlocked the door with a tug it drew open on rusty squeaking hinges dank stench wafted up from the darkness below the smell clenched kahlans stomach muscles with the memories it carried cara took a nervous step back there arent any rats down there are there rats kahlan glanced to the dark maw no theres no way for them to get in no rats youll see kahlan turned her attention to the soldiers back up the hall waiting with marlin and gestured toward the long ladder resting on its side against the wall opposite the door once they had the ladder through the door and it had thudded down in place cara snapped her fingers and motioned marlin forward he scurried to her without hesitation anxious to avoid doing anything to displease her take that torch and get down there cara told him marlin pulled the torch from its rust encrusted bracket and started down the ladder with a frown of puzzlement cara followed him down into the gloom when kahlan motioned her to the ladder kahlan turned to the guards sergeant collins you and your men wait up here please are you sure mother confessor he sergeant asked are you eager to be down there in a small space with an illtempered mordsith sergeant he hooked a thumb behind his weapons belt as he glanced at the opening into the pit well wait up here as you command kahlan started backing down the ladder well be fine the smooth stone blocks of the walls were so precisely dryfit that there wasnt so much as a fingernail hold to be had looking back over her shoulder she could see marlin holding the torch and cara waiting for her nearly twenty feet below she carefully put a foot in each rung mindful not to step on the hem of her dress lest she fall why are we down here with him cara asked as kahlan stepped off the last rung kahlan wiped her hands together brushing off the grit from the ladder rungs she took the torch from marlin and went to the wall before them she stretched up on her toes and pushed the torch into one of the brackets on the wall because on the way down here i thought of some more questions to ask him before we leave him here cara glared at marlin and pointed to the floor spit she waited now stand on it marlin moved onto the spot careful to get both feet on it cara eyed the empty room checking the shadows in the corners kahlan wondered if she was making sure the place really was free of rats marlin kahlan said he licked his lips waiting for her question when was the last time you received orders from jagang like i told you before it was about two weeks ago and hes not sought you out since then no mother confessor if he was dead would you know he didnt hesitate with his answer i dont know he either comes to me or he doesnt i have no way of knowing of him between his calls how does he come to you in my dreams and youve not dreamed of him since you say he last came to you a fortnight ago no mother confessor kahlan paced to the wall with the hissing torch and back as she thought you didnt recognize me when you first saw me he shook his head would you recognize richard yes mother confessor kahlan frowned how how would you know him from the palace of the prophets i was a student there richard was brought there by sister verna i knew him from the palace a student at the palace of the prophets then you how old are you ninetythree mother confessor no wonder he seemed so strange to her sometimes like a boy and sometimes seeming to have the demeanor of an older man that explained the sage bearing in his young eyes there was a presence about those eyes that didnt fit his youthful frame this would certainly explain it the palace of the prophets trained boys in their gift ancient magic had aided the sisters of the light in their task by altering time at the palace so that they would have the time needed in the absence of an experienced wizard to teach the boys to control their magic that was all ended now richard had destroyed the palace and the prophecies lest jagang capture them the prophecies would have aided him in his effort to conquer the world and the palace would have given him hundreds of years to rule over those he vanquished kahlan felt the weight of worry lift from her mind now i know why i felt there was something strange about him she said as she sighed her relief cara didnt look so relieved why did you announce yourself to the soldiers inside the confessors palace emperor jagang didnt explain his instructions mistress cara jagang is from the old world and no doubt doesnt know about mordsith cara said to kahlan he probably thought a wizard like marlin here would be able to announce himself cause a panic and wreak havoc kahlan considered the supposition could be jagang has the sisters of the dark as his puppets so he would have been able to get information about richard richard wasnt at the palace long enough to learn much about his gift the sisters of the dark would have told jagang that richard doesnt know how to use his magic richard is the seeker and knows how to use the sword of truth but he doesnt know how to use his gift jagang might have thought to send in a wizard on the chance that he might succeed and if he didnt so what he has others what do you think my pet marlins eyes filled with tears i dont know mistress cara i dont know he didnt tell me i swear a tremor seeped from his jaw into his voice but it could be what the mother confessor says is true he doesnt care if we are killed while performing a task our lives mean little to him cara turned to kahlan what else kahlan shook her head i cant think of anything else at the moment i guess it could all make sense well come back later after ive thought about it maybe ill think of some other questions that might settle it cara pointed her agiel at his face you stand right there on that spot of your spit until we come back whether its in two hours or two days it doesnt matter if you sit down or any part of you other than the soles of your feet touches the floor you will be down here all alone with the pain it brings for going against my wishes understand he blinked as a drop of sweat ran into his eye yes mistress cara cara do you think it necessary that yes i know my business let me do it you yourself reminded me what was at stake and how we dared not take any chances kahlan relented all right kahlan took hold of a rung above her head and started up the ladder on the second rung she paused and looked back frowning she stepped back off the ladder marlin did you come to aydindril alone no mother confessor cara snatched the neck of his tunic what you came with others yes mistress cara how many with one other mistress cara she was a sister of the dark kahlans fist joined caras on his tunic what was her name frightened by both women he tried to back away a bit but their grip on his tunic wouldnt allow it i dont know her name he whined i swear she was a sister of the dark from the palace where you lived for close to a century and you dont know her name kahlan asked marlin licked his lips his gaze moving between the two women there were hundreds of sisters at the palace of the prophets there were rules we had teachers assigned to us there were places we didnt go and sisters we never came in contact with like those who handled administration i didnt know them all i swear i saw her before at the palace but i didnt know her name and she didnt tell me where is she now marlin shook in terror i dont know i havent seen her for days since i came to the city kahlan gritted her teeth what did she look like then marlin licked his lips again as his gaze flicked back and forth between the two women i dont know i dont know how to describe her a young woman i dont think she was long out of being a novice she was younglooking like you mother confessor pretty i thought she was pretty she had long hair long brown hair kahlan and cara shared a look nadine they said as one chapter mistress cara marlin called from below cara turned hanging by one hand on the next rung down from kahlan she held the torch out in her other hand what how will i sleep mistress cara if you dont come back tonight and if i have to stand then how will i sleep sleep thats not my concern i told youyou must remain on your feet on that spot move sit or lie down and you will be very sorry you will be all alone with the pain understand yes mistress cara came the weak voice from the darkness below once kahlan was up in the hall she reached down and took the torch from cara freeing the mordsith to use both hands to climb out kahlan handed the torch to a relievedlooking sergeant collins collins id like all of you to remain here keep the door locked and dont go down therefor anything dont let anyone else so much as take a peek yes mother confessor sergeant collins hesitated is it dangerous then kahlan understood his concern no cara has control of his power hes incapable of using his magic she took appraisal of the troops clogging the dingy stone corridor there had to be close to a hundred i dont know if well be back tonight she told the sergeant get the rest of your men down here divide them into squads take shifts so that theres at least this many down here at all times lock all the barricade doors post archers at the doors and at each end of this hall i thought you said there was no need for concern that he couldnt use his magic kahlan smiled do you want to have to explain it to cara here if someone sneaks in and rescues her charge out from under your nose in her absence he scratched his stubble as he glanced at cara i understand mother confessor no one will be allowed within shouting distance of this door still dont trust me cara asked when they were out of earshot of the soldiers kahlan offered a friendly smile my father was king wyborn he was cyrillas father and then mine he was a great warrior he taught me that its impossible to be too cautious with prisoners cara shrugged as they passed a sputtering torch fine by me it doesnt hurt my feelings but i have his magic hes helpless i still dont understand how you can fear magic and have such control over it i told you only if he specifically attacks me with it and how do you take control of it how do you make it yours to command cara spun the agiel on the end of the chain at her wrist as she walked i dont know myself we just do it the master rahl himself takes part in some of the training of mordsith it is during that phase that the ability is instilled in us its not magic from within us but transferred to us i guess kahlan shook her head yet you dont know really what youre doing and still it works with her fingertips cara hooked the iron rail at a corner swung around it and followed kahlan up the stone stairs you dont have to know what you are doing in order for magic to work what do you mean well lord rahl told us that a child is magic the magic of creation you dont have to know what you are doing to make a child one time this girla very naive girlof about fourteen summers a daughter of one of the staff at the peoples palace in d hara told me that darken rahl father rahl he liked to be calledhad given her a rosebud and it had bloomed in her fingers as he smiled down at her she said that that was how she had come to be with childthrough his magic cara laughed without humor she really thought that that was how she became pregnant it never occurred to her that it was because she had spread her legs for him so you see she did magic created a son and without knowing how she had really done it kahlan paused on the landing in the shadows and seized the crook of caras elbow halting her all richards family is deaddarken rahl killed his stepfather his mother died when he was young and his half brother michael betrayed richard allowing denna to capture him after richard defeated darken rahl richard forgave michael for what he had done to him but ordered him executed because his treachery had knowingly caused the torture and death of countless people at the hands of darken rahl i know how much family means to richard he would be thrilled to come to know a half brother could we send word to the palace in dhara and have him brought here richard would be cara shook her head and glanced away darken rahl tested the child and discovered that he was born without the gift darken rahl was eager to have a gifted heir he considered anything less deformed and worthless i see silence filled the stairwell the girl the mother cara heaved a sigh realizing that kahlan wanted to hear it all darken rahl had a temper a sick temper he crushed the girls windpipe with his bare hands after he had made her watch him well watch him kill her son when ungifted offspring came to his attention it often made him angry and then he did that kahlan let her hand fall away from caras arm caras eyes came up the calm had repossessed them a few of the mordsith suffered a similar fate fortunately i never came to be with child when he chose me for his amusement kahlan sought to fill the silence im glad richard freed you from bondage to that beast freed everyone cara nodded her eyes as cold as kahlan had ever seen them he is more than lord rahl to us anyone who ever hurts him will answer to the mordsithto me kahlan suddenly saw what cara had said about richard being allowed to keep kahlan in a new light it was the kindest thing she could think to do for him allowing him to have the one he loved despite her concern for the danger to his heart youll have to wait in line kahlan said cara at last grinned let us pray to the good spirits that we never have to fight over first rights i have a better idea lets keep harm from reaching him in the first place but remember when we get up there that we dont know for sure who this nadine is if she is a sister of the dark she is a very dangerous woman but we dont know for sure that she is she might be a dignitary a woman of rank and importance it could even be that shes nothing more than a rich noblemans daughter maybe he banished her poor farmboy lover and shes simply looking for him i dont want you harming an innocent person lets just keep our heads im not a monster mother confessor i know i didnt mean to say that you were i just dont want our desire to protect richard to make us lose our heads that includes me now lets get up to petitioners hall cara frowned why would we go there why not go to nadines room kahlan started up the second flight two steps at a time there are two hundred eightyeight guest rooms in the confessors palace divided among six separate wings at distant points i was distracted before and didnt think to tell the guards where to put her so we have to go ask cara shouldered open the door at the top of the stairs and head swiveling entered the hall ahead of kahlan as she liked to do in order to check the way for trouble seems a poor design why would guest rooms be separated kahlan gestured to a corridor branching to the left this way is shorter she slowed as two guards stepped aside to make way for them and then quickened her pace along the deep blue carpet running down the hall the guest rooms are separated because many diplomats visited the palace on business with the council and if the wrong diplomats are placed too close together they could become very undiplomatic keeping peace among allies was sometimes a delicate balancing game that included accommodations but there are all the palacesfor the representatives of the landson kings row kahlan grunted cynically part of the game when they entered petitioners hall everyone went to their knees again kahlan had to give them the formal acknowledgment before she could speak with the captain he told her where he had put nadine and she was about to leave when a boy one of the group of jala players waiting patiently in the hall snatched the floppy wool hat from his head of blond hair and bolted toward them the captain caught sight of him trotting across the room hes waiting to see lord rahl probably wants him to come watch another game the captain smiled to himself i told him it would be all right if he waited but that i couldnt promise that lord rahl could see him he shrugged selfconsciously least i could do i was at the game yesterday with a crowd of soldiers the boy and his team won me three silver marks hat crushed in both little fists the boy genuflected on the other side of the marble railing from kahlan mother confessor wed like to well if its no trouble we his voice trailed off as he gulped air kahlan smiled encouragement dont be afraid whats your name yonick mother confessor im sorry yonick but richard cant come watch another game just now were busy at the moment perhaps tomorrow i know we both enjoyed it and we would very much like to come watch again but on another day he shook his head its not about that its my brother kip he twisted his hat hes sick i was wondering if well if lord rahl could come do some magic and make him better kahlan gave the boys shoulder a comforting squeeze well richards not really that kind of wizard why dont you go see one of the healers on stentor street tell them what hes sick with and theyll give him some herbs to help him feel better yonick hung his head we dont have no money for herbs thats why i was hoping kip is real sick kahlan straightened and peered at the captain his gaze went from kahlan to the boy and back again he cleared his throat well yonick i saw you play yesterday the captain stammered quite good your team was quite good checking kahlans eyes again he stabbed a hand into a pocket and came out with a coin he bent over the rail and pushed the coin into yonicks fist i know which ones your brother he that was a great play that goal he made take this and get him some herbs like the mother confessor said he needs yonick stared in astonishment at the silver coin in his hand herbs dont cost this much as i hear told the captain waved away the notion well i dont have anything smaller buy your team a treat for their win with the extra now take it and be off we have palace business we must attend to yonick straightened and clapped a fist to his heart in salute yes sir and practice that kick of yours the captain called after the boy as he ran across the hall to his fellows its a little sloppy i will yonick shouted over his shoulder thanks kahlan watched as he collected his friends and they rushed to the door very kind of you captain harris he winced thank you mother confessor cara lets go see this lady nadine kahlan hoped the captain who came to attention at the end of the hall had had an uneventful watch has nadine tried to leave captain nance no mother confessor he said when he straightened from his bow she seemed grateful that someone was taking in interest in her request when i explained that there could be trouble about and we needed her to stay in her room she promised to abide by my instructions he glanced at the door she said that she didnt want to get me in hot water and she would do as i asked thank you captain she paused before she opened the door if she comes out of this room without us kill her dont stop to ask her any questions and dont give her any warning just have the archers take her down when his brow twitched she added if she leaves first it will be because she has proven she commands magic and has killed us with it captain nance his face gone as pale as yearold straw clapped a fist to his heart in salute the outer sitting room was decorated in red the walls were a dark crimson adorned with white crown molding pink marble baseboard and door casings and a hardwood floor almost entirely covered with a huge goldfringed carpet embellished with an ornate leafandflower motif the gilded legs of the marbletopped table and of the red velvet tufted chairs were carved with a matching leafandflower design being an interior room there were no windows cutglass chimneys on the dozen reflector lamps around the room sent sparkles of light dancing across the walls to kahlans mind it was one of the least tasteful color schemes in the palace but there were diplomats who specified this color room when requesting accommodations at the palace they felt it put them in the right frame of mind for negotiations kahlan was always wary when hearing the arguments of representatives who had requested one of the red rooms nadine wasnt in the extravagant outer room the door to the bedroom was ajar delicious rooms cara whispered can i have them kahlan shushed her she knew why the mordsith would want a red room with cara peering over her shoulder kahlan cautiously pushed back the bedroom door caras breath tickled her left ear if it was possible the bedroom was more jarring to the senses than the sitting room with the red theme carried into the carpets embroidered bedcover immoderate collection of ornate goldfringed crimson pillows and the swirled pink marble fireplace surround kahlan thought that if cara was wearing her red leather and ever wanted to hide she could simply sit in this room and no one would ever find her only half the lamps in the bedroom were lit several blownglass bowls set about on tables and the desk were filled with cried rose petals their fragrance mingling with the lamp oil to permeate the air with a heavy sicklysweet odor when the hinges squeaked the woman resting on the bed opened her eyes saw kahlan and sprang to her feet ready to take nadine with her confessors power if she gave the slightest indication of aggression kahlan unconsciously held an arm out to her side to keep cara out of her way in preparation her muscles tight as coiled steel kahlan was holding her breath if the woman conjured magic kahlan would have to be quick nadine hastily knuckled the sleep from her eyes by her indecision as to which foot to put forward in the awkward curtsy she performed kahlan knew that she was no noblewoman but that didnt mean she couldnt be a sister of the dark nadine gawked at cara for an instant before smoothing down her dress at her shapely hips and addressing kahlan forgive me queen but ive been on a long journey and i was taking a bit of a rest guess i must have fallen asleep i didnt hear you knock im nadine brighton queen as nadine dipped into another inelegant curtsy kahlan quickly surveyed the room the washbasin and ewer hadnt been used the towels beside them on the washstand were clean and still folded a simple worn woolen travel bag sat at the foot of the bed a clothesbrush and a tin cup were the only foreign objects on the overwrought gilded table to the other side of a red velvet chair beside the fringed canopy bed despite the early spring chill and cold hearth she hadnt pulled down the bedcovers for her nap perhaps thought kahlan so as not to become tangled in them if she had to move fast kahlan didnt apologize for entering without knocking mother confessor she said in a cautious tone feeling the need to make clear the tacit threat of the power she wielded queen is one of my less common titles i am more widely known as the mother confessor as nadine blushed the sprinkling of freckles at the top of her cheekbones and across her delicate nose almost disappeared her large brown eyes turned to the floor with unease she hastily ran her fingers through her thick brown hair although it didnt look disheveled she wasnt as tall as kahlan though she looked to be about the same age or perhaps a year younger she was a lovelylooking young woman and cast off no warning signs of threat or danger but kahlan wasnt put at ease by a fresh face and innocent demeanor experience had taught kahlan hard lessons marlin the latest lesson hadnt appeared at first to be anything other than an awkward young man this young womans lovely eyes though didnt seem to have the same timeless quality to them that had so unnerved kahlan still her caution wasnt allayed either nadine turned and hurriedly swept the flats of her hands over the bedcover pressing out the wrinkles with quick strokes forgive me mother confessor i didnt mean to muss your lovely bed brushed my dress first so i wouldnt get road dust on it i intended to lie on the floor but the bed looked so inviting i couldnt resist giving it a try i hope i havent caused offense of course not kahlan said i invited you to use the room as your own before the last word was out of kahlans mouth cara had swept around her even though there seemed to be no rank among the mordsith berdine and raina always deferred to caras word among the dharans the rank of the mordsith and cara in particular seemed undisputed though kahlan had never heard anyone put definition to it if cara said spit people spat nadine let out a wideeyed squeak when she saw the leatherclad mordsith coming at her cara kahlan called out cara ignored her we have your friend marlin down in the pit youll be joining him shortly cara jabbed a finger in the hollow at the base of nadines neck causing her to drop backward onto the chair beside the bed ow nadine shouted as she glared up at cara that hurt as she bounded up off the chair cara seized the young womans throat in an armored fist she swept her agiel up and pointed it between the wide brown eyes i have not yet begun to hurt you kahlan snatched caras braid and gave it a mighty yank one way or the other youre going to learn to follow orders cara still gripping the young womans throat turned in surprise let her go i told you to let me handle this until she makes a threatening move you will do as you are told or you can wait outside cara released nadine with a shove that plopped her down in the chair again this ones trouble i can feel it you should let me kill her kahlan pressed her lips together until cara rolled her eyes and grudgingly stepped aside nadine came off the chair slower this time her eyes teared as she rubbed her throat and coughed whyd you do that ive done nothing to you i didnt disturb any of your fine things you people have the worst manners of anyone ive ever seen she shook a finger at kahlan theres no call to treat a person that way on the contrary kahlan said an innocent enough looking young man showed up at the palace today also asking to see lord rahl he turned out to be an assassin thanks to cara here we were able to stop him nadines indignation faltered oh thats not the worst of it kahlan added he confessed to having an accomplicean attractive young woman with long brown hair nadines throatrubbing paused as she looked at cara then back to kahlan oh well i guess i can understand the mistake you asked to see lord rahl too thats made everyone just a little jumpy all of us are quite protective of lord rahl i guess i can see the reason for the confusion no offense taken cara here is one of lord rahls personal guards kahlan said im sure you can understand the reason for her belligerent attitude nadine took her hand away from her throat and rested it on one hip of course i guess i landed in the middle of a hornets nest the problem is kahlan went on you havent yet convinced us you are not the second assassin for your sake it would be best if you did so at once nadines eyes darted between the two women watching her her relief reversed to alarm me a killer but im a woman so am i cara said one who is going to have your blood all over this room until you tell us the truth nadine spun around and snatched up the chair brandishing its legs toward cara and kahlan stay away im warning you tommy lancaster and his friend lester once thought to have their way with me and they now have to eat all their meals without the benefit of their front teeth put down the chair cara warned in a deadly hiss or you will be eating your next meal in the spirit world nadine dropped the chair as if it had caught fire she retreated until she was up against the wall leave me be i didnt do anything kahlan gently hooked caras arm and urged her back let a sister of the agiel handle this she said in a whisper as she lifted an eyebrow i know i said until she makes a threatening move but a chair is hardly the kind of threat i had in mind caras mouth twisted in annoyance all right for the moment kahlan turned to nadine i need some answers tell the truth and if you really have nothing to do with this assassin you will have my sincere apology and ill do what i can to make up for our inhospitality but if you lie to me and you intend to do harm to lord rahl the guards outside have orders not to allow you to leave this room alive do you understand nadine her back pressed against the wall nodded you asked to see lord rahl nadine nodded again why im on my way to my love hes been gone since last autumn were to be wed and im on my way to him she brushed a strand of hair back from her eyes but i dont know where he is exactly i was told to go see lord rahl and i would find my betrothed nadines lower lids brimmed with tears thats why i wanted to speak with this lord rahlto ask if he could help i see kahlan said i can understand your distress over your love being missing what is your young mans name nadine pulled her kerchief from her sleeve and dabbed it at her eyes richard richard is there more to his name nadine nodded richard cypher kahlan had to remind herself to draw a breath through her open mouth but her mind couldnt seem to make her tongue work who cara asked richard cypher hes a woods guide where i live in hartland thats in westland where we live what do you mean youre to wed him kahlan finally managed in a whisper she felt her world threatening to crush in around her as a thousand things all at once whirled chaotically in her mind did he tell you that nadine twisted her damp kerchief well he was courting me it was understood but then he disappeared a woman came and told me that were to be married she said that the sky had spoken to hershe was a mystic of some sort she knew all about my richard how kind and strong and handsome he is and all she knew all manner of things about me too she said that its my destiny to marry richard and richards destiny to be my husband woman kahlan could get out no more than that one word nadine nodded shota she said her name was kahlans hands balled into fists her voice returned with venom shota did this woman shota have anyone with her yes a strange little fellow with yellow eyes he kind of scared me but she said he was harmless shota is the one who told me to come see lord rahl she said lord rahl could help me find my richard kahlan recognized the description of shotas companion samuel this womans voice calling richard my richard kept thundering around in the storm in kahlans head she worked at making her voice sound calm nadine please wait here i will nadine said gathering her composure is everything all right you believe me dont you every word is true kahlan didnt answer but instead pulled her stunned stare from nadine and marched from the room cara closed the door as she followed on kahlans heels kahlan staggered to a halt in the outer room everything swimming in a watery red blur mother confessor cara whispered whats wrong your face is as red as my leather who is this shota shota is a witch woman cara stiffened at that news and do you know this richard cypher kahlan twice swallowed past the painful lump in the back of her throat richard was raised by his stepfather until richard found out that darken rahl was his real father his name was richard cypher chapter ill kill her kahlan rasped in a hoarse voice as she stared off at nothing with my bare hands ill strangle the life out of her cara turned toward the bedroom i will take care of it better if you let me take care of her kahlan hooked caras arm not her im talking about shota she gestured toward the bedroom door she doesnt understand any of this she doesnt know about shota you know this witch woman then kahlan bitterly huffed out a breath oh yes i know her shes been trying to prevent richard and me from being together since the first why would she do that kahlan turned away from the bedroom door i dont know she gives a different reason every time but i sometimes fear that its because she wants richard for herself cara frowned how would getting lord rahl to marry this little strumpet gain shota lord rahl kahlan flicked a hand i dont know shota is always up to something shes caused us trouble at every turn her fists tightened with resolve but it wont work this time if its the last thing i do im going to end her meddling and then richard and i are going to be married her voice dropped to a whispered oath if i have to touch shota with my power and send her to the underworld i will end her meddling cara folded her arms as she considered the problem what do you wish done with nadine her blue eyes turned toward the bedroom it still might be best to get rid of her kahlan squeezed the bridge of her nose between a finger and thumb this isnt nadines doing shes simply a pawn in shotas plotting one foot soldier can sometimes cause you more trouble than a generals battle plan if he caras words trailed off as her arms came unfolded she cocked her head as if listening to a wind in the halls lord rahl is coming the ability of the mordsith to sense richard through their bond to him was uncanny if not unnerving the door opened berdine and raina wearing leather of the same cut and skintight style as caras but brown rather than red strutted into the room both were a bit shorter than cara but no less attractive where cara was leggy muscular and without a spare ounce of fat blueeyed berdine had a more curvaceous shape berdines wavy brown hair was plaited in the characteristic long braid of a mordsith as was graceful rainas fine dark hair all three shared the same ruthless confidence rainas incisive darkeyed gaze took in caras red leather but she made no comment both she and berdine wore grim forbidding expressions the two mordsith turned to face one another from either side of the door we present lord rahl berdine said in an officious tone the seeker of truth and wielder of the sword of truth the bringer of death the master of dhara the ruler of the midlands the commander of the gar nation the champion of free people and bane of the wicked her penetrating blue eyes turned to kahlanand the betrothed of the mother confessor she lifted an introductory arm toward the door kahlan couldnt imagine what was going on she had seen the mordsith display a variety of temperaments from imperious to mischievous but she had never seen them acting ceremonial richard strode into the room his raptor gaze locked on kahlan for an instant the world stopped there was nothing else but the two of them joined in a silent link a smile widened on his lips and gleamed in his eyes a smile of unbounded love there was only her and richard only his eyes but the rest of him she felt her mouth drop open in astonishment kahlan put a hand over her heart as long as she had known him he had worn only his simple woods clothes but now his black boots were all she recognized the tops of the boots were wrapped with leather thongs pinned with silver emblems embossed with geometric designs and covered new black wool trousers over a black shirt was a black opensided tunic decorated with symbols snaking along a wide gold band running all the way around its squared edges a wide multilayered leather belt bearing several more of the silver emblems and a goldworked pouch to each side cinched the magnificent tunic at his waist the ancient tooledbather baldric holding the gold and silver wrought scabbard for the sword of truth crossed over his right shoulder at each wrist was a wide leatherpadded silver band bearing linked rings encompassing more of the strange symbols his broad shoulders bore a cape that appeared to be made of spun gold he looked at once noble and sinister regal and deadly he looked like a commander of kings and like a vision of what the prophecies had named him the bringer of death kahlan would never have thought he could look more handsome than he always did more commanding more imposing she was wrong as her jaw worked trying to bring forth words that werent there he crossed the room he bent and kissed her temple good cara announced she needed that she had a headache she lifted an eyebrow to kahlan all better now kahlan hardly able to get her breath hardly hearing cara touched her fingers to him as if to test it this was a vision or real like it he asked like it dear spirits she breathed he chuckled ill take that for a yes kahlan wished everyone was gone but richard what is this where did you get all this she couldnt take her hand from his chest she liked the feel of his breathing she could feel his heart beating too and she could feel her own heart pounding well he said i knew you wanted me to get some new clothes she pulled her gaze from his body and looked up into his gray eyes what i never said that he laughed your beautiful green eyes said it for you when you looked at my old woods outfit your eyes spoke quite c early she took a step back and gestured to the new clothes where did you get all this he clasped one of her hands and with the fingers of his other lifted her chin to gaze into her eyes youre so beautiful youre going to look magnificent in your blue wedding dress i wanted to look worthy of the mother confessor herself when were married i had it made in a hurry so as not to delay our wedding he had the seamstresses make it for him it was a surprise cara said i never told her your secret lord rahl she tried her best to get it out of me but i didnt tell her thank you cara richard laughed i bet it wasnt easy kahlan laughed with him but this is wonderful mistress wellington made all this for you well not all of it i told her what i wanted and she and the other seamstresses went to work i think she did a fine job i will give her my compliments if not a hug kahlan tested the cape between a finger and thumb she made this ive never seen anything like it i cant believe she made this well no richard admitted that and some of the other things came from the wizards keep the keep what were you doing up there when i was there before i came across these rooms where the wizards used to stay i went back and had a better look at some of the things that belonged to them when did you do this a few days ago when you were busy meeting with some of the officials from our new allies kahlans brow tightened as she appraised the outfit the wizards of that time wore this i thought wizards always wore simple robes most of them did one wore some of this what kind of wizard wore an outfit like this a war wizard a war wizard she whispered in astonishment though he largely didnt know how to use his gift richard was the first war wizard to have been born in nearly three thousand years kahlan was about to launch into a raft of questions but remembered that there were more consequential matters at the moment her mood sank richardshe looked away from his eyesthere is someone here to see you she heard the bedroom door squeak richard nadine standing in the doorway expectantly twisted her kerchief in her fingers i heard richards voice nadine nadines eyes went as big as sanderian gold crowns richard richard smiled politely nadine his mouth smiled anyway his eyes though held no hint of a smile it was as discordant a look as kahlan had ever seen on his face kahlan had seen richard angry she had seen him in the lethal rage from magic of the sword of truth when the magic danced dangerously in his eyes and she had seen him with the deadly calm countenance invoked when he turned the blade white in the fury of commitment and determination richard was capable of looking frightening but no look she had ever seen on his face was as terrifying to kahlan as the one she saw now this wasnt a deadly rage that gripped his eyes or a lethal commitment this was somehow worse the depth of disinterest in that empty smile in his eyes was frightening the only way kahlan could imagine it being worse would be if such a gaze were directed her way that look so devoid of fervor if directed at her would have broken her heart nadine apparently didnt know him as well as did kahlan she didnt see anything but the smile on his lips oh richard nadine dashed across the room and threw her arms around his neck she seemed ready to throw her legs around richard too kahlan shot an arm out to stop cara before the mordsith could take more than a step kahlan had to force herself to stand her ground and hold her tongue despite everything she and richard meant to each other she knew that this was something beyond her say this was richards past and as well as she knew him some of that pasthis romantic past anywaywas largely unknown territory up until that moment it had seemed unimportant fearing to say the wrong thing kahlan said nothing her fate was in richards hands and those of a beautiful woman who at that moment had hers around his neckbut worse her fate seemed once again in shotas hands nadine began planting kisses all over richards neck even as he tried to hold his head away from her he placed his hands on her waist and pushed her away nadine what are you doing here looking for you silly she said in a breathless voice everyones been puzzledworriedsince you disappeared last autumn my father missed you ive missed you none of us knew what happened to you zedds missing too the boundary came down and then you came up missing and zedd and your brother i know you were upset when your father was murdered but we didnt expect you to run away her words were running together in breathless excitement well its a long story and one im sure you wouldnt be interested in true to richards words she didnt seem to hear a bit of it and simply rambled on i had so much to take care of first i had to get lindy hamilton to promise to get the winter roots for pa hes been beside himself without you to bring him some of the special plants he needs that only you can seem to find ive done my best but i dont know the woods like you hes hoping lindy will be able to fill in until i can get you home then i had to think what to take and how to find my way ive been looking so long i came to speak with somebody named lord rahl hoping he could help me find you i never in all the world dreamed id find you before i even talked to him i am lord rahl this too she seemed not to hear she stepped buck and looked him up and down richard what are you doing in that outfit who are you pretending to be get changed well go home everythings fine now that ive found you well be back home soon and everything will be back to the way it was well be married and what she blinked married well be marred and have a house and everything you can build us a better oneyour old house wont do well have children lots of children sons lots of sons big and strong like my richard she grinned i love you my richard were going to be married at last his smile as empty as it had been was gone and in its place a serious scowl grew where did you ever get an idea like that nadine laughed as she playfully ran a finger down his front she finally glanced about no one else was so much as smiling her laughter died out and she sought refuge in richards gaze but richard you and me like it was always supposed to be well be married at last like it was always meant to be cara leaned toward kahlan to whisper in her ear you should have let me kill her richards glare wiped the smirk from the mordsiths mouth and drained the blood from her face he turned back to nadine where did you get such an idea nadine was appraising his clothes again richard you look foolish dressed like this sometimes i wonder if you have a lick of sense what are you doing playing at being a king and where did you get such a sword richard i know you would never steal but you dont have the kind of money such a weapon would cost if you won it in a bet or something you can sell it so that we richard gripped her by the shoulders and gave her a shake nadine we were never engaged to be married or even close where did you get a crazy idea like that what are you doing here nadine finally wilted under his glower richard ive come a long way ive never been out of hartland before it was hard traveling doesnt that mean anything to you doesnt that count for anything i would never have left except to come get you i love you richard ulic one of richards two huge personal bodyguards ducked as he stepped through the doorway lord rahl if you are not busy general kerson has a problem and needs to speak with you richard turned a hot glare toward the towering ulic in a minute ulic not used to richard directing such a forbidding look or tone his way bowed i will tell him lord rahl puzzled nadine watched the mountain of muscle duck back out the doorway lord rahl richard what in the name of the good spirits was that man talking about what trouble have you gotten yourself into you were always so sensible what have you done why are you tricking these people who are you playing at being he seemed to cool a bit and his voice turned weary nadine its a long story and one im not in the mood to repeat just now im afraid im not the same person its been a long time since ive left home a great many things have happened im sorry youve come a long way for nothing but what was once between us kahlan expected a sheepish glance her way she never got one nadine took a step back she looked around at all the faces watching her kahlan cara berdine raina and the silent hulk of egan back near the door nadine threw her hands up whats the matter with all you people who do you think this man is hes richard cypher my richard hes a woods guide a nobody hes just a simple boy from hartland playing at being somebody important hes not are you all blind fools hes my richard and were to be married cara finally broke the silence we all know quite well who this man is apparently you do not he is lord rahl the master of dhara and the ruler of what was the midlands at least he is the ruler of those who have so far surrendered to him everyone in this room if not this city would lay down their lives to protect him we all owe him more than our loyalty we owe him our lives we can all only be who we are richard told nadine no more and no less a very wise woman told me that one time nadine whispered her incredulity but kahlan couldnt hear the words richard put his arm around kahlans waist in that gentle touch she read the message of comfort and love and suddenly felt profound sorrow for this woman standing before strangers exposing such personal matters of the heart nadine richard said in a quiet tone this is kahlan the wise woman i spoke of the woman i love kahlan not nadine kahlan and i are soon to be married were shortly going to leave to be wedded by the mud people nothing in this world is going to change that nadine seemed afraid to take her eyes from richard as if she feared that if she did it would become true mud people what in the name of the spirits are mud people sounds dreadful richard you she seemed to gather her resolve she pressed her lips together and suddenly scowled she shook her finger at him richard cypher i dont know what kind of foolish game youre playing but ill not have it you listen to me you big oaf you go get your things packed were going home i am home nadine nadine at last could think of no counter nadine who told you all this this marriage business the fire had gone out of her a mystic named shota kahlan tensed at the sound of that name shota was the true threat no matter what nadine said or wanted it was shota who had the power to cause trouble shota richard wiped a hand across his face shota i might have known and then richard did the last thing kahlan would have expected he chuckled he stood there with everyone watching him threw his head back and laughed aloud somehow it magically melted kahlans fears that richard would simply laugh off what shota might do somehow trivialized the threat suddenly her heart felt buoyant richard said that the mud people were going to marry them as they both wanted and the fact that shota wished otherwise was worth no more than a chuckle richards arm around her waist tightened with a loving squeeze she felt her cheeks tighten with a grin of her own richard waved an apology nadine im sorry im not laughing at you its just that shota has been playing her little tricks on us for a long time its unfortunate that shes used you in her scheme but its just one of her wretched games shes a witch woman witch woman nadine whispered richard nodded shes taken us in with her little dramas in the past but not this time i no longer care what shota says im not playing her games anymore nadine looked perplexed a witch woman magic ive been plied with magic but she said that the sky had spoken to her is that so well i dont care if the creator himself has spoken to her she said that the wind hunts you i was worried i wanted to help the wind hunts me well its always something with her nadines gaze drifted from his but what about us nadine there is no us the edge returned to his voice you of all people know the truth of that her chin lifted with indignation i dont know what youre talking about he watched her for a long moment as if considering saying more than he finally did have it your way nadine for the first time kahlan felt embarrassed whatever the exchange had meant she felt like an intruder hearing it richard seemed uncomfortable too im sorry nadine but i have things i have to take care of if you need help getting home ill see what i can do whatever you needa horse supplies whatever tell everyone back in hartland that im fine and i send my best wishes he turned to the waiting ulic is general kerson here yes lord rahl richard took a step toward the door id best go see what his problem is general kerson instead entered from right around the doorway when he heard his name graying but muscular and fit and a head shorter than richard he cut an imposing figure in his burnished leather uniform his upper arms bore scars of rank their shiny white furrows showing through the short chainmail sleeves he clapped a fist to his heart in salute lord rahl i need to speak with you fine speak the general hesitated i meant alone lord rahl richard looked in no mood to dally with the man there are no spies here speak its about the men lord rahl a great many of them are sick sick whats wrong with them well lord rahl they that is richards brow tightened out with it lord rahlgeneral kerson glanced among the women before clearing his throative got over half my army well out of commission squatting and groaning with debilitating bouts of diarrhea richards brow relaxed oh well im sorry i hope theyre better soon its a miserable state to be in its not an uncommon condition among an army but to be this widespread it is and because it is so widespread something has to be done well be sure they get plenty to drink keep me informed let me know how theyre doing lord rahl something has to be done now we cant have this its not like theyre stricken with spotted fever general general kerson clasped his hands behind his back and took a patient breath lord rahl general reibisch before he went south told us that you wanted your officers to voice their opinions to you when we thought it important he said that you told him that you may get angry if you didnt like what we had to say but you wouldnt punish us for voicing our views he said you wanted to know our opinions because weve had more experience at dealing with troops and with command of an army than you richard wiped a hand back and forth across his mouth youre right general so what is it thats so vital well lord rahl im one of the heroes of the shinavont province revolt thats in dhara i was a lieutenant at the time there were five hundred of us and we came upon the rebel force seven thousand strong encamped in a scrag wood we attacked at first light and ended the revolt before the day was out there were no shinavont rebels left by sunset very impressive general general kerson shrugged not really nearly all their men had their pants down around their ankles you ever try to fight when the grips had your guts richard admitted that he hadnt everyone called us heroes but it doesnt take a hero to split a mans skull when hes so dizzy with diarrhea that he can hardly lift his head i wasnt proud of what we did but it was our duty and we ended the revolt and undoubtedly prevented the greater bloodshed that would have occurred if their force had gotten well and escaped us no telling what they would have done how many more would have died but they didnt we took them down because they were sick with dysentery and couldnt keep their feet he swept his arm around indicating the surrounding countryside ive got over half my men down weve not a full force because general reibisch went off to the south whats left isnt in fighting condition something has to be done a sizable enough foe attacks now and were in trouble were vulnerable we could lose aydindril id be grateful if you knew something we could do to reverse the situation why are you bringing this to me dont you have healers the healers we have are for those kinds of problems caused by steel we tried going to some of the herb sellers and healers here in aydindril but they couldnt begin to handle the numbers he shrugged youre the lord rahl i thought you would know what to do youre right the herb dealers wouldnt have anything in that kind of quantity richard pinched his lower lip as he thought garlic will take care of it if they eat enough blueberries will help too get plenty of garlic into the men and supplement it with blueberries there would be enough of those around the general leaned in with a dubious frown garlic and blueberries are you serious my grandfather taught me about herbs and remedies and such things trust me general it will work theyve got to drink plenty of tannin tea from quench oak bark too garlic blueberries and the quench oak tea should take care of it richard looked over his shoulder right nadine she nodded that would do it but it would be easier yet if you gave them powdered bistort i thought of that but well never find any bistort this time of year and the herb sellers wouldnt begin to have enough it doesnt take that much in powered form and it would work best nadine said how many men sir last report was in the neighborhood of fifty thousand the general said by now who knows nadines eyebrows lifted in surprise at the number ive never seen that much bistort in my life theyd be old men before that much could be gathered richards right then garlic blueberries and quench oak tea comfrey tea would work too but no one will carry that kind of quantity quench oak is your best bet but its hard to find if there arent quench oaks to be had arrowwood would at least be better than nothing no richard said ive seen quench oak up in the high ridges to the northeast general kerson scratched his stubble whats a quench oak an oak tree the kind of oak tree that will be what your men need it has a yellow inner bark that you use to make the tea a tree lord rahl i can identify ten different kinds of steel just from the feel of it between my fingers but i couldnt tell one tree from another if i had extra eyes surely you must have men who know trees richard nadine said quench oak is what we call it in hartland ive collected roots and plants on my way here that i know the names of but are called different by the people ive met if these men drink tea from the wrong tree the best you can hope for is that it wont harm them but it wont solve the problem the garlic and blueberries will help their gut but they need the liquid for what was drained out of the rest of them the tea helps stop them from losing all that water and builds their health back up yes i know he rubbed his eyes general get a detachment together about five hundred wagons and extra packhorses in case we cant get the wagons close i know where the trees are ill lead you up there richard laughed quietly to himself once a guide always a guide the men will appreciate it that lord rahl is concerned about their wellbeing the general said i for sure appreciate it lord rahl thanks general get everything needed together and ill meet you out at the stables shortly id like to get up there at least before dark those passes are no place to be stumbling around in the dark especially with wagons the moon is near full but even that wont help enough well be ready before you can walk out there lord rahl after a quick fist to his heart in salute the general was gone richard flashed nadine another of his empty smiles thanks for the help and then he turned his full attention to the mordsith clad in red leather chapter richard gripped caras jaw and lifted her face he turned her head so he could better see the oozing cut on her cheek whats this she glanced to kahlan when he released his hold on her a man refused my advances is that so maybe he was put off by your choice of red leather richard looked to kahlan whats going on weve got a palace full of guards so jumpy that they even challenged me when i came in weve got squads of archers guarding stairwells and ive not seen so much bared steel since the blood of the fold attacked the city his eyes had that raptor gaze again whos down in the pit i told you cara whispered to kahlan he always finds out kahlan had told cara not to mention marlin because she feared he might somehow hurt richard but once marlin had revealed that there was a second assassin everything changed she had to tell richard that there was a sister of the dark wandering around loose an assassin showed up to kill you kahlan gestured with a tilt of her head toward cara little miss magic here goaded him into using his gift on her so that she could capture him we put him down in the pit for safekeeping richard glanced at cara before addressing kahlan little miss magic eh why did you let her do that he said he wanted to kill you cara decided to question him in her own fashion do you think that was necessary he asked cara we have a whole army one man couldnt get to me he also said he intended to kill the mother confessor richards expression darkened then i hope you didnt show him your gentle side cara smiled no lord rahl richard kahlan said its worse than that he was a wizard from the palace of the prophets he said that he came with a sister of the dark we havent found her yet a sister of the dark great how did you manage to discover that this man was an assassin he announced himself believe it or not he claims that jagang sent him to kill you and me and that his orders were to announce himself once inside the confessors palace then jagangs plan wasnt really for this man to kill us jagang isnt that stupid what was this sister of the dark to do here in aydindril did he say that she was here to kill us too or that she was here for some other purpose marlin didnt seem to know kahlan said after what cara did to him i believe him which sister is it whats her name marlin didnt know her name richard nodded thats possible how long was he in the city before he announced himself im not sure exactly i assumed a few days then why didnt he come directly to the palace once he arrived i dont know kahlan said i didnt ask him that how long was he with the sister what did they do while they were here i dont know kahlan hesitated i guess i didnt think to ask him well if he was with her she must have had something to say to him she would have been the one in charge what did she say to him i dont know did this marlin see anyone else while he was in the city did he meet with anyone else where did he stay it was the seeker questioning her not richard even though he wasnt raising his voice or using a threatening tone kahlans ears burned i didnt think to ask what did they do while they were together did she have anything with her did she buy anything or pick up anything or talk to anyone else who could end up being another part of a team was there anyone else they were ordered to kill i didnt richard combed his fingers through his hair one obviously doesnt send an assassin and have him announce himself to the guards at the intended victims door that will only get your assassin killed instead maybe jagang had this man do something before he came to the palace and then once the task was done he wanted marlin to come here so we would kill him and eliminate any chance we would find out whats going on before this sister carried out the true plot jagang certainly wouldnt care if we killed one of his pawnshe has plenty more and he doesnt value human life kahlan twisted her fingers together behind her back she was feeling decidedly foolish richards furrowed brow over his piercing gray eyes wasnt helping richard we knew that there was a woman up here who was asking to see you just as marlin did we didnt know who nadine was marlin didnt know the sisters name but he gave us a description young pretty and with long brown hair we were worried that nadine might be the sister right here among us and so we left marlin down there and came up here at once to see about nadine that was our priority stopping a sister of the dark if she was in the palace well ask marlin all those questions later hes not going anywhere richards raptor gaze softened as he took a contemplative breath he finally nodded you did the right thing youre right about the questions being less important im sorry i should have realized you would do what was best he lifted a cautionary finger leave this mariln fellow to me richard turned the raptor gaze on cara i dont want you and kahlan down there with him understand something could happen cara would offer her life without question to protect his but by her glare she was apparently beginning to resent having her ability questioned and how dangerous was a big strong man at the end of dennas leash as she walked him with impunity among the public at the peoples palace in dhara did she have to do more than tuck the end of her pets thin chain under her belt to demonstrate her complete control did he ever once so much as dare to let tension come to that leash the man at the end of that leash had been richard caras blue eyes flashed with indignation like sudden lightning from a clear blue sky kahlan almost would have expected richard to draw his sword in rage instead he watched her as if listening dispassionately to her opinion and waiting to see if she had anything to add kahlan wondered if mordsith feared being struck dead or welcomed it lord rahl i have his power nothing can happen im sure you do i dont doubt your abilities cara but i dont want kahlan put at risk no matter how inconceivable the risk when it isnt necessary you and i will go question marlin when i get back i trust you with my life but i just dont want to trust kahlans to an ugly twist of fate jagang overlooked the ability of the mordsith probably because he doesnt know enough about the new world to know what a mordsith is hes made a mistake i simply want to make sure we dont make a mistake too all right when i get back well question marlin and find out whats really going on as quickly as it had come the storm in caras eyes passed richards calm demeanor had quelled it and in seconds it seemed as if nothing had happened kahlan almost wasnt sure cara had actually said the savage things she had heard almost kahlan wished she could have thought through the matter of marlin when she had had the chance richard made it al seem so simple to her she guessed that she was so worried for him that she just wasnt thinking clearly that was a mistake she knew she shouldnt allow her concern to cloud her thinking lest she cause the harm she feared richard held the back of kahlans neck as he kissed her brow im relieved that you werent hurt you frighten me the way you get it in your head to put your life before mine dont do it again kahlan smiled she didnt promise but instead changed the subject im worried about you leaving the safety of the palace i dont like you being out there when a sister of the dark is about ill be all right but the jarian ambassador is here along with representatives from grennidon they have huge standing armies there are a few others here too from smaller landsmardovia pendisan reach and togressa theyre all expecting to meet with you tonight richard hooked a thumb behind the wide leather belt look they can surrender to you theyre either with us or against us they dont need to see me they just have to agree to the terms of surrender kahlan touched her fingers to his arm but you are lord rahl the master of dhara you made the demands they expect to see you then theyll have to wait until tomorrow night our men come first general kerson is right if the men cant fight were in trouble the dharan army is the main reason the lands are ready to surrender we cant show any weakness in our ability to lead but i dont want us to be separated she whispered richard smiled i know i feel the same but this is important promise me youll be careful his smile widened i promise and you know that a wizard always keeps his promise all right then but hurry back i will you just stay away from that marlin fellow he turned to the others cara you and raina stay here along with egan ulic im sorry i yelled at you ill make it up to you by letting you come with me so you can watch me with those big blue eyes and make me feel guilty he turned to the last of them berdine since i know that you three will make my life miserable if i dont take at least one of you you can come with me berdine turned a grin on nadine im lord rahls favorite nadine rather than looking impressed appeared dumbfounded as she had throughout most of the preceding conversation nadine finally turned a haughty look on richard she folded her arms across her breasts and are you going to boss me around too are you going to tell me what to do like you seem to enjoy doing to everyone else richard rather than getting angry as kahlan thought he might at the insult looked more disinterested than ever there are a lot of people fighting for our freedom fighting to stop the imperial order from enslaving the midlands dhara and eventually westland i lead those willing to fight for their own freedom and on behalf of innocent people who would otherwise be enslaved i lead because circumstances have placed me in command i dont do it for power or because i enjoy it i do it because i must to my enemies or potential enemies i deliver demands to those loyal to me i issue orders you are neither nadine do as you wish nadines freckles disappeared as her cheeks mantled richard lifted his sword a few inches and let it drop back unconsciously checking that the blade was clear in its scabbard berdine ulic get your things and meet me out at the stables richard scooped up kahlans hand and pulled her toward the door i need to talk to the mother confessor alone richard took kahlan down the passageway crowded with muscular dharan guards wearing dark leather and chain mail and bristling weapons to an empty side hall he pulled her around the corner into the shadow beneath a silver lamp and backed her up against a wall paneled in agemellowed cherry with a finger he gently squashed the end of her nose i couldnt leave without kissing you goodbye kahlan grinned didnt want to kiss me in front of an old girlfriend youre the only one i love the only one ive ever loved richards features distorted in chagrin you can understand how it would be if one of your old boyfriends showed up no i cant his face went blank for just an instant and then went crimson sorry i wasnt thinking confessors had no boyfriends as they grew up the deliberate touch of a confessor destroyed a persons mind and in its place left only mindless devotion to the confessor who had touched him with her power a confessor always had to restrain her grip on her power lest it be accidentally released it generally wasnt difficult her power grew as she did and being born with the power the ability to restrain it came as naturally as breathing but in the throes of passion an experience she hadnt grown up with it was impossible for a confessor to maintain that restraint a lovers mind would unintentionally be destroyed in the distracted unrestrained apex of a confessors passion confessors even if they wished it had no friends save other confessors people feared them feared their power men especially feared confessors no man wanted to get within striking distance of a confessor confessors didnt have lovers a confessor chose her mate for qualities desirable in her daughter for the father he could be a confessor never chose for love because the act of loving would destroy the person she loved no one willingly wed a confessor a confessor chose her mate and took him with her magic before they were wedded men feared a confessor who had yet to choose a mate she was a destroyer among them a predator and men her potential prey only richard had defeated that magic his unequivocal love for her had transcended her power kahlan was the only confessor she had ever heard of who had the love of a man and could reciprocate that love in her whole life she had never imagined she would fulfill that most exalted of human desires love she had heard it said that there was only one true love in a persons life with richard that was more than a saying it was the dead cold truth more than any of it though she simply loved him helplessly and completely that he loved her and they could be together sometimes left her numb with disbelief she dragged her finger down his leather baldric so you never think about her you never wonder no look ive known nadine since i was little her father cecil brighton sells herbs and remedies id bring him rare plants now and again hed let me know if there was something he wanted but couldnt find when i went out to guide people id keep an eye out for what he needed nadine always wanted to be like her father to learn what herbs helped people and to work in his shop shed go with me sometimes to learn how to find certain plants she only went with you to look for plants well no there was a little more to it than that iwellsometimes id go visit her and her parents id go for walks with her even if her father hadnt asked me to find some herb i danced with her at the midsummer festival last summer before you came to hartland i liked her but i never led her to think i wanted to marry her kahlan smiled and decided to end his twisting in the wind she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him she wondered briefly at something he had said to nadine at what more there had been but then her mind was spinning from the feel of his powerful arms around her and his soft lips against hers his tongue glided across the inside of her front teeth and she sucked it in a big hand slid down her back and pulled her hard against him then she pushed him away richard she said breathlessly what about shota what if she causes trouble richard biinked trying to banish the lust from his eyes to the underworld with shota but in the past as much trouble as shota caused she always seemed to have a nugget of truth in the trouble she wrapped around it in her own way she was trying to do what needed doing shes not going to keep us from getting married i know but when i get back well get married and that will be that his smile made a sunrise seem boring i want you in that big bed of yours that you keep promising me but how can we get married now unless we do it here its a long way to the mud people we promised the bird man and weselan and savidlin and all the rest that we would be wedded as mud people chandalen protected me on my journey here and i owe him my life wesslan made me my beautiful blue wedding dress with her own hands out of cloth that probably took her years to earn they took us in they made us mud people the mud people have sacrificed for us many have given their lives for our cause i know its not the kind of wedding most women dream ofa whole village of halfnaked people covered in mud dancing around bonfires calling the spirits to come join two of their people having a feast that goes on for days with those strange drums and ritual dancers acting out stories and all the rest but its the most heartfelt ceremony we could ever have right now we cant leave aydindril to go on a long journey to the mud people just because we want to just for us everyone else is depending on us there is a war going on richard pressed a gentle kiss against her forehead i know i want the mud people to marry us too and they will trust me im the seeker im giving it a lot of thought i have a few ideas he sighed but right now i have to go take care of things mother confessor ill be back tomorrow promise she hugged him so tight it made her aims hurt he finally separated from her and looked down into her eyes ive got to go before it gets any later or ill have men getting hurt in the dark up in those passes he paused if if nadine needs anything would you see that she gets it a horse or food or supplies or whatever shes not a bad person i dont wish her ill she doesnt deserve what shota did to her kahlan nodded and then laid her head against his chest she could hear his heart beating thank you for getting this outfit to be married in you look more handsome than ever she closed her eyes against the pain of the words she had heard back in the red room richard why didnt you get angry when cara said those cruel things because i understand what was done to them ive been in that world of madness hate would have destroyed me forgiveness in my heart was the only thing that saved me i dont want hate to destroy them i didnt want to let mere words ruin what im trying to give them i want them to learn to trust sometimes you can only gain trust by giving it maybe youre having an effect despite what cara said back there earlier today she said some things that make me think they understand kahlan smiled and tried to lighten the subject of the mordsith i heard you were outside today with berdine and raina taming chipmunks taming chipmunks is easy i was doing something considerably more difficult i was trying to tame mordsith his one was grave leading to the impression that his thoughts were far away you should have seen berdine and raina they were giggling just like little girls i almost wept at the sight kahlan smiled to herself in wonder and here i thought you were just out there wasting time how many more mordsith are back at the peoples palace in dhara dozens dozens it was a daunting thought at least chipmunks are plentiful he stroked a hand down her hair as lie held her head to his chest i love you kahlan amnell thanks for being patient i love you too richard rahl she clutched his tunic and pressed herself against him richard shota still scares me promise me that you really will marry me he let out a little breathy laugh and then kissed the top of her head i love you more than i could ever tell you there is no one else not nadine not anyone i swear an oath on my gift you are the only one i will ever love i promise she could hear her heart drumming in her ears that was not the promise she had asked for he pushed away i have to go but he looked back around the comer what i have to go she shooed him with a hand go hurry back to me he blew her a kiss and then he was gone she leaned a shoulder against the corner as she watched his billowing gold cape recede down the hall and listened to the jangle of chain mail and weapons and thud of boots as a raft of guards trailed in his wake chapter the two remaining mordsith and egan waited in the red sitting room the door to the bedroom was closed raina egan i want you to go protect richard kahlan announced as she walked in lord rahl told us to remain with you mother confessor raina said kahlan lifted an eyebrow since when have you followed lord rahls orders when it comes to matters of protecting him raina grinned wickedly a rare sight fine by us but he will be angry that we left you alone i have cara and a palace packed with guards and surrounded by troops the biggest danger to me is that one of those hulking guards will step on my foot richard has only five hundred men and berdine and ulic im worried for him what if he sends us back tell him tell him wait kahlan crossed the room to the mahogany writing desk and pulled paper ink and pen from under the lid she dipped the pen leaned over and wrote stay warm and sleep snug it gets cold in the mountains in the spring i love youkahlan she folded the paper and handed it to raina follow at a distance wait until after they set up camp then give him this message tell him that i told you it was important it will be dark and he wont send you back in the dark raina unfastened two buttons at the side of her leather outfit and slid the note in between her breasts he will still be angry but at you kahlan smiled the big fellow doesnt scare me i know how to cool his scowl raina smiled conspiratorially ive noticed she looked over her shoulder at a pleasedlooking egan lets do our duty and deliver the mother confessors message to lord rahl we need to find some slow horses after they had departed kahlan glanced to a watchful cara and then knocked on the bedroom door come in came nadines muffled voice cara followed kahlan in kahlan didnt object she knew that if she had asked her to wait outside cara would have ignored the order the mordsith paid no heed to orders if they thought protecting her or richard required that they did so nadine was rearranging things in her scruffy travel bag her head hung low looking into the bag and her thick hair dangled down around her head hiding her face periodically she pushed her kerchief in under that veil of hair are you all right nadine nadine sniffled but didnt look up ii you call being the biggest fool the spirits ever saw all right then i guess im just dandy shota has played me for a fool too i know how you feel sure is there anything you need richard wanted me to see to it that you have anything you need hes concerned about you and pigs fly he just wants me out of your fine room and on the road home thats not true nadine he said that you were a nice person nadine finally straightened and pushed some of her hair back over her shoulder she wiped her nose and stuffed the kerchief in a pocket in her blue dress im sorry you must hate me i didnt mean to come busting in here and try to take your man i didnt know i swear i didnt know or id never have done it i thought well i thought he wanted the word me was drowned in the sound of her tears trying to imagine the devastation of losing richards love stirred kahlans sympathy she gave nadine a comforting hug and sat her on the bed nadine pulled the kerchief back out of her pocket and pressed it against her nose as she wept kahlan sat down on the bed next to the woman why dont you tell me about it about you and richard if it would make you feel better sometimes it helps to have someone listen i feel so foolish nadine flopped her arms down in her lap as she made an effort to control her weeping its my own fault i always liked richard everybody liked richard hes nice to everyone ive never seen him like he was today he seems so different he is different in some ways kahlan said even from last autumn when i first met him hes been through a lot hes had to sacrifice his old life and hes been tested by events hes had to learn to fight or die hes had to face the fact that george cypher wasnt his real father nadine looked up in astonishment george wasnt his father then who was someone named rahl kahlan nodded darken rahl the leader of dhara dhara until the boundary came down i only thought of dhara as an evil place it was kahlan said darken rahl was a violent ruler who sought conquest through torture and murder he had richard captured and tortured nearly to death richards brother michael had betrayed him to darken rahl michael well i guess that really doesnt surprise me richard loved michael michael is an important man but he has a mean streak if he wants something he doesnt care who it hurts though no one had the nerve to voice it i dont think anyone was too unhappy when he leftand never came back he died in the fight with darken rahl nadine didnt seem unhappy about this news either kahlan didnt say that richard had had michael executed for betraying the people he was supposed to be protecting for his responsibility in the deaths of so many darken rahl was trying to use magic that would have enslaved everyone under his rule richard escaped and killed hi real father and saved us all darken rahl was a wizard wizard and richard defeated him yes we all owe richard a great debt for saving us from what his father would have taken the world into richard is a wizard too nadine laughed at what she thought was a joke kahlan didnt so much as smile cara stood stonefaced nadines eyes widened youre serious arent you yes zedd was his grandfather zedd was a wizard as was richards real father richard was born with the gift but he doesnt know very much about how to use it zedds gone too he came with us in the beginning ties been fighting with us and trying to help richard but a short time ago in a battle he was lost i fear he was killed up at the wizards keep up on the mountain above aydindril richard refuses to believe zedd was killed kahlan shrugged maybe he wasnt that old man was the most resourceful person ive ever met other than richard nadine wiped her kerchief across her nose richard and that crazy old man were best friends that was what richard meant then when he said that his grandfather taught him about herbs everyone comes to my father for remedies my father knows just about everything about herbs and i hope someday to know half of what he knows but my father always said that he wished he knew half as much as old zedd i never knew zedd was richards grandfather no one did not even richard its a long story ill tell you a bit of the more important parts kahlan looked down at her own hands nested in her lap after richard stopped darken rahl he was taken by the sisters of the light to the old world so that they could teach him to me his gift they would have kept him at the palace of the prophets in a web of magic that slowed time they would have had him there for centuries we thought he was lost to us the palace of the prophets turned out to be infested with sisters of the dark and they wanted to free the keeper of the underworld they tried to use richard to those ends but he escaped his confinement and stopped them in the process the towers of perdition that kept the old and new worlds separated were destroyed now emperor jagang of the imperial order in the old world is no longer restrained by those towers and is trying to bring all the world under his rule he wants richard dead for thwarting him janagang is powerful and has a huge army we have been unwillingly cast into a war for our destiny our freedom and for our very existence richard leads us in that war zedd acting in his capacity as first wizard named richard the seeker of truth its an ancient post created three thousand years ago in the great war that raged at that time its a solemn assignment of rectitude granted when there is grave need a seeker is above any law but his own and backs his authority with the sword of truth and its attendant magic fate occasionally touches us all in ways we dont always understand but it sometimes seems to have a death grip on richard nadine her eyes wide finally blinked richard why richard why is he in the center of all this hes just a woods guide hes just a nobody from hartland just because kittens are born in the hearth oven that doesnt make them muffins no matter where theyre born its their destiny to grow up to go out and kill rats richard is a very special kind of wizard a war wizard he is the first wizard with both sides of the magic additive and subtractive to be born in three thousand years richard didnt choose to do all this he does this because we are all depending on him to help us remain a free people richard isnt one to stand by and watch while people are hurt nadine looked away i know she fumbled with the kerchief in her fingers i kind of lied to you before about what she heaved a sigh well when i told you about tommy and lester i made it sound like it was me who knocked out their front teeth the truth is i was on my way to meet richard we were to go for a walk and look for some mapleleafed viburnum my father needed some of the inner bark to make a decoction for a baby with colic and he had run out richard knew where there was a patch anyway when i was on my way through the woods to richards place i came across tommy lancaster and his friend lester on their way back from hunting doves id fended off tommys unwanted advances in front of some of his pals and made him look a fool i guess i kind of slapped him and called him a name he thought to pay me back when he came across me in the woods he had lester hold me down and he well about the time he got his pants pushed down around his knees richard showed up that took the starch right out of tommy richard told them to be off and said that he was going to tell their fathers instead of doing the smart thing and leaving the two of them decided to put a few bird arrows in richard to teach him a lesson to mind his own business thats why tommy and lester dont have any front teeth he told them that that was for what they wanted to do to me he broke their valuable yew bows and told them that that was for what they wanted to do to him he told tommy that if he ever again tried to do that to me hed slice off well you know kahlan smiled that sounds like the richard i know it doesnt sound like hes really changed all that much the tommys and lesters are just bigger now and meaner nadine gave a little shrug i guess she looked up when cara held out nadines tin cup which cara had filled from the ewer on the washstand nadine took a sip i cant believe people are really trying to kill richard i cant believe anyone would want to kill him she smirked even tommy and lester only want to knock out his teeth she settled the cup in her lap i cant believe his own father would want to kill him you said darken rahl had richard tortured why did he do that kahlan glanced up at cara its in the past i really dont want to stir up the memories nadine reddened sorry i almost forgot that he and you she drew her fingers across her cheeks wiping away a fresh tear it just doesnt seem fair younadine flicked a hand in frustrationyouve got everything you have this this palace i never even knew such things existed it looks like some vision come from the spirit world and you have such fine things and magnificent clothes that dress makes you look like one of the good spirits nadine looked kahlan in the eye and youre so beautiful it doesnt seem fair you even have beautiful green eyes i just have dumb brown eyes you must have had men lined up around the palace your whole life wanting you you must have had more suitors than most women can even dream of you have everything you could have your pick of any man in the midlands and you pick a man from my home love isnt always fair it just is and your eyes are lovely kahlan twined her fingers together and hooked her hands over a knee what did richard mean when he said to you that there is no us and that you of all people should know that nadines eyes slid closed as she turned her face away well i guess a lot of girls in hartland wanted richard not just me he wasnt like anyone else he was special i remember one time when he was about ten or twelve and he talked two men out of fighting he always had a way about him he got the two men to laughing and they left my pas shop with an arm over each others shoulder richard was always a rare person the mark of a wizard kahlan said so richard must have had a lot of girlfriends no not really he was nice to everyone and polite and helpful but he never seemed to fall for anyone that only seemed to make them want him all the more he didnt have a special person a love but a lot of us girls wanted to be the one after tommy and lester tried to tolay claim to me to rape you yeah i guess that was what it really was i never like to think that someone would really do that to me like thatholding me down and all but i guess that thats what they were trying to do rape me some people dont call it that though sometimes if a boy does that to a girl then hes laid claim to her and the parents say that it was because the girl encouraged it and so they make the girl and boy get married before she turns up pregnant i know girls who had to do that many younglings mostly those of the country folk have it already decided for them who theyre to marry but sometimes a boy doesnt like who hes supposed to marry and so he lays claim to who he wants like tommy tried to do to me in the hope that either hell get her pregnant and shell have to marry him or their parents will make them wed because shes been spoiled tommy was supposed to wed skinny rita wellington and he hated her sometimes the girl really does encourage it because she doesnt like who her parents picked for her mostly though younglings go along as theyre told my parents never decided for me some parents dont they say that its a recipe for trouble as often as it is one for happiness they said they figured that id know for myself what i wanted a lo of the girls who didnt have it decided for them wanted richard some of them like me waited long past when we should have been married and mothers two or three times over after richard stopped tommy richard kind of always looked out for me i started to think it was more than him just watching out for me at last i started to think that he really wanted to be with mi it seemed like he was really noticing me as a woman not as some kid he knew who he was protecting i was sure of it at the midsummer festival last year he danced with me more than any of the other girls they were turning green with envy especially when he held me close right then and there i wanted him to be the one no one else i thought that after the festival things would change that he would tell me that i meant more to him than i had before i thought he would come around and court me more serious he didnt nadine held the cup of water between her knees with one hand as she worked her kerchief in the fingers of her other hand i had other boys who wanted to court me and i didnt want to throw my future away if richard was never going to come to his senses so i got it in my head to give him a shove a shove nadine nodded besides some of the other boys richards brother michael was always after me too i think just because he always was jealous of richard at the time i wasnt exactly against the idea of michael courting me i didnt know him so well but he was already making somebody of himself i thought richard would never be anything more than a woods guide not that thats bad im nobody special either richard loved the woods kahlan smiled he still does if he could im sure he would like nothing more than being a simple woods guide but he cant so what happened then well i figured that if i kind of made richard just a bit jealous maybe he would get down off the fence and make a move for me sometimes men need a shove my ma always says so i gave him a good shove nadine cleared her throat i let him catch me kissing michael i made sure he saw that i was having a good time of it kahlan drew a deep breath as her eyebrows lifted nadine may have grown up with richard but she certainly didnt know him he never even got angry at me or jealous or anything nadine said he was still nice to me and he still watched out for me but he never came visiting and he never asked me to go for walks after that when i tried to talk to him about it to explain he just wasnt interested nadine stared off he had that look in his eyes like he did today that look that means he just doesnt care i never knew what it meant until i saw it again today i think he really had cared and expected me to show him i cared by being loyal but id betrayed him nadine dabbed at her lower lids as he took labored breaths shota told me that richard was going to marry me and i was so happy that i just didnt want to believe it when he said it wasnt so i didnt want to believe that look in his eyes so i pretended to myself that it didnt mean anything but it does it means everything im sorry nadine kahlan said softly nadine stood and set the tin cup on the side table tears streamed down her cheeks and dripped off the side of her jaw forgive me for coming in here like i did he loves you not me he never loved me im happy for you mother confessor you have a good man who will watch over you and protect you and always be kind i know he will kahlan stood and took nadines hand giving it a comforting squeeze kahlan my name is kahlan kahlan nadine still couldnt meet kahlans eyes does he kiss good i always wondered when i laid awake in bed i always wondered when you love someone with all your heart their kisses are always good i guess i never had a good kiss one really enjoyed like the ones ive dreamed about anyway she smoothed the front of her dress as she made an effort to compose herself i wore this because blue is richards favorite color you should know thatblue is his favorite color dress i know kahlan whispered nadine pulled her bag closer i dont know what im thinking forgetting my profession while i ramble on about whats over and done nadine rummaged around in her bag bringing out a small piece of a sheeps horn with a cork stopper in the squarecut end the horn was marked with scratches and circles she pulled the cork stopper aid dipped in a finger then lifted it to cara cara backed away what do you think you are doing its an unguent made from aum to take away the sting and comfrey and yarrow to help stop the bleeding so the wound can heal smooth the cut on your cheek is still oozing if this doesnt stop the blood then i have some foxglove but i think this will do it its not only the ingredients but how much of each my pa says thats the secret that makes the medicine work i dont need it cara said youre very pretty you dont want to end up with a scar now do you i have many scars you just cant see them where are they cara scowled but nadine didnt back away all right cara said at last use your herbs if it will get you away from me but im not undressing so you can peer at my scars nadine smiled assurance and then dabbed the brownish paste on caras cheek this will take away the pain of the cut but its going to sting for just a minute and then it will ease cara didnt so much as blink it must lave surprised nadine because she paused and looked at caras eyes before resuming her work when she was finished nadine replaced the stopper in the horn and placed it back in her bag nadine glanced around the room ive never seen such a beautiful room thank you for letting me use it of course do you need anything some supplies anything nadine shook her head wiped her nose a last time and stuffed the kerchief back in the pocket she remembered the cup downed the rest of the water and put it in her bag too its a bit of a journey but i have some silver left ill be fine she rested a hand on her bag as she stared down at her trembling fingers i never thought my journey would end like this im going to be the laugh of hartland running off after richard like i did she swallowed whats pa going to say did shota tell him too that you were going to marry richard no i hadnt met shota yet what do you mean i thought she was the one who told you to come here that you were to marry him wellnadine made a wincing smilethat wasnt exactly how it happened i see kahlan clasped her hands well exactly how did it happen it will sound sillylike im some moonstruck girl of twelve nadine just tell me nadine considered a moment before finally sighing i suppose it doesnt matter i started having these well i dont know what to call it id see richard or rather i thought i saw richard id see him out of the comer of my eye and id turn but he wouldnt be there like one day when i was walking in the woods looking for new shoots and i saw him standing beside a tree so i stopped but he was gone every time i knew he needed me i didnt know how i knew but i knew i knew it was important that he was in trouble of some sort i never questioned it i told my parents that richard needed me and i had to go help him and they believed you they had faith in your visions they simply let you set out well i never quite explained it to them i just told them that richard had sent me a message that he needed my help and i was going to him i guess that i well i might have kind of made them think i knew where i was going kahlan was beginning to see that nadine didnt explain things to anyone very well then shota came no then i left i knew richard needed me and so i started out alone you simply thought to march off and search the entire midlands for him nadine shrugged selfconsciously it never occurred to me to wonder how i would find him i knew he needed me and i felt that it was important so i left to go to him she smiled as if to reassure kahlan i came right to himstraight as an arrow it all worked out exactly right her cheeks flushed except the part about him wanting me i mean nadine had you been having any strange dreams then or now nadine brushed back a thick strand of hair strange dreams no no strange dreams you know i mean no stranger than any dreams just regular dreams what kind of regular dreams do you have well you know like when you dream that youre little again and lost in the woods and none of the trails lead you where you know they should or like when you dream that you cant find all the right ingredients for a pie and so you go to a cave and borrow them from a bear that can talk things like that just dreams dreams that you can fly or breathe underwater crazy things but just dreams like ive always had nothing different have they changed recently no if i remember them theyre the same sort of things i see i guess that all sounds pretty normal nadine pulled a cloak from her bag well i guess id better get a start with luck ill be home for the spring festival kahlan frowned youll be lucky to make midsummer festival nadine laughed i should think no it cant take longer back than here just two weeks or so i only left just after the moons second quarter its not yet full kahlan stared dumbly two weeks it had to have taken nadine months to travel all the way from westland especially in the winter when she would have had to have started and especially across the rangshada mountains your horse must have had wings nadine laughed then it died out as her smooth brow puckered funny you should mention that i dont have a horse i walked walked kahlan repeated incredulously yes but since ive left ive had dreams of flying on a horse with wings kahlan was having to work at keeping track of the shifting pieces of nadines story she tried to think of how richard would ask questions it had made her feel foolish when richard put words to all the questions she should have asked marlin but never thought of though he had taken the sting out of it by telling her that she had done the right thing it still embarrassed her that she had found out next to nothing important from marlin when she had had her chance confessors didnt need to know much about questioning people once she had touched a person with her power a confessor simply asked the criminal to confess if they had truly committed the crimes they had been found guilty of and if the answer was yeswhich it always was except in a couple of rare instancesthen to recount the details there was no art to it and none needed it was an infallible way of seeing to it that political dissenters werent falsely accused and found guilty of crimes they didnt commit simply to have them eliminated through a convenient execution kahlan was determined to do a better job of asking nadine questions when did shota come to see you you still havent told me that part oh well she didnt exactly come to see me i came across her up in the mountains she had a lovely palace but i never had the chance to go inside i wasnt there long i wanted to get to richard and what did shota tell you what were her words her exact words lets see nadine pressed her first finger to her upper lip as she recollected she welcomed me she offered me tea she said that i had been expectedand had me sit with her she made samuel leave my bag when he tried to drag it away and she told me not to be afraid of him she asked where i was traveling and i told her that i was going to my richardthat he needed me then she told me things about richard things about his past that i would know about it astonished me that she would know so much about him but i thought that she must know him and then she told me things about me that she would have no way of knowing like longings and ambitionsbeing a healer using my herbs things like that thats when i realized she was a mystic i dont remember her exact words about any of that part she told me that it was true about richard needing me she said that we were going to be married she said that the sky had told her it was so nadine looked away from kahlans eyes i was so happy i dont think id ever been that happy the sky what else then she said that she didnt want to delay my journey to richard she said the wind hunts himwhatever that meansand that i was right that he needed me and i should hurry and be on my way she wished me luck thats all she must have said something else no thats all nadine buttoned her bag closed except she said a prayer for richard i think what do you mean what did she say her exact words well when she turned away to go back to her palace as i was getting up to leave i heard her whisper real solemnlike may the spirits have mercy on his soul kahlan felt her arms under the white satin sleeves of her dress prickle with gooseflesh she only remembered to take a breath when she felt her lungs burning for want of air nadine hoisted her bag well ive caused you enough grief id best be on my way home kahlan spread her hands look nadine why dont you stay here for a while nadine paused with a bewildered look why kahlan desperately searched for an excuse well i wouldnt mind hearing stories about richard when he was growing up you could tell me about all the trouble he got himself into she made herself smile encouragement id really like that nadine shook her head richard wouldnt want me here hell be angry if he comes back and im still here you didnt see the look in his eyes nadine richard isnt going to throw you out on your ear without letting you have a chance to rest up for a few days before you start back richard isnt like that he said anything she needs i think you could use a rest for a few days more than anything else nadine shook her head again no youve already been more kind to me than ive a right to expect you and richard belong together you dont need me around but thank you for the offer i cant believe how kind you areits small wonder richard loves you any other woman in your place wouldve had me shaved bald and sent out of town in the back of a manure wagon nadine id really like you to stay kahlan wet her lips please she heard herself add it might cause hard feelings between you and richard i dont want to be the cause of that im not that kind of person if it was a problem i wouldnt have asked stay at least for a few days all right you could stay right here in this room you like so much id really like you to stay nadine studied kahlans eyes for a long moment you really want me to stay really yes kahlan could feel her nails digging into her palms really well to tell the truth im not in a hurry to go home and confess my foolishness to my parents all right then if you really want me to ill stay for a while thank you despite having important reasons for asking nadine to stay kahlan couldnt help feeling like a moth flying into a flame chapter kahlan forced a smile good then youll stay it will be nice to have you stay for a visit well talk you and about richard i mean id like to hear your stories about him growing up she realized she must sound like she was babbling and made herself stop nadine beamed i can sleep in the bid dont be silly of course in the bed where else i have a blanket and could sleep on the carpet so as not to no i wont have it ive invited you to stay i want you to feel at home just like other guests who use this room nadine giggled then id be sleeping on the floor i sleep on a pallet on the floor in the back room above our shop well kahlan said here you will sleep in the bed kahlan glanced at cara before going on later ill show you around the palace if youd like but for now why dont you just unpack some of your things and have a rest while cara and i go see to some important business what business cara asked the woman is as silent as a stone through all this kahlan thought and now she has to ask questions marlin business lord rahl told us to stay away from marlin hes an assassin sent to kill richard there are things i need to know i want to come too then nadine said she looked back and forth between kahlan and cara i cant imagine anyone wanting to kill a person much less richard i want to see what such a person looks like i want to look into his eyes kahlan emphatically shook her head its not something you want to see we need to question him and it isnt likely to be pleasant really cara asked her voice brightening why nadine asked what do you mean kahlan held up a finger enough i say this for your own good marlin is dangerous and i dont want you down there you are a guest please respect my wishes while you are a guest in my home nadine studied the floor at her feet of course forgive me i will tell the guards that you are a guest and if you would like anythingto have some of your things washed a bath anythingjust ask and they will see that someone from the staff helps you ill be back after a while and we can have dinner well talk over dinner nadine turned to her bag on the bed sure i didnt mean to meddle i dont want to be in the way kahlan hesitantly touched a hand to the back of nadines shoulder i didnt mean to sound like i was ordering you around this business with someone trying to hurt richard just has me on edge thats all im sorry i nearly bit your head off youre a guest please enjoy our home as your own nadine smiled over her shoulder i understand thanks she really was a beautiful young woman attractive figure and face and an innocent quality despite what truths kahlan feared she danced around kahlan could easily see why richard would have beer attracted to her she wondered at what random wisp of fate had matched richard with her instead of this one whatever the reason she thanked the good spirits that it was so and prayed fervently that it would remain so more than anything kahlan wanted this perfidious gift from shota to vanish she wanted this tempting beautiful dangerous young woman away from richard to just send nadine away if only she could do so after telling the guards that nadine was a guest and once kahlan and cara had descended the carpeted stairs at the far end of the hall and were alone on the richly appointed landing cara seized kahlans arm and spun her around to a halt are you crazy what are you talking about cara gritted her teeth as she leaned closer a witch woman sends your man a wedding giftits the bride and you invite her to stay kahlan rubbed a thumb against the round polished sphere of ironwood topping the newel post i had to isnt it obvious what is obvious to me is that you should have done as the little strumpet suggested you should have shaved her bald and sent her away in the back of a manure wagon shes a victim in this too she is shotas pawn her tongue has a distaste for the truth she still wants your man if you cant see that in her eyes then you arent the wise woman i thought you to be cara i trust richard i know he loves me if theres one thing at the core of richards way of looking at things its trust and loyalty i know my heart is safe in his hands how would it look if i acted like a jealous woman and sent nadine away if i dont show my trust in him then im not honoring his loyalty to me i cant afford to even appear to betray his trust in me caras scowl didnt so much as soften that bucket wont carry water for me all that may be true but that isnt why you asked nadine to stay you want to strangle her as much as i do i can see it in your green eyes kahlan smiled trying to see herself in the dark polished ironwood she could only see a blur of a reflection hard to fool a sister of the agiel youre right i had to ask nadine to stay because theres something going on something dangerous the danger wont simply go away if i make nadine leave with a gloved hand cara wiped a strand of blond hair back from her face dangerous like what therein lies the problem i dont know and dont you dare even think of hurting her i have to find out whats really going on and in order to do that i may need nadine i dont want to have to go hunting her when i could have kept her at hand and in sight in the beginning look at it this way would it have been the right thing to do to simply send marlin away when he arrived and announced he wanted to kill richard would that have solved the problem why are we keeping him around to find out whats going on thats why cara wiped at the unguent on her check as if it were a smudge of dirt i think you are inviting trouble to your bed kahlan had to blink at the burning sensation in her eye i know me too the obvious thing to do the thing i ache to do is to send nadine away on the fastest horse i can find but no problem is that easily solved especially one sent by shota you mean what shota told nadine about the wind hunting lord rahl thats part of it i dont know what it means but it doesnt sound to me like its something shota dreamed up worse though is shotas prayer may the spirits have mercy on his soul i dont know what she meant by that but it terrifies me that and that i might be making the biggest mistake of my life but what choice do i have two people show up on the same day one sent to kill him and the other sent to marry him i dont know which is more dangerous but i do know that neither can be simple dismissed if someone is trying to stick a knife in your back closing your eyes doesnt make you safe caras face eased from that of a mordsith to the softer features of a woman who understood another womans fears will watch your back if she crawls into lord rahls bed i will throw her out before he ever finds her there kahlan squeezed caras arm thanks now lets get down to the pit cara didnt budge lord rahl said he does not want you down there and since when have you started following orders i always follow his orders especially the ones i know he means he means this one fine you can watch over nadine while i go down there cara snatched kahlans elbow as she started to turn away lord rahl does not want you in danger and i dont want him in danger cara i felt a fool when richard asked me all those questions that we failed to ask marl in i want the answers to those questions lord rahl said he would ask them and hes not going to be back until tomorrow night what happens in the meantime what if something is going on and its too late to stop it by then what if richard is killed because we sat on our hands following his orders richard is afraid for me and thats keeping him from thinking clearly marlin has information about whats going on and its foolhardy to let time pass while the danger grows what was it that you said to me before something about hesitation being the end of you or the end of those you care about caras face went slack but she didnt answer i care about richard and im not going to risk his life by hesitating im going to get the answers to those questions cara smiled at last i like your thinking mother confessor but then you are a sister of the agiel the orders were illadvised if not foolish mordsith only follow lord rahls foolish orders when his male pride is at stake not his life we will go have a little discussion with marlin and get the answer to every one of those questions and more when lord rahl comes back we will be able to give him the information he needsif we havent already ended the threat kahlan popped the palm of her hand against the round newel post thats the cara i know as they went lower in the palace below the levels with carpets and paneling down to the narrow lowceilinged halls where light came only from lamps and even lower where only torches lit the way the air went from light and springfresh to stale and then to rank with the heavy smell of damp moldy stone kahlan had walked those confining halls more times than she wished to recall the pit was where they took confessions of the condemned she had taken her first there from a man who had killed his neighbors daughters after committing unspeakable acts on them of course each of those times she had been accompanied by a wizard now she was going to see a wizard being held there when they had passed out of earshot of a squad of soldiers guarding an intersection with two stairwells and before they reached the turn that would take them to the pit hall that would be crowded with all the soldiers she had stationed there kahlan glanced over cara was an attractive woman but a woman with an air of menace about her as she swept the empty hall with vigilant gazes cara can i ask you a personal question cara clasped her hands behind her back as she strode along you are a sister of the agiel ask before you told me that hesitation can be the end of you or those you care about you were talking about yourself werent you cara slowed to a stop even in the hissing torchlight kahlan could see that her face had paled now that is truly a personal question you dont have to tell me i dont mean it to sound like an order or anything i was just wondering woman to woman you know so much about me and i hardly know anything about you except that you are mordsith i wasnt always mordsith cara whispered her eyes had lost the menace and she looked like nothing so much a a frightened little girl kahlan could tell that cara was no longer seeing the empty stone hall i guess that there is no reason not to tell you as you said i am not to blame for what was done to me others were responsible every year in dhara they would select a few girls to be trained as mordsith it is said that the greatest cruelty is drawn from those with the kindest hearts rewards were paid for the names of gills who fit the requirements i was an only child one of the requirements and of tie right age the girl and her parents are taken the parents to be murdered in the training of a mordsith my parents didnt know that our names had been sold to i he hunters caras face and tone had lost their emotion she had gone blank as if she were telling of last years beet harvest but her words if not her tone carried more than enough emotion my father and i were out back of the house butchering chickens when they came i had no idea what it meant my father did he saw them coming down the hill through the trees he surprised them but there were more than he had seen or could handle and he had the advantage for only a few moments he screamed at me cari the knife cari get the knife i snatched it up because he said to he was holding three of the men my father was big he screamed again cari stab them stab them hurry cara looked into kahlans eyes i just stood there i hesitated i didnt want to stab someone to hurt someone i just stood there i couldnt even kill the chickens he did that part kahlan didnt know if cara was going to go on in the dead silence she decided that if she didnt the questions would end there cara looked away from kahlans eyes staring off into the visions and then she did go on someone walked up beside me ill never forget it as long as i live i looked up and there was this woman this beautiful woman the most beautiful woman i had ever seen with blue eyes and blond hair in a long braid the sunlight coming through the leaves danced in little patches across her red leather outfit she smiled down at me as she took the knife out of my hand not a pretty smile but a smile like a snake thats what i always called her in my mind after thatsnake when she straightened she said isnt that sweet little cari doesnt want to hurt anyone with her knife that hesitation just made you a mordsith cara it begins cara stood rigid as if turned to stone they kept me in a little room with little grates in the bottom of the door i couldnt get out but the rats could get in at night when i finally could stay awake no longer and fell asleep the rats would sneak into my empty little room and bite my fingertips and my toes snake beat me nearly to death for blocking the grate rats like blood it excites them i learned to sleep in a ball with my hands in fists and tucked in against my belly where they couldnt get at my fingers but they could usually get at my toes i tried taking my shirt off and wrapping it around my bare feet but then if i didnt sleep on my stomach they would bite my nipples laying barechested on the cold stone with my hands under my stomach was a torture in itself but it usually kept me awake longer if the rats couldnt get a my toes they would bite me somewhere elsemy ears or nose or legsuntil i woke with a start and scared them away in the night i could hear the other girls cry out when a rat bit them awake i could always hear one of them weeping in the night calling for her mother sometimes i realized it was my own voice i heard sometimes i would wake when rats scratched my face with their little claws their whiskers brushing my cheeks as their cold little noses pressed against my lips sniffing for a crumb i thought to stop eating what they brought me and left the bowl of gruel and slab of bread on the floor hoping the rats would eat my dinner and leave me alone it didnt work the food only brought hordes of rats and then when it was gone i always ate every scrap of dinner after that when snake brought it sometimes she would taunt me when she brought my dinner she would say dont hesitate cara or the rats will get your dinner i knew what she meant by saying dont hesitate it was her way of reminding me what my hesitation had cost me and my parents when they tortured my mother to death in front of me snake said see what happens cara because you hesitated because you were too timid we were taught that darken rahl was father rahl we had no father but he at my third breaking when they told me to torture my real father to death snake told me not to hesitate i didnt my father begged for mercy cari please he wept cari spare yourself becoming what they want but i never hesitated after that my only father was father rahl cara brought her agiel up and stared at it as she rolled it in her fingers i earned my agiel for that the very same agiel they trained me with i earned the appellation mordsith cara looked back into kahlans eyes as if from a great distance not merely the two steps that separated them from the other side of madness a madness others had put there kahlan felt as if she too was turned to stone by what she saw in the depths of those blue eyes i have been snake i have stood in the dappled sunlight over young girls and taken the knife from their hands when they hesitated not wanting to hurt anyone kahlan had always hated snakes she hated them more now tears tickled her face as they ran down her cheeks leaving wet tracks im sorry cara she whispered her stomach roiled she wanted nothing more than to put her arms around the woman in red leather before her but she couldnt make herself move so much as a finger torches hissed in the distance she heard muffled snippets of conversation from the guards a soft ripple of laughter floated up the hall water weeping from the stone ceiling echoed as it splashed in a little green puddle not far away kahlan could hear her own heart pounding in her ears lord rahl freed us from that kahlan remembered richard telling her that he had almost wept at the sight of the other two mordsith giggling like little girls as they fed seeds to chipmunks kahlan understood the leap that was a simple giggle richard understood the madness kahlan didnt know if these women could ever return from it but if they were to have a chance it was only because of richard the iron returned to caras grim expression lets go find out how marlin planned to harm lord rahl but dont expect me to be gentle if he hesitates in confessing every detail under sergeant collinss watchful eye a dharan soldier unlocked the iron door and backed away as if the rusty lock was the only thing protecting everyone in the palace from the sinister magic below in the pit two more big soldiers effortlessly dragged the heavy ladder closer before kahlan could pull open the door she heard approaching voices and footsteps everyone turned to look up the hall it was nadine with four soldiers escorting her nadine rubbed her hands together as if to warm them as she stepped through the ring of hulking leatherclad guards kahlan didnt return the womans bright smile what are you doing down here well you said i was a guest as pretty as your rooms are i wanted to go for a walk i asked the guards to show me the way down here i want to see this killer i told you to wait upstairs in your room i told you that i didnt want you coming down here nadines dainty brow drew together im getting just a little tired of being treated like a backwater bumpkin she lifted her delicate nose im a healer im respected where i come from people listen when i speak when i tell someone to do something they do it if i tell a councilman to take a potion three times a day and to stay in bed he very well drinks his medicine three times a day from his bed until i tell him he can leave it i dont care who jumps when you speak kahlan said here you jump when i speak do you understand nadine pressed her lips together as she slanted her fists on her hips now you look here ive been cold and hungry and scared ive been played for a fool by people i dont even know i was minding my own business going about my life when i was sent on this pointless journey only to arrive at a place where people treat me like a leper as my thanks for coming to help ive been yelled at by people i dont know and humiliated by a boy i grew up with i thought i was going to marry the man i wanted but i had that rug yanked out from under my feet he doesnt want me he wants you well so be it now someone is trying to kill the man i traveled all this way to see and you tell me it isnt any of my business she shook a finger at kahlan richard cypher saved me from tommy lancaster laying claim to me if it wasnt for richard id be married to tommy now instead tommy had to marry rita wellington if it wasnt for richard id be the one with black eyes all the time id be barefoot buck at his shack and pregnant with the offspring of that pigfaced bully tommy ridiculed me for fixing herbs to help people he said it was stupid for a girl to mix herbs he said my father should have had a boy if he wanted someone to work in his shop touching herbs that sick people needed id never have any hope of being a healer if it wasnt for richard just because im not the one to be his wife that doesnt mean that i dont care about him i grew up with him hes still a boy from my home we take care of our own like theyre family even if they arent ive a right to know what danger hes in ive a right to see what sort of man from your world would want to kill a boy from my home whos helped me kahlan was in no mood to argue she was also in no mood to spare the woman what she might see she studied nadines brown eyes trying to tell if what cara had said that nadine still wanted richard was true if it was kahlan couldnt tell simply by looking into her eyes you want to see a man who wants to kill us richard and me kahlan gripped the lever and threw open the door fine you shall have your wish she gestured to the men with the ladder they pushed it through the opening and down into the darkness until it thudded in place kahlan yanked a torch from a bracket and thrust it in caras hand lets show nadine what she wishes to see cara checked kahlans resolve found it rock solid and then started down the ladder kahlan held her arm out in invitation welcome to my world nadine welcome to richards world nadines determination faltered for only an instant before she huffed and started down the ladder after cara kahlan glanced around at the guards sergeant collins if he comes up through this door before us he had better not get out of this hall alive he wants to kill richard on my word as a dharan soldier mother confessor harm wont get a glimpse of lord rahl with a hand signal from sergeant collins soldiers drew steel archers nocked arrows big hands unhooked crescentbladed axes from weapons belts kahlan gave the sergeant a nod of approval took another torch and started down the ladder chapter dank heavy air wafted up from the pit as kahlan followed nadine down the ladder using the hand with the torch to also hold the side of the ladder made her have to endure the heat of the flame near the side of her face but she was almost happy for the smell of pitch because it covered the stink of the air in the pit lower down the wavering light from the torches lit more than the stone walls they lit the dark figure in the center of the room kahlan stepped off the ladder as cara rammed her torch into a bracket on the slimecovered wall kahlan slipped hers into one on the opposite wall nadine stood transfixed looking at the man covered in dried blood hunched before them kahlan stepped past her to stand beside cara caras brow drew down as she peered at marlin his head hung forward and his eyes were closed his breathing was deep slow and even hes asleep cara whispered asleep kahlan whispered back how can he be asleep while hes standing up like that i dont know we always make new prisoners stand sometimes for days with no one to talk to and nothing to do but consider their doom it drains their resolvetakes the fight right out of them its an insidious form of torment i have had men beg to be beaten rather than have to stand alone hour after hour marlin was snoring softly how often does this happenthat they simply fall asleep cara put one hand on a hip as she wiped her mouth with the other ive had them fall asleep but that wakes them for sure if they move from the spot where weve told them to stand the link brings on the pain we dont have to be there the link works no matter where we are i have never even heard of a man falling asleep and remaining on his feet kahlan looked over her shoulder past nadine and up the long ladder to the light coming through the doorway she could see the tops of soldiers heads but none were so bold as to stare down into the pit where there were apt to be deeds of magic nadine stuck her head between them maybe its a spell magic of some sort she straightened pulling her head back when she received only glares in answer more out of curiosity than an attempt to wake him cara lightly jabbed marlins shoulder she pushed her finger into his chest and his stomach hard as a rock his muscles are all locked rigid that must be how hes able to stand there like that maybe its some sort of trick he learned as a wizard cara didnt seem convinced with a twitch of her hand so slight kahlan almost missed it cara spun her agiel up into her fist the pain kahlan knew it caused her to hold her agiel didnt show on her face it never did kahlan snatched caras wrist you dont need to do that just wake him and dont use your link with his mind his magic to give him pain unless its absolutely necessary unless i tell you so displeasure registered on caras face i think its necessary i cant have this i cant hesitate to exert my control cara there is a great gulf between prudence and hesitation this whole thing with marlin has been more than odd from the first lets just take it one step at a time youve said that you have control over him lets not be impetuous you do have control dont you a slow smile spread on caras lips oh i have control no doubt of that but if you insist i will wake him the way we sometimes wake our pets then cara bent forward at the waist slipped her left arm around his neck tilted her head and gently gave marlin a long kiss on the mouth kahlan felt her face go red she knew that denna sometimes awakened richard like that before torturing him again with a satisfied smirk cara drew back like a cat coming awake from a nap marlins lids slid open his eyes had that quality in them againthat quality that made kahlans very soul want to shrink back this time she saw more than she had before these eyes were not merely those of great age these were eyes unvisited by fear as he regarded the three of them with slow unflinching calculating deliberation he bent his fisted hands back at the wrists and arched his back in a feline stretch a depraved grin spread onto his face a taint of wickedness expanding like blood seeping through white linen so my two darlins have returned his disquieting eyes seemed to see more than they should to know more than they should and theyve brought a new bitch with em marlins voice had been almost boyish before now it was deep and gravelly as if coming from a muscled man weighing twice as mucha voice steeped with unquestioned power and authority it exuded invincibility kahlan had never heard such a dangerous voice she retreated a step clutching caras arm and pulling her back with her though marlin didnt move she felt the coiling of menace cara kahlan put a hand behind forcing nadine back as she withdrew another stepcara tell me youve got him tell me you have control cara was staring mouth agape at marlin what she abruptly unleashed a powerful strike her armored fist only snapped his head a few inches to the side it should have taken him from his feet marlin regarded her with a bloody smile he spit out broken teeth nice try darlin marlin said in a rough voice but ive got control of your link with marlin cara rammed her agiel in his gut his body flinched with the jolt his arms flopping ineffectually his eyes though never lost the deadly look the smile didnt falter as he watched her cara took two steps back on her own whats going on nadine whispered whats wrong i thought you said he was helpless get out cara whispered urgently to kahlan now she glanced up the ladder ill hold him off lock the door wanting to leave marlin asked in the grating voice as they moved toward the ladder so soon and before weve had a little talk ive enjoyed listening to the talks you two have had ive learned so much i never knew about mordsith but i do now kahlan halted what are you talking about his predatory gaze moved from cara to kahlan i learned of your touching love for richard rahl it was so thoughtful of you to reveal the limits of his gift i suspected much of it but you confirmed the extent you also confirmed my suspicion that he would be able to recognize another with the gift and that it would raise his suspicions even you were able to see something wrong in marlins eyes who are you kahlan asked as she pushed nadine back with her toward the ladder marlin shook with a belly laugh why none other than your worst nightmare my little darlins jagang kahlan whispered incredulously is that it are you jagang the belly laugh boomed around the stone walls of the pit you have me cornered i confess it is i the dream walker himself ive borrowed this poor fellows mind just so i could pay you a little visit cara slammed her agiel against the side of his neck a puppet arm swept her aside cara returned almost instantly crashing into his kidneys trying to take him down he didnt budge with jerky movements he reached down caught her braid and flung her back against the wall behind him as if she were a stick doll kahlan winced at the sound of cara smacking the stone she rolled facedown on the floor blood soaking into her blond hair kahlan shoved nadine toward the ladder get out nadine seized a rung on the ladder what are you going to do ive seen enough this ends now kahlan went for marlin or jagang or whoever it was she had to end it with her power screaming nadine shot past kahlan and across the floor as if she were sliding across ice marlin caught the flailing woman spun her around and gripped her by the throat in one hand nadine her eyes wide choked for air kahlan skidded to a halt as marlin twitched up a cautionary finger tuttut ill crush her throat kahlan retreated a step nadine gulped air when he released the pressure one life for all those you will otherwise kill do you think the mother confessor would be unwilling to make such a choice at kahlans words nadine in renewed panic writhed in his grip her fingers digging frantically at his hands even if marlin didnt crush her throat he was touching her and if kahlan took him with her power nadine would be lost too perhaps you would but dont you want to know what im doing here darlin dont you want to know my plans for your love the great lord rahl kahlan turned and screamed up the shaft of light collins shut the door lock it above the door slammed shut only the spitting torches remained to light the pit the sound of the door clanging shut added its echo to the hissing torches kahlan turned back to marlin keeping her eyes on him she began slowly edging around the room what are you who are you well actually thats a difficult philosophical question to answer in terms you would understand a dream walker is able to slip into the infinite spaces of time between thoughts when a person who they are their very essence doesnt exist and inhabit that persons mind what you see before you is marlin a loyal little lapdog of mine im the flea on his back that he brought into your house with him he is a host which i thought to use for certain things nadine thrashed against her captor causing him to squeeze tighter to maintain his grip kahlan pursed her lips and urged her to shush if she continued fighting him she would get herself strangled as if snatching the lifeline of kahlans command nadine stilled in his grip and was able at last to pull breaths your host will shortly be a dead best kahlan said hes expendable unfortunately for you the damage has already been done thanks to marlin with a furtive glance to the side kahlan checked her slow progress toward the facedown cara why what has he done why marlin has brought you and richard rahl down for me of course you have yet to suffer what i have wrought but he has done it i had the privilege of witnessing the glory of it what have you done what are you doing here in aydindril jagang chuckled why ive been enjoying myself yesterday i even went to watch a jala game you were there richard rahl was there i saw you both i wasnt pleased to see that he changed the broc replacing it with a lightweight one hes turned it into a game for the weak its meant to be played with a heavy ball and by the strongest the most aggressive and brutish playersthose with the true lust to win do you know what jala means darlin kahlan shook her head as she ran through a list of her options and priorities foremost on the list was using her power to stop this man before he escaped the pit but first she had to find out all she could if they were to stop his plans she had already failed once at that task she wouldnt fail again its from my native tongue the full and proper name is jala dh jinthe game of life i dont like the way richard rahl corrupted it kahlan had almost reached cara so you infested this mans mind so that you could come and watch children play a game i thought that the great and allpowerful emperor jagang would have better things to do oh ive had better things to do much better his grin was maddening you see you thought i was dead i wanted you to know that you failed to kill me at the palace of the prophets i wasnt even there i was enjoying the charms of a young woman at the time actually one of my newly captured slaves so you arent dead you could have sent us a letter and not have to go to all this trouble you came for some other reason you were here with a sister of the dark sister amelia had a little task to perform but im afraid shes no longer a sister of the dark she betrayed her oath to the keeper of the underworld so that i could destroy richard rahl kahlans foot touched cara why didnt you tell us all this before when we first captured marlin why wait until now ah well i had to wait until amelia returned with what i sent her for im not one to take chances you see not anymore and what did she steal from aydindril for you jagang chuckled derisively oh not from aydindril darlin kahlan squatted down beside cara why would she no longer be sworn to the keeper not that im unhappy about it but why would she betray her oath because i placed her in a double bind i gave her the choice of being sent to her master where she would suffer for eternity at his merciless hands for her past failure with your love or to betray him and escape his grasp for now only to intensify his anger for later and darlin you should be unhappy about it very unhappy as it will be the downfall of richard rahl kahlan forced herself to speak an empty threat i dont make empty threats his smile widened why do you think i went to all this trouble to be there at its doing and to let you know that it is i jagang who has brought it upon you id hate to have you think it was simply chance kahlan shot to her feet and took an angry stride toward him tell me you bastard what have you done marlins hand jerked up raising one finger nadine made a strangling sound l careful mother confessor or youll be denying yourself hearing the rest of it kahlan stepped back nadine gasped for air thats better darlin you see richard rahl thought that by destroying the palace of the prophets he kept me from gaining the knowledge it contained marlins puppet finger waggled not so prophecies were not unique to the palace of the prophets there have been prophets about elsewhere and there are prophecies elsewhere here for example there are prophecies in the wizards keep in the old world there are prophecies too i found a number of them when i excavated an ancient city that once thrived at the time of the great war among them i found one that will be richard rahls undoing it is an extraordinarily rare type of prophecy called a bound fork it enforces a double bind on its victim i have invoked the prophecy kahlan didnt have the slightest idea what he was talking about she quickly squatted and lifted caras head cara scowled up at her you idiot cara whispered under her breath im fine leave me get answers then signal and i will use my link to kill him kahlan dropped caras head and stood she started inching back toward the ladder youre talking babble jagang she moved more quickly hoping jagang would think she had found cara dead she was halfway to the ladder although she had no intention of trying to escape she intended to unleash her power on him nadine or no nadine i dont know anything about prophecy youre making no sense well darlin its like this either richard rahl lets the firestorm of what i have wrought rage out of control fulfilling one fork of the prophecy in which case it kills him too or he tries to stop what i have done fulfilling the other fork of the prophecy on that fork he is destroyed see he cant win no matter which he chooses only one of two events can now evolve only one of the two forks he has the power to choose which one but either will be his doom you are a fool richard will choose neither jagang roared with laughter oh but he will ive already invoked the prophecy through marlin once invoked there is no turning back from a bound fork prophecy but enjoy your delusions if it will please you it will make the fall all that much more painful kahlan paused in her tracks i dont believe you you will oh yes you will empty threats what proof have you proof will come on the red moon there is no such thing you are full of empty threats kahlan lifted a finger toward him as her fear dissolved in the heat of rage but i want you to know of my threat jagang and it is not empty i have seen the bodies of the women and children you ordered slaughtered in ebinissia and i swore undying vengeance on your imperial order even prophecy will not stop us from defeating you if nothing else she needed to at least provoke him into revealing the prophecy if they knew it perhaps they could thwart it that is my prophecy to you jagang unlike your pretend prophecy it has words to it his belly laugh echoed around the pit pretend let me show you the prophecy then one of martins hands lifted lightning exploded in the pit kahlan covered her ears as she ducked hunching to protect tier head stone chips howled through the air she felt a sharp pain as one sliced across her arm and another speared the side of her shoulder she felt the sickening feeling of warm blood soaking down her sleeve above their heads the lightning jumped and leaped across the wall incising the stone leaving in its wake lettering she could just see through the blinding flashes the crash of lightning cut off leaving jagged afterimages across her vision the smell of dust and smoke choking her lung and the cacophony echoing in her head there you go darlin kahlan rose to her feet squinting up at the wall gibberish thats all it is it means nothing its in high dharan according to the records in the last war we had captured a wizard a prophet and of course since he was loyal to the house of rahl my ancestor dream walkers were denied access to his mind so they tortured him in a delirious state and missing half his intestines he gave forth this prophecy have richard rahl translate it he leaned toward her with a venomous sneer though i doubt he will want to tell you what it says he pressed a kiss against nadines cheek well its been delightful my little journey but im afraid marlin must be going too bad for you that the seeker wasnt here with his sword that would have ended it for marlin cara kahlan went for him mentally beseeching the good spirits forgiveness for what she was going to have to do to nadine too cara sprang up with impossible strength jagang heaved nadine through the air the woman cried out as she tumbled violently into kahlan kahlan landed with a grunt onto her back on the stone her vision prickled with floating dots of light she couldnt feel anything she feared it might have broken her back but sensation returned with tingling pain when she twisted to the side she gasped to get her wind back as she struggled to sit up cara on the far side of the room let out a shrill piercing scream she crumpled to her knees covering her ears with her forearms as she shrieked marlin leaped onto the ladder as she and nadine wrestled to untangle themselves from each other marlin hands and feet to each side of the ladder sprang up in spurts like a cat going up a tree the torches puffed out plunging them into darkness jagang laughed as he ascended cara screamed as if she were being torn limb from limb kahlan finally managed to shove nadine aside and shuffle on her hands and knees toward the sound of jagangs mocking laughter she could feel blood soaking all the way down her sleeve the iron door exploded outward clanging against the stone on the other side of the hall the sound resonating with a boom through the halls a man cried out as it crushed him with the door gone a shaft of light bathed the ladder kahlan scrambled to her feet and went for it as she stretched up for the ladder the pain in her shoulder caused her to recoil with a cry she reached up and yanked out the sharp shard of stone the blood dammed behind it gushed from the wound fast as she could kahlan scuttled up the ladder in pursuit of marlin she had to stop him there was no one else who could do it with richard gone she was the magic against magic for all these people her wounded arm shook with the effort and she could barely grasp the ladder hurry nadine called out from right behind hell get away from below caras shrieks seared kahlans nerves kahlan had once felt the awesome agony of an agiel for a fraction of a second mordsith endured the same pain whenever they held their agiel yet not the slightest grimace ever registered on their faces mordsith lived in a world of pain years of torture had disciplined them in their ability to disregard it kahlan couldnt imagine what it would take to cause a mordsith to scream like that whatever was happening to cara it was killing her there was no doubt in kahlans mind kahlans foot slipped through a rung her shinbone whacked painfully against the rung above she yanked her leg back in a rush to get to jagang her flesh grazed the side catching and driving a long splinter into her calf she cursed in pain and charged up the ladder clambering through the opening at the top she slipped and fell to her hands and knees in a chaos of viscera sergeant collins stared up at her with dead eyes jagged white ends of rib bones stuck up holding back the ripped leather and mail of his uniform his entire torso was rent from his throat to his groin a dozen or so men writhed in agony on the floor others were still as death swords were embedded to their hilts in the stone walls axes lodged there too as if stuck in soft wood an enemy with magic had scythed through these men but not without cost close by lay an arm severed above the elbow by what it was wearing she recognized it as marlins the fingers of the hand clenched and unclenched with measured regularity kahlan pushed herself up and turned to the door she clasped wrists with nadine and helped her up into the hall careful nadine gasped at the bloody sight kahlan expected her to faint or scream hysterically she didnt men bristling swords axes pikes and bows were charging up the hall from the left the hall to the right was empty silent and dark beyond a lone torch kahlan went right to her credit nadine chased right after her the screams coming from the pit sent shivers up kahlans spine chapter beyond the last hissing torch the hall disappeared into blackness a soldier lay in a crumpled heap to the side like dirty laundry waiting to be collected his blackened sword lay in the center of the hall its blade fractured into a tangled fray of twisted steel strips kahlan paused and studied the still silence ahead just as there was nothing to be seen there was nothing to be heard marlin could be anywhere hiding around any intersection crouched in any comer with jagangs selfsatisfied smirk on his face as he lingered in the darkness to put an end to the pursuit nadine stay here no i told you we protect our own he wants to kill richard ill not let him get away with it not as long as i have a chance to help the only chance you will have is to get yourself killed im going kahlan had neither the time nor desire to argue if nadine was going to go at least she could make herself useful kahlan needed her hands free then grab that torch nadine yanked it from the bracket and waited expectantly i have to touch him kahlan told her if i touch him i can kill him who marlin or jagang kahlans heart pounded against her ribs marlin if jagang could get into his mind i expect he can get out but who knows if nothing else at least jagang will be gone and his minion will be dead that will end it for now thats what you were trying to do back in the pit what did you mean about making a choice one life for all the others kahlan grabbed her face squeezing her cheeks you listen to me this isnt just some tommy lancaster wanting to rape you this is a man who is trying to kill us all i have to stop him if anyone else is touching him when i do they will be destroyed along with him if you or anyone else is touching him i wont hesitate do you understand i cant afford to hesitate too much is at stake nadine nodded kahlan released her she redirected her anger to the task at hand she could feel blood dripping from the ends of the fingers of her left hand she didnt think she could lift her left arm and she needed her right arm to touch marlin at least nadine could hold a torch for her kahlan hoped that she wasnt making a mistake hoped that nadine wouldnt slow her she hoped she wasnt letting nadine come for the wrong reasons nadine took kahlans right hand and placed it to her bleeding left shoulder we dont have time to fix this now hold that wound closed as tight as you can until you need your hand or youll lose too much blood and not be able to do what you must a bit chagrined kahlan squeezed the wound thanks if youre going to come then stay behind me and just light the way if soldiers cant stop him you cant hope to do better i dont want you getting hurt for nothing got it right behind you just remember what i said and dont get in my way kahlan stretched up looking back behind nadine to the soldiers use arrows or spears if you get a shot but stay behind me get some more torches we need to corner him some of them trotted back to retrieve torches as kahlan started away nadine held her torch out ahead of her as she trotted to keep up the flame fluttered and roared in the wind of their flight illuminating the walls ceiling and floor for a short distance around them creating an undulating island of light in a sea of blackness close behind men with torches created their own islands of light heavy breathing echoed through the hall as they ran along with the thud of boots the jangle of chain mail the clang of steel and the roar of flame above it all in her mind kahlan could still hear caras screams kahlan halted at an intersection panting to get her breath as she looked ahead and then down the corridor that branched to the right here nadine pointed to blood on the floor he went this way kahlan looked up the dark hall ahead it led to the stairwells and up into the palace the other corridor that branched off to the right led under the palace in a labyrinth of storerooms abandoned areas once used in the excavation of the bedrock the palace was built atop access tunnels to inspect and maintain the foundation walls and drainage tunnels for the springs the builders had encountered at the ends of the drainage tunnels massive stone grates let the water out through the foundation walls but prevented anyone from getting in no kahlan said this wayto the right but the blood nadine protested he went this way weve seen no blood until this place the blood is a diversion that way leads up into the palace jagang went this way to the right where there are no people nadine followed after as kahlan started down the corridor to the right but why would he care if there are people he killed and wounded all those soldiers back there and they managed to take off an arm now marlin is wounded jagang wont care if we kill marlin but on the other hand if he can escape then he can use marlin to cause more harm what more harm could he cause than hurting people hurting all those people upstairs and the soldiers the wizards keep kahlan said jagang doesnt have command of magic other than his ability as a dream walker but he can use a person with the gift from what ive seen so far though he doesnt know much about using anothers magic the things he did back there simple use of air and heat are far from inventive for a wizard jagang only thinks to do the simplest of things with their magic things of brute force that is to our advantage if i were him i would try to get to the keep and use the magic there to cause the most destruction i could kahlan turned down an ancient stairwell carved from rock taking the steps two at a time at the bottom the rough tunnellike hall ran in two directions she turned to the soldiers still racing down the stairs behind split uphalf each way this is the lowest level when you encounter more junctures cover them all remember which way you went at each turn or you could be lost down here for days youve seen what he can do if you find him dont take a chance trying to take him post sentries so we know if he backtracks and then send runners to come get me how will we find you one asked kahlan looked to the right at every choice ill take the one to the right so you can follow where i went now hurry i think hes headed for any opening out of the palace he can find we cant let him get out if he gets to the keep he can get through shields there that i cant with nadine and half the men kahlan rushed on through the dank hall they encountered several rooms all empty and before long several more corridors at every branch she divided the men and took her continually dwindling force to the right whats the wizards keep nadine asked as they moved on through the darkness its a massive fortress a stronghold where wizards used to live it predates the confessors palace kahlan lifted a hand indicating the palace above them in ages long forgotten nearly everyone was born with the gift over the last three thousand years the gift has been dying out in the race of man whats in the keep living quarters long abandoned libraries rooms of every sort and things of magic are stored there books weapons things like that shields protect important or dangerous parts of the keep those without magic cant pass through any of the shields since i was born with magic i can pass through some of them but not all the keep is vast it makes the confessors palace look like a cramped cottage by comparison in the great war three thousand years ago the keep was filled with wizards and their families richard says it was a place filled with laughter and life at that time the wizards had both subtractive and additive magic and now they dont no only richard has been born with both sides there are places in the keep that i and the wizards i grew up with could not enter because the shields are so powerful there are other places that have not been entered in thousands of years because they are shielded with both sides of the magic no one could get past the shields but richard can i fear marlin can too sounds a dreadful place ive spent a good portion of my life there studying books of language and learning from the wizards i never though of it as anything but part of my home where are these wizards now cant they help us they all killed themselves at the end of last summer in the war with darken rahl killed themselves how awful why would they do that kahlan was silent for a moment as they moved relentlessly onward into the darkness it all seemed a dream from another life we needed to find the first wizard to have him appoint the seeker of truth to stop darken rahl zedd was the first wizard he was in westland on the other side of the boundary the boundary was linked to the underworld the world of the dead so no one was able to cross it darken rahl was also hunting zedd it took all the wizards to conjure magic to get me through the boundary to go after zedd if darken rahl had captured the wizards he might have used his vile magic to make them confess what they knew to give me the time to have a chance to succeed the wizards killed themselves darken rahl still managed to send assassins after me that was when i met richard he protected me blunt cliff nadine said in questioning amazement there were four huge men found dead at the bottom of the cliff they had leather uniforms and weapons of every sort no one had ever seen men like them before that was them what happened kahlan gave her a sidelong glance something like you and your experience with tommy lancaster richard did that richard killed these men kahlan nodded two of them i took another with my power and he killed the last those were probably the first men richard had ever encountered who wanted to do more to him than simply give him a beating when he chose to protect someone to protect me richard has had to make a lot of hard choices since that day on blunt cliff for what seemed hours but she knew couldnt be more than fifteen or twenty minutes they continued on into the dark stinking halls the stone blocks were larger some so huge that single blocks ran from floor to ceiling they were roughly cut but fit with no less precision than the other mortarless jointwork elsewhere in the palace the halls were wetter too with water running down the walls in places draining into small tiled weep holes at the edges of the floor that had a crown to direct the water to the drains some of the drains were plugged with debris allowing shallow pools to form rats used the tiled drains as tunnels they squeaked and scurried away at the approach of light and sound some taking to the drains some running on ahead kahlan thought again of cara and wondered if she was still alive it seemed too cruel that she should die before having a chance to taste life without the madness that shadowed her a series of connecting tunnels finally reduced kahlans company to nadine and two men the way was so narrow that they had to proceed singlefile the low arched ceiling forced them to trot in a crouch kahlan saw no bloodjagang probably used his control of marlins mind to cut the flowbut in several places she did see that the slime on the wall was smeared in horizontal streaks as low and narrow as the passageway was it would be difficult to avoid grazing the close walls kahlan brushed against the wall more than she wished to it hurt her shoulder when the knuckles of her hand over the wound struck the slimy stone marlinjaganghad to have been through the passageway and brushed against the same wall she felt both a rush of heady relief that she was on his tail and terror at the prospect of catching him the arched passageway narrowed again and the ceiling became even lower they had to hunch into a deep crouch to proceed the flames from the torches folded to lap at the stone close overhead and the smoke billowed along the ceiling burning their eyes as the passageway started into a steep descent they all slipped and fell more than once nadine skinned her elbow as she fell on it while maintaining a grip on the torch kahlan slowed but didnt stop as one of the soldiers helped nadine regain her feet the other three quickly caught up ahead kahlan heard the rush of water the narrow passageway opened into a large tubular tunnel water rushed in a torrent down the round tunnel that was part of the drainage system below the palace kahlan paused at the edge what now mother confessor ore of the soldiers asked stick to the plan ill go with nadine downstream to the right you two go upstream to the left but if hes trying to get out he would have gone to the right the soldier said he would hope to get out where the water does we should go with you unless he knows were after him end hes trying to send us the wrong way you two go left come on nadine in there the water must be waistdeep a little more id say its runoff from the spring melt its usually no more than a foot or two deep there are stepping stones along the other side but theyre just underwater now in the center of where this passageway opens into the drain tunnel there will be an oblong stone to step across on kahlan stretched and stepped out putting a foot into the center of the torrent and onto the flat stone just under the surface of the water she lifted her other leg across the rushing water testing until he foot found one of the stones against the far wall she clasped a hand with nadine and boosted herself across standing on the stone the water was only ankledeep but it quickly soaked through the lacing and filled her boots it was ice cold see kahlans voice echoed and she hoped it didnt carry far but be careful it isnt an unbroken walkway the stones are spaced apart kahlan moved to the next stepping stone and gave nadine a hand across she gestured to the men to go up the tunnel they crossed and moved quickly off into the darkness soon the light from the mens torches vanished around a bend and kahlan was left with nadine in the dim light of a single torch kahlan hoped it would last long enough careful now she said to nadine nadine cupped her ear it was hard to hear over the roar of the water kahlan put her mouth close and repeated the admonition she didnt want to yell and alert jagang if he was close even if the torch had been brighter they wouldnt have been able to see far the drainage tunnel twisted and turned on its way down and out of the palace underground kahlan had to put a hand to the cold slimy stone wall in order to keep her balance in several places the tunnel took a steep descent the stones along the side following it down like a stairway down through a roaring rapid icy water misted the air and soaked them to the skin even in the flatter sections running was impossible as they had to step carefully from stone to stone if they went too fast and missed a step they could break an ankle down in the tunnel in the water with jagang somewhere about would be a very bad place to be hurt the blood running afresh down kahlans arm reminded her that she was already hurt but at least she could walk that was when nadine squealed from behind and went into the water dont lose the torch kahlan screamed nadine chestdeep in the rushing water thrust the torch up in the air to keep it from being doused kahlan snatched her wrist and strained against the drag of the water as the current swept nadine past there was nothing for kahlan to grab hold of with her other hand she hooked the heels of her boots over the edge of the stepping stone to keep from being pulled off nadine thrashed with her other hand searching for one of the stepping stones she found one and grasped it with kahlans help she pulled herself back up dear spirits that water is cold i told you to be careful something a rat i think grabbed my leg she said trying to catch her breath im sure it was dead ive seen others float past now be careful nadine nodded in embarrassment i because she had been swept past kahlan nadine was now in the lead kahlan didnt see how they could change places without a struggle so she motioned nadine on nadine turned to start out suddenly a huge shape erupted from the black depths water sluiced from marlin as he bobbed up and snatched nadines ankle with his one hand she shrieked as she was yanked feetfirst into the inky water chapter on her way down nadine swung the torch and caught marlin square across the bridge of his nose he let go of her as he madly groped to wipe the burning pitch from his eyes the current swept him away kahlan gripped nadines arm still holding the torch above the water and helped her back up on the stepping stone for a second time they flattened themselves against the wall gulping air and shaking in shock well kahlan said at last at least we know which way he went nadine was shivering violently from her second dunking her hair was plastered to her head and neck i cant swim now i know why i never wanted to learn i dont like it kahlan smiled to herself the woman had more pluck than she would have thought her smile wilted when she remembered why nadine was there and who had sent her kahlan realized that in the surprise of the ambush she had missed her chance to get jagang let me go first nadine held the torch up with both hands kahlan put her arms around nadines waist as they twisted around on tiptoes to change places on the stone the woman was as cold as a fish in winter kahlan wasnt much warmer from being in the frigid tunnels with the icy water lapping around her ankles her toes were numb what if he swims upstream and escapes nadine asked her teeth chattering i dont think that likely with only on arm he was probably holding a stone keeping just his face above the surface as he lurked in the water waiting for us and what if he does it again im in front now it will be me he grabs hold of and that will be the last mistake he makes and what if he waits until you pass and pops up and grabs me again then hit him harder the next time i hit him as hard as i could kahlan smiled and gave nadine a reassuring squeeze on her arm i know you did you did the right thing you did well they inched along the wall passing several more gentle turns watching the water the whole time for marlins face peering up at them both started at things they saw in the water but it always turned out to be nothing more than pieces of flotsam the torch was sputtering more and looked to be near its end the drains all led outside and they had traveled a goodly distance in this one kahlan knew that the tunnel must end soon she realized the thought was more hope than knowledge as a girl she had explored the tunnels and drains down here though not when they had been so swollen with runoff and although she had a good idea of where she was she didnt know their exact location she remembered that some drainage tunnels seemed to go on forever as they moved along the sound of the roaring water seemed to change pitch kahlan wasnt sure what that meant ahead the tunnel bent to the right a thump that she could feel in her chest more than hear made her stop she held out a hand not only to halt nadine but to signal silence the wet stone of the walls ahead brightened glistening with a reflected bluish glow from something beyond the bend a low howl rose in pitch until they could hear it clearly over the rush of the water a boiling ball of flame exploded from around the bend raging yellow and blue flame filling the entire tunnel tumbled as it raced toward them with a wail liquid fire seething with allconsuming menace wizards fire kahlan snatched nadine by the hair hold your breath pulling nadine with her kahlan dived into the water just ahead of the angry fury of roiling flame the icy water was such a shock that she almost gasped it in under the churning water it was difficult to tell up from down kahlan opened her eyes she saw the wavering glow of the inferno overhead nadine was struggling to get to the surface kahlan jammed her left hand against the underside of a stepping stone to hold herself under and with her good arm held nadine under with her nadine in the panic of drowning fought to escape panic clawed at kahlan too when everything went black kahlan her lungs burning for air thrust her head above the water pulling nadine up with her nadine choked and coughed as she gasped long sodden strands of hair covered both their faces another tumbling ball of wizards fire raced up the tunnel get a big breath kahlan screamed she sucked a deep breath herself and went under dragging nadine down with her they went under without an instant to spare kahlan knew that given a choice nadine would have chosen to die in the fire rather than drown but the water was their only chance wizards fire burned with deadly determination with the resolve of the wizard who conjured it they couldnt keep doing this the water was so cold she was shivering uncontrollably already she knew that cold water by itself could kill a person they couldnt stay in the water it would end up killing them as sure as the wizards fire they couldnt get to jagang through marlins wizards fire if they were to reach him in time there was only one way they would have to go under the fire under the water kahlan repressed her panic at the thought of drowning made sure she had a good grip around nadines waist and then pushed away from the stepping stone she had been gripping for dear life the wet wrath of water swept them away in its frigid flux she could feel herself tumbling under the water as she scraped and bumped along the stone when her shoulder hit on something she almost screamed but the thought of losing her breath instantly locked her throat shut even tighter with frenzied need of air and blackness disorienting her she knew she had to come up she was holding nadine in a death grip with her good arm with her other hand she managed to hook a stone with nadines weight in addition to her own it felt as if the rush of water would rip her arm from its socket when her head cleared the surface there was light not twenty feet away was a stone lattice late afternoon light poured in through the openings above the water level as kahlan pulled nadines head above the water she clamped a hand over the womans mouth on one of the stepping stones to the side near the stone grate facing away stood marlin kahlan could see the broken shafts of least a half dozen arrows sticking from his back by the way marlin was staggering as he stepped to the next stone she knew he couldnt live much longer the stump of his left arm wasnt bleeding if only she could count on him dying before he reached the keep jagang was obviously driving the wounded man relentlessly onward she had no idea what jagang was capable of in controlling the mans mind to keep him alive and moving he had no concern for the life he occupied and she knew he would be willing to let marlin suffer any damage to accomplish jagangs wishes marlin lifted a hand fingers spread toward the stone grate kahlan had grown up around wizards marlin was conjuring air a section of the lattice grate exploded outward in a cloud of dust and stone fragments more light poured in through the blasted opening the suddenly wider spillway let the water flood out with yet greater force kahlans injured arm had no strength an i the mounting might of the discharge tore her away from the stone step she lost her grip on nadine in the powerful clutch of the water kahlan grasped frantically for a handhold but found none she twisted and tumbled under the water trying with her arms and legs to grapple something she hadnt had a chance to get a good breath and she struggled too to fight her terror at her exigent need for air her fingers caught the sharp stone at the edge of the blasted hole the water sucked her under and jammed her hard against the lower part of the grate she could only force her head and part of one shoulder above the surface it seemed she was breathing more water than air kahlan looked up jagangs wicked smile greeted her he was only a few feet away the force of the water ramming against her crushed her tight to the broken grate she didnt have the muscle to overcome the pounding weight of the water try as she might she couldnt get to him it was all she could do to get a breath she glanced over her shoulder what she saw took the breath for which she had fought so hard they were on the east side of the palacethe high side of the foundation the water roared out of the drainage gateway to plunge for a good fifty feet before crashing to the rocks below jagang chuckled well well darlin how nice of you to drop by to witness my escape where are you going jagang she managed i thought id go up to the keep kahlan gasped for air and caught a mouthful of water instead she coughed and choked it out why do you want to go to the keep whats there that you want darlin youre deluding yourself if you think i would reveal anything i dont want you to know what did you do to cara he smiled but didnt answer he lifted marlins hand a blast of air shattered more of the grate to the side the stone she was holding gave way her back scraped over the broken edge kahlan snatched for a solid piece and just caught it with her fingers before she was ejected from the drain when she looked down she was looking at the rocks below the foundation water thundered above her she worked her fingers over the sharp stone struggling desperately to pull herself back behind what was left of the grate panic powering her effort she regained the inside of the stone lattice but she couldnt get away from it the water kept her pinned problem darlin kahlan wanted to scream at him but she could only gasp for air as she fought to keep from being swept through the opening her arms burned with the effort she could think of nothing to do to stop him she thought of richard jagang lifted marlins hand again spreading his fingers nadine popped up from the water right behind him with one hand she held a stone step in her other she still gripped the dead torch looking as if she was at the ragged edge of madness she took a mighty swing clubbing him across the back of his knees marlins legs folded under him and he toppled into the water right in front of kahlan he caught himself on the broker grate with his one hand when he saw what waited outside he frantically tried to push himself back apparently he hadnt anticipated that there might be no way down from the drain tunnel nadine clutched a stepping stone and held on for dear life kahlan reached behind with her injured arm stuffed her left hand through a grate opening under the water and made a fist to lodge it fast with her other hand she seized marlin by the throat well well she said through gritted teeth look what i have here the great and allpowerful emperor jagang he grinned showing broken teeth actually darlin he said in jagangs grating impudent voice you have marlin she pulled herself close to his face think so do you know that a confessors magic works faster than thought thats why once were touching someone they have no chance none the magic bond of my loyalty to richard rahl denies a dream walker access to my mind marlins mind is our field of battle now do you suppose that my magic might work faster than yours what do you think do you think i can take you along with marlin two minds at once he said with a smirk i dont think so darlin well see maybe ill get you too maybe well end the war and the imperial order right here and now oh darlin you are a fool man is destined to free his world from the shackles of magic even if you could kill me here and now which you cant you will not end the order it will survive any one man even me because it is the struggle of all mankind to inherit our world do you really expect me to believe that you dont do this for yourself for naked power not at all i relish rule but i simply ride a horse already in full charge it will run you down you are a fool who follows the dying religion of magic a fool who has you by the throatthe great jagang who professes to want man to triumph over magic yet uses magic for now but when magic dies i will be the one with the daring and the muscle to rulewithout magic fury erupted through kahlan this was the man who had ordered the deaths of thousands of innocent people this was the butcher of ebinissia this was the man who would enslave the world this was the man who wanted to kill richard in the silence of her mind in the core of her power where there was no cold no exhaustion no fear she had all the time in the world though he made no attempt to escape even if he had it would have been hopeless he was hers kahlan did as she had done countless times beforeshe released her restraint for an imperceptible twitch of time something was different there was resistance where there had been none before a wall like hot steel through glass her power crashed through it the magic exploded through marlins mind thunder without sound stone chips fell from the ceiling at the concussion water droplets danced despite the waters rush a ring of ripples raced outward around the two of them driving a wall of mist and dust nadine clinging to the stepping stone cried out in the pain of being so close to a confessors power unleashed marlins mouth went slack once a persons mind had been destroyed by a confessor they became a vessel needing her command marlin offered no such abdication blood streamed from his ears and nose his head lolled to the side in the rushing torrent his dead eyes started kahlan released her grip of his throat when his hand went slack on the grate and the water tore him away marlins body tumbled out through the broken stone lattice and plummeted to the rocks below kahlan knew she had almost had jagang but she failed his thoughts his ability as a dream walker had been too fast for her confessors magic to catch nadine was reaching toward her grab my hand i cant hold on forever kahlan locked wrists with her using her power drained a confessor of strength after using her magic it took even kahlan the mother confessor and perhaps the strongest confessor ever born several hours before she could use her power again but longer than that to fully recover her strength she was exhausted and couldnt fight the torrent any longer without nadines hold on her she would have gone over the edge too with nadines help kahlan managed to regain the stepping stones shivering with the cold they both dragged themselves up nadine wept at the crest of terror that had passed and had almost taken them kahlan was too exhausted to weep but she knew how nadine felt i wasnt touching him when you used magic but i thought every one of my joints had popped apart it didnt do anything to me did it anything magic am i going to die too no youre fine kahlan assured her you simply felt the pain because you were too close thats all if you had been touching him though it would have been inconceivably worseyou would have been destroyed nadine nodded in mute reply kahlan put an arm around her and whispered a thank you in her ear nadine smiled the tears away we have to get back to cara kahlan said we have to hurry how the torch is gone theres no way down the outside and as soon as we try to go back it will be pitch black i dont want to go back there in the dark its impossible until the soldiers come with torches to light our way nothing is impossible kahlan said wearily we took every turn to the right so we have only to put a hand on the left wall and follow it to find our way back nadine threw her hand out pointing back into the blackness that may be all fine and good in the halls but when we came into this drainage tunnel we crossed over to the other side there arent steps on that side well never find the opening the water rushing over the step stone in the center of the tunnel had a different sound didnt you notice ill remember it kahlan took nadines hand to give her encouragement we have to try cara needs help nadine stared in wordless worry for a moment and then said all right but wait a moment she tore a strip from the shredded hem of kahlans dress and wound it around kahlans upper arm closing the wound as best she could kahlan winced when nadine drew the knot tight lets go nadine said but be careful until i can sew it closed and put a poultice on it chapter they made excruciatingly slow process back up the drainage tunnel the blind trek groping along the cold slimy stone with the water coursing about their ankles and the constant fear of falling into the raging water in the darkness was at least devoid of the terror that marlin might pop up grab their legs and pull them in when kahlan heard the sound of the water change and its echo into the hall she held nadines hand and probed with a foot until she found the step stone across the channel partway back through the dark labynnth of tunnels and halls the soldiers found them and led the way with torches in a numb haze kahlan followed the wavering flames of the torches as they plunged ever onward into the black nothingness it was an effort to put one foot in front of the other kahlan wished for nothing more than to lie down even if it were on the cold wet stone outside the pit the halls were crowded with hundreds of grim soldiers archers all had arrows nocked spears were at the ready as were swords and axes other weapons from the fight with marlin were still embedded in the stone she doubted that anything short of magic would remove them the dead and wounded had been cleared away but blood boasted where they had lain screams were no longer coming from the pit kahlan recognized captain harris who had been up in petitioners hall earlier in the day has anyone gone down there to help her captain no mother confessor he didnt even have the decency to look sheepish about it dharans feared magic and felt no loss of pride admitting it lord rahl was the magic against magic they were the steel against steel it was as simple as that kahlan couldnt bring herself to reprimand the men in the hall for leaving cara alone they had shown their bravery in the fight with marlin many of them had been killed or seriously injured going down into the pit was different from fighting something that came out defending their selves was different in their minds from going out and looking for trouble with magic for their part of the bargain the steel against steel dharan soldiers fought to the death they expected their lord rahl to do his part and his part was dealing with magic kahlan read the apprehension in all the waiting eyes the assassin the man who escaped the pit is dead its over soft sighs of relief could be heard up and down the hall but by the anxious expression still on the captains face she knew she must look quite a mess i think we should get you some help mother confessor later kahlan started for the ladder nadine followed how long has she been silent captain maybe an hour that was about when marlin died come with us and bring a couple more men so we can get cara out of there cara was on the far side of the room near the wall where kahlan had seen her last kahlan knelt on one side nadine or the other as the soldiers held torches so they could see cara was in convulsions of some sort her eyes were closed and she was no longer screaming but she shook violently her arms and legs thrashing against the stone floor she was choking on her own vomit kahlan gripped the shoulder of caras red leather and yanked her onto her side open her mouth nadine leaned over from behind and pushed her thumb against the back of caras jaw forcing it forward with her other hand she pressed down on her chin keeping her mouth open kahlan swept two fingers through caras mouth several times until she had cleared her airway breathe kahlan yelled breathe cara breathe nadine slapped the prone woman on the back eliciting gurgling wet choking coughs that finally brought a semblance of clear if gasping breathing although she was able to breathe it didnt halt the convulsions kahlan felt helpless i better go get my things nadine said whats wrong with her i dont really know a paroxysm of some sort im no expert but i think we need to stop it i might be able to help i might have something in my bag you two go show her the way leave a torch nadine and the two soldiers raced up the ladder after one of them shoved a torch in a bracket on the wall mother confessor captain harris said just a little while ago a raugmoss showed up in petitioners hall a what a raugmoss from dhara i dont know much about dhara who are they theyre a secret sect i dont know much about them myself the raugmoss keep to themselves and are rarely seen get to the point whats he doing here this one is the raugmoss high priest himself the raugmoss are healers he says he sensed that a new lord rahl had become master of dhara and he came to offer his services to his new master a healer well dont just stand therego get him maybe he can help hurry captain harris clapped a fist to his hear before racing up the ladder kahlan pulled caras shoulders and head into her lap and held her tight trying to calm her convulsions kahlan didnt know what else to do she knew a lot about hurting people but little about healing them she was so sick of hurting people she wished she knew more about helping people like nadine hold on cara she whispered as she rocked the shaking woman help is coming hold on kahlans eyes were drawn to the top of the opposite wall the words incised in the stone stared back she knew nearly every language in the midlands all confessors did but she knew nothing about high dharan high dharan was a dead language few people knew the ancient tongue richard was learning high dharan he and berdine worked together translating the journal they had found in the keep kolos journal they called itwhich had been written in high dharan in the great war three thousand years before richard would be able to translate the prophecy on the wall she wished he couldnt she didnt want to know what it said prophecy was never anything but trouble she didnt want to believe that jagang had unleashed some unknown festering plague of torment on them but she couldnt find a good reason to doubt his word she pressed her cheek to the top of caras head and closed her eyes she didnt want to see the prophecy she wanted it gone kahlan felt tears running down her face she didnt want cara to die she didnt know why she should feel so much for his woman except perhaps because no one else did the soldiers wouldnt even come down to see why she had stopped screaming she could have choked to death on her own vomit something as simple as that not magic could have killed her because they were afraid or perhaps because no one cared if she died hold on cara i care she smoothed the mordsiths hair back from her clammy forehead i care we want you to live kahlan squeezed the quaking women as if trying to squeeze her words her concern into her it occurred to her that cara wasnt so different from herself cara was trained to hurt people when it all came down to it kahlan was much the same she used her power to destroy a persons mind she knew that she was doing it to save others but it was still hurting people mordsith hurt people but to them it was to help their master to preserve his life and that in turn was to save the lives of the dharan people dear spirits was she no more than this mordsith she was trying to bring back from madness kahlan could feel the agiel hanging around her neck pressing against her chest as she held cara was she a sister of the agiel in more ways than one if nadine had been killed in the beginning would she have cared nadine helped people she didnt make a life of hurting them no wonder richard had been attracted to her she wiped her cheek as the tears ran more freely her shoulder throbbed she hurt all over she wanted richard to hold her she knew he was going to be angry but she needed him so badly at that moment it was hurting her shoulder to hold the trembling woman in her lap but she refused to let go hold on cara youre not alone im with you i wont leave you i promise is she any better nadine asked as she scurried down the ladder no shes still unconscious and sharing like before as she knelt nadine let her bag drop to the floor beside kahlan things inside banged together with muffled sounds i told those men to wait up there we dont want to move her until we can bring her out of it and theyll just be in the way nadine started pulling things out of her bag little folded cloth packages leather pouches with markings scratched on them and stoppered horn containers likewise scratched with symbols she briefly inspected the markings before setting each item aside blue cohosh she mumbled to herself as she squinted at the cryptic marks on one of the leather pouches no i dont think it would do and shed have to drink cups of it she took out several more leather pouches before pausing at another pearly everlasting might work but wed have to get her to smoke it somehow she sighed irritably that wont do she considered a horn mugwort she muttered as she set it aside feverfew she put that horn in the damp sling of her dress in her lap yes betony might be of some good too she said as she considered another she added the horn lo her lap kahlan picked up one of the horns nadine had set aside and pulled its cork the pungent smell of anise made her pull back she pushed the cork back in and set it down she picked up another two circles were deeply scratched into the patina of the horn a horizontal line ran through both circles kahlan wiggled the carefully carved wooden stopper trying to pull it free nadine slapped the horn out of kahlans hands dont kahlan looked up in surprise sorry i didnt mean to snoop in your things i was no its not that she picked up the horn with the two circles struck through with a line and held it up this is powdered canin pepper if you arent careful when you open it you could get it on your hands or worse in your face its a powerful substance that will immobilize a person for a time if you had opened it carelessly you would have been on the floor blind and gasping for air convinced you were about to die i thought about using it on cara to stop her shaking by paralyzing her but i decided it best not to it immobilizes a person partly by interfering with their breathing it feels like its burning your eyes out of your head it blinds you your nose feels on fire youre sure your heart is going to burst and you cant get your breath youre helpless trying to wash it off only makes it worse because the powder is oily and just spreads it doesnt cause any real harm and youd recover completely in a short time but until then youre disabled and totally helpless i dont think immobilizing cara in that fashion would be good since shes already having trouble breathing in her state it might make her worse instead of helping her do you know what to do to help her you do know what to do dont you kahlan asked trying not to sound critical nadines hand paused on the edge of her bag well i i think i do its not so common a problem that im sure but ive heard of it my father has mentioned it in passing kahlan wasnt reassured nadine found a small bottle in her bag and held it up in the torchlight she pulled the cork and turned the bottle upside down on a finger hold her head up what is it kahlan asked as she turned cara over she watched nadine rub the substance on caras temples oil of lavender it helps with headaches i think she has more than a simple headache i know but until i find something else it might help ease the pain and that might help calm her i dont think i have any one thing that by itself will do it ill need to try to add things together the problem is that with the convulsions we cant get her to drink decoctions or teas motherwort and linden help calm people but we cant get her to drink a whole cup of it in water black horehound would help stop the vomiting but shed have to drink five cups a day i dont see how we can get her to drink the first until we stop the convulsions maybe we could get her to swallow some feverfew but there is one thing im hoping nadines long damp hair hung around her face as she pawed through her bag she came up with another small brown bottle yes i did bring it what is it tincture of maypop its a strong sedative and also a painkiller ive heard my pa say that it settles people who are in a state of nervous shakes i think he may have meant shakes like convulsions since its a tincture we can put some on the back of her tongue shell swallow it that way cara shuddered violently in kahlans arms kahlan embraced her tighter until she settled a bit she didnt know if she liked the idea of having to rely on nadines i think but kahlan had no better solution something had to be done nadine was working her thumbnail at the wax seal on the little brown bottle of tincture of maypop when the shaft of light coming from the doorway above darkened nadines hands stilled a motionless silhouetted figure filled the doorway seeming to consider them at length with nary a flutter of his long cloak he wheeled and started down the ladder in the silence but for the hissing torch kahlan absently stroked a protective hand over caras brow as she watched the man in a hooded cloak descend the ladder chapter nadine paused at her work on the wax seal who hes some kind of healer kahlan whispered as she watched the mans methodical descent from dhara i was told he came to offer his services to richard i think hes an important person nadine grunted dismissively whats he going to do without any herbs or things she leaned closer while watching him he doesnt seem to have anything with him kahlan shushed her stone dust crunched under his boots as he turned the sound echoing in the hush of the pit he approached in measured strides the torch was on the wall behind him so kahlan couldnt see his features in the deeply cowled hood of the voluminous coarse flaxen cloak that hung to the floor he was as tall as richard with shoulders just as wide mordsith he observed in a voice hat was smooth and authoritative some thing like richards too he brought a hand out of his cloak and gestured kahlan complied laying cara on her back on the stone floor with the way he seemed to study caras shivering kahlan didnt want to interrupt for introductions she just wanted someone to help cara what happened to her he asked from the shadow of the cowl in a voice just as deep and dark she had control of a man who he had the gift she was linked with him yes kahlan said thats what she called it he made a sound in his throat as if mentally assimilating the information it turned out that the man was possessed by a dream walker and whats a dream walker a person as i understand it who can invade another persons mind by slipping into the spaces between their thoughts he gains control of them in this way he was covertly possessing this man that she linked with he considered a moment i see go on we came down here to question the man to torture him kahlan pulled an irritated breath no i told cara that we were simply going to question him to get answers if we could the man was an assassin sent to kill lord rahl and if he didnt answer the questions then cara was prepared to do what she must to get those answersto protect lord rahl but it never got that far we discovered that this dream walker had control of him control of his gift the dream walker used the mans gift to write a prophecy in the stone behind you the healer didnt turn to look then what then he was going to escape and start killing people cara tried to stop him with her link yes she let out a scream like ive never heard before and fell to the ground holding her ears kahlan inclined her head nadine here and i went after the man when he tried to escape fortunately he was killed when we got back we found cara on the floor in convulsions you shouldnt have left her alone she could have choked to death on her own vomit kahlan pressed her lips together and remained silent the man just stood there watching cara shudder finally kahlan could bear it no longer this is one of lord rahls personal guards shes important do you intend to help her or you just going to stand there quiet he commanded in a distracted tone one must observe before one acts or more harm than help can be the result kahlan glowered at the shadowed form at last he sank to his knees and sat back on his heels he lifted caras wrist in one of his big hands working a finger between her glove and sleeve he flicked his other hand out over the items on the floor whats all this theyre my things nadine said her chin rose im a healer still holding caras wrist the man picked up a leather pouch with his other hand looking at its markings he set it down and then scooped the two horns from nadines lap feverfew he said as he tossed it back in nadines lap he looked at the symbols on the other betony he tossed it back in her lap with the first youre not a healer he said you re an herb woman how dare you did you give her any of your medicines besides the oil of lavender how did ive not had time to give her anything else good he proclaimed the oil of lavender wont help her but at least it wont harm her well of course i know its not going to stop the convulsions it was just to help ease some of her pain i was going to give her tincture of maypop for that were you now fortunate that i arrived in time then nadine folded her arms across her breasts whys that because tincture of maypop would likely have killed her nadine scowled as she unfolded her arms and planted fists on her hips maypop is a powerful sedative it would likely have halted her convulsions if you hadnt interfered id have her recovered by now is that so did you feel her pulse no nadine paused warily why what difference could that possibly make her pulse is weak staggering and labored this woman is struggling with all her strength to keep her heart beating had you given her your maypop it would have done as you said sedated her her heart would have stopped i i cant see how even a simple herb woman should know to use more caution when dealing with magic magic nadine wilted im from westland ive never seen magic before i didnt know magic had any effect on healing herbs im sorry he ignored the apology and pointed undo the buttons and open the top of her outfit why nadine asked do it or do you favor watching her die she cant hold on much longer nadine leaned forward and began undoing the row of little red leather buttons along the side of caras ribs when she finished he gestured for her to open it nadine glanced up at kahlan kahlan gave her a nod and she pulled back the supple leather exposing caras chest may i ask your name kahlan asked him drefan instead of asking hers he put an ear to the center of caras chest listening he shifted around forcing kahlan to scoot out of the way until he was at caras head he briefly inspected the bloody wound above her left ear and then seeming to dismiss it as unimportant went on to systematically probe the base of her neck kahlan could only see the side of his deep cowl and nothing of his face the single torch didnt provide much light anyway drefan leaned forward and gripped caras breasts in his big hands kahlan sat up straighter what do you think youre doing examining her is that what you call it he sat back on his heels feel her breasts why to see what i discovered kahlan finally turned from the shadow of his cowl and rather than grabbing her as he had put the back of her fingers against the side of caras left breast it was hotburning with a fever she felt the other it was ice cold when drefan gestured nadine followed suit what does it mean she asked id like to reserve judgment until ive finished examining her but its not good he put his fingers to the side of her neck feeling her pulse again he ran his thumbs outward along her forehead he tent and put his ear to each of hers he smelled her breath he carefully lifted her head and rotated it he spread her arms out to the sides pulled the red leather outfit open further so that caras torso was naked to her waist and then bent over her and palpated her abdomen and up under her ribs with his head bent as if in concentration he touched his fingers to the front of her shoulders for a moment the sides of her neck the base of her skull her temples several places on her ribs and lastly to the palms of her hands kahlan was getting impatient she was seeing a lot of probing and prodding but very little healing well her aura is seriously snarled he said as he brazenly thrust a big hand under the red leather at caras waist kahlan watched in stunned disbelief as his hand slid down to her crotch she could see his fingers under the tight leather as he worked them into her sex hard as she could kahlan fisted him on the nerve at the side of his upper arm he recoiled in pain he fell to the side of his hip with a groan covering his arm where she had clouted him i told you this is an important woman how dare you grope her like that i wont have it do you understand i wasnt groping her he growled the heat was still in kahlans voice then what do you call it i was trying to determine what this dream walker has done to her hes greatly disturbed her auras her energy flows confusing her minds control of her body shes not in convulsions precisely shes having uncontrolled muscular contractions i was checking to make sure that he hadnt triggered the part of her brain that controls excitement i was making sure that he hadnt put her in a state of continual orgasm i have to know the extent of the blocks and triggers hes disturbed so that i know how to reverse it nadine eyes widening leaned forward magic can do such a thing make a person have continual he nodded as he flexed his sore arm if the practitioner knows what hes doing can you do such a thing she breathed no i dont have the gift or any other form of magic but i know how to heal if the damage isnt too great the cowl turned toward kahlan now do you wish me to continue or do you want to watch her die continue but if you put your hand down there again you are going to be a onehanded healer ive already learned what i needed to know nadine leaned in again is she no he flicked his hand irritably pull off her boots nadine shuffled around and did as he had ordered he turned a bit toward kahlan as if peering at her from the depths of his cowl did you know to hit that particular nerve in my arm with deliberate knowledge or did you simply get lucky kahlan studied the shadow trying to see his eyes she couldnt i was trained to do such things to defend myself and others im impressed with such understanding of nerves you could learn to heal instead of hurt he turned his attention to nadine depress the third anterior axis of the dorsin meridian nadine made a face what he waggled his hand pointing between the tendon at the back of her ankles and the prominent bone sticking out to the sides squeeze there with a thumb and one finger both ankles nadine did as she was told while drefan pressed behind caras ears with his little fingers and at the same time on the tops of her shoulders with his thumbs harder woman he put both palms one hand atop the other on caras sternum second meridian he murmured what move down half an inch and do it again both ankles he moved his fingers on caras skull concentrating on what he was doing all right first meridian another half inch down nadine asked yes yes hurry he held caras elbows between a thumb and finger as he lifted them a few inches finally he sat back on his heels with a sigh this is astounding he muttered to himself this is not good what is it kahlan asked are you saying that you cant help her he waved dismissively as if too distracted to answer answer me kahlan insisted if i wish you to bother me woman i will ask nadine leaned forward cocking her head do you have any idea who youre talking to she pointed with her chin indicating kahlan he was feeling caras earlobes by the looks of her id say some mucker on the cleaning staff one in need of a bath ive just had a bath kahlan said under her breath nadines voice lowered with import youd better show some respect mister healer shes the one who owns this palace the whole thing shes the mother confessor herself he ran a finger down the inside of caras upper arms is that so well good for her now be quiet the both of you shes also the betrothed of lord richard rahl himself drefans hands froze his whole body stiffened and since lord richard rahl is the master of dhara and youre from dhara nadine went on i reckon that makes him the boss of you if i were you id be showing a lot more respect for lord richard rahls future wife he doesnt like it when people dont show respect for women ive seen him knock out peoples teeth for being disrespectful drefan hadnt moved a muscle kahlan thought nadine had put it very crudely but she doubted it could have been any more effective not only that nadine added but shes the one who killed the assassin with magic drefan finally cleared his throat forgive me mistress mother confessor kahlan corrected i most humbly beg your forgiveness mother confessor i had no idea i had no intention to cause kahlan cut him off i understand you were more concerned with healing cara here than with formalities so am i can you help her i can please get on with it then he immediately turned back to cara kahlan frowned as she watched his hands gliding in patterns over the supine woman keeping just above her flesh his hands paused occasionally fingers trembling with effort at an invisible task from caras feet nadine folded her arms again you call this healing my herbs would have had a better effect than this piffle and a lot sooner too he looked up piffle is that what you think this is just some nonsense do you have the slightest idea young lady what were dealing with a paroxysm it must be ended not prayed over he rose up on his knees i am the raugmoss high priest i am not given to praying for my healings nadine snorted derisively he nodded as if deciding something you wish to see what were dialing with you want proof your simple herb woman eyes can understand nadine scowled in view of the lack of results a little proof would be a fine dish he pointed i saw a horn of mugwort give it here i presume you have a taper in that bag bring it too after you light it as nadine took the candle to the torch to light it drefan opened his cloak and took several items from a pouch nadine handed him the lit candle he dripped hot wax on the floor to the side and stuck the taper in it drefan reached under his cloak arid pulled out a long thinbladed knife he leaned over and pressed it between caras breasts a ruby drop grew under the point he set the knife aside and leaned over her with a longhandled spoon he skimmed the blood from her flesh he sat back unstopped the horn nadine had given him and dumped some mugwort atop the blood in the spoon you call this mugwort youre only supposed to collect the fluffy underside of the leaf youve got the whole leaf mixed in with it it doesnt matter its all mugwort a very low grade this way you ought to know to use a highgrade mugwort what sort of herb woman are you anyway nadine squinted in indignation it works just fine are you trying to find an excuse to get out of showing us that you know what youre doing are you trying to blame your failure on the grade of mugwort the grade is more than good enough for my purpose but not for yours his tone turned instructional if not polite next time purify the sample you collect and you will find it to be of more help to those who need it he hunched over holding the spoor to the point of the candle flame until the mugwort ignited giving off a copious amount of smoke and a heavy musky odor drefan circled the smoking spoon over caras stomach letting the layer of smoke build he handed the spoon of smoking mugwort to nadine hold this between her feet he put his fingers to his temples as he murmured a chant under his breath he took his hands from his head now watch and you will see what i can see what i can feel without the smoke he put his thumbs to caras temples and his little fingers to the sides of her throat the thick layer of mugwort smoke jumped kahlan gasped as she saw ropy lines of smoke coiling and snaking all over cara drefan removed his hands and the smoke trails snapped into a still web of lines some arched from her sternum to her breasts her shoulders her hips and her thighs a tangle of lines went from the top half of her head to points all over her body drefan traced one with a finger see this one from her left temple to her left leg watch he pressed his fingers to the base of her skull on the left side and the line of smoke crossed to her right leg there thats where it belongs what is all that kahlan asked in astonishment her meridian lines the flow of her force her life her aura its more than that too but its hard to put it all into a few words for you what i have done is nothing more than the way a shaft of sunlight shows you the dust motes floating in the air nadine her mouth hanging open sat frozen holding the smoking spoon how did you make the line move by using my life force to compel a healing energy shift where it was needed then you have magic nadine breathed no training squeeze her ankles where you did the first time nadine set the spoon down and squeezed caras ankles the tangle of lines going down caras legs twisted and untangled moving from her hips to her feet in straight lines there drefan said you have just corrected her legs see how theyve stilled i did that nadine asked incredulously yes but that was the easy part see here he indicated the web of lines coming from her head this is the dangerous part of what this dream walker did it has to be undone these lines indicate that she cant control her muscles she cant speak and shes been blinded look here this line going from her ears outward and then back to her forehead thats the only one thats correct she can hear and understand everything we say she just cant react to it kahlans jaw dropped she can hear us every word rest assured she knows were trying to help her now if you please i need to concentrate this all has to be done in the correct order or well lose her kahlan whisked her hands toward him of course do what you need to do to help her drefan hunched to his task working his way around caras body pressing fingers or the flats of his hands to various places on her at times he used the knife point he never drew more than a drop of blood is he pressed it into her flesh at nearly each thing he did some of the ropy lines of smoke moved untangling some laying down against caras body and others curving outward in a smooth arch before returning to a spot he had attended when he compressed the flesh between her thumb and first finger not only did the smoke lines over her arms straighten but cara moaned in relief as she twisted her head and rolled her shoulders it was the first normal response of any kind cara had given when he pierced the tops of her ankles with his knife she gasped and began to breathe with a steady if rapid rhythm relief and hope flooded through kahlan he at last had moved all the way around her and was working at her head pressing his thumbs along the bridge of her nose and across her forehead her whole body was still no longer shaking and quivering her chest rose and fell without effort he pressed the knife point between her eyebrows that should take care of it he murmured to himself caras blue eyes opened they searched about until they found kahlan i heard your words she whispered thank you my sister kahlan smiled her relief she knew what cara meant cara had after all heard kahlan tell her that she wasnt alone i got marlin cara smiled you make me proud to serve with you i regret that you have gone to all this effort healing me for nothing kahlan frowned not knowing what she meant cara rolled her head back looking up at drefan as he hunched over her how do you feel he asked is everything feeling normal now her brow drew together with a look of foggy confusion bordering on alarm lord rahl she asked incredulously no im drefan with both hands he laid back his cowl kahlans eyes went wide along with nadines but my father too was darken rahl i am lord rahls half brother kahlan stared in wonder same size same muscular build as richard blond hair like darken rahls although shorter and not so straight richards hair was darker and coarser drefans eyes piercing blue like darken rahls rather than gray like richards nonetheless bore the same cutting raptor rake his features possessed that impossibly handsome perfection of a statue that darken rahls had richard hadnt inherited that cruel perfection drefans looks somewhere in the middle leaned more toward darken rahl than richard but while no one would mistake drefan for richard they would have no trouble telling that they were brothers she wondered why cara had made that mistake then she saw the agiel in caras fist that wasnt what cara had meant by lord rahl in a confused state looking at him upside down as she regained consciousness she hadnt thought he was richard she had thought he was darken rail chapter the only sound in the otherwise dead silence was the click click click of richards thumbnail on one of the points of the recurved cross guard on his sword the elbow of his other arm rested on the polished tabletop while he cradled his head between a thumb under his chin and his first finger along his temple with a calm face he did his best to control his anger he was furious this time they had crossed the line and they knew it in his mind he had gone over a whole list of possible punishments but had rejected them all not because they were too harsh but because he knew they wouldnt work in the end he settled on the truth there was nothing harsher than the truth and nothing else as likely to get through to them before him in a row stood berdine raina ulic and egan they stood stiffly their eyes focused at some point over his head and behind him as he sat at the table in the small room he used for meeting with people reading and various other work to the side of the table hung small landscape paintings of idyllic country scenes but from the window behind from which streamed the low angled rays of morning sunlight the massive baleful stone face of the wizards keep glared down on him he had been back in aydindril for only an hourlong enough to discover what had happened after he had left the evening before all four of his guards had been back since before dawn he had ordered them to return to aydindril after raina and egan had sauntered into camp the night before they had thought he wouldnt make them return in the dead of night they had been wrong as brazen as they ordinarily were the look in his eyes had insured that none of the four dared disobey that order richard had also returned much earlier than he had planned he had pointed out the quench oak to the soldiers told them what to collect and then instead of overseeing the task had started back alone for aydindril before the sun was up after what he had seen in the night hed been too troubled to get any sleep and had wanted to be back in aydindril as soon as possible drumming his finger on the tabletop richard watched his guards sweating berdine and raina wore their brown leather outfits their long braided hair disheveled from their hard ride the two great blondheaded men ulic and egan wore uniforms of dark leather straps plates and belts the thick leather plates were molded to fit like a second skin over the conspicuous contours of their muscles incised in the leather at the center of their chests was an ornate letter r for the house of rahl and beneath that two crossed swords around their arms just above their elbows they wore golden bands brandishing razorsharp projectionsweapons for close combat no dharan but the lord rahls persona bodyguards wore such weapons they were more than simply weapons they were the rarest the highest badges of honor earned he knew not how richard had inherited the rule of a people he didnt know with customs that were mostly a mystery to him and expectations he only partly fathomed since they had returned these four too had discovered what had happened with marlin the night before they knew why they had been summoned but he hadnt said anything to them yet he was trying to get a grip on his rage first lord rahl yes raina are you angry with us for disobeying your orders and coming out to you with the mother confessors message the message had been a pretense and they knew it as well as he click click click went his thumbnail that will be all you may go all of you their postures relaxed but none made a move to leave leave raina asked arent you going to punish us a smirk spread on her face maybe clean out the stables for a week or something richard pushed back from the table as he ground his teeth he was not in the mood for their impish humor he rose behind the table no raina no punishment you may go the two mordsith smiled berdine loaned toward raina speaking in a whisper but loud enough for him to hear he realizes that we know best how to protect him they all started for the door before you go richard said as he strolled around the table i just want you to know one thing whats that berdine asked richard walked past them pausing long enough to look each in the eye that im disappointed in you raina made a face youre disappointed in us youre not going to yell or punish us youre simply disappointed thats right youve disappointed me i thought i could trust you i cant richard turned away dismissed berdine cleared her throat lord rahl ulic and i went with you by your command oh so if it had been you id left here to protect kahlan instead of raina you would have done as i asked and stayed she didnt answer ive counted on all of you and youve made me feel a fool for trusting you he flexed his fists instead of yelling i would have seen to kahlans protection if id known i couldnt trust you richard leaned an arm against the window frame and stared out at the cold spring morning the four behind him shifted their feet uneasily lord rahl berdine said at last we would lay down our lives for you richard rounded on them and let kahlan die he carefully quieted his tone you can lay down your lives for me all you want play your games all you want pretend youre doing something important play at being my guards just stay out of my way and out of the way of people helping me in this effort to stop the imperial order he flicked his hand toward the door dismissed berdine and raina shared a look we will be outside in the hall if you need us lord rahl richard gave them such a cold look that it drained the color from their faces i wont be needing you i dont need people i cant trust berdine swallowed but but what she swallowed again what about kolos journal dont you want me to help you with the translation ill manage anything else each of them shook their heads they began filing out raina at the end of the line paused and turned back her dark eyes fixed on the floor lord rahl will you be taking us out later to feed the chipmunks im busy theyll manage just fine without us but what about reggie who reggie hes the one missing the end of his little tail he he sat in my hand hell be looking for us richard watched her for a silencefilled eternity he teetered between wanting to hug her and wanting to yell at her he had tried the hugging or its equivalent anyway and it had nearly gotten kahlan killed maybe another day dismissed she wiped the back of her hand across her nose yes lord rahl raina quietly pulled the door closed behind her richard raked back his hair as he flopped down in his chair again with a finger he slowly spun kolos journal around and around as he ground his teeth kahlan could have died while he was off looking for trees kahlan could have died while the people he thought were protecting her were instead following their own agenda he shuddered to think what the added magic the added rage of the sword would do were he to draw it at that moment he couldnt recall being this angry without the sword of truth in his hand he couldnt imagine the wrath of the swords magic on top of this the words of the prophecy from the stone wall in the pit ran through his mind with haunting mocking finality a soft knock silenced the hundredth whispered sound of the prophecy in his head this was the knock he had been waiting for he knew who it was come in cara the tall muscular blondhaired mordsith slunk in through the door she pushed it closed with her back her head was bent and she looked as miserable as he had ever seen her may i speak with you lord rahl why are you wearing your red leather she swallowed before answering its a mordsith thing lord rahl he didnt ask for an explanation he didnt really care this was the one he had been waiting for this was the one who was at the core of his wrath i see what do you want cara approached the table and stood with her shoulders slumped she had a bandage around her head but he had been told that her head wound wasnt serious by the redrimmed look of her eyes it was obvious that she hadnt slept the night before how is the mother confessor this morning when i left her she was resting but shes going to be fine her wounds werent serious as serious as they easily could have been shes lucky to be alive considering what happened considering that she wasnt supposed to have been down there with marlin in the first place considering that i specifically told you that i didnt want either of you down there caras eyes closed lord rahl it was my fault entirely im the one who talked her into it i wanted to question marlin she tried to convince me to stay away but i went anyway she only went to try to make me leave him be as you had instructed had richard not been so angry he might have laughed even if kahlan hadnt admitted the truth to him he knew her well enough to recognize caras confession as pure fiction but he also knew that cara hadnt put in much of an effort to keep kahlan away from the assassin i thought that i had control of him i made a mistake richard leaned forward didnt i specifically tell you that i didnt want either of you down there her shoulders trembled as she nodded without looking up his fist hitting the table made her flinch answer me didnt i specifically tell you that i didnt want either of you down there yes lord rahl was there any doubt in your mind what i meant no lord rahl richard leaned back in his chair that was the mistake cara do you understand not that you didnt have control of him that was beyond your power going down there was a choice you made that was the mistake you made i love kahlan more than anything in this world or anything in any other world nothing else is so precious to me i trusted you to protect her to keep her out of harms view the sunlight coming through the patterned shears played across her red leather in dappled patches like sunlight coming through leaves lord rahl she said in a small voice i fully understand the dimensions of my failure and what it means lord rahl may i be granted a request what is it she sank to her knees bending forward in supplication she took up her agiel holding it in both trembling fists may i choose the manner of my execution what a mordsith wears her red leather at her execution if she has previously served with honor she is allowed to choose the manner of execution and what would you choose my agiel lord rahl i know how i have failed youi have committed an unforgivable transgressionbut i have served with honor in the past please allow it to be with my agiel its my only request either berdine or raina can carry it out they know how richard walked around the table he leaned back against its edge looking down at caras slumped quivering form he folded his arms denied her shoulders shuddered with a sob may i ask what lord rahl will choose cara look at me he said in a soft voice her tearstained face came up cara im angry but no matter how angry i was i would never ever have you any of you executed you must i have failed you i have disobeyed your orders to protect your love i have made an unforgivable mistake richard smiled i dont know that there are unforgivable mistakes there may be unforgivable betrayals but not mistakes if we were going to start executing people for mistakes im afraid id have been dead long ago i make mistakes all the time some of them have been pretty big she shook her head as she gazed into his eyes a mordsith knows when she has earned execution i have earned it in those blue eyes he saw the iron of her resolution either you carry it out or i will richard stood for a time judging the demand of duty to which a mordsith was bound judging the madness in those eyes do you wish to die cara no lord rahl since you have been our lord rahl never that is why i must i have failed you a mordsith lives and dies by a code of duty to her master neither you nor i can alter what must be my life is forfeit you must carry out the execution or i will richard knew that she wasnt making a play for sympathy mordsith didnt bluff if he didnt somehow change her mind she would do as she promised with comprehension and the resulting sickening realization of his only choice he made the mental leap off the rim of sanity and into the madness where dwelt part of this womans mind and he feared part of his as irretrievable as a heartbeat the decision had been made muscles flexing with the call he drew his sword it sent the soft matchless ring of steel through the room through his bones with that seemingly simple act the wrath of the swords magic was loosed the lock on the door to death was slipped free it took his breath like a wall of an acid wind storms of rage lifted on that biting wind magic then he told her will be your judge and executioner her eyes squeezed shut look at me the swords rage twisted through him trying to carry him away with it he fought to maintain his grip of control as he always had to do when he held the fury unleashed you will look into my eyes when i kill you her eyes opened her brow wrinkled together tears streaming down her cheeks any good she had done any bravery in the face of danger any sacrifice to her duty had been stripped away in the face of her disgrace she had been denied the honor of a death by her agiel for that and that alone she cried richard pressed the razorsharp edge to his forearm drawing for the blade its taste of blood he brought the sword of truth to his forehead touching the cold steel the warm blood to his flesh he whispered his invocation blade be true this day this was the person who for her presumption and but for luck would have cost him kahlan cost him everything she watched as the blade rose above him she saw the fury the righteous rage in his eyes she saw the magic dancing there she saw death dancing there the knuckles of both fists were white as he gripped the hilt he knew he couldnt deny the magic its willif he was to have a chance he loosed his wrath at this woman for abandoning her responsibility to protect kahlan her arrogance could have ended kahlans life ended his future ended his reason for living he had entrusted his dearest love to her care and she had failed in her duty to honor his faith he could have returned to find kahlan dead because of this woman on her knees before him for no other reason their eyes shared the madness of what they were doing of what they each had become of knowing that there was no other wayfor either of them he committed to cleave her in two the swords wrath demanded it he would accept no less he envisioned it he would have it her blood with a scream of rage with all his strength with all his fury and anger he swung the blade down toward her face the swords tip whistled in every detail he could see the light glint off the polished blade as it swept through a streamer of sunlight he could see drops of his sweat sparkle in the sunlight as if frozen in space he could have counted them he could see where the blade would hit her she could see where the blade was going to hit her his muscles screamed with the effort as his lungs screamed with rage between her eyes an inch from her flesh the blade stopped as solidly as if it had thunked into an impenetrable wall sweat rolled down his face his arms shook the room echoed with the lingering sound of his cry of fury at last he withdrew the blade from over cara she stared up with big round unblinking eyes she was panting in rapid short breaths through her mouth a long low whine came from her throat there will be no execution richard said in a hoarse voice how she whispered how could it do that how could it stop like that im sorry cara but the swords magic has made the choice it has chosen that you live you will have to abide by its decision her eyes finally turned to look into his you were going to do it you were going to execute me he slid the sword slowly into its scabbard yes then why am i not dead because the magic decided otherwise we cant question its judgment we must abide by it richard had been reasonably sure that the swords magic wouldnt harm cara the magic wouldnt let him harm one who was an ally he had been counting on that but there had been doubt cara had brought kahlan within dangers grasp though not intentionally he wasnt entirely sun that doubt wouldnt cause the blade to take her that was the way with the sword of truths magicone wasnt always entirely sure zedd had told richard when he had given him the sword that therein lay the danger the sword destroyed an enemy and spared a friend but the swords magic worked as a result of the view of its holder not the truth zedd had told him that doubt could possibly cause the death of a friend or allow the escape of a foe but he did know that if it was to work he had to commit his entire being to the effort otherwise cara wouldnt believe the magic had spared her and she would have credited it to him then she would have been obligated to do as she had promised his insides felt as if they were twisted into knots his knees trembled he had been sucked into a world of dread he hadnt been positive that it would work as he had planned worse he wasnt entirely sure he hadnt made a mistake by sparing her richard cupped caras chin the sword of truth has made its choice it chose for you to live for you to have another chance you must accept its decision cara nodded in his hand yes lord rahl he reached under her arm and helped her to her feet he could hardly stand himself and wondered if he had been in her place if he would be able to get to his feet as steadily as she i will do better in the future lord rahl richard pulled her head to his shoulder and held her tight for a moment something he had been aching to do her arms slipped around him in grateful surrender thats all i ask cara as she headed for the door richard called her name she turned back you still must be punished her eyes turned down yes lord rahl tomorrow afternoon you will have to learn to feed chipmunks her gaze came back up lord rahl do you wish to feed chipmunks no lord rahl then thats your punishment bring berdine and raina they too are due some punishment richard closed the door after her leaned against it and shut his eyes the inferno of the swords rage had consumed his anger he was left empty and weak he shook so badly he could hardly stand he was almost sick at the vivid memory of looking into her eyes as he brought the sword down with all his strength expecting that he was going to kill her he had been prepared for the spray of blood and bone caras blood and bone a person he cared about he had done what he had to to save her life but at what cost the prophecy reeled through his head and the nausea took him to his knees in a flash of cold sweat and dread chapter the soldiers he had stationed in the halls around the mother confessors rooms stepped aside each clapping a fist to the chain mail over his heart as richard went by he absently returned the salute as he swept past them his gold cape billowing out behind the soldiers crossed their pikes before the three mordsith and two big bodyguards trailing him at a distance when he had previously stationed the soldiers he had given them a very short list of who was to be allowed through their positions his five guards werent on the list he glanced back to see agiel come up into fists he met caras eyes the three mordsith reluctantly released their weapons his five guards backed away from the challenge and set up their own guard post beyond the soldiers with a hand signal from cara raina and ulic swiftly disappeared back down the hall no doubt she had sent them to find another way around to guard the opposite end of the hall when he rounded the next to last corner before kahlans room he saw nadine sitting on a giltlegged chair to the side of the hall she was swinging her legs like a bored child waiting to go outside and play when she saw him coming she bounded up out of the chair she looked scrubbed and fresh her thick hair glistened his brow twitched her dress looked tighter than it had the day before it seemed to fit closer to her ribs and hips showing her alluring shape more than he remembered he knew it was the same dress he thought he must be imagining things seeing her figure displayed to such advantage reminded him that there had been a time she schooled her enthusiasm twisting a strand of hair with a finger as she affected a smile her delight at seeing him faltered as he approached she took a step back toward the wall as he stopped before her nadines gaze left his eyes richard good morning i thought i heard someone say you were back already i wasshe gestured toward kahlans room for an excuse to look awayi came to see how kahlan was doing this morning i well i need to put on a new poultice i was just waiting until i was sure she was up and kahlan told me how you helped her thanks nadine i appreciate it more than you could know she shrugged one shoulder were hartlanders you and i in the thick silence she twisted a thread between her fingers tommy and skinny rita wellington got married richard watched the top of her bowed head as she played with the thread i guess that was to be expected that was what their parents wanted nadine didnt look up from her thread he beats the stuffing out of her i had to give her poultices and herbs one time when he made her bleed you know down there people say its none of their business and pretend not to know its happening richard wasnt sure what she was getting at he certainly wasnt going back to hartland to rattle a conscience into tom lancasters head well if he keeps at it her brothers might end up giving him a lesson in cracked skulls nadine didnt look up that could have been me she cleared her throat i could have been married to tommy crying to anyone whod listen about how well it could have been me it could have been me pregnant wondering if hed beat me till i lost this one too i reckon i owe you richard and you being a boy from hartland and all i just wanted to help if you were in trouble she shrugged her one shoulder again kahlans real nice most women would have i guess shes about the prettiest woman i ever saw nothing like me i never figured you owed me anything nadine id have done the same no matter who tom had caught alone that day but you have my sincere gratitude for helping kahlan sure i guess that was stupid of me to think you stopped him because richard realized by the way she sounded on the verge of tears that he hadnt put it very well so he laid a hand tenderly on her shoulder nadine youve grown into a beautiful woman too she peered up with a growing smile you think im beautiful she smoothed her blue dress at her hips i didnt dance with you at the midsummer festival because you were still clumsy little nadine brighton she started winding the string again i liked dancing with you you know i carved the initials nc on my betrothal trunk for nadine cypher im sorry nadine michael is dead she looked up with a frown michael no thats not what it meant it meant you richard decided that this conversation had gone far enough he had more important things to worry about im richard rahl now i cant live in the past my future is with kahlan nadine caught his arm as he started turning away im sorry i know that i know i made a big mistake with michael i mean richard caught himself just in time to bite off a caustic retort what would be the purpose i appreciate that you helped kahlan i suppose youll want to be heading home tell everyone im well ill be back for a visit when kahlan invited me to stay a while richard was caught off guard kahlan had neglected to tell him that part of it oh and you wish to stay for a day or two sure i thought id like that ive never been away from home before if its all right with you i mean i wouldnt wan to richard gently pulled his arm from her hand fine if she invited you then its fine with me she brightened as if oblivious to the disapproval on his face richard did you see the moon last night everyone is abuzz about it did you see it was it as extraordinary as remarkable as they say that and more he whispered his mood darkening before she could get in another word he marched off his soft knock on the door produced a rotund woman in a staff uniform her ruddy face peered out through the narrow crack lord rahl nancy is just helping the mother confessor get dressed shell be finished in a minute dressed he called to the closing door the latch clicked into place shes supposed to be in bed he called through the heavy ornately carved door getting no response he decided to wait rather than cause a scene once when he looked up he saw nadine peeking around the corner her head swiftly disappeared back around the corner he paced before the door until the rubicund woman finally opened it wide and held an arm out in invitation richard stepped into the room feeling as if he was entering another world the confessors palace was a place of splendor power and history but the mother confessors quarters were the place that more than anywhere else in the palace reminded him that he was really just a woods guide it made him feel out of his element the mother confessors rooms were a majestic quiet sanctuary befitting the woman to whom knelt kings and queens if richard had seen this room before he came to know kahlan he wondered if he would have ever had the nerve to speak to her even now it embarrassed him to recall teaching her to build snares and dig roots when he didnt know who or what she was it made him smile though to remember her eagerness to learn he was thankful he had come to know the woman before he came to understand the post she filled and the magic she wielded he thanked the good spirits she had come into his life and prayed she would be a part of it forever she meant everything to him the three marble fireplaces in the mother confessors sitting room were ablaze the heavy drapes on the tenfoottall windows hung open slightly forming tall slits letting in only enough light muted by the sheer panels behind to make lamps unnecessary he guessed that bright sunlight was inappropriate in a sanctuary there were only a few houses in hartland that wouldnt fit in this room alone on a glossy goldembellished mahogany table to the side sat a silver tray with tea soup biscuits sliced pears and brown bread none of it had been touched the sight reminded him that he hadnt eaten since noon the day before but failed to summon his appetite the three women in crisp gray dresses with white lace collars and cuffs watched him expectantly as if waiting to see if he would dare to simply walk in on the mother confessor or fall into a show of some other scandalous behavior richard glanced at the door at the far end of the room his sense of propriety making him ask the obvious is she dressed the one who had cracked the door before reddened i wouldnt have let you in sir had she not been of course he headed soundlessly across the plush darkhued carpets he stopped and turned back they watched like three owls thank you ladies that will be all they bowed and reluctantly took their leave he realized as the last one stole a quick glance over her shoulder while pulling the door closed that they probably considered it the height of indecency for a man engaged to a woman to be alone with her in her bedroom doubly so for the mother confessor richard forced out an annoyed breath whenever he was anywhere near the mother confessors rooms some member of the staff always managed to show up every other minute checking to see if she needed anything the variety of things they suspected she might be needing never failed to surprise him he sometimes expected one of them to come right out and ask her if she might need her virtue protected outside her rooms the staff was friendly even joking with him when he put them at ease or helped them carry things a few were afraid of him but not in her rooms in her rooms they all turned into bold protective mother hawks inside the bedroom against the far paneled wall stood the huge bed its four great dark polished posts rising up like columns before a palace the thick embroidered bedcover cascaded down the sides of the bed like a colorful waterfall frozen in place a slash of sunlight cut across the dark sumptuous carpets and over the lower half of the bed richard remembered kahlan describing her bed to him telling him how she couldnt wait to have him in it when they were married he very much wanted to be in bed with her it had been since that night between worlds that he had been alone with herin that waybut he had to admit that he was intimidated by that bed of hers he thought he might lose her in it she had promised there would be no chance of that kahlan was standing at the row of glassed doors before the expansive balcony looking out past the open curtain she was staring out over the stone railings and up toward the keep on the mountainside the sight of her in her satiny white dress flowing smoothly over her ravishing curves with her dazzling mane cascading down her back nearly took his breath the sight of her made him ache he decided that the bed would be just fine when he tenderly touched her shoulder she started she turned a beaming smile on her face as she looked up at him i thought you were nancy come back in what do you mean you thought i was nancy you didnt know it was me how would i know it was you he shrugged because i always can tell when its you whos walked into a room i dont have to see you her brow furrowed in disbelief you cannot of course i can how you have a unique fragrance i know the sounds you make the sound of your breathing the way you move the way you pause theyre all unique to you her frown grew youre not kidding you mean it youre serious of course cant you tell me by those things no but i guess youve spent much of your life in the woods watching smelling listening she slipped her good arm around his i still dont know if i believe you then test me some time richard stroked his fingers down her hair how are you feeling hows your arm im all right its not so bad not as bad as that time elder toffalar cut me remember that was worse than this he nodded what are you doing out of bed you were told to rest she pushed at his stomach stop im fine she looked him up and down and you look more than fine i cant believe you had that made for me you look magnificent lord rahl richard tenderly met her lips she tried to pull him into a more passionate kiss but he pulled back im afraid ill hurt you he said richard im fine really i was exhausted before because i used my power along with all the rest of it people mistook that for me being hurt worse than i was he appraised her for a long moment before bending to the kind of kiss he had been longing to give her thats better she breathed on parting she pushed back richard did you see cara you left so quickly and you had that look in your eye i didnt have time to really talk to you it wasnt her fault i know you told me you didnt yell at her did you we had a talk she squinted talk what did she have to say for herself she didnt try to tell you that she was whats nadine still doing here she was looking at him she snatched his wrist richard you have blood on you your arm she looked up in alarm what did you do richard you didnt hurt her did you she lifted his arm higher into the light richard this looks like like when you she seized his shirt you didnt hurt her tell me that you didnt hurt her she wanted to be executed she gave me the choice of doing it or she would so i used the sword like that time with the mud people elders shes all right shes all right isnt she shes all right kahlan concern in her expression looked into his eyes and you are you all right ive been better kahlan what is nadine still doing here shes just staying for a visit thats all have you met drefan yet richard held her away when she moved to lay her head to his chest what is she doing here why did you invite her to stay richard i had to trouble from shota isnt so easily dismissed you ought to know that we have to know whats going on before we can do something to make sure shota cant cause us trouble richard went to the glassed door and stared out at the mountain towering over the city the wizards keep stared back i dont like it not one bit neither do i she said from behind him richard she helped me i didnt think she would have the guts to keep her head but she did shes confused by all this too something more than were seeing is going on and we have to use our heads not hide under the blankets he heaved a sigh i still dont like it but you have a point i only marry smart women he could hear kahlan absently smooth her dress behind him the fragrance of her calmed him i can see why you liked her shes a lovely woman besides being a healer it must have hurt you the keep seemed to absorb the morning sunlight in its dark stone he should go up there what must have hurt me when you caught her kissing michael she told me how you caught her kissing your brother richard wheeled around staring in slackjawed disbelief she told you what kahlan gestured back toward the door as if nadine might appear to speak for herself she said that you caught her kissing your brother kissing him thats what she said richard turned his glare back to the window did she now what was she doing then you mean you caught kahlan we have sixteen men who died down by the pit last night and a dozen more who may not live the day ive got guards i cant trust to protect the woman i love weve got a witch woman who has made it her lifes mission to cause us trouble weve got jagang sending us messages in walking dead men weve got a sister of the dark loose somewhere weve got half the army in aydindril sick and unable to fight if they have to weve got representatives waiting to see us ive got a half brother i never knew i had downstairs under guard i think we have more important things to discuss than nadines than nadines difficulty with the truth kahlans green eyes watched him tenderly for a moment that bad now i understand what put that look in your eyes remember what you told me one time never let a beautiful woman pick your path for you when theres a man in her line of sight she put a hand over his shoulder nadine isnt picking my path i asked her to stay for my own reasons nadine sticks to what she wants like a hound on scent but im not talking about nadine im talking about shota shes pointing down a path and youre walking right down it we have to find out whats down that path and shotas reasons for pointing to it richard turned back to the glassed door i want to know what else marlin jaganghad to say every word i want you to try to remember every word why dont you just yell at me and get it over with i dont want to yell at you you scared me to death going down there i just want to hold you to protect you i want to marry you he turned back and looked into her green eyes i think i have a way for it to work with the mud people i mean she stepped closer really how first you tell me everything jagang said richard idly watched the keep as she went through the whole story how jagang said he watched the jala game and that in his native tongue the name meant the game of life that he wanted to witness the glory of what marlin had done how he wanted sister amelia to return to him before he revealed himself that he had found prophecies other than those richard had destroyed and that he had invoked one called a bound fork prophecy thats all i remember she said why are you watching the keep so intently im wondering why sister amelia went there and what marlin was going to do there any ideas no jagang wouldnt say richard have you seen the prophecy in the pit his stomach roiled yes and what does it say i dont know ill have to translate it richard rahl you may be able to tell its me who has walked into a room without seeing me but i can tell when youre not telling me the truth without even having to look into your eyes richard couldnt manage to smile prophecies are more complicated than their words you know that just hearing their words doesnt mean its what it sounds like besides just because jagang found a prophecy that doesnt mean he can invoke it well thats all true enough i told him as much myself he said that proof he had invoked the prophecy would come on a red moon not much chance of that richard spun around what did you say you didnt tell me that before what did jagang say her face paled i forgot until you said i told jagang that i didnt believe himabout invoking the prophecy he said that proof would come on the red moon richard do you know what that means richards tongue felt thick he made himself blink the moon was red last night ive been outdoors my whole life ive never seen anything even remotely like it it was like looking at the moon through a glass of red wine it gave me goose bumps that was why i came back early richard what did the prophecy say tell me he stared at her trying to think of a lie he could make her believe he couldnt it said he whispered on the red moon will come the firestorm the one bonded to the blade will watch as his people die if he does nothing then he and all those he loves will die in its heat for no blade forged of steel or conjured of sorcery can touch this foe silence rang through the still room kahlans face was white whats the rest of it jagang said it was a bound fork prophecy whats the rest of ither voice brokethe other fork you tell me richard dont you lie to me were in this together if you love me then you tell me dear spirits let her hear the words and not my dread let me at least spare her that his left hand clutched the hilt of his sword the raised letters of the word truth bit into his flesh he blinked his vision clear show no fear to quench the inferno he must seek the remedy in the wind lightning will find him on that path for the one in white his true beloved will betray him in her blood chapter kahlan could feel tears falling down her cheeks richard she sucked back a sob richard you know i would never you dont believe i could ever i swear on my life i would never you have to believe me he swept her into his arms as she lost control over a wail of anguish richard she sobbed against his chest i would never betray you not for anything in this world not to spare myself eternal torment in the underworld at the keepers hands i know of course i know that you know as well as i that you cant understand a prophecy by its words dont let it hurt you thats what jagang wants he doesnt even know what it means he just put it down there because the words sounded like what he wanted to hear but i she couldnt halt her weeping shhhh his big hand held her head against him the terror of the night before and the worse terror of the prophecy came out in uncontrollable tears she had never cried in the face of battle but in the safety of his arms she couldnt control herself she was swept away by a flood of tears no less powerful than the torrent in the drainage tunnel kahlan dont let yourself believe it please dont but it says i will listen to me didnt i tell you not to go down there to question marlin didnt i tell you that i would do it when i got back and that it was dangerous and i didnt want you down there yes but i was afraid for you and i just wanted you went against my wishes no matter your reasons you went against my wishes didnt you she nodded against him that could be the betrayal in the prophecy you were wounded you were bleeding you betrayed me and you had blood on you your blood i wouldnt call what i did a betrayal i was doing it for you because i love you and i was afraid for you but dont you see the words of prophecy dont always work the way they sound at the palace of the prophets in the old world both warren and nathan warned me that prophecies arent meant to be understood by the words the words are only obliquely connected to the prophecy but i dont see how im just saying that it could be something as simple as that you cant let a prophecy gain control of your fears dont let it zedd told me that too he said that there were prophecies about me that he wouldnt tell me because the words werent to be trusted he said you were right to ignore the words of prophecy but this is different richard this says i will betray you i already told you how it could be something simple lightning isnt simple being struck by lightning is a symbol for being killed if not an outright declaration of the manner of your death the prophecy says i will betray you and because of that you will die i dont believe it kahlan i love you i know it isnt possible you wouldnt betray me and bring me harm you wouldnt kahlan clutched his shirt as she gasped a sob thats why shota sent nadine she wants you to marry someone else because she knows i will be the death of you shota is trying to save youfrom me she thought that once before and she turned out to be wrong remember if shota had had her way we wouldnt have been able to stop darken rahl he would rule us all right now if we had given in to her reading of the future prophecy is no different richard gripped her shoulders and held her at arms length so that he could look into her eyes do you love me his grip on her wounded shoulder made it sing with pain but she refused to pull away from his touch more than life itself then trust in me i wont let it destroy us i promise it will all fall into place for the best in the end youll see we cant think of the solution if were focused on the problem she wiped at her eyes he sounded so sure of himself his confidence calmed her and bolstered her spirits youre right im sorry do you want to marry me of course but i dont see how we can leave our responsibility for such a long time to travel the sliph she blinked what the sliph up in the wizards keep ive been thinking about it we traveled all the way to the old world and back in her with her magic and it took less than a day each way i can wake the sliph and we can travel in her but she would take us to the old world to the city of tanimura jagang is somewhere near tanimura thats still a lot closer to the mud people than aydindril is besides i think the sliph can go other places too she asked me where i wished to travel that means she can go other places maybe she can get us a lot closer than tanimura kahlan her tears forgotten at the prospect of their wedding being possible glanced up at the keep we might be able to go to the mud people be married and be back in a matter of a few days we could be gone that long surely richard smiled as his arms circled her from behind surely kahlan wiped the last of the tears away as she turned in his arms how do you always manage to figure things out he nodded toward her bed i had a great deal of motivation kahlan a grin spreading on her face was just about to reward him with something positively indecent when there was a knock at the door it immediately opened without benefit of an answer nancy stuck her head in are you all right mother confessor she glanced meaningfully to richard yes what is it lady nadine is asking if she could change the poultice is she now kahlan said in a dark tone yes mother confessor but if you are indisposed i could ask her to wait until send her in then richard said nancy hesitated we will have to take the top of your dress down mother confessor to get at the bandage its all right richard whispered in kahlans ear i have to go talk to berdine i have some work for her i hope it doesnt involve horse manure richard smiled no i want her to work on kolos journal why he kissed the top of her head knowledge is a weapon i intend to be formidably armed he glanced to nancy need me to help with her dress nancy managed to scowl and turn red at the same time i guess that means you will manage at the door he turned back to kahlan ill wait until nadines finished with you and then we better go see this drefan fellow i have a task for him id like you to be with me when he had closed the door nancy brushed back her short brown hair and moved around behind kahlan to help with her dress your mother confessors dress the one you were wearing yesterday was ruined beyond repair i expected as much confessors had a collection of dresses all the same confessors all wore black dresses only the mother confessor wore white she thought about the blue wedding dress she would wear nancy do you remember when your husband was courting you nancy paused yes mother confessor then you must know how it would have made you feel if someone were to keep popping in on you when you were alone with him nancy eased the dress over kahlans shoulder mother confessor i was never allowed to be alone with him until we were married i was young and ignorant my parents were right to watch over me and the impulses of youth nancy im a grown woman im the mother confessor i cant have you and the other women popping your heads into my room whenever richard is with me ow sorry that was my fault it isnt proper mother confessor thats for me to decide if you say so mother confessor kahlan held her arm out as nancy slipped the sleeve over her hand i say so nancy glanced to the bed you were conceived in that bed who knows how many mother confessors before you conceived their daughters in that bed it holds a legacy of tradition only wedded mother confessors took their men to that bed to conceive a child and not one of them because of love i was not conceived through love nancy my child if i have one will be all the more reason that it should be by the grace of the good spiritsin the sanctity of marriage kahlan didnt say that the good spirits had taken them to a place between worlds to sanctify their union the good spirits know whats in our hearts there is no one else for either of us nor will there ever be nancy busied herself at the bandage and you are eager to get to it like my daughter and her young man are if nancy only knew how eager thats not it im just saying that i dont want you coming in on me when richard is here with me we will be wedded soon we are irreversibly committed to one another there is more to being in love than just jumping into bed you know like just being close in one anothers arms can you understand i cant very well kiss my future husband and have my injuries comforted by him if you keep popping your head in every two minutes now can i no mother confessor nadine knocked at the open door may i come in yes of course here set your bag on the bed i can manage now nancy thank you with a deprecating shake of her head nancy shut the door behind herself nadine sat on the bed next to kahlan and worked at finishing unwrapping the bandage kahlan frowned at nadines dress nadine that dress it is the same one yon were wearing yesterday isnt it sure it seems nadine looked down at herself the ladies washed it for me but its oh i know what youre talking about it was torn in the tunnels when we went for a swim some of the fabric at the seams was mined so i had to take it in to save it i havent had much of an appetite since i left home thinking about i mean what with my travels i was busy and ive slimmed down a bit so i was able to take in the seams and save the dress its not too tight its fine in view of your aid i will see to it that you get another dress that would be more comfortable no this ones fine i see well your cut looks no worse this morning thats encouraging she carefully wiped at the old poultice i saw richard on the way out he looked upset you two havent had a fight i hope kahlans forbearance evaporated no he was upset because of something else nadine paused at her work she turned to her bag and brought back a horn the fragrance of pine pitch filled the air when she opened it kahlan winced as nadine dabbed on the poultice when she was satisfied she began winding the bandage back around kahlans arm theres no need to be embarrassed nadine said in a casual tone lovers sometimes have spats they dont always end a relationship im sure richard will come to his senses eventually actually kahlan said i told him that i understood about you and him about what happened that was why he was so upset nadines wrapping slowed what do you mean i told him what you said about letting him catch you kissing his brother the little shove you gave him remember nadine brought the tails of the bandage around her fingers suddenly working swiftly at tying them oh that yes that nadine avoided looking up she slipped the sleeve of the dress over kahlans hand as soon as she had pulled the dress up over kahlans shoulder she dropped the horn back in her bag that should do it i should replace the poultice later today kahlan watched as nadine hefted her bag and scurried for the door kahlan called her name nadine reluctantly paused and turned partway back seems you lied to me richard told me what really happened nadines freckles vanished in a crimson glow kahlan stood and gestured toward a tufted velvet chair care to set things right to tell me your side of it nadine stood woodenly for a moment then sank into the chair she folded her hands in her lap and stared down at them i told you i had to give him a shove you call that a shove nadine turned even redder well she flicked a hand i knew how boys lost their heads over over their lust i figured that was my best chance of getting him to to lay claim to me kahlan was confused but she didnt let it show seems it would have been a little late for that well not necessarily i was bound to end up with one of them when i let richard catch me like that naked atop michael having a good time of it michael was game for me that was for sure kahlans brow rose how did you figure that i had it worked out richard would come in behind me hed see me on michaels lance crying out with the pleasure of it and hed be taken with lust by the sight and by my willingness then hed lose his head his inhibition and at last hed have to have me too kahlan stared dumbly how was that going to get you richard nadine cleared her throat well it was like this i figured that richard would enjoy having me id make sure of that then id tell him no the next time he wanted me and hed want me so much after hed had a sampling that hed claim me if michael wanted to claim me too then its my choice and id choose richard if richard didnt claim me and i got pregnant then id say it was his and hed marry me because it could be his if i didnt get pregnant and he wouldnt claim me well then there was still michael i figured second best was better than none kahlan didnt know what had happened richard hadnt said she feared nadine would stop her story right there kahlan couldnt very well admit she didnt know what happened next and worse she feared to hear just how successful nadines bizarre plan had been in the first version the kissing version richard had turned away but kahlan now knew that version wasnt true she watched the vein in the side of the nadines neck throb kahlan folded her arms and waited at last nadine collected her voice and continued well that was my plan anyway it seemed to make sense i figured id get richard out of it at best and michael at worst it didnt work the way i thought richard walked in and froze i smiled over my shoulder i invited him to come join the fun or else to come to me later and id see to him too kahlan held her breath that was the first time i saw that look in richards eyes he didnt say a word he just turned and walked out nadine stuck a hand in under the hair hanging around her face and wiped it across her nose as she sniffled i thought id at least have michael he laughed at me when i told him hed claimed me he just laughed he never wanted to be with me again after that hed gotten what he wanted i was no use to him after that he moved on to other girls but if you were willing to dear spirits why didnt you simply seduce richard because i was worried he might expect that and have his resistance built up for it i wasnt the only girl he danced with i was afraid he wouldnt want to commit and that if i simply tried to seduce him he might be ready for that and turn me down id heard a rumor that bess pratter tried that it didnt seem to have worked for her i was afraid it wouldnt be enough of a shove i figured that jealousy would be the thing that pushed him off the fence i figured my plan would take him by such surprise that hed just lose his head with jealousy and lust and then id have him ive heard tell theres nothing more powerful in a man than jealousy and lust with both hands nadine pushed her hair back on her head i cant believe richard told you i didnt think he would ever tell anyone he didnt kahlan whispered richard only stared at me when i told him that you said he caught you kissing his brother he didnt tell me the story you just did that all by yourself nadines face sank into her hands you may have grown up with richard but you didnt know him dear spirits you didnt know the first thing about him it might have worked you dont know as much as you think richard is just a boy from hartland who never had anything and has had his head turned by fine things and people doing his bidding thats why it might have workedbecause he just wants what he sees i was just trying to make him see what i have to offer kahlans head throbbed she pinched the bridge of her nose as she shut her eyes nadine as the good spirits are my witness you have got to be just about the stupidest woman i have ever met nadine sprang up from the chair you think im so stupid you love him you want him she jabbed her finger at her own chest you know how it feels in here to want him i wanted him no less than you if you had to you would do the same thing right now as well as you know him youd do the same if you thought it was your only chance your only chance tell me you wouldnt nadine kahlan said in a calm voice you dont know the first thing about love love isnt about taking what you want its about wanting happiness for the one you love nadine leaned in with a venomous expression youd do the same as i did if you had to the words of the prophecy whisperer through kahlans head lightning will find him on that path for the one in white his true beloved will betray him youre wrong nadine i wouldnt not for anything in this world would i chance hurting richard not for anything i would live a life of lonely misery before i would hurt him i would even let you have him before i would hurt him chapter a breathless beaming berdine lurched to a halt as kahlan watched nadine storm off down the hall mother confessor lord rahl wants me to stay up all night and do work for him isnt that wonderful kahlans brow twitched if you say so berdine grinning berdine ran on down the hall in the direction nadine had gone richard was talking to a knot of soldiers just up the hall in the other direction beyond the soldiers a ways further up the hall cara and egan stood watching when richard saw kahlan he left the guards and came to meet her when he was close enough she twisted a fistful of his shirt and pulled him close answer me one thing richard rahl she hissed through gritted teeth whats that richard asked in innocent bewilderment why did you ever dance with that whore kahlan ive never heard you use such language richard glanced down the hall in the direction nadine had gone how did you get her to tell you i tricked her into it richard smiled a sly smile you told her that i told you the story didnt you his smile widened when she nodded ive been a bad influence on you he said richard im sorry i asked her to stay i didnt know if i ever get my hands on shota im going to strangle her forgive me for asking nadine to stay nothing to forgive my emotions just got in the way of seeing that you were right to ask her to stay richard are you sure shota and the prophecy both mentioned the wind nadine plays some part in this she has to stay for now id better have her guarded so she doesnt leave we dont need guards nadine wont leave how can you be so sure vultures dont give up they circle as long as they think there are bones to pick kahlan looked back down the empty hall she actually had the nerve to tell me that i would do what she had done if i had to i feel a bit sorry for nadine she has a lot of good in her too but i doubt she will ever truly experience love kahlan felt the heat of him at her back how could michael do that to you how could you ever have forgiven him he was my brother richard whispered i would have forgiven anything he did against me someday i will stand before the good spirits i didnt want to give them a reason to say i was no better it was what he did to others that i couldnt forgive she put a comforting hand to his arm i guess i see why you want me to go with you to meet drefan the spirits tested you with michael i think you will find drefan a better brother he may be a bit arrogant but hes a healer besides it would be hard to find two that wicked nadine is a healer too not compared to drefan his talent borders on magic do you think he wields magic i dont think so but i have no way of telling i will know if he does have magic i will know guards at their post near the mother confessors room saluted after richard gave them instructions kahlan walked close at his side as they moved on down the hall cara stood up straighter when richard paused before her even egan perked up expectantly kahlan thought cara looked tired and miserable cara richard finally said im going to see this healer who helped you i hear hes another bastard son of darken rahl like me why dont you come along i wouldnt mind having a friend with me caras brow wrinkled together in near tears if you wish lord rahl i wish you too egan egan i told the soldiers that you all are permitted to pass go get raina and ulic and bring them along too right behind you lord rahl egan said with a rare smile where did you ask drefan to wait kahlan asked i told the guards to take him to a guest room in the southeast wing the opposite end of the palace why all the way over there richard gave her an unreadable look because i wanted him to remain here under guard and thats as far from your rooms as i could get him cara was still wearing her red leather she hadnt had time to change the soldiers guarding the southeast wing of the confessors palace saluted with fists to hearts and moved aside for richard kahlan ulic egan and raina in her brown leather but they backed away an extra step for cara no dharan wanted the attention of a mordsith in red leather after the brisk march across the palace they all came to a halt before a simple door flanked by leather and muscles and steel richard absently lifted his sword and let it drop back checking that it was clear in its scabbard i think hes more afraid than you kahlan whispered up to him hes a healer he said he came to help you he showed up to help on the same day as nadine and marlin i dont believe in coincidence kahlan recognized the look in his eyes he was bleeding a lethal flux of magic from his sword without even touching it every inch of him every ripple of hard muscle every fluid movement bespoke the calm coiling death without knocking richard threw open the door and stepped into the small windowless room sparsely furnished with a bed small table and two simple wooden chairs it was one of the more utilitarian guest rooms to the side the eyes of knots in a plain pine wardrobe watched then a small brick hearth provided a modicum of heat to the chill scented air holding richards left arm from a half step behind knowing better than to get in the way of his sword kahlan stayed close ulic and egan stepped to each side their blond hair nearly brushing the low ceiling cara and raina swept around them screening richard and kahlan drefan knelt before the table against the far wall dozens of candles were set randomly about the table at the sound of all the commotion he rose smoothly to his feet and turned his blueeyed gaze took in richard as if no one else had entered the room with him each absorbed in silent thoughts she could only imagine they appraised one another and then drefan went to his knees putting his forehead to the floor master rahl guide us master rahl teach us master rahl protect us in your light we thrive in your mercy we are sheltered in your wisdom we are humbled we live only to serve our lives are yours kahlan saw richards two huge body guards and both mordsith almost drop reflexively to their knees to join in the devotion to the master of dhara she had seen countless dharans in aydindril give the devotion she had stood at richards side when the sisters of the light had knelt and sworn fidelity to him richard had told her that at the peoples palace in dhara when darken rahl had been there everyone went to devotion squares twice a day for two hours each time and said those same words over and over while touching foreheads to the tiled floors drefan stood once more assuming a relaxed selfassured stance he was dressed nobly in a ruffled white shirt open to midchest high boots turned down just below his knees and tight dark trousers that displayed enough of the swell of his manhood that kahlan could feel her cheeks flush she forced her eyes to move she could see at least four leather pouches attached to his wide leather belt their flaps held closed with carved bone pins draped loosely over his shoulders was the simple flaxen cloak she had seen him in before the same height and build as richard and with the handsome cast of darken rahls features he cut a striking figure his tumbledown blond hair made his tanned face look all the better kahlan couldnt help staring at the fleshandblood twist of richard and darken rahl richard gestured toward all the candles whats this drefans blueeyed gaze stayed locked on richard i was praying lord rahl making my peace with the good spirits should i be joining them this day there was no timidity in his voice it was a simple selfconfident statement of fact richards chest grew with a deep breath he let it out cara you stay raina ulic egan please wait outside he glanced to them as they were leaving me first they returned grim nods it was code if richard didnt come out of the room first then drefan died on his way outa precaution kahlan used herself i am drefan lord rahl at your service should you find me worthy he bowed his head to kahlan mother confessor what did you mean about joining the good spirits richard asked drefan slid his hands into the opposite sleeves of the cloak there is a bit of a story to it lord rahl take your hands out of your sleeves and then tell me the story drefan pulled his hands out sorry he lifted his cloak back with a little finger to reveal the long thinbladed knife sheathed at his belt he pulled the knife free with one finger and a thumb flipped it in the air and caught it by the point forgive me i meant to set it aside before your visit without turning he tossed the knife over his shoulder the knife stuck solidly in the wall he bent pulled a heavier knife from his boot and tossed that over his shoulder with his other hand as he straightened sticking it too in the wall an inch from the first he reached behind his back under the cloak and came out with a wickedly curved blade without looking he stuck it too in the wall behind between the two blades already there any other weapons richard asked in a businesslike manner drefan spread his arms my hands lord rahl and my knowledge he continued to hold his hands out though even my hands wouldnt be quick enough to defeat your magic lord rahl please search my person to assure yourself that i am otherwise unarmed richard didnt act on the offer so whats the story i am the bastard son of darken rahl as am i richard said not exactly you are the gifted heir of darken rahl a distinct difference lord rahl gifted darken rahl raped my mother i have often had reason to consider my magic a curse drefan nodded deferentially as you would have it lord rahl but darken rahl didnt view offspring the way you seem to to him there was his heir and there were weeds you are his heir i am but one of his weeds formalities associated with conception were irrelevant to the master of dhara women were simply there to bring him pleasure and to grow his seed ones who conceived inferior fruitthose without the giftwere barren soil in his eyes even your mother having produced his prized fruit would have been no more important to him than the dirt in his most coveted orchard kahlan squeezed richards hand cara told me much the same she said that darken rahl that he eliminated those he found without the gift richard stiffened he killed my siblings yes lord rahl cara said not in a methodical fashion but rather on whim or ill mood i dont know anything about his other children i didnt even know he was my father until last autumn how is it that youre alive he asked drefan my mother wasnt drefan paused searching for an inoffensive way to put it she wasnt treated as unfortunately as your cherished mother lord rahl my mother was a woman of ambition and cupidity she saw our father as a means to gain status as i have heard it told she was fair of face and figure and was one of a few who was called to his bed repeatedly most were not apparently she succeeded in cultivating his appetite for her charms to put it bluntly she was a talented whore she hoped to be the one who bore him a gifted heir so as to raise her status in his eyes to something more she failed drefans cheeks mantled she had me that may be a failure in her eyes richard said in a quiet tone but not in the eyes of the good spirits you are no less than i in their eyes the corners of drefans mouth curled in a small smile thank you lord rahl very magnanimous of you to cede to the good spirits that which was always theirs not all men do in your wisdom we are humbled he quoted from the devotion drefan was managing to be courteously respectful without being servile he seemed honestly deferential but without losing his air of nobility unlike the way he had been in the pit he was scrupulously polite but he nonetheless exuded the bearing of a rahl no amount of bowing could alter his aplomb like richard he carried himself with inherent authority so what happened then drefan took a deep breath she took me as an infant to a wizard to have me tested for the gift hoping to present darken rahl with the gifted heir that would bring her riches station and the fawning adoration of darken rahl did i also mention that she was a fool richard didnt answer and drefan went on the wizard broke the bad news to her i was born without the gift instead of bearing a pass to a life of ease she had given birth to a liability darken rahl was known to pull the intestines out of such womenan inch at a time obviously richard said you managed not to draw his attention why not my dear mother was responsible for that she knew that she might be able to raise me and never be noticed by him never be killed but she also knew it would be a hard life of hiding and worry over every knock at the door instead she took me when i was but an infant to a remote community of healers hoping that they would raise me in anonymity so that my father would have no reason to come to know of me and kill me that must have been hard for her to do kahlan said his piercing blue eyes turned on her for her grief she prescribed herself a potent cure which was in turn provided by the healers henbane henbane richard said in a flat tone henbane is poison yes it acts quickly but has the unfortunate quality of being exquisitely painful at its task these healers provided her with poison richard asked incredulously drefans raptor gaze shadowed with admonition returned to richard the calling of a healer is to provide the remedy that is warranted sometimes the remedy is death that doesnt fit my definition of healer richard said returning the raptor gaze in kind a person who is dying with no hope of recovery and in great suffering can be no better served than by the benevolent act of assisting them in ending their suffering your mother wasnt dying with no hope of recovery had darken rahl found her her suffering would have been profound to say the least i dont know how much you knew about our father but he was known for his inventiveness at giving pain and making it last she lived in shuddering fear of that fate she was driven nearly insane with dread she fell to tears at every shadow the healers could do nothing to prevent that fate to protect her from darken rahl had darken rahl wanted to find her he would have had she remained with the healers and been found he would have slaughtered them all for hiding her she gave up her life to give me the chance at one kahlan started when a log in the fire popped drefan didnt start nor did richard im sorry richard whispered my grandfather took his daughter my mother to westland to hide her from darken rahl i guess that he too understood the danger she was in the danger i was in drefan shrugged then we are much the same you and i exiles from our father you however would not have been killed richard nodded to himself he tried to kill me drefans brow twitched with curiosity really he wanted a gifted heir and then he tried to kill him he didnt know as i didnt that it was he who fathered me richard turned the subject back to the matter at hand so whats this about you making peace with the good spirits in case you are to join them today the healers who raised me never kept from me the knowledge of who i was i have known since i can remember that i was the bastard son of our master of father rahl i always knew that he could come at any moment and kill me i prayed each night thanking the good spirits for another day of life free from my father and what he would do to me werent the healers afraid that he would come and kill them too for hiding you perhaps they always discounted it they said that they were not in fear for themselves that they could always say i was a babe abandoned to them and they didnt know my paternity must have been a hard life drefan turned his back on them and seemed to stare into the candles for a time before he went on it was life the only life i knew but i do know that i was woefully tired of living each day in fear that he might come hes dead richard said you no longer have to fear him that is why im here when i felt the bond break and it was later confirmed that he was dead i decided that i would end my private terror ive been guarded since the moment i arrived i knew i wasnt free to leave this room i know the reputation of the guards you surround yourself with that was all part of the chance i took to come here i didnt know if the new lord rahl would want me eliminated too but i decided to end the constant death sentence hanging over my head ive come to offer my services to the master of dhara if he will have me or if it is his will that my life be forfeit for my crime of birth either way it will be over i want it over drefan his eyes watering turned to face richard there you have it lord rahl either forgive me or kill me i dont know that i much care which anymore but i beg you to end itone way or the other his chest rose and fell with labored breaths richard appraised his half brother in the dragging silence kahlan could only imagine what richard must be thinking at the emotions of those deliberations at the painful shadows of the past and the light of hope for what might be at last he held his hand out im richard drefan welcome to the new dhara a dhara that fights for freedom from terror we fight that none have to live in fear as you have done the two men clasped wrists their big powerful hands were the same size thank you drefan whispered richard chapter i heard that you saved caras life richard said i want to thank you it must have been hard knowing that she was one of my guards who might end up harming you if things didnt go right for you im a healer its what i dorichard im afraid i may have trouble calling you anything but lord rahlfor a time anyway i feel the bond to you to you as the lord rahl richard shrugged selfconsciously im still having trouble getting used to people calling me lord rahl he stroked a finger along his lower lip do we do you know if we have any other half brothers or sisters im sure we must some must have survived ive heard a rumor that we have a younger sister at least sister richard grinned really a sister where do you think she is do you know her name im sorry lord richard but all i know is the name lindie the words passed on to me said that if she is still alive she would be perhaps as much as fourteen years the person who told me her name said that all he knew was her first name lindie and that she was born in dhara to the southwest of the peoples palace anything else im afraid not you have now heard everything i know drefan turned to kahlan how are you feeling did the herb woman what was her name stitch you up properly yes kahlan said nadine did fine it hurts some and i have a headache i guess from everything thats happened i didnt sleep well last night with the ache of my shoulder but thats to be expected im fine he moved toward her and before she knew it he had her arm in his hand he lifted it twisted it and pulled it asking each time where it hurt when he had satisfied himself he moved around behind her and gripped her collarbone with his fingers while pressing his thumbs to the base of her neck pain shot up her spine the room swam he pressed under her arm and at the back of her shoulder there hows that kahlan rotated her arm finding the pair greatly diminished much better thank you just be careful with it ive numbed some of the pain but it still must heal before you put it to heavy use do you still have the headache kahlan nodded let me see what i can do for that he pulled her by the hand back toward the table and sat her in a chair he lowered over her blocking her view of richard drefan pulled her arms out toward himself squeezing and manipulating the webs between her first fingers and thumbs his hands made hers seem so small he had hands like richard big and powerful though less callused he was hurting her he was pressing so hard but she didnt voice a complaint thinking he must know what he was doing with him standing right in front of her she had to turn her eyes up lest she be forced to stare at his tight trousers kahlan watched his hands kneading hershis fingers working over her flesh she remembered his hand on cara she vividly recalled those strong fingers working their way down under caras red leather and between her legs working into her kahlan abruptly jerked her hands away thank you thats much better she lied he smiled down at her with a penetrating hawklike blueeyed rahl gaze ive never healed a headache so quickly are you sure its better yes it was just a little headache its gone now thank you glad to help he said he watched her for a long moment the little smile still on his lips finally he turned to richard i was told that you are to be wedded to the mother confessor here you are a very different sort of lord rahl from our father darken rahl would never have considered marriage for himself of course he probably was never tempted into marriage by one so beautiful as your betrothed may i offer my congratulations whens the wedding soon kahlan interjected as she moved to richards side thats right richard said soon we dont know the exact date yet we have a few things to work out look drefan i could use your help we have a number of wounded men and some of them are in grave condition they were wounded by the same man who hurt cara id really appreciate it if youd see what you could do to help them drefan retrieved his knives slipping them away without having to look at what he was doing thats what im here for to help he headed for the door richard caught his arm youd better let me go first until i change the orders you will die if you step out of a room before me we dont want that as richard took kahlans arm and turned toward the door she met caras eyes for an instant her hearing wasnt affected drefan had said she could hear every thing even though she couldnt react she had to have heard kahlan warn him not to put his hand on her there again she had to have known what drefan had been doing but she had been unable to do anything to stop him kahlans face heated at the memory she turned and hugged richards waist as they went through the door richard looked up and down the quiet hall and when he saw no one he backed her to the paneled wall outside her rooms and pressed a kiss to her lips she was glad that drefan had eased the pain in her arm earlier in the day it hardly hurt to circle both arms around richards neck she moaned against his mouth she was tired from the long day and her arm did still hurt just a bit but it wasnt weariness or discomfort that drove out the moanit was longing he drew her into his arms and turned so that he was leaning his back against the wall instead his powerful arms crushed her to him almost lifting her toes from the floor as his kiss became more insistent she returned it in kind she pulled his lower lip through her teeth and then backed away for a breath i cant believe nancy or one of her women isnt here waiting for us richard said he had left their guards farther up the hall around the corner they were at last alonea rare luxury even though she had grown up with people always around she now found their constant presence wearing there was great value in simply being alone kahlan gave his lips a quick lick and a kiss i dont think nancy will be bothering us really richard asked with a sly grin why mother confessor who will protect your virtue her lips brushed his dear spirits no one i pray he surprised her with an abrupt change of topic what do you think of drefan that was a question she was not prepared to answer what do you think of him id like to have a brother i could trust and believe in hes a healer the surgeon was impressed with the way he helped some of those men he said that at least one of them will live only because of what drefan did for him nadine was more than a little curious about some of the compounds he carries in the leather pouches at his belt id like to think that i have a brother who helps people nothing seems so noble as that do you think he has magic i didnt see any trace of it in his eyes im sure i would have been able to tell i cant explain how i can sense magic now how i can see it sometimes sparkle in the air about a person or show in their eyes but i didnt see any of that with drefan i think that he is simply a talented healer im grateful that he saved cara at least he said he saved her what if she had recovered on her own after marlin was dead and her link with him was broken kahlan hadnt thought of that so you dont trust him i dont know i still dont believe in coincidence he sighed in frustration kahlan i need you to be honest and not let me be blinded because hes my brother and i want to trust him i havent proven a very good judge of brothers if you have any reason to doubt him i want to hear about it all right that seems fair he tipped his head toward her for example you can tell me why you lied to him kahlan frowned what do you mean about your headache being gone i could see that he didnt make it any better why did you tell him that it was gone kahlan cupped a hand to the side of his face id like you to have a brother you could be proud of richard but i want it to be real i guess what you said about coincidence has made me wary thats all anything other than simply what i said about coincidence no i hope he can bring a little brotherly love to your heart i pray that it is nothing more than simple coincidence me too she gave his arm an affectionate squeeze i know he has the women on the staff all aflutter i suspect he will soon be breaking hearts what with all the swooning looks ive seen i promise to let you know if he gives me reason to suspect something amiss thanks he didnt smile at what she said about the women all liking drefan richard had never displayed any jealousy he didnt have reason to even if she hadnt been a confessor but still there was a painful history with michael that she realized could make reason less than relevant she wished she hadnt mentioned it he ran his fingers back into her hair holding the sides of her head as he kissed her she pulled back why did you take nadine with you this afternoon who he leaned toward her again she pulled back nadine remember her the woman in the tight dress oh that nadine she poked his ribs so you noticed her dress his brow drew together did you think there was something different about it today oh yes there was something different about it so why did you take her with you because shes a healer shes not an evil personshe has good qualities i thought that as long as she was going to be here she might as well make herself useful i thought that that might make her feel better about herself i had her check that the men were making the quench oak tea properly that it was strong enough she seemed happy to help kahlan remembered nadines smile when richard had asked her to go with him she had been happy all right but not simply to help the smile was for richard as was the dress so richard said you think drefan is handsome as all the other women do she thought his trousers were too tight she pulled richard into a kiss hoping he wouldnt notice her face flushing and misunderstand the reason for it who she breathed dreamily drefan remember him the man in the tight pants sorry i dont remember him she said as she kissed his neck and she nearly didnt she ached for richard and nothing else there was no room in her mind for drefan almost the only thing in her thoughts was the time she had been with richard in that strange place between worlds where they had been together truly together as never before or since she wanted him that way again she wanted him that way now with the way his hands were slipping down her back and the urgency of his lips on her neck she knew he wanted her the same way and just as badly but she also knew that richard didnt want to even appear to be like his father he didnt want anyone to think she was no more than darken rahls women had been an amusement for the master of dhara that was why he always let the women on the staff so easily keep him a bay despite his frustrated objections he never overruled them when they shooed him away the three mordsith too always seemed to be protecting kahlan from being seen as less than the true betrothed to the master of dhara whenever she and richard thought to go to his room at night even just to talk either cara or berdine or raina was always there asking some pointed question that seemed to keep them apart when richard scowled they reminded him that he had instructed them to protect the mother confessor he never countermanded the orders today the three mordsith were scrupulously following his orders and when he had told cara and raina to guard him from around the corner and down the hall they had remained there without objection with their wedding so soon kahlan and richard had decided to wait even though they had already been together once that time seemed somehow unreal in a place between worlds in a place with no heat no cold no source of light no ground and yet they could see and they had lain in dark space firm enough to support them more than anything she remembered the feel of him they had been the source of all heat all light all feeling in that strange place between worlds where the good spirits had taken them she was feeling that heat now as she ran her hands over the muscles of his chest and stomach she could hardly get her breath with the feel of his lips on her she wanted his mouth everywhere on her she wanted hers everywhere on him she wanted him on the other side of her door richard she whispered in his ear please stay with me tonight his hands were making her lose all sense of restraint kahlan i thought please richard i want you in my bed i want you in me he moaned helplessly at her words and at her hands i hope im not interrupting came a voice richard jerked up straight kahlan spun around with the thick carpets they hadnt heard nadines silent approach nadine kahlan said catching her breath what kahlan selfconsciously clasped her hands behind her back wondering if nadine had seen where they had just been she had to have seen where richards had been kahlan felt her face going red nadines cool gaze moved from richard to kahlan i didnt mean to interrupt i just came to change your poultice and to apologize apologize kahlan asked still gulping air yes i said some things to you earlier and i guess i was a bit out of sorts at the time i thought i may have said some things i shouldnt have i thought i should apologize thats all right kahlan said i understand how you felt at the time nadine lifted her bag and her eyebrow the poultice my arm is fine for tonight you could change the poultice for me tomorrow though kahlan sought to fill the dragging silence drefan did some of his healing on it earlier so its fine for tonight sure she lowered her bag you two off to bed then nadine richard said in a restrained tone thanks for checking on kahlan good night nadine regarded him with a cold glower dont even plan to get married first just going to throw her down on the bed and lay claim to her like some girl you come across in the woods seems a bit crude for the high and mighty lord rahl and here you were pretending you were better than us common folk she glanced down at richard and then turned her glare on kahlan like i said before he wants what hes shown shota told me about you i guess you know about what pushes men off the fence too it seems you would do anything to have him after all like i said before youre no better than me bag in hand she turned and marched off down the hall kahlan and richard stood in the uncomfortable silence watching the empty hall out of the mouths of whores kahlan said richard wiped his hands back across his face maybe she has a point maybe she does kahlan admitted reluctantly well good night sleep well you too ill be thinking about you in that little guest room you use he bent and kissed her cheek not going to bed right off where are you going oh i thought id go dunk myself in a horse trough she caught him by the wide leatherpadded band around his wrist richard i dont know if i can stand this much longer are we ever going to get married before something else happens well go wake the sliph just as soon as we make sure everything here is in order i promise dear spirits i promise what things just as soon as we know that the men are getting better and im satisfied about a few other things i want to make sure that jagang cant make good on his threats a couple of days and the men should be better a couple days i promise she held one of his fingers in each of her hands as she stared longingly into his gray eyes i love you she whispered in a few days or after an eternity im yours words spoken over us or not im forever yours we are already one in our hearts the good spirits know the truth of that they want us to be together theyve already proven it and will watch over us dont worry well have the words said over us he started away but turned back win a haunted look in his eyes i only wish zedd could be there when were married dear spirits i wish he could and that he was here to help me now when he looked back from the comer at the end of the hall kahlan threw him a kiss she shuffled into her empty lonely rooms and threw herself on her big bed she thought about what nadine said shota told me about you kahlan wept in frustration so youre not going to be sleeping up here tonight cara said when he walked past and what would make you think i was richard asked cara shrugged you made us wait around the corner maybe i just wanted to kiss kahlan good night without you two passing judgment on my skill cara and raina both smiled the first he had seen from them all day i have already seen you kiss the mother confessor cara said you appear quite talented at it it always leaves her breathless and wanting more even though he didnt feel like smiling he did anyway because he was glad to see them smiling that doesnt mean im talented it just means she loves me ive been kissed cara said and ive seen you kiss i believe i can say with some authority that you are talented at the task we watched you from around the corner tonight richard tried to look indignant as he felt his face going red i gave you orders to stay down here it is our responsibility to watch over you to do that we cant let you out of our sight we cant follow such orders richard shook his head he couldnt be angry over the violation of orders how could he when they were risking his anger to protect him they hadnt endangered kahlan in doing so what do you two think of drefan he is your brother lord rahl raina said the resemblance is obvious i know the resemblance is obvious i mean what do you think of him we dont know him lord rahl raina said i dont know him either look im not going to be angry if you tell me you dont like him in fact id really like to know if you dont what about you cara what do you think of him she shrugged ive never kissed either of you but from what i have seen i would rather kiss you richard put his hands on his hips what does that mean i was hurt yesterday and he helped me but i dont like the fact that master drefan came now when marlin and nadine came richard sighed my thoughts too i ask people not to judge me because of who my father was and i find myself doing that with him id really like to trust him please both of you if you have any reason for concern dont be afraid to come and tell me well cara said i dont like his hands what do you mean he has hands like darken rahl i have already seen them caressing fawning women darken rahl did that too richard threw his hands up when did he have time to do that he was with me most of the day he found the time when you were talking to soldiers and when you were out checking on the men with nadine it didnt take him long the women found him i have never seen so many women batting their lashes at a man you have to admit he is fine to look upon richard didnt see what was so especially fine about his looks have any of these women not been willing her answer was a long moment in coming no lord rahl well i guess ive seen other men who acted like that some of them have been my friends they liked women and women liked them as long as the women are willing i cant see that its any of my business im more concerned about other things like what i wish i knew if you learn that he is here innocently and only means to help as he says then you can be proud of him lord rahl your brother is an important man he is how important is he your brother is the leader of his sect of healers he is he never told me that no doubt he did not wish to vaunt himself humility before the lord rahl is the way of dharans and one of the tenets of that ancient sect of healers i suppose so he leads these healers yes cara said he is the high priest of the raugmoss the what richard whispered what did you call them the raugmoss lord rahl do you know the meaning of the words cara shrugged just that it means healers thats all does it have some meaning to you lord rahl wheres berdine in her bed i would suppose richard started down the hall calling orders back to them as he went cara post a guard for the night around kahlans room raina go wake berdine and ask her to meet me in my office now lord rahl raina asked this late yes please richard took the steps two at a time on the way to his office where waited the journal kolos journal written in high dharan in high dharan raugmoss meant divine wind both shotas warning to nadine for richard the wind hunts him and the words from the prophecy down in the pit he must seek the remedy in the wind spun through his mind chapter this time ann warned you had better let me do the talking understand her eyebrows drew so tight together zedd thought they might touch she leaned close enough that he could smell the lingering aroma of sausage on her breath with a fingernail she tapped his collaranother warning albeit a wordless one zedd blinked innocently if it would please you by all means but my tales always have your best interest and our purpose at heart oh of course and your clever wit is always a delight too zedd felt that her affected smile was overdoing it the sardonic praise would have been quite enough there were accepted customs to such things the woman really did need to learn where the line was zedds gaze again focused beyond her to the problem at hand he passed a critical eye over the inns dimly lit door it was across the street and at the end of a narrow board walk above the alleyway that ran between two warehouses hung a small sign jesters inn zedd didnt know the name of the large town they had come to in the dark but he did know that he would have preferred to pass it by he had seen several inns in the town this wasnt the one he would have chosen had he a choice jesters inn looked as if it had either been an afterthought meant to use available space in the back or else its proprietors wanted to shelter it from the scrutiny of honest people and the critical eye of authority from the customers zedd had already seen he was leaning in the direction of the second guess most of the men looked to be mercenaries or highwaymen i dont like it he muttered to himself you dont like anything ann snapped youre the most disagreeable man ive ever met zedds eyebrows went up in true surprise why would you say that ive been told that im a most pleasant traveling companion do we have any of that sausage left ann rolled her eyes no what is it you dont like this time zedd watched a man look both ways before going to the door at the back of the dark alleyway why would nathan go in there ann looked over her shoulder across the deserted street of rutted frozen slush she fingered a stray wisp of graying hair into the loose knot tied at the back of her head to get a hot meal and some sleep she scowled back at zedd that is if hes even in there ive shown you how to sense the thread of magic i used to hook the tracer cloud to him youve felt it felt him true enough ann admitted yet now that we finally catch him and know that hes in there you suddenly dont like it thats right he said distantly i dont like it the scowl on anns face lost its heat and turned serious what is it that bothers you look at the sign after the name a pair of womans legs pointed up in the shape of a v she turned back and peered at him is if he were daft zedd the man has been locked up in the palace of the prophets for almost a thousand years you just said it hes been locked up zedd tapped the collar called a radahan around his own neck the collar she had put on him to capture him and make him do her bidding nathan is not inclined to be locked up in a collar again it probably took him hundreds of years of planning and the right turn of events to get out of his collar and to escape i dread to consider how that man may have influenced or even directly altered events through prophecy to bring to pass the turn of fate that allowed him the opportunity to get off his collar now you expect me to believe he would go in there just to be with a woman when he has to know youre chasing after him ann stared in stunned disbelief zedd are you saying that you think nathan may have influenced eventspropheciesjust to get his collar off zedd looked across the road and shook his head im just saying i dont like it he probably wanted whats in there enough that it distracted him from worrying about me he simply wanted some female companionship and ignored the dangers of being caught you have known nathan for over nine centuries ive only known him a short time he leaned down closer to her and lifted an eyebrow but even i know better than that nathan is anything but stupid he is a wizard of remarkable talent you make a serious mistake if you underestimate him she watched his eyes a moment youre right it may be a trap nathan wouldnt kill me to escape but beyond that you may be right zedd harrumphed zedd ann said after a long uncomfortable silence this business with nathan is important he must be caught hes helped me in the past when we have discovered danger in the prophecies but he is still a prophet prophets are dangerous not because they deliberately wish to cause trouble but because of the nature of prophecy you dont need to convince me of that i know well the dangers of prophecy we have always kept prophets confined at the palace of the prophets because of the potential for catastrophe should they roam free a prophet who wanted mischief could have it even a prophet who doesnt wish mischief is dangerous not only to others but to himself people usually extract vengeance on the bringer of truth as if knowing the truth is its cause prophecy is not meant to be heard by untrained minds those having no understanding of magic much less prophecy one time as we sometimes did at his request we let a woman visit nathan zedd frowned at her you took prostitutes to him ann shrugged selfconsciously we knew the loneliness of his confinement it wasnt the most desirable solution but yes we brought him companionship from lime to time we werent heartless how magnanimous of you ann glanced away from his eyes we did what we had to by locking him in the palace but we felt sorrow for him it wasnt his choice to be born with the gift of prophecy we always warned him not to tell the women any prophecy but one time he did the woman ran screaming from the palace we never knew how she escaped before we could stop her she spread word of the prophecy before we could find her it started a civil war thousands died women and children died nathan sometimes seems crazy out of his senses sometimes he seems to me to be the most dangerously unbalanced person ive ever known nathan views the world not only by what he sees around him but through the filter of prophecy that visits his mind when i confronted him he professed not to remember the prophecy or having told the young woman anything i only found out much later when i was able to link several prophecies that one of the children who died was a boy named in prophecy as one who would go on to rule through torture and murder untold tens of thousands would have died had that boy lived and grown into a man but nathan had choked off that dangerous fork in prophecy i have no idea how much that man knows but wont disclose a prophet has the potential to just as easily cause great harm a prophet who wished power would have a fair chance of ruling the world zedd was still watching the door so you lock them away yes zedd picked at a thread on his maroon robes he looked down at her squat form in the dim light ann i am first wizard if i didnt understand i wouldnt be helping you thank you she whispered zedd considered their options there werent many what you are saying if i understand you is that you dont know if nathan is sane but even if he is he has the potential to be dangerous i guess so but nathan has often helped me to spare people suffering hundreds of years ago he warned me about darken rahl and told me of a prophecy that a war wizard would be bornthat richard would be born we worked together to see to it that richard would be safe from interference as he grew so that you would have the time to help raise your grandson into the kind of man who would use his ability to help people for that you have my gratitude zedd offered but you put this collar around my neck and i dont like that one bit i understand its not something i liked doing nor am i proud of what i did sometimes desperate need calls for desperate acts the good spirits will have the final say on my actions the sooner we get nathan the sooner i will take the radahan from your neck i dont enjoy holding you prisoner by that collar and making you help me but in view of the dire consequences should i fail to get nathan i do as i feel i must zedd aimed a thumb over his shoulder i also dont like that ann didnt look she knew what he was pointing at what does a red moon have to do with nathan its most peculiar but what does one have to do with the other im not saying it has anything to do with nathan i just dont like it with the thick clouds of the last few days they had been slowed at night both by the darkness and also by the difficulty of seeing the tracer cloud he had hooked to nathan fortunately they had been close enough to sense the link of magic without having to see the tracer cloud the tracer cloud was only used to get its tracker close enough to sense the link zedd knew they were very near to nathanwithin a few hundred feet this close to the object of the trace the links magic distorted zedds senses his ability to judge with the aid of his magic his capacity to access his familiar ability with his gift this close his magic was like a bloodhound on scent so concentrated on the object of its search that it disregarded anything else but the trail it was an uncomfortable form of blindness and another reason for his unease he could break the link but that was risky before they actually had nathan once broken it couldnt be reestablished without physical contact the snow flurries of the last few days had slowed them and made the going cold and miserable earlier in the day the clouds had at last cleared away even if they had left behind the bitter wind to vex them they had been looking forward to the moonrise and the light it would provide as they closed in on nathan they had both watched in stunned silence when the moon had risen it had risen red at first they thought that it might be a lingering haze that was causing it but with the moon well overhead zedd knew it was not being caused by some innocent atmospheric event worse with the recent cloud cover he didnt know how long it had been since the moon had turned rid zedd ann finally asked into the breeding silence do you know what it means zedd looked away pretending to scan the shadows do you youve lived a lot longer than i you must know something about such a sign he could hear her fussing with her wool cloak you are a wizard of the first order i would defer to your expertise in such matters you all of a sudden think my judgment worthwhile zedd lets not joust with words about this i know that such a sign is without precedent in my experience but i do recall a reference to a red moon in an ancient text a text from the great war the book didnt say what it meant only that it brought great alarm zedd squatted in the shadow of the comer of the building they hid behind he leaned his back against the clapboards and held a hand out in invitation ann sat beside him deeper in the shadow in the wizards keep there are dozers of libraries huge libraries most at least as large as the vault of books at the palace of the prophets many a great deal larger there are also many books of prophecy there there were books of prophecy at the keep that were considered so dangerous that they were kept locked behind the powerful shields protecting the first wizards private enclave not even the old wizards who had lived at the keep when zedd was young were allowed to read those prophecies even though he had access to them after he became first wizard zedd had not read nearly all of them the ones he had read left him in sleepless sweats dear spirits he went on there an so many books at the keep that ive not even read all the titles there used to be staffs of curators for each library each knew the books in his section of the stacks long ago well before my time these curators were gathered when an answer was sought each knew his own books and could speak up if his particular books held information on the subject in question in this way it was a relatively simple task to locate the reference volumes or prophecies that might help with the problem at hand when i was very young there were only two wizards left acting as curators two men could not begin to tap the knowledge held there a plethora of information is held in those books but finding a specific bit of it is a formidable challenge the guidance of the gift is needed to even begin to narrow the search needing information from the libraries is like being adrift in the ocean and needing a drink of water information is in overabundance yet you can die of thirst for it before you can locate it when i was young i was guided as to what were the more important books of history magic and prophecy i mostly confined my studies to those books what about the red moon ann asked what did the books you read say of it i only recall once reading about a red moon what i read wasnt very explicit mentioning it only obliquely i wish i had thought to inquire into the subject further but i didnt there were other matters in the books that were of greater importance at the time and demanded my attentionmatters that were real and not hypothetical what did this book say if i recall correctly and im not saying that i do it said something about a breach between worlds it said that in the event of such a breach the warning would be three nights of a red moon three nights for all we know with the clouds weve had we could already have had our three nights what if there were clouds all the time the warning would be missed zedd squinted in concentration as he tried to recall what he had read no no it said that the one to whom the warning was directed would see all three nights of the warningall three nights of the red moon what exactly is meant by such a warning what kind of breach could there be between worlds i wish i knew zedd thumped his head of wavy white hair back against the wall when the boxes of orden were opened by darken rahl and the stone of tears came into this world from another and the keeper of the underworld was near to coming into our world through the breach there was never a red moon then maybe the red moon doesnt mean that there is a breach perhaps you recall it wrongly perhaps what i recall most vividly are my thoughts at the time i remember picturing a red moon in my mind and telling myself to remember such an image and that if i ever saw it for real i must remember that it was grave trouble and i must at once search out the meaning of the sign ann touched his arm an act of compassion she had never done before zedd we almost have nathan well have him tonight when we do ill take the radahan from your neck so that you can hurry to aydindril and see to this matter in fact as soon as we have nathan we will all go nathan will understand the seriousness of this and will help well go to aydindril with you and help although zedd didnt like that this woman had insisted he come with her to capture nathan he had come to understand how afraid she was of what could happen with nathan free and that she needed his help at times he had difficulty maintaining his indignation he knew how desperate she was to keep the prophecies from being loosed along with nathan zedd knew how dangerous it could he if people were exposed to raw prophecy he had been lectured since he was a boy on the dangers of prophecy even for a wizard sounds like a worthwhile bargain to me i help you get nathan back and you two help me find the meaning of the red moon a bargain thenwe work together willingly i must admit it will be a pleasant change of affairs is that so zedd asked then why dont you take this collar off me i will just as soon as we have nathan nathan means more to you than you have admitted she was silent a moment he does we have worked together for centuries he can be trouble on two legs but somewhere in all that bluster nathan has a noble heart her voice lowered as she turned her head away zedd thought she wiped a hand at her eyes i care greatly for that incorrigible wonderful man zedd peeked around the corner at the inns silent door i still dont like it he whispered something about this is wrong i wish i knew what it was so she finally asked what are we going to do about nathan i thought you wanted to do the talking well i guess you have convinced me that we should be careful what do you think we should do ill go in there alone and ask for a room you wait outside if i find him before he leaves ill surprise him and put him down if he comes out before i find him or if something goes wrong you seize him zedd nathan is a wizard im only a sorceress if he had his radahan around his neck i could easily control him but he is without it zedd mulled it over for a moment they couldnt take a chance on his getting away beyond that ann could be hurt they would have a difficult time of finding nathan again once he knew they were onto him he might figure out the tracer cloud and possibly unhook it that was not likely though youre right he said at last ill cast a web outside the door so that if he comes out it will hobble him and then you can snap that infernal collar around his neck that sounds a good idea what sort of web will you use as youve said yourself we cant fail he studied her eyes in the dim light bags i cant believe im actually doing this he muttered give me the collar for a moment ann searched under her cloak for the pouch at her waist when her hand came out the light of the red moon glinted dully off the radahan this is the same one he wore zedd asked for almost a thousand years zedd grunted he took the collar in his hands and let his magic flow into the cold object of subjugation let it mingle with the magic of the collar he could feel he warm hum of the additive magic the collar possessed and he could feel the icy tingle of its subtractive magic he handed back the collar ive keyed the spell to his radahan what spell are you going to weave she asked in a suspicious tone he considered the resolve in her eyes a light spell if he comes out without me you will have twenty of his heartbeats to get that around his neck or the light web will ignite if she didnt get the collar around his neck in time to extinguish the spell nathan would be consumed by it without the collar there would be no escape for nathan from such a spell with it he would escape the spell but then there would be no escape from her a double bind at that moment zedd didnt much like himself ann took a deep breath someone else coming out wont trigger it will they zedd shook his head i will link it to the tracer cloud the spell will recognize him and only him by that and that alone his voice lowered in warning if you dont get it around him in time and it ignites then others beside nathan will be hurt or killed if theyre close enough if you cant get that around his neck for any reason then you make sure you get away in time he may prefer death over having that around his neck again chapter as he ambled in surveying the gloomy room zedd realized that his heavy maroon robes with black sleeves and cowled shoulders were out of place the mellow lamplight showed off the three rows of silver brocade at each cuff and the thicker gold brocade running around the neck and down the front a red satin belt set with a gold buckle cinched the waist of the rich robes zedd missed his simple robes but they were long goneat adies insistence the old sorceress had chosen his new disguise for powerful wizards simple accoutrements were the equivalent of military dress zedd suspected she just didnt like his old robes and preferred him in this he missed adie and felt sorrow for the heartache she must feel at believing him dead nearly everyone thought he was dead when they had time maybe he would have ann write a message in her journey book letting adie know he was alive he felt the most sorrow though for richard richard needed him richard had the gift and without proper instruction he was as helpless as an eaglet fallen from the nest at least richard had the sword of truth to help protect him for now zedd intended to go to richard just as soon as they had nathan it wouldnt be long and then he could hurry on his way to richard the innkeeper eyed zedds flashy outfit his gaze snagging on the gold belt buckle a collection of scraggy patrons dressed in furs tattered leather and ragged wool watched from a few booths at the wall to the right the two plank tables sat empty on the strawcovered floor waiting for diners or drinkers rooms are a silver the innkeeper said in a disinterested tone if youd like company its an extra silver it would appear that my choice of outfits has turned out to be rather costly zedd observed the burly innkeeper smiled with one side of his mouth as he held out a meaty hand palm up the price is the price you want a room or not zedd dropped a single silver in the mans hand third door on the left he nodded his head of curly brown hair toward the hall in the back interested in company old man youd have to share it with the lady who called i was thinking you might be interested in a bit more profit a considerable bit more the mans brow twitched with curiosity as he closed his fist around the silver coin meaning well i heard a dear old friend of mine has been known to stop here ive not seen him in quite a while if he were here tonight and you could direct me to his room id be so overwhelmed with joy and happiness to see him again that id foolishly part with a gold piece a full gold piece the man looked him up and down again this friend of yours have a name well zedd said in a low voice like many of your other patrons he has a problem with nameshe cant seem to remember them for very long and has to keep thinking up new ones but i can tell you that hes tall older and with white hair down to his broad shoulders the man stroked his tongue across the inside of his cheek hes busy at the moment zedd produced the gold piece but pulled it back when the innkeeper reached for it so you say id like to decide for myself just how busy he is then its another silver zedd forced himself to keep his voice down for what for the ladys time and company ive no intention of availing myself of your lady so you say when you see her with him you might have a change of mood and decide to try to rekindle your youth its my policy to collect the money first if she tells me you gave her no more than a smile then you can have the silver back zedd knew there was no chance of that it would be his word against hers and her word would carry the sweet ring of extra profit if not the truth but in the scheme of things the price was of no consequence no matter how much it irked him zedd dug into an inner pocket and handed over the silver coin last room on the right the innkeeper said as he turned away he turned back to zedd and we have a guest in the next room who doesnt want to be disturbed i wont bother your guests he gave zedd a cunning grin plain as she is i offered her a little companionshipno extra chargeand she told me that if anyone disturbed her rest shed skin me alive a woman with enough brass to come in here alone i believe her im not giving her her silver piece back if you wake her ill take it out of your hide understand zedd nodded absently as he gave brief consideration to asking for a mealhe was hungrybut reluctantly dismissed the thought would you happen to have a back door in case i need some night air zedd didnt want nathan slipping out the wrong door id understand if it cost extra were backed up to the blacksmiths shop the innkeeper said as he walked away theres no other door last room on the right only one way in one way out something about this was wrong nathan wouldnt be so foolish yet zedd could feel the air crackling with the magic of his link as dubious as he was that nathan would be so conveniently bedded down for them he moved silently down the dark hall he listened intently for anything out of the ordinary but heard only the wellpracticed feigned sounds of passion from a woman in the second room to the left the end of the hall was lit by a single candle on a wooden bracket to the side from the next to last room zedd could hear the soft snores of the brassy lady who didnt want to be disturbed he hoped it wouldnt come to that and that she would sleep through the whole thing zedd put his ear close to the last door on the right he heard soft throaty laughter from a woman if this went wrong she might be hurt if it went very wrong she might be killed he could wait but having nathan distracted would certainly be convenient the man was a wizard after all zedd didnt know how strongly nathan felt about being captured zedd knew how he would feel about it that decided him he couldnt afford not to take the opportunity of the distraction zedd threw open the door casting a hand out igniting the air with silent confusing flashes of heat and light the naked couple on the bed cringed away covering their eyes with a fist of air zedd threw nathan off the woman and over the far side of the bed with nathan grunting and flailing at the air zedd seized the womans wrist and threw her back out of the way she snatched a sheet with her as the flashes of light sparked out and before she was even able to throw the sheet around herself zedd loosed a web paralyzing her where she stood almost simultaneously he cast a similar web at the man behind the bed except this web was laced with serious consequences should he try to fend it off with magic of his own this was no time to be polite or indulgent with hardly a sound other than a bit of thumping onto the floor the gloomy room was suddenly silent only a single candle on a washstand flickered weakly zedd was relieved it had gone so well and he hadnt had to hurt the woman he rounded the bottom of the bed to see the man on the floor frozen in place his mouth opened in the beginning of a scream his hands clawed to defend himself it wasnt nathan zedd stared in disbelief he could feel the magic of the hook in the room he knew this was who he had been chasing he leaned over the man i know you can hear me so listen carefully im going to release the magic holding you but if you cry out i will put it back on and leave you like that forever think carefully before you dare to call for help as you may have already surmised im a wizard and anyone who comes will not be able to do anything to save you should you displease me zedd passed his hand before the man pulling back the veil of the web the man scooted back to the wall but he remained silent he was older but not as old as nathan appeared his hair was white but wavy rather than nathans straight hair it wasnt as long either but the short description zedd had given the innkeeper would have been close enough for him to think this was the man zedd sought who are you zedd asked williams my name youd be zedd zedd straightened how do you know that the fellow youd be looking for told me he gestured toward the nearby chair mind if i pull on my trousers i have a feeling ill not be needing them off anymore tonight zedd tilted his head toward the chair signaling for william to go ahead talk while you do it and keep in mind what i told you about my being a wizard i know when a man is telling me a lie keep in mind too that im suddenly in a very foul mood zedd wasnt exactly telling the truth about being able to detect a lie but he reasoned that the man didnt know that he was however telling the truth about his mood i ran into the man you were chasing he didnt tell me his name he offered me william glanced to the woman as he pulled the trousers up can she hear this dont you worry about her worry abut me zedd gritted his teeth talk well he offered me he peered at the woman her wrinkled face was frozen in a startled expression he offered me a purse if id do him a favor what favor taking his place he told me to ride like the keeper himself was after me until i got at least this far he said that when i got here i could slow rest or stop whatever my choice he told me that youd be catching up with me and he wanted that william buttoned his trousers plopped back into the chair and started pulling on his boots he said i wouldnt be able to lose you that sooner or later youd catch up with me but he didnt want that to happen until at least after i arrived here fast as i was moving i must admit that i didnt think youd be so close on my heels so i thought to enjoy some of my profits william stood and stuffed an arm into his brown wool shirt he told me that i was to give you a message message what message william tucked in his shirt and then reached into a trouser pocket and pulled out a leather purse it looked to be heavy with coins william fingered open the purse its in here with what he gave me zedd snatched the purse from the man ill take a look the purse held mostly gold coins with a few silver zedd felt one of the gold coins between a finger and thumb he could feel the slight aftertingle of magic the coins had probably started out as coppers and nathan had changed them to gold with magic zedd had been hoping that nathan didnt know how to do that changing things to gold was dangerous magic zedd only did it himself if there was no other choice inside the purse besides the coins was a folded piece of paper he pulled it out and turned it over in his fingers giving it a good look in the dim light wary of any form of magic snare that might be attached to it william pointed thats what he gave me he told me to give it to you when you caught me anything else did he tell you anything else besides to give me this message well as we were parting he paused and looked up at me he said tell zedd its not what he thinks zedd mulled this over for a moment which way did he go i dont know i was atop my horse and he was still afoot he told me to ride then he slapped my horses rump and i rode zedd tossed the purse to william while keeping a wary eye on the man he unfolded the paper he squinted in the dim light of the single candle as he scanned the message sorry ann but i have important business one of our sisters is going to do something very stupid i must stop her if i can in case i die i want you to know i love you but i guess you knew that i could never say it as long as i was your prisoner zedd if the moon rises red as i expect it to then we are all in mortal danger if the moon rises red for three nights it means jagang has invoked a bound fork prophecy you must go to the jocopo treasure if you instead waste precious time coming after me we will all die and the emperor will have the spoils the bound fork prophecy enforces a double bind on its victim zedd i am sorry but the victim named is richard may the spirits have mercy on his soul if i knew the meaning of the prophecy would tell you but i dontthe spirits have denied me access to it ann go with zedd he will need your help may the good spirits be with you both as zedd blinked trying to clear his watery vision he noticed a smudge he turned the message over and realized that the smudge was wax residue the message had been sealed but in the poor light lie hadnt noticed before zedd looked up to see williams club he flinched back but felt the stunning pain of a blow the floor crashed against his shoulder william pounced atop him holding a knife to his throat wheres this jocopo treasure old man talk or ill slit your throat zedd tried to hold on to his vision as he felt the room spinning and tilling nausea gagged him he was in an instant sweat williams eyes were wild above him talk the man stabbed him in the upper arm talk wheres the treasure a hand reached down and snatched william by the hair it was a middleaged woman in a dark cloak zedd couldnt seem to make sense of who she was or what she was doing there with surprising strength the woman threw william back he crashed against the wall beside the open door and slumped to the floor she sneered down at zedd you have made a big mistake old man letting nathan get away i suspected that following that old crone would net me the prophet so ive followed you two until i could sense your link with him yet what do i find at the end of your magic hook but this fool here instead of nathan so now i have to make things unpleasant for you i want the prophet she turned and cast a hand out toward the naked woman frozen in place the room erupted with thunder as a midnightblack discharge of lightning arced from her hand the deathlike bolt of lightning sliced the woman and the sheet she held cleanly in half blood splattered the wall the top half of her toppled to the floor like a statue cleaved in two her insides spilled across the floor as her torso hit the ground but her limbs remained frozen in the same pose the woman hovering above him turned back her eyes were molten rage if you would like a taste of subtractive magic one limb at a time then just give me a reason now let me see the message zedd opened his hand to her she reached out he focused his mind through the dizziness before she could snatch the paper he ignited it it went up in a bright yellow flash with a cry of fury she spun to william what did it say you little worm william until that instant rigid in panic flung himself through the door and bolted down the hall her stringy hair whipped around her face as she spun back to zedd ill be back to get answers from you you will confess everything before i kill you as she lunged for the door zedd felt an unfamiliar composition of magic ram through his hasty shield pain erupted in his head trying to gather his senses he fought through the grip of blinding agony he wasnt paralyzed but he was unable to think of how to make himself get up his arms and legs battled the air as ineffectively as a turtle on its back the searing pain made it difficult to do much more than maintain consciousness he pressed his hands against the sides of his head feeling as if it was going to come apart and he had to hold it together he could hear himself gasping for breath the sudden thud of a concussion jolted the air and briefly lifted him clear of the floor a blinding flash lit the room as the roof tore open the ripping roar of splintering wood and snapping beams was nearly lost in a deafening boom of thunder the pain extinguished the light web had ignited dust billowed through the air as smoking debris rained down around him zedd drew into a ball and covered his head as boards and bits of rubble peppered him it sounded like being under a kettle in a hailstorm when silence settled over the scene zedd finally took his hands from his head and looked up to his surprise the building was still standingafter a fashion the roof was mostly gone letting the wind pull the dust away into the dark night above the walls were holed like motheaten rags nearby lay the gory remains of the woman zedd took assessment of himself and was surprised to find he was in remarkably good condition considering blood was running down the side of his head from where william had clubbed him and his arm was throbbing where he had been stabbed but other than that he seemed uninjured not a bad bargain in view of what could have been he decided moans drifted in from outside a woman screamed hysterically zedd could hear men throwing wreckage aside calling out names as they searched for the injured or dead the door hanging crookedly from one hinge suddenly exploded open as someone kicked it in zedd sighed in relief as he saw a familiar squat form rush in her red face etched with concern zedd zedd are you alive bags woman dont you think i look alive ann knelt beside him i think you look a mess your head is bleeding zedd grunted in pain as she helped him sit up i cant tell you how glad i am to see you alive i feared you might have been too close to the light spell when it ignited she pawed through his bloodmatted hair inspecting the wound zedd that wasnt nathan i almost snapped the collar around that mans neck when he ran into the spell then sister roslyn came flying out the door she threw herself on him screaming something at him about a message roslyn is a sister of the dark she didnt see me my legs arent what they used to be but i ran like a girl of twelve when i saw her trying to use subtractive magic to undo the spell i guess it didnt work zedd muttered i guess she never encountered a spell cast by a first wizard but i certainly didnt make it that big using subtractive magic on the light spell expanded its power it cost innocent people their lives at least it cost that evil woman hers too ann heal me and then we have to help these people zedd who was that man why did he set off the spell where is nathan zedd held out his hand and opened his tightly closed fist he let the warmth of magic flow into the ashes in his hand the powdery black residue began clumping together as the inky ashes lightened to gray when the charred ruins reconstituted itself into the paper it had been it finally returned to pale brown ive never seen anyone able to do such a thing ann whispered in astonishment be thankful that sister roslyn hadnt either or we would be in even more trouble than we are being first wizard has its advantages ann lifted the crumpled paper from his palm her lower lids brimmed with tears as she read the message from nathan by the time she had finished silent tears were running down her round cheeks dear creator she breathed at last his own eyes stung with tears indeed he whispered in response zedd what is the jocopo treasure he blinked at her i was hoping you would know why would nathan tell us to go protect something and not tell us what it is people outside were crying in pain and calling for help in the distance a wall or perhaps a piece of roof crashed to the ground men were yelling directions as they dug through the rubble nathan forgets that he is different from other people just as you recall things from a few decades ago he also recalls what was except what he recalls is sometimes not a couple of decades ago but a couple of centuries i wish he would have told us more we have to find it we will find it i have a few ideas she shook her finger at him and you are coming with me we still havent got nathan that collar stays on for now youre going with me do you understand ill hear none of your arguing zedd reached up and unsnapped the collar around his neck anns eyes went wide and her jaw dropped zedd tossed the radahan into her lap we have to find this jocopo treasure that nathan spoke of nathan is not playing games about this this is deadly serious i believe what he wrote in that message we are in a lot of trouble im going with you but this time we must be more careful this time we must cover our trail with magic zedd she finally whispered how did you get that collar off its impossible zedd scowled at her to keep himself from weeping at the thought of the prophecy trapping richard like i said being first wizard has its advantages her face flushed crimson did you just how long have you been able to take off the radahan zedd shrugged a bony shoulder it took me a couple of days to figure it out since then since after the first two or three days yet you went with me you still went with me why i guess i like women who do things out of desperation shows character he balled his trembling hands into fists do you believe everything nathan said in that message i wish i could say no im sorry zedd ann swallowed he said may the spirits have mercy on his soul meaning richard nathan didnt say good spirits he just said spirits zedd wiped his sticklike fingers across his face not all spirits are good there are evil spirits too what do you know about double fork prophecies about prophecy that enforced a double bind unlike your collar there is no escape from one the cataclysm named has to be brought about to invoke the prophecy whatever it is the event has already happened once invoked the nature of the cataclysm is selfdefining meaning that the victim has only the choice of one of the two forks in the prophecy the victim can choose only which way he would rather surely you must know this as first wizard you would have to know i had been hoping you would tell me i was wrong zedd whispered i wish nathan would have at least written the prophecy for us to see be thankful he didnt chapter clarissa gripped the weathered sill of the window in the stone tower of the abbey in an effort to control her quaking she clutched her other hand over her thundering heart even with the acrid smoke burning her eyes she had to force herself to blink as she stood transfixed watching the tumult in the city and the square below the noise was deafening the invaders screamed battle cries as they charged ahead swinging swords axes and flails steel clashed and rang the air hissed with arrows horses screamed in panic balls of light and flame wailed in from the distant countryside and exploded through the stone walls the grisly invaders blew shrill horns and bellowed like beasts as they poured through the rents in the city walls their impossible numbers darkening the streets in a sooty flood flames whooshed and roared and snapped townsmen wept unashamedly as they begged for mercy their hands outstretched imploring even as they were put to the sword clarissa saw the bloody body of one of the assembly of seven being dragged down the street on a rope behind a horse the shrill screams of women pierced through it all as their children their husbands their brothers and fathers were murdered before their eyes the hot wind carried the jumbled smells of a burning city pitch and wood oil and cloth hide and flesh but laced through it all in every breath she pulled was the gagging stench of blood it was all happening just as he had said it would clarissa had laughed at him she didnt think she would ever be able to laugh again as long as she lived at the thought of how short a time that might be her legs nearly gave way no she wouldnt think that she was safe here they wouldnt violate the abbey she could hear the throng seeking safety in the great room below weeping and crying out in terror this was a sacred place devoted to the worship of the creator and the good spirits it would be blasphemy even for these beasts to spill blood in such a sanctuary yet he had told her they would below out in the streets the armys resistance had been crushed the renwold defenders had never before let an invader set foot inside the walls it was said the city was as safe as if the creator himself defended it invaders had tried before and had always departed bloodied and dispirited no horde from the wilds had ever breached the city walls renwold had always stood safe this day as he had said it would renwold had fallen for their audacity at refusing to surrender the city and its spoils peacefully without a fight the people of renwold were being shown no mercy some had urged surrender arguing that the red moons of the previous three nights had been an ill omen but those voices were few the city had always been held safe before the good spirits and the creator himself had turned away from the people of renwold this day what their crime was she couldnt fathom but surely it must be terrible indeed to warrant no mercy from the good spirits from her vantage point at the top of the abbey she could see the people of renwold being herded into clusters in the streets the market district and courtyards she knew many of the people being forced at the point of steel into the square below the invaders clad in foreign outfits of studded metal and spiked leather straps and belts and layers of hides and fur looked to her the way she imagined savages from the wilds the invaders began sorting through the men pulling aside those with trades smiths bowyers fletchers bakers brewers butchers millers carpentersanyone of a craft or trade who might be put to use those men were chained together to be marched off as slaves the very old young boys and those seemingly without useful trades like valets yeomen innkeepers city officials and merchants were slaughtered on the spota sword hacked to the side of the neck a spear through the chest a knife in the gut a flail across the skull there was no system to the slaughter clarissa stared as an invader clubbed the head of a man on the ground who wouldnt seem to die it reminded her of a fisherman clubbing a catfish on the bankthunk thunk thunk the man doing the clubbing didnt seem to think any more of it than a fisherman would dumb gus the poor halfwit who ran errands for merchants shopkeepers and inns his work paid for with food and a bed and watered ale kicked one last time as his thick skull gave way with a resounding crack clarissa put trembling fingers over her mouth as she felt the contents of her stomach lurch up into the back of her throat she swallowed it back down and gasped for air this wasnt happening she told herself she was dreaming she repeated the lie over and over in her head this isnt happening this isnt happening this isnt happening but it was dear creator it was clarissa watched as the women were culled from the men the old women were summarily put to death the women judged worth keeping were shoved screaming and crying for their men into a group invaders sorted through them further winnowing them according to age and apparently looks laughing invaders held the women as others of the beasts methodically went from woman to woman seized them by their lower lip and poked it through with a thin spike a ring was pushed through each womans lip its split opening efficiently closed with the aid of the invaders teeth he had told her this too the women would be marked into slavery this too she had laughed at and why not he seemed to her as daft as dumb gus expounding his crazy preposterous ideas and nonsense clarissa squinted trying to see better it appeared that the different groups of women had differentcolored rings put through their lips one group of older women of every shape looked to have coppercolored rings another group of younger women screamed and fought as silver rings were put upon them they stopped fighting and meekly submitted after a few who fought the hardest were run through with swords the smallest group of the youngest prettiest women were in the grip of the greatest terror as they were surrounded by a gang of burly invaders these women received gold rings blood ran down their chins and onto their fancy dresses clarissa knew most of these young women it was hard not to remember people who regularly humiliated you being in her early thirties and unmarried clarissa was the object of scorn among many women but these young women were the crudest giving her smirking sidelong glances as they passed referring to her as the old maid or the hag among themselves but just loud enough that she could hear them clarissa had never planned to be this age and without a husband she had always wanted a family she wasnt entirely sure how life and time had rolled on without providing her with the opportunity for a husband she wasnt ugly she didnt think but she knew she was no more than plain at best her figure was satisfactory she had meat on her bones her face wasnt twisted or shriveled or grotesque whenever she looked at her reflection while passing a window at night she didnt think an ugly woman stared back at her she knew it wasnt a face that inspired ballads but it wasnt repulsive yet with more women than men to be had being merely not ugly wasnt adequate the pretty younger women didnt understand they had men in abundance courting them the older women understood and were kinder but still she was an unfortunate in their eyes and they feared to be overly friendly lest they catch the unseen unknown taint that kept her unwed no man would want her now she was too old too old they would fear to give them sons time had trapped her alone and an old maid her work filled her time but it never made her happy the way she suspected a family would have as much as the sting of those young womens words hurt and as much as she had often wished them to experience humiliation she would never wish them this the invaders laughed as they ripped the bodices of the fine dresses inspecting the young women like livestock dear creator she wept in prayer please dont let this be because i wished them to feel the shame of degradation i never wished them this dear creator i beg you forgive me ever wishing them ill i didnt want this for them i swear on my soul clarissa gasped and leaned out the little window for a better view when she saw a band of invaders running forward with a log they disappeared beneath an overhang below she felt the building reverberate with a dull thud people in the great room screamed another thud and another followed by splintering wood the underworlds own pandemonium broke out below they were violating the sanctity of the creators abbey just as the prophet had said they would clarissa clutched her dress over her heart in both hands as she heard the slaughter begin anew below she shuddered uncontrollably they would soon come up the stairs and find her what was to happen to her was she to be marked with a ring through her lip and cast into slavery would she have the courage to fight and be killed rather than submit no she knew the answer would be no in the face of it she wanted to live she didnt want to be butchered like one of the people in the square had been or like poor dumb gus she feared death more than life she gasped as the door banged open the abbot burst into the small room clarissa neither young nor fit he huffed from running up the stairs his portly shape could not be disguised beneath his dull brown robes his round face was as ashen as a threedaydead corpse clarissa the books he panted we must run away take the books with us take them and hide she blinked dumbly at him the room of books would take days to pack and several wagons to lug them away there was nowhere to hide there was nowhere to run there was no way to escape through the throng of invaders it was a ludicrous command born of mad terror abbot there is no way we can escape he rushed to her and took her hands he licked his lips his eyes darted about they wont notice us pretend we are just going about our business they wont question us she didnt know how to answer such delusion but was denied an attempt three men in bloodsplattered leather and hides and fur stepped through the door they were so big and the room so small that it took them only three strides to close the distance to the abbot two had greasy curly matted hair the third was shaved bald but had a thick beard like the other two each wore a gold ring through his left nostril the one with the shiny head snatched the abbot by his fringe of white hair and yanked his head back the abbot squealed trade do you have a trade the abbot his head bent back so that he could look only at the ceiling spread his hands in supplication i am the abbot a man of prayer he licked his lips and added in a shout and books i care for the books books where are they the archives are in the athenaeum his head tilted back he pointed blindly clarissa knows clarissa can show you she works with them she can show you she cares for them no trade then prayer im a man of prayer ill pray to the creator and the good spirits for you youll see im a man of prayer no donation required ill pray for you no donation the man with the shaved head his sweatslicked muscles bulging pulled the abbots head back further and with a long knife sliced down through his throat clarissa felt warm blood splatter her face as the abbot exhaled through the gaping wound we dont need a man of prayer the invader said as he tossed the abbot aside clarissa stared in wideeyed horror as she saw blood spread under the abbots brown robes she had known him for nearly her whole life he had taken her in years ago and kept her from starving by giving her work as a scribe he had taken pity on her because she could find no husband and she had no skill except that she could read not many could read but clarissa could read and it provided her with bread that she had to endure the abbots pudgy hands and slobbering lips was an onus she had to abide if she wanted to keep her work and feed herself it hadnt been that way right from the first but after she came to know her work and feel safe in being able to meet her needs she came to understand that she had to tolerate things she didnt like long ago when she had begged him to stop and that hadnt worked she had threatened him he told her that she would be banished if she made such scandalous accusations against a respected abbot how would a single woman alone in the countryside survive he had asked what truly terrible things would she suffer then she supposed it wasnt the worst of things others went hungry and pride didnt fill their bellies some women suffered worse at the hands of men the abbot never struck her at least she had never wished him harm she only wished him to leave her be she never wished him harm he had taken her in and given her work and food others gave her only scorn the brute with the knife stepped to her startling her from her shock at seeing the abbot murdered he slid the knife behind a belt he gripped her chin with callused bloodstained fingers and turned her head side to side he looked her up and down he pinched her waist in evaluation she felt her face burn with humiliation at being scrutinized so he swung to one of the others ring her for a moment she didnt understand her knees began trembling as one of the burly men came forward and she realized what he had meant she feared to cry out she knew what they would do to her if she resisted she didnt want her throat slit like the abbot or her head bashed in like poor dumb gus dear creator she didnt want to die which one captain mallack the bald man looked into her eyes silver silver not copper silver a maniacal laugh cavorted through the back of her mind as the man gripped her lower lip between a thumb and knuckle these men these men who were experienced at judging the worth of flesh had just valued her more highly than her own people even if it was as a slave they had given her value she clenched shut the back of her throat to hold in the scream as she felt the pick stab into the margin of her lip he twisted the pick until it poked through she blinked trying to see through the tears of pain not gold she told herself of course rot gold but not copper either they thought her worth a silver ring some part of her was disgusted at her vainglory what else did she have now the man stinking of sweat blood and soot shoved the split silver ring through her lip she grunted in helpless pain he leaned in and closed the ring with his crooked yellow teeth she made no effort to wipe the dripping blood from her chin as captain mallack looked her in the eyes again you are now the property of the imperial order chapter clarissa thought she might faint how could a person be the property of anyone with shame she realized that she had let herself be little more to the abbot he had been kind to her after a fashion but in return he had viewed her as his property she knew these beasts were not going to be kind she knew what they were going to do with her and it was going to be something considerably worse than the abbots drunken impotent affections the look of steel in the mans eyes told her that they were men who would have no difficulty following through with what they wanted at least it was silver she didnt know why that mattered to her but it did you have books here captain mallack said are there prophecies among them the abbot should have kept his mouth closed but she didnt want to die to protect the books besides these men would tear the place apart and find them anyway the books werent hidden the city had been thought safe from invasion after all yes the emperor wants all books brought to him you will show us where they are clarissa swallowed of course hows it going boys came an amicable voice from behind the men everything in order you look to have matters well in hand the three men turned a vigorous older man filled the doorway a full head of straight white hair hung to his broad shoulders he was wearing high boots brown trousers and a ruffled white shirt under an open dark green vest the hem of his heavy dark brown cape hovered just above the floor a sword was sheathed in an elegant scabbard at his hip it was the prophet who are you captain mallack growled the prophet casually flipped his cape back over a shoulder a man in need of a slave he shouldered one of the men out of his way as he strode up to clarissa he grasped her jaw in a big hand and turned her head this way and that this one will do how much do you want for her the baldheaded captain mallack snatched a fistful of white shirt the slaves belong to the order they are all the property of the emperor the prophet scowled down at the hand on his shirt he slapped it away mind the shirt friend your hands are dirty theyre going to be bloody in a moment who are you whats your trade one of the other men put a knife to the prophets ribs answer captain mallacks question or die whats your trade the prophet dismissed the question with a flip of a hand not one you would be interested in now how much for the slave i can pay handsomely you boys might as well make something for yourselves out of it i never begrudge a man his profit we have all the plunder we want its here for the taking the captain glanced to the man who had put the ring through her lip kill him the prophet casually swept a staying hand before them i mean you no harm boys he leaned down a little closer to their faces wont you reconsider captain mallack opened his mouth but then he paused no words came out clarissa heard distressed liquid rumbling from the guts of the three men their eyes widened whats wrong the prophet asked is everything all right now how about my offer boys how much do you want for her the three mens faces twisted with discomfort clarissa smelled an unpleasant odor well captain mallack said in a strained voice i think he grimaced we ah we have to go the prophet bowed why thank you boys off with you then give my regards to my friend emperor jagang wont you but what about him one of the men asked the captain as they edged away someone else will be along shortly and kill him the captain said as all three of them shuffled bowlegged through the door the prophet turned to her his smile evaporating as he regarded her with a hawklike gaze well have you reconsidered my offer clarissa stood quivering she wasnt sure who she feared more the invaders or the prophet they would hurt her she didnt know what the prophet would do to her he might tell her how she was to die he had told her how a whole city was going to die and it was coming to pass she feared that if he said something he could make it happen prophets commanded magic who are you she whispered he bowed dramatically nathan rahl i have already told you that i am a prophet forgive me for overlooking the introductions but we dont exactly have a great deal of time his penetrating blue eyes frightened her but she made herself ask why do you want a slave well not for the same as they i dont want he snatched her arm and forced her to the window look out there look for the first time she lost control of the tears and they poured out in forlorn sobs dear creator hes not coming to help you no one can help those people now i can help you but you have to agree to help me in return ill not risk my life and lives of tens of thousands of others on you if you are of no use to me ill find another who would rather go with me than be a slave to these beasts she made herself look into his eyes will it be dangerous yes will i die helping you maybe maybe youll live if you die you will die doing something noble trying to prevent suffering worse than this cant you help them cant you stop this no what is done is done we can only strive to shape the futurewe cannot alter the past you have an inkling of the dangers in the future you once had a prophet living here and he wrote down some of his prophecies he was not an important prophet but he left them here where you fools view them as revelation of divine will they are not they are simply the words of potential the same as if i tell you that you have it within your power to choose your destiny you can stay and be a whore to this army or you can risk your life doing something worthwhile she trembled under his powerful grip on her arm i im afraid his azure eyes softened clarissa would it help if i told you that i am terrified you are you seem so sure of yourself i am only sure of what i can try to do to help now we must go to your archives before these men get a look at the books clarissa turned glad for the excuse to withdraw from his gaze down here ill show you the way she led him down the spiral stone steps at the back of the room they werent often used because they were so narrow and hard to negotiate the prophet who had constructed the abbey was a slight man and the stairs were built to suit him as tight as they were for her she couldnt imagine how this prophet could pass down them but he did on the dark landing below he lit a little flame above his palm she paused in astonishment wondering at why it did not burn his flesh he urged her to hurry on the low wooden door opened into a short hall the stairs at the center led down to the archives the door at the end of the hall led to the main room of the abbey beyond that door people were being murdered she turned down the stairs taking them two at a time nathan caught her arm when she slipped keeping her from a fall he made a gentle joke about that not being the danger hed warned her about in the dark room below he cast out a hand and the lamps hanging on wooden pilasters sprang to flame his brow drew down as he surveyed the shelves lining the walls of the room two sturdy but unexceptional tables provided a place to read and to write while he strode to the shelves on the left she frantically tried to think of a place she could hide from the men of the order there must be some place surely the invaders would leave sooner or later and hen she could come out and be safe she was afraid of the prophet he expected things of her she didnt know what those things were but she didnt think she had the courage to do them she just wanted to be left alone the prophet strode past the shelves stopping here and there to put a finger atop a spine and pull out a volume he didnt open the books he removed but tossed them on the floor in the center of the room and went on to the next the books he pulled out all contained prophecies he didnt select all the books of prophecy by any means but prophecies were the only ones he chose why me she asked as she watched him why do you want me he paused with a finger on a large leatherbound volume he watched her the way a hawk watched a mouse as he withdrew the book he took it to the pile of eight or ten already on the floor set it down and picked up one already there he paged through it after he stopped before her here read this she lifted the heavy book from his hands and read where he pointed should she go freely one ringed will be able to touch that long trusted into the winds alone long trusted into the winds alone the very idea of such an incomprehensible thing made her want to run one ringed she said does that mean me if you choose to go freely what if i choose to stay and hide then what he lifted an eyebrow then i will find another who wants to escape i offered you the chance first for my own reasons and because you can read im sure there are others who can read if i have to i will find another what is it one ringed can touch he took the book from her tremulous hands and snapped it shut dont try to understand what the words mean i know that you people try to do that but i am a prophet and i can tell you with a great deal of authority that such an endeavor is futile no matter what you think what you fear you will be wrong her resolve to leave with him weakened despite his seeming kindness in saving her up in the tower the prophet frightened her a man who knew things such as he could know frightened her they had put a silver ring through her lip not copper maybe that meant she would be treated better at least she would live they would feed her and she would live she wouldnt have to fear some terrifying unknown death she started when he spoke her name clarissa he said again go get some of the soldiers tell them that you are to lead them to the archives down here why why do you want me to get them do as i say tell them that captain mallack said you were to lead them down to the books if you have any trouble tell them he also said to get their sorry hides down to the books right now or the dream walker would pay them a visit they would regret but if i go up there her words trailed off in the grip of his gaze if you have trouble tell them those words and you will be all right lead them down here she opened her mouth to ask why he wanted them to come down to the books but his expression changed her mind she dashed up the stairs glad to be away from the prophet although she realized that she would have to face the brutes she paused before the door to the great room she could run away she remembered the abbot suggesting the same thing and she remembered knowing how foolish the idea was there was nowhere to run she had a silver ring maybe that would be good for something these men valued her at least that much she opened the door and took one step before the sight brought her to a wideeyed halt the double door to the street was splintered and broken in the floor was strewn with the bodies of men who had run to the abbey for shelter the great room was packed with invaders among the bloody bodies of the dead the women were being raped clarissa stood frozen her mouth agape men stood in groups waiting their turn the largest groups were for the women with gold rings the things being done to those women brought vomit up into clarissas mouth she covered her mouth and forced herself to swallow it she stood transfixed unable to turn her eyes away from a naked manda perlin one of the young women who had frequently tormented her manda had married a wealthy middleaged man who lent money and invested in cargos her husband rupert perlin lay close by his throat so viciously cut that his head had been nearly severed from his body manda wailed in terror as the brutes held her down the men roared with laughter at her wails but they could hardly be heard above all the noise clarissa felt her eyes water these were not men they were wild animals a man snatched clarissa by the hair another hooked her leg with an arm they laughed as her scream joined all the others before she landed on her back they had her dress up no she cried out they laughed at her as the others were laughing at manda noi was sent good one man said i was tired of waiting my turn he smacked her when she fought off his hands the pain of the wallop stunned her and made her ears hum she had a silver ring that meant something she had a silver ring she heard a woman not two feet away grunt as a man flopped down on her back her silver ring did her no good either mallack clarissa screamed captain mallack sent me the man put a fist in her hair and crushed a grimy bristly kiss to her lips her wound from the ring through her lip sang with pain and she could feel blood gush anew across her chin my thanks to captain mallack he aid he bit her ear making her scream again as the other man pawed at her smallclothes she tried desperately to remember what the prophet had told her to say message she cried out captain mallack sent me with a message he said im to lead you down to the books he said to tell you to get your sorry hides down to the books right now or the dream walker would pay you a visit you would regret the men cursed obscenely then pulled her to her feet by her hair she smoothed her dress down with trembling hands the half dozen men around her laughed one slid a hand back up between her legs well dont just stand there enjoying it bitch get going lead the way her legs had all the starch of wet rope and she had to hold the rail on the way down the stairs visions of what she had seen flashed through her mind in a jumble as she led the half dozen men down to the archives the prophet met them at the door as if he were about to leave there you are about time the prophet said in an irritable voice he gestured back to the room everything is in order start packing them up before anything happens or the emperor will be using us as firewood the men frowned in confusion they glanced about the room in the center where clarissa had seen the prophet stack the books he had taken from the shelves there was only a stain of white ash the empty places where he had pulled out books had been closed up so it didnt appear that any had been removed i smell smoke one of the men said the prophet thunked the mans skull idiot half the city is ablaze at last you begin to smell smoke now get to it i have to report on the books i found one of them snatched clarissas arm as the prophet started leading her out leave her well be needing some entertainment the prophet glared at them shes a scribe you fool she knows all the books we have more important work for her than amusing you lazy oafs there are women enough when you finish your work or would you rather have me report you to captain mallack even though they were confused by who nathan was they decided to get to work nathan closed the door behind him he pushed clarissa on ahead on the steps alone with him in the silence she halted leaning against the railing for support she felt lightheaded and sick to her stomach he put his fingers to her cheek clarissa listen to me slow your breathing think slow it down or you will faint tears coursed down her face she lifted a hand toward the room she had gone to to get the men i i saw i know what you saw he said in a soft voice she slapped him why did you send me up there you didnt need those men you think you will be able to hide you wont they will search every hole in this city when they are finished they will burn it all to the ground there will be nothing of renwold left but i i could im afraid of going with you i dont want to die i wanted you to know what will happen to you should you choose to stay here clarissa you are a lovely young woman he pointed with his chin toward the great hall believe me you do not want to be here to experience what is going to happen to the women here over the next three days and then as slaves to the imperial order please believe me you dont want that how can they do such things how can they this is the unspeakable reality of war there are no rules of conduct except those the aggressor makes or those the winner can enforce you can either fight against this or submit to it cant cant you do anything to help these people no he whispered i can only help you but im not going to waste precious time doing it unless you are worth saving the dead here died a quick death terrible as it was it was quick vast numbers of people many times as many people as lived in this city are about to die horrible suffering lingering deaths i cant help these people but i can try to help those others is freedom worth having life worth living if i dont try it is time for you to decide if you will help if your life is worth living worth the creators gift of your soul visions of what was happening up in the great hall out in the streets and to her whole city flashed chaotically through her mind she felt as if she were already dead if she could have a chance to help others and to live again she must take it this was the only chance she would get she knew it was she wiped the tears from her eyes and the blood from her chin yes ill help you i swear on my soul that i will do what you ask if it means a chance to save lives and a chance at my freedom even if i ask you to do something that you fear even if you think you will die doing it yes his warm smile made her heart lift surprisingly he drew her to him and gave her a comforting hug she had been a child the last time she had been comforted with a hug it made her weep nathan put his fingers to her lip and she felt a warm sensation of succor her terror eased her memories of what she had seen now gave her the determination to stop the men who did this to prevent them from visiting suffering on others her mind filled with hope that she might do something important that would help other people to be free too clarissa felt her lip after nathan had taken his hand away it no longer throbbed the wound was healed around the ring thank youprophet nathan he ran a hand down her hair we must go the longer we stay here the greater the chance of never getting away clarissa nodded im ready not yet he cupped his big hands to her cheeks we must walk through the city through it all to get away you have seen too much already i dont want you to see any more or hear any more i would spare you that much at least but i dont see how we can ever get past the order you let me worry about that for now i am going to put a spell over you you will be blind so that you dont have to see any more of what is happening to your city and you will be deaf so that you dont have to hear any more of the suffering and death that now possesses this place she suspected that he feared she might panic and get them caught she didnt know that he might not be right if you say so nathan i will do as you say standing there in the dim light two steps below her so that his face was closer to hers he gave her a warm smile for as old as he was he was a strikingly handsome man i have chosen the right woman you will do well i pray the good spirits grant you freedom in return for your help holding his hand as they walked was her only connection to the world she couldnt see the slaughter she couldnt hear the screams she couldnt smell the fires yet she knew that those things had to be happening around her in her silent world she prayed as she walked prayed that the good spirits would keep safe the souls of those who had died here this day and for those who still lived she prayed for the good spirits to give them strength he guided her around rubble and around the heat of fires he held her hand tight when she stumbled over debris it seemed they walked for hours through the ruins of the vast city occasionally they stopped and she lost the connection to his hand as she stood still and alone in her silent world she could neither see nor hear so she didnt know the exact reason for the stop but she suspected that nathan was having to talk their way out sometimes those stops dragged on and on and her heart raced at the thought of what unseen danger nathan warded sometimes the stop was followed by his arm around her waist pulling her into a run she felt confident in his care and comfort too her hip sockets ached from walking and her weary feet throbbed he at last placed both hands on her shoulders turned her and helped her sit she felt cool grass under her her vision suddenly returned along with her hearing and sense of smell rolling green hills spread away before her she looked around and saw only countryside there were no people anywhere the city of renwold was nowhere to be seen she dared to feel the budding of sweet relief not only at having escaped the slaughter but at having escaped her old life the terror had burned so deep into her soul that she felt as if she had been recast in a furnace of fear and had come out a shiny new ingot hardened for what lay ahead whatever she had to face it could be no worse than what she would have faced had she stayed if she had chosen to stay it would have been a turning away from helping others and from herself she didnt know what he was going to ask her to do but every day of freedom she had was one she wouldnt otherwise have had if not for the prophet thank you nathan for choosing me he was staring off in thought and didnt seem to hear her chapter sister verna turned to the commotion and saw a scout leaping from his lathered horse before it had skidded to a stop in the near darkness the scout panted trying to catch his breath at the same time as he relayed his report to the general the generals tense posture visibly relaxed at the report he gestured in a jaunty fashion for his officers to stand down their concern too she couldnt hear the scouts report but she knew what it would be she didnt have to be a prophet to know what the scout would have seen the fools she had told him as much the smiling general reibisch approached her his heavy eyebrows arched with his good humor when he came into the ring of firelight his grayishgreen eyes searched her out prelate there you are good news verna her mind on other more important matters loosened the shawl around her shoulders dont tell me general my sisters and i wont have to spend the whole night calming nervous soldiers and casting spells to tell you where panicked men have run off to hide while they await the end of the world he scratched his rustcolored beard ah well i do appreciate your help prelate but no you wont youre right as usual she snorted an itoldyouso the scout had been watching from atop the hill and from there could see the moonrise before any of them down in the valley my man said that the moon didnt rise red tonight i know you told me it wouldnt and that three nights of it was all there would be but i cant help being relieved to know things are back to normal prelate back to normal hardly im glad general that we will all get a good nights sleep for a change i hope too that your men have learned a lesson and that in the future when i tell them that the underworld isnt about to swallow us all they will have a little more faith he smiled sheepishly yes prelate i believed you of course but some of these men are more superstitious than is healthy for their hearts magic scares them she leaned a little closer to the man and lowered her voice it should he cleared his throat yes prelate well i guess we better all get some sleep your messengers havent returned yet have they no he traced a finger down the lower part of the white scar running from his left temple to his jaw i dont expect theyve even reached aydindril yet verna sighed she wished she could have heard word first it might have made her decision easier i suppose not what do you think prelate whats your advice north she stared off watching the sparks from the fire spiral up into the darkness and feeling its heat on her face she had more important decisions to make i dont know richards exact words to me were head north theres an army of a hundred thousand dharan soldiers heading south looking for kahlan youll have more protection with them and they with you tell general reibisch that she is safe with me it would have made things easier if he would have said for sure he didnt say for us to go north back to aydindril but it was implied im sure he thought thats what we would do however i take seriously your advice in matters such as this he shrugged im a soldier i think like a soldier richard had gone to tanimura to rescue kahlan and had managed to destroy the palace of the prophets along with its vault of prophecies before emperor jagang could capture it richard had said that he had to return to aydindril at once and that he didnt have time to explain but only he and kahlan had the magic required that would allow their immediate return he said he couldnt take the rest of them he had told her to go north to meet up with general reibisch and his dharan army general reibisch was reluctant to return north he reasoned that with a force this large already this far south it would be strategically advantageous to blunt an invasion of the new world before it could drive into the populous areas general i have no argument with your motives but i fear that you underestimate the threat from the information ive managed to gather the imperial orders forces are large enough to crush even an army of this size without losing stride i dont doubt your mens ability but by sheer numbers alone the order will swallow you whole i understand your reasoning but even with as many men as you have it wont be enough and then we wouldnt have them to lend their weight to a gathering of a larger force that might have a chance against the order the general smiled reassuringly prelate what you say makes sense ive listened to reasoned arguments like yours my whole career the thing is war isnt a reasonable pursuit sometimes you simply have to take advantage of what the good spirits give you and throw yourself into the fray sounds like a good way to be annihilated well ive been doing it a long tine and im still alive just because you choose to meet the enemy that doesnt mean you have to stick your chin out and let him have a good swing at it verna squinted at the man what have you in mind seems to me that were already here messengers can move a great deal faster than an army i think we should move to a more secure location one more defendable and sit tight where if we go east into the high country of southern dhara then we could be in a better position to react i know the country there if the order tries to come up into the new world through dhara the easy way through the kern river valley then we are there to stop them we can fight on more equal terms in tighter country like that just because you have more men that doesnt mean you can use them all a valley is only so wide what if they go more to the west as they move north skirt the mountains and head up through the wilds then we have this army to sweep in behind them when our other forces are sent south to meet them the enemy would have to split their force and fight against us on two fronts on top of that it would limit their options by making it difficult for them to move freely verna considered his words she had read of battles in the old books and understood the sense of his strategy it seemed more prudent than she had thought at first the man was bold but he was no fool with our troops in a strategic location he went on we can send messengers to aydindril and the peoples palace in dhara we can get reinforcements from dhara and from the lands of the midlands that join with us and lord rahl can send us his instructions if the order invades well then were already here to know about it information is a valuable commodity in war richard may not like it that you hunker down here instead of returning to protect aydindril lord rahl is a reasonable man verna interrupted with a guffaw richard reasonable now you stretch my credulity general he frowned at her as i was saying lord rahl is a reasonable man he told me that he wants me to speak up with my advice when i think it important i think its important he considers my advice on matters of war the messengers are already on their way with my letter if he doesnt like my advice then he can say so and order me north and i will go but until i know for sure that he wishes it i think we should do our job and defend the new world from the imperial order i asked your advice prelate because you command magic i dont know anything about magic if you or the sisters of the light have something to say that would be important to us in our struggle then im listening were on the same side you know verna relented forgive me general i guess i sometimes forget that she offered him a smile the last few months have turned my life upside down lord rahl has turned the whole world upside down he has reordered everything she smiled to herself that he has she looked back at the generals grayishgreen eyes your plan makes senseat the very worst it would slow the order but id like to talk to warren first he he sometimes has surprising insights wizards are like that the general nodded magic is not my part we have lord rahl for that and you too of course verna repressed a laugh at the idea of richard being the one to wield magic for them the boy could hardly get out of his own way where magic was concerned no that wasnt entirely true richard often did surprising things with his gift the problem was that it usually surprised him too still he was a war wizard the only to be born in the last three thousand years and all their hopes hung on his leadership in this war against the imperial order richards heart and his determination were in the right place he would do his best it was up to the rest of them to help him and to keep him alive the general shifted his weight and scratched under his chainmail sleeve prelate the order claims to want to end magic in this world but we all know that they use magic in their attempt to crush us that they do she knew emperor jagang had most of the sisters of the dark at his beck and call he had young wizards to do his bidding too he had also captured a number of the sisters of the light and dominated them through his ability as a dream walker it was this that nettled her conscience as prelate it was ultimately up to her to see to the safety of the sisters of the light some of her sisters were anything but safe in the hands of jagang well prelate seeing as how their troops are likely to be accompanied by those with magic im wondering if i can count on you and your sisters to be the counter to them lord rahl said youll have more protection with them and they with you that sounds to me like he intended you to use your magic to help us against the orders army verna would like to think the general wrong she would like to think that sisters of the light those charged with doing the creators work would be above bringing harm to anyone general reibisch i dont like it however im afraid that i concur if we lose this war we all lose not simply our troops on the field of battle all free people will be slaves to the order if jagang wins the sisters of the light will be executed we all must fight or die the order would not want to fall into your plans so conveniently they may try to sneak past undetectedfarther to the west possibly even to the east of you the sisters can be of use in detecting the movements of the enemy should they advance into the new world and try to slip past you if those with magic mask the orders movements from you our sisters will know it we will be your eyes if fighting comes the enemy will use magic to try to defeat you we will have to use our power to thwart that magic the general considered the flames for a moment he glanced off toward the men bedding down for the night thank you prelate i know that decision cant be easy for you since youve all been with us ive come to know the sisters as gentle women verna barked a laugh general you have not come to know us at all the sisters of the light are many things but gentle is not one of them she flicked her wrist her dacra sprang into her hand a dacra resembled a knife but had a sharpened rod instead of a blade verna twirled the dacra i have had to kill men before reflected flashes of firelight sparkled and danced as she spur the weapon with graceful ease walking it over her knuckles and back i can assure you general i was anything but gentle he lifted an eyebrow a knife in talented hands such as yours is trouble but its hardly a match for the weapons of war she smiled politely this is a weapon possessing deadly magic if you see one of these coming for you run it only must penetrate your flesheven if its your little fingerand you will be dead before you can blink he straightened and his chest grew with a deep breath thanks for the warning and thanks for your help prelate im glad to have you on our side i regret that jagang has some of our sisters of the light under his control they can do the same as i maybe more she gave him a reassuring pat on the shoulder when she saw that his face had paled good night general reibisch sleep wellthe red moons are gone verna watched the general make a zigzag course through his officers speaking with them checking on his men and issuing orders after he had disappeared into the darkness she turned to her tent deep in thought she idly cast her han and lit the candles inside the small field tent the men had provided for her use with the moon up annalinathe real prelatewould be waiting verna pried the little journey book from its secret pouch in her belt journey books had magic that allowed a message written in one to appear simultaneously in its twin prelate annalina had the twin to vernas she sat crosslegged on her blankets and opened the book in her lap there was a message waiting verna pulled a candle closer and bent in the dim light to better see the writing in the journey book verna we have trouble here we finally caught up with nathan at least who we thought was nathan the man we had been pursuing turned out not to be nathan nathan tricked us he is gone and we dont know where he went verna sighed she had thought it had sounded too good to be true when ann told her that they were closing in on the prophet nathan left us a message the message is more trouble than the thought of nathan being on the loose he said that he had important businessthat one of our sisters was going to do something very stupid and that he must stop her if he could we have no idea where he went he also confirmed what you told me warren said that the red moon means jagang has invoked a bound fork prophecy nathan said that zedd and i must go to the jocopo treasure and that if we wasted time going after him instead we would all die i believe him verna we must talk if you are there reply i will be waiting verna pulled the stylus from the spine of the journey book moonrise was the time they had agreed upon to communicate through the journey books if they needed to she bent closer and wrote in her book am here ann what happened are you all right in a moment words began appearing in the book its a long story and i dont have time for it now but sister roslyn was hunting nathan too she was killed along with at least eighteen innocent people we cant be sure of the true number consumed in the light spell vernas eyes widened at hearing that people were killed so she wanted to ask what they were doing casting such a dangerous web but decided not to ask as she read on first of all verna we need to know if you have any idea what the jocopo treasure is nathan didnt explain verna put a finger to her lips as she squeezed her eyes closed trying to remember she had heard the name before she had been on her journey to the new world for twenty years and she had heard of it there ann i think i recall hearing that the jocopo were a people living somewhere in the wilds if i recall correctly they are all deadexterminated in a war i believe all traces of them were destroyed the wilds you say verna are you sure it was the wilds yes wait a moment while i tell zedd this news the minutes dragged by as verna watched the blank place at the end of the writing at last words began to appear zedd has succumbed to a bout of loud cursing and arm flailing he is swearing oaths about what he intends to do to nathan i am quite sure that he will find most of his intentions to be physically impossible the creator is humbling me for complaining to him that nathan was incorrigible i think i am being taught a lesson as to the true meaning of incorrigible verna the wilds are a big place any idea where in the wilds no sorry i only recall hearing the jocopo mentioned once somewhere in southern kelton i once admired a pottery relic in a shop of curiosities it was purported by the proprietor to have been made by a disappeared culture from the wilds he called them the jocopo thats all i know i was hunting richard at the time not vanished cultures i will check with warren he might know something from the books thank you verna if you find anything send word at once now do you have any idea what stupid thing it is that nathan thinks a sister is going to do no we are all here with the dharan army general reibisch wants to stay to the south so as to thwart the order should they invade we await word from richard but there are sisters of the light being held captive by jagang who can tell what he will make them do ann did nathan say anything of the bound fork prophecy warren might be able to help if you would tell me the words of the prophecy there was a pause before anns writing began again nathan didnt tell us the words he said that the spirits denied him access to its meaning he did say though that the victim of the double bind in the prophecy is richard verna gasped in some saliva she coughed violently trying to get it back out of her lungs her eyes watering as she coughed she held the book up and read the last message again she finally got her lungs and throat clear ann you wrote richard did you really mean richard yes verna closed her eyes with a whispered prayer fighting down the flutter of panic anything else verna wrote not for now your information about the jocopo will help we will be able to narrow our search now and know the questions to ask thank you if you learn more let me know i had better go zedd is complaining of lifethreatening hunger ann is everything all right with you and the first wizard ducky he has his collar off you took off his collar before you find nathan why would you do such a thing i didnt he did vernas eyes widened at this news she feared to ask how he could accomplish such a thing so she didnt verna thought she could read in anns message that it was a sore subject and yet he is going with you verna i am not quite sure who is going with whom but for now we both understand the dire nature of nathans warning nathan isnt always irrational i know no doubt that old man is right now smiling at a woman trying to make her swoon and fall into his bed verna wrote may the creator hold you safely in his care prelate ann was really the prelate but had named verna prelate when she and nathan had faked their deaths and gone on an important mission for now everyone thought ann and nathan dead and that verna was the prelate thank you verna one other thing zedd is concerned for adie he wishes you to take her aside and let her know that he is alive and well but in the hands of a crazy woman ann do you wish me to tell the sisters that you are alive and well the message took a moment to resume no verna not just now it helps you and them that they have you as prelate with what nathan has told us and what we must do it would be inadvisable to tell them that i live only to have to turn around and tell them that i am dead after all verna understood the wilds were a dangerous place that was where verna had had to kill people and she hadnt been trying to get information out of them she had been trying to avoid contact with people there verna had been young and fast at the time ann was nearly as old as nathan but she was a sorceress and she did have a wizard with her while zedd was not young either he was far from helpless the fact that he had managed to remove his radahan spoke volumes about his ability ann dont say that you be careful you and zedd must protect each other we all need you back thank you child take care of the sisters of the light prelate who knows i may want them back someday verna smiled at the comfort of consulting with ann and at her humor in dire circumstance verna wished she had a sense of humor like ann the smile faded when she remembered that ann had told her that richard was the victim named in the deadly prophecy she thought about what nathan had warmed that one of the sisters was going to do something stupid she wished that nathan had been more specific he could mean almost anything by stupid verna wouldnt be inclined to believe just anything nathan said but ann knew him much better than did verna she thought about the sisters jagang was holding some were sisters of the light and a few were vernas dear friends and had been since they were novices the five of themchristabel amelia janet phoebe and vernahad grown up together at the palace of those verna had named phoebe one of her administrators only phoebe was with them now christabel vernas dearest friend had turned to the keeper of the underworld she had become a sister of the dark and had been captured by jagang the last two of vernas friends amelia and janet had been taken by jagang too janet had remained loyal to the light verna knew but she wasnt sure about amelia if she was still loyal verna pressed trembling fingers to her lips at the thought of her two friends two sisters of the light being slaves to the dream walker in the end that decided her verna peeked into warrens tent unbidden a smile came to her lips when she saw his shape on his blankets in the darkness probably pondering some young prophets thoughts she smiled at how much she loved him and at knowing how much he loved her verna and warren having both grown up at the palace of the prophets had known each other nearly their whole lives her gift as a sorceress was destined to be used to help train young wizards while his gift as a wizard destined him toward prophecy their paths didnt cross in a serious way until after verna returned to the palace with richard because of richard and his huge impact on life at the palace events brought verna and warren together and their friendship grew after verna was named prelate during their struggle against the sisters of the dark she and warren had depended on each other for their very lives it was during that struggle that they had become more than friends after all those years in the palace only now had they really found each other and found love at the thought of what she had to tell him her smile faded warren she whispered are you awake yes came a quiet reply before he could have a chance to rise and take her into his arms and she lost her nerve she stepped into his tent and blurted it out warren ive made my decision ill have no argument from you do you understand this is too important he was silent so she went on amelia and janet are my friends besides being sisters of the light in enemy hands i love them they would do the same for me i know they would im going after them and any others i can rescue i know he whispered he knew what did that mean silence dragged on in the darkness verna frowned it wasnt like warren not to argue about such a thing she had been ready for his argument but not his calm acceptance using her han the force of life and spirit through which the magic of the gift worked verna lit a flame in her palm arid passed it to a candle he was huddled on his blanket his knees pulled up and his head resting in his hands she knelt down before him warren whats wrong his face came up his blue eyes were rimmed with red his face was sickly pale verna clutched his arm warren you dont look well whats wrong verna he whispered i have come to realize that being a prophet is not the wonder i had imagined warren was the same age as verna but looked younger because he had remained at the palace of the prophets under its spell that retarded aging while she went on her twentyoddyear journey to find richard warren didnt look so young at the moment warren had only recently had his first vision as a prophet he had told her that the prophecy came as a vision of events accompanied by words of the prophecy the words were what were written down but it was the vision that was the true prophecy that was why it took a prophet to truly understand the meaning of the words they invoked the vision that was being passed on from another prophet hardly anyone knew this everyone tried to understand prophecy by the words verna now knew from what warren had told her that this method was inadequate at best and dangerous at worst prophecy was meant to be read by other prophets she frowned have you had a vision another prophecy warren ignored the question and asked one of his own verna do we have any radahan with us the collars around the young men who escaped with us are the only ones we didnt have time to bring any extras why he put his head back in his hands verna shook a finger at him warren if this is some trick to try to get me to stay here with you it wont work do you hear me it wont work im going and im going alone thats final verna he whispered i have to go with you no its too dangerous i love you too much i wont risk anyone else if i have to i will order you as prelate to stay here i will warren his head rose again verna im dying icy goose bumps tingled across her aims and thighs what warren im having the headaches the headaches from the gift verna was choked silent with the realization of the deadly nature of what he had just said the whole reason the sisters of the light took boys born with the gift was to save their lives unless schooled the gift could kill him the headaches were a manifestation of the fatal nature of the gift going awry besides providing the sisters with control over the young wizards the most important function of the collar was its magic which protected the life of the boy until he could learn to control his gift because of all that had happened verna had taken warrens collar off long before it was customary but warren youve studied a long lime you know how to control your gift you shouldnt need the radahan for protection any longer if i was an ordinary wizard that may be true but my gift is for prophecy nathan was the only prophet at the palace in centuries we dont know how the magic works in a prophet i only recently had my first prophecy it signifies a new level of my ability now im having the headaches verna was suddenly in a panic her eyes were tearing she threw her arms around him warren ill stay i wont go ill help you well do something maybe we could take a collar off one of the boys and you could share it that might work well try that first his arms pulled her tight that wont work verna a sudden thought flashed into her mind making her gasp with relief it was so simple warren its all right it is i just realized what we can do listen to me verna i know what she shushed him she held him by the shoulders and looked into his blue eyes she brushed back his wavy blond hair warren listen its simple the reason the sisters were founded was to help boys born with the gift we were given radahan to protect them while we teach them to control their gift verna i know all that but listen we have the collars to help them because we dont have wizards who can do what is needed in the past greedy wizards refused to help those born with the gift an experienced wizard can join with your mind and pass on the protection show you how to put the gift right its simple for a wizard to do but not a sorceress we need only to visit a wizard verna pried the journey book from her belt and held it before his eyes we have a wizardzedd all we have to do is talk to ann and have her and zedd meet us zedd can help you and then youll be all right warren stared into her eyes verna it wont work dont say that you dont know you dont know warren yes i do i have had another prophecy verna sat back on her heels you have what was it warren pressed his fingertips to his temples she could see that he was in pain she knew that the pain of the headaches from the gift were excruciating in the end if not corrected they were fatal verna now you listen to me for a change i have had a prophecy the words arent important the meaning is he took his hands away from his head and looked her in the eye in that moment he looked very old to her you must do what you plan and go after the sisters the prophecy didnt say whether you will succeed but i must go with you if i do anything else i will die its a forked prophecyan eitheror prophecy she cleared her throat but surely there must be something no if i stay or if i try to go to zedd i will die the prophecy doesnt say that if i go with you i will live but it does say that going with you is my only chance end of discussion if you make me stay i will die if you try to take me to zedd i will die if you want me to have a chance to live then you must take me with you choose prelate verna swallowed as a sister of the light a sorceress she could tell by the distinctive murky cast to his eyes that he was in the pain of a headache from the gift she also knew that warren would not lie to her about a prophecy he might pull some trick to go with her but he would not lie about a prophecy he was a prophet prophecy was his life maybe his death she took his hand up in hers get some supplies together get two horses i have to go tell adie something and then i must talk to my advisors let them know what to do while were gone verna kissed his hand i wont let you die warren i love you too much well do this together im not sleepy lets not wait till morning we can be on our way in an hour warren drew her to him in a thankful embrace chapter from the solace of the shadows he watched as the middleaged man closed the door and stood in the dim hall a moment to tuck in his shirt over his potbelly the man chortled to himself and then thumped off down the hall to disappear as he descended the stairs it was late it would be several hours yet before the sun was up with the walls painted red the candles set before silvered reflectors at either end of the narrow hall were able to provide precious little useful light he liked it that waythe way the comforting cloak of shadows in the pit of the night lent its mood to such nefarious needs debauchery was best indulged in the right in the darkness he stood awhile in the quiet obscurity of the hall savoring his desire it had been too long he let his lust have rein and felt its glorious wanton ache fill him he closed his mouth and breathed through his nose to better experience the range of aromas both transcendent and abiding he put his shoulders back and used his abdominal muscles to draw slower deeper breaths he counted a variety of scents from tie smells men carried in and took away with them back to their own lives the smells of their workhorse clay grain dust the lanolin soldiers used in the care of leather uniforms and the oil they used for sharpening their weapons to a redolent wisp of almond oil and the stale dirt and wet wood of the building it was an afferent feast that was only just beginning he glanced the length of the hall again checking he heard no sounds of lust coming from any of the other rooms it was late even for an establishment like this the fat potbellied man was probably the last of them except for himself he liked to be last the evidence of the events before he arrived and the lingering smells gave him a rush of sensation hi senses were always heightened in his aroused state and he valued all the details he closed his eyes for a moment feeling the throbbing of his need she would help him she would sate his desire that was what they were here for they offered themselves willingly other men like the potbellied man simply threw themselves on a woman grunted in a moment of satisfaction and it was over they never gave thought to what the woman was feeling to what she needed to giving her satisfaction those men were no more than rutting beasts ignorant of all the details that could add to the climax for both their minds eye was too focused on the object of their lust they didnt see the integral parts of the wider setting that led to true satisfaction it was the fleeting the ephemeral that created a transcendent experience through uncommon perception and his singular awareness he could net such evanescent events and commemorate them forever in his memory thus giving the transient nature of satisfaction permanence he felt fortunate that he could see such things and that he at least could bring fulfillment to women at last he took a settling breath and then advanced silently down the hall marking the way the shadows and tiny lays of light mirrored off the silvered candle reflectors slipped across his body he thought that if he was mindful he might someday be able to feel the touch of the light and of the dark without knocking he opened the door the potbellied man had come from and stepped into her room gratified to see that it was nearly as dim as the hall with a finger he shut the door behind the door the woman was just pulling her panties up her legs she spread her knees and squatted a bit drawing them up tight against herself when her skyblue eyes finally turned up to look at him her only reaction was to toss the sides of her robe together over the rest of her bare body and casually flip the silk belt together into a loose knot the air carried the odor of the hot coals in the warming pan under the bed the weak but clean aroma of soap the light fragrance of body powder and the cloying scent of a sickly sweet perfume but pervading it all like the darkness that shaped shadows was the lingering smack of lust pointed with the arresting scent of semen the room had no windows the bed covered with stained rumpled sheets was pushed into the far corner even though it wasnt large the bed took up a good part of the room against the wall beside the head of the bed sat a small simply made pine chest probably for personal items on the wall over the head of the bed hung an ink drawing of two people coupled in passion it left nothing to the imagination a washbasin sat centered on a wobblylooking cabinet beside her behind the door in its edge the white washbasin had a stained kidneyshaped chip with a crack that looked like an artery coming from the kidney the cloth hanging over the side of the basin still dripped the milky water in the basin gently sloshed from side to side she had just washed herself they each had their own habits some didnt bother to wash but they were usually the older unattractive ones who were paid little and cared little he had noticed that the younger prettier more expensive women washed after each man he preferred the ones who washed before he came to them but in the end his lust overrode such trivial matters he idly wondered if those he had been with who were not professionals ever gave thought to such things probably not he doubted that others pondered such curious particulars others gave little thought to the texture of details other women women looking for love satisfied him but not in the same way they always wanted to talk and to be wooed they wanted he wanted in the end his want overrode what he would prefer and he gave them some of what they wanted before his needs could be satisfied i thought i was finished for the night she said her words came out silky smooth with a pleasant pert lilt but bore no real interest at the prospect of another man this late i think im the last he said trying to sound apologetic so as not to anger her it wasnt as satisfying if they were angry he liked nothing more than when they were eager to please she sighed all right then she showed no fear at having a man simply walk into her room without knocking even though she was hardly wearing anything nor did she make any demands for money silas latherton downstairs with his cudgel and a long knife in his belt made sure the women had nothing to fear he also didnt let anyone go up the stairs unless they paid in advance so the women didnt have to be bothered with the trouble of collecting money it insured that he rather than they kept control of the income and its distribution her short straight blond hair was disheveled from mister potbelly no doubt but he found its disorder alluring it was a suggestive indication of what she had just been doing it lent her an erotic looka look he very much liked her body was shapely and firm with long legs and wonderfully formed breasts at least what he had seen of her body before she had thrown closed her robe he would see it again and could wait the anticipation added to his excitement unlike her other men he was in no rush to have it over once it began it would be over all too quickly he could never stop himself once it began for the moment he would relish all the little details so that he could capture them in his memory for all time she was more than simply pretty he decided she was a creature possessed of features that would fire mens minds with obsessive memories of her and make them return time and time again to try if only for fleeting moments to possess her the confidence with which she carried her body told him that she knew this the frequency with which men spent money to have her was a constant reinforcement of that confidence those features though no matter their grace and haunting beauty had an acidic edge to them a harshness that betrayed her true character no doubt other men saw only the sweet face and never noticed he noticed he noticed such subtle things and he had seen this detail often it always looked the same it was a baseness her fair features couldnt hide from one such as himself are you new he asked even though he knew she was first day here she said he knew that too aydindril is big enough to mean clients for me but with a huge army here its all the better blue eyes around here arent all that common my blue eyes remind the dharan soldiers of girls from home so many extra men mean women like me are in greater demand and it insures a better wage she allowed herself a small smug knowing smile if you couldnt afford it you wouldnt be up here so cut the complaints he had only meant to make an observation and regretted the way she took it her voice betrayed an underlying acerbic temperament he sought to smooth away the ripple of her displeasure with him soldiers can sometimes get rough with a young woman as attractive as you the compliment didnt register in her skyblue eyes she had probably heard it so often that she was numb to such praise im glad you came to silas latherton he went on he doesnt let any of his clients rough up the young ladies youll be safe here under his roof im glad you came here thanks her tone carried no warmth but the ripple at least had been smoothed im glad to hear his reputation is known to his clients i got slammed around once i didnt like it besides the pain i couldnt work for a month that must have been terrible the pain i mean she tilled her head toward the bed you going to take off your clothes or what he said nothing but gestured to her robe he watched her slip loose the knot from the satin belt have it your way she said as she shrugged the robe open just enough to tempt him into getting on with it id like id like you to enjoy it too she lifted an eyebrow darling dont you worry about me ill enjoy it just fine youll no doubt thrill me but youre the one who paid for it lets just worry about your pleasure he liked to hear the tempered thread of sarcasm in her voice she cloaked it well with a breathy tone and others might have missed it but he had been listening for it carefully slowly one at a time he placed four small gold coins on the washstand beside her it was ten times what silas latherton downstairs charged for his womens company and probably thirty times what he gave her for each man she watched the coins as he withdrew his hand as if counting them to herself to make sure she was seeing what she thought she was seeing it was a great deal of money she gave him a questioning look he liked the twitch of confusion in her eyes women like this werent often confused by money but she was young and probably never had a man bestow such largess on her before he liked it that it impressed her he knew that few things would id like you to enjoy yourself im wiling to pay to see you enjoying yourself darling for that much youll remember my screams until youre an old man of that he was sure she smiled her best smile and slipped off the robe gazing at him with her big skyblue eyes she blindly hung the robe on a peg in the back of the door she stroked his chest and then circled her arms around his waist gently but deliberately she squashed her firm breasts against him so what is it you want darling some nice clawmarks down your back to make your young lady jealous no he said no i just want to see you enjoying it youre so fair of face and figure i think that if youre paid will enough youll enjoy your part thats all i want to know that youre enjoying yourself she eyed the coins and then smiled up at him oh i will darling i promise im a very talented whore that was what i was hoping i want you to be so pleased with my charms that you will want to return to my bed you seem to be reading my mind my name is rose she whispered in her breathy voice a name as beautiful as you are and as unoriginal and yours what should i call you when you call on me regularly as im already aching for you to do i like the name youve already given me i like the sound of it on your lips she licked her lips for him glad to meet you darling he slipped a finger under the waist of her panties can i have these she ran her fingers down his belly performing a moan at the feel of him its the end of a long day these arent exactly clean i have some clean ones in my trunk for what youve paid you can have as many of them as you wish darling you can have them all if you wish these will do fine i only need these she smirked up at him i see like that is it he didnt answer why dont you take them off me she teased take your prize id like to watch you do it without hesitation she slipped them down her legs as dramatically as she could she pressed herself up against him again and looking into his eyes stroked his cheek with her panties she smiled wickedly and then pushed them into his hand here you go just for you darling just the way you like themwith the scent of rose he worked them in his fingers feeling the warmth of her still in them she stretched up to kiss him if he hadnt known better known what she was he might have thought she wanted him more than anything else in life but he would please her what do you want me to do for you she whispered name it and its yoursand i dont make that offer to my other men but i want you so badly anything just tell me he could smell the sweat of the other men on her he could smell the stink of their lust on her lets just see how things work out shall we rose anything you say darling she smiled dreamily anything she winked at him as she swept the four gold coins from the washstand she swayed provocatively as she went to the small trunk she squatted down before it he had been wondering if she would squat or bend at the waist he was satisfied at the detail at the remnant of a demure past as she pushed the coins under some of her clothes in the chest he saw atop her things a small pillow decorated with a dash of red such a detail intrigued him it seemed out of place whats that he asked knowing that the money had earned her indulgence she held it up for him to see it was small pillow an item of decoration a frivolity it had a red rose embroidered on it i made it when i was younger i staffed it with cedar shaving so it would smell nice she glided her fingers lovingly over the rose my namesakea rose for rosa my father named me he was from nicobarese rosa means rose in his language he always called me his little rosa and said that i grew in the garden of his heart the detail astonished him he was thrilled to know something so intimate about her he felt as if he already possessed her the pleasure of knowing such a small seemingly insignificant thing pounded through his veins as he watched her replace the little packet of her past into her trunk he wondered at her father wondered if he knew where she was or if perhaps he had sent her away in revulsion his rose wilted in his heart he imagined an angry scene he wondered at her motherif her mother understood her choice in life or cried at a daughter lost now he too was playing a part in who she was in her life may i call you rosa he asked as she closed the lid of her trunk its such a lovely name she looked back over her shoulder her eyes watched his fingers working her underpants into a tight ball she returned to him smiling as she came youre my special man now ive never told another man my true name it would give me pleasure to hear my given name on your lips his heart pounded and he swayed on his feet with his need thank you rosa he whispered and he truly meant it i want so much to please you your hands are trembling they always did until he started then they were rock steady once he started he would be steady it was just the anticipation im sorry a throaty lusty laugh came from deep in her throat dont be it excites me that you would be nervous he wasnt nervous not in the least but he was excited her hands found that he was i want to taste you she licked his ear i have no one else tonight we have all the time we want to enjoy this i know he whispered back thats why i wanted to be last yes she teased i want it to last too can you make it last darling i can and i will he promised a long time she let out a purr of satisfaction at his promise and turned in his arms pressing her bottom against him she arched her back and rocked her head against his chest as she moaned again he kept the smirk from his face as he looked down into her skyblue eyes yes she was a talented whore he slid his hand down her lower spine counting her vertebrae fingering the spaces between them she moaned urgently at his touch because of the way she swayed her bottom he missed the spot he wanted she staggered the second time he slammed the knife into her lower back he hit the right spot between the vertebrae severing her spinal cord he swept an arm around her middle to hold her up the shocked grunting moan was real this time anyone in the other rooms wouldnt think it any different from the sounds she regularly made for men others didnt notice such details he did and savored the difference as her mouth widened to scream he stuffed it full with the wadded ball of her dirty underpants he timed it just right so only the cry of the gasp sounded before the pitch rose he yanked the silk tie from her robe on the peg beside him and whirled it around her head four times to hold the gag in her mouth with one hand and the aid of his teeth he drew it tight and knotted it he would have liked to have listened to her heartfelt screams but that would bring a premature end to their pleasure he loved the screams the cries they were always sincere he pressed his mouth against the side of her head he could smell the sweat of men in her hair oh rosa you are going to please me so you are going to give me more pleasure than youve ever given any man before i want you to enjoy it too i know this is what you always wanted im the man youve been waiting for ive come at last he let her slip to the floor her legs were useless now she wasnt going anywhere she tried to punch him between his legs he caught her dainty little fist in his hand he watched her wide skyblue eyes as he pressed open her fist he held her palm between his thumb and a finger and bent it down until the bones in her wrist snapped he used the arms of her robe to bind her hands so that she couldnt pull the gag from her mouth his heart hammered as he listened to her muffled wails he couldnt understand the words against the gag but they heightened his excitement because he could feel their pain a storm of emotion rampaged through his mind at least the voices were silent for now leaving him to his lust he wasnt sure what the voices were but he was sure that he was only able to hear them because of his singular intellect he was able to seine such evanescent messages from the ethers because of his incomparable perception and because he minded the details tears flooded down her face her perfectly plucked brows bunched together lifting in the middle furrowing the skin on her forehead into neat rows he counted them because he was special with wide anguished skyblue eyes she watched as he removed his clothes and set them aside it wouldnt do to have them soaked in blood the knife was rock steady in his hand now he stood above her naked and erect to show her what a good job she was doing for him so far and then he began chapter kahlan with cara following behind came to the door of the small room richard used as an office at the same lime as a young woman with short black hair arrived carrying a small silver tray with hot tea raina standing guard beside the door along with ulic and egan yawned richard ask for tea sarah the young woman curtsied as best she could holding the tray yes mother confessor kahlan lifted the tray from the womans hands thats all right sarah im going inill take it in to him sahara blushed trying to hold on to the tray but mother confessor you shouldnt have to do that dont be silly im perfectly capable of carrying a tray for ten feet kahlan backed away a step gaining full possession of the tray sarah didnt know what to do with her hands so she bowed yes mother confessor she said before departing rather than being pleased to have been relieved of a small task she looked as if she had just been ambushed and robbed sarah like most of the staff was fiercely vigilant about her duties has he been up long kahlan asked raina raina gave her a sullen look yes all night i finally left a squad of guards and went to bed he had berdine up with him all night too the reason no doubt for the sullen look im sure it was important but ill she if i cant get him to stop at night for some sleep or at least let berdine get hers i would appreciate it cara muttered raina gets grumpy when berdine doesnt come to bed berdine needs her sleep raina said defensively im sure it was important raina but youre right if people dont get enough sleep they wont be any good to him ill remind himhe sometimes gets lost in what hes doing and forgets about what other people need rainas dark eyes brightened thank you mother confessor kahlan balanced the tray in one hand as she opened the door cara took up station beside raina peering after kahlan to make sure she didnt have any trouble with the tray and then closed the door richard had his back to her as he stared out the window a low fire in the hearth did a poor job banishing the chill from the room kahlan smirked to herself she would put the lie to his boast before she had a chance to set the tray on the table and let the cup ping against the pot to catch his attention and make him think it was the serving woman richard spoke without turning kahlan good im glad you came frowning she set down the tray you have your back to the door how could you know it was me and not the woman bringing the tea you ordered richard turned around with a puzzled look why would i think it was the woman with the tea when it was you bringing it in he truly looked bewildered by her question i swear richard sometimes you give me the shivers she decided that he had to have seen her reflection in the window he lifted her chin with a finger and kissed her im glad to see you its been lonely without you sleep well sleep i i guess not but at least the riots seem to have ceased i dont know what we would have done if the moon had risen red again i cant believe people would go wild simply because of something like that you have to admit that it was odd frightening i do but that didnt make me want to run screaming through the streets breaking windows and setting fires thats because youre lord rahl and you have more sense ill have some order too ill not have people doing that kind of damage to say nothing of injuring innocent people the next time it happens im going to have the soldiers put it down immediately rather than wait hoping people will be suddenly stricken with reason i have more important matters to worry about than childish reactions to superstition kahlan could tell by his smoldering tone that he was on the verge of losing his temper his eyes were bleary she knew that if a person didnt get enough sleep forbearance could quickly evaporate one night was one thing but three in a row was quite another she hoped it wasnt affecting his judgment more important matters you mean your work with berdine he nodded kahlan poured a cup of tea and held it out to him he stared at the cup a moment before taking it richard you have to let the poor woman get more sleep shell be no good to you if you dont let her have enough sleep he took a sip i know he turned to the window and yawned i had to send her over to my room to take a nap she was making mistakes richard you need to get some sleep too he stared out the window toward the massive stone walls of the wizards keep up on the mountain i think i may have found out what the red moon meant the somber quality in his voice gave her pause what she finally asked he turned to the table and set down the cup i had berdine looking for places where kolo used the word moss or maybe mentioned a red moon hoping that we might find something to help us he flipped open the journal on the table he had found the journal up in the keep where it had been sealed in for three thousand years along with the man who had written it kolo had been keeping watch over the sliph the strange creature that could take some people great distances when the towers separating the old and new worlds were completed when the towers were activated kolo had been sealed in trapped and had died there the journal had already proven an invaluable source of information but it was written in high dharan which complicated matters berdine understood high dharan but not such an ancient form of it they had to use another book written in almost the same ancient form of high dharan to aid them richards childhood memory of that books story helped berdine to translate words which they used as a cross reference in order to work out the translation of the journal as they went along richard was learning much of both the vernacular high dharan and also the much older argot form but it was still frustratingly slow going after richard had brought kahlan back to aydindril he told her how he had used the information in the book to find a way to rescue her he said that sometimes he could seem to read with ease but then at other places he and berdine became bogged down he said that at times he was able to unravel a page in a few hours and then they would spend a whole day trying to translate one sentence moss you said you had her checking for the word moss whats that mean he took a sip of tea and set the cup tack down moss oh it means wind in high dharan he opened the pages to a marker since it was taking so much time to translate the journal weve just been looking for key words and then concentrating on those passages hoping to get lucky i thought you said that you were translating it in order to better understand the way kolo uses the language he sighed in annoyance kahlan i dont have the time for that we had to change our tactics kahlan didnt like the sound of that richard i was told that your brother is the high priest of an order called the raugmoss is that high dharan means divine wind he muttered he tapped the book not seeming to want to discuss it see here berdine found where kolo was talking about a red moon he was really upset about it the whole keep was in an uproar he writes that they were betrayed by the team he said that the team was to be put on trial for their crimes we havent had time to look into that yet but richard flipped the book back toward the front where one of their written translations was inserted and read her the passage today one of our most coveted desires possible only through the brilliant tireless work of a team of near to one hundred has been accomplished the items most feared lost should we be overrun have been protected a cheer went up from all in the keep when we received word today that we were successful some thought it was not possible but to the astonishment of all it is done the temple of the winds is gone gone kahlan asked whats the temple of the winds where did it go richard shut the book i dont know but later in the journal kolo says that this team who had done it had betrayed then all high dharan is an odd language words have different meanings depending on how theyre used most languages are that way our own is yes but sometimes in high dharan a word that ordinarily has different meanings according to its usage is intended to have multiple meanings you cant have one meaning without all the rest that makes translating it all the more difficult for example in the old prophecy that names me the bringer of death the word death means three different things depending on how its used the bringer of the underworld the world of the dead the bringer of spirits spirits of the dead and the bringer of death meaning to kill each meaning is different but all three were intended that was the key the prophecy was in the book we brought with us from the palace of the prophets warren was only able to translate the prophecy after i told him that all three meanings were true he told me that because of that he was the first in thousands of years to know the true meaning of the prophecy as it was written what does this have to do with the temple of the winds when kolo says winds i think that he sometimes just means the wind like when you say that the wind is blowing today but sometimes when he says winds i think he means the temple of the winds i think he used it as a short way of referring to the temple of the winds and at the same time as a way to differentiate it from other temples kahlan blinked are you saying that you think shotas message that the wind hunts you means that the temple of the winds is really somehow hunting you i dont know for sure richard thats a pretty big leap of reasoning if thats what youre really thinkingto take kolos short way of referring to the temple of the winds and infer that shota is talking about the same place when kolo talks about how everyone was in an uproar and these men were to be put on trial he makes it sound as if the winds have a sense of perception kahlan cleared her throat this time richard are you trying to tell me that kolo claims that this place the temple of the winds is sentient she wondered how long it had been since he had gotten any sleep she wondered if he was thinking clearly i said i wasnt sure but thats what you mean well it sounds absurd when you ay it like that it doesnt sound the same when you read it in high dharan i dont know how to explain the difference but there is one maybe its just a difference of degree difference of degree or not how can a place have a sense of perception be sentient richard sighed i dont know ive been trying to figure that out myself why do you think ive been up all night but such a thing is not possible his defiant gray eyes turned to her the wizards keep is just a place but it knows when someone violates it it reacts to that violation by stopping the person even killing them if it must to prevent an unauthorized person from entering a place they dont belong kahlan made a face richard thats the shields wizards placed those shields to protect important or dangerous things from being stolen or to prevent people from going where they could be hurt but they react without anyone having to tell them to dont they so does a leghold trap that doesnt make them sentient you mean that the temple of the winds is protected by shields thats all youre saying thenthat it has shields yes and no its more than simple shields shields only ward the way kolo talks about it makes it sound like the temple of the winds can i dont know like it can think like it can decide things when it must decide things like what when he wrote how everyone was in a panic about the red moon that was when he said that the team who had sent the temple of the winds away had betrayed them so what so i think that the temple of the winds made the moon turn red kahlan watched his eyes transfixed by the look of conviction in them i wont even ask how such a thing would be possible but for the moment lets just say youre right why would the temple of the winds make the moon turn red richard held her gaze as a warning of what the shields in the keep react by warding almost no one can pass through them i can because i have the right kind of magic if someone who wants to do harm has enough magic and knowledge they too can get by the shields what happens then well nothing they get through exactly i think the temple of the winds can do more i think it can know if someone has violated its defenses and lend a warning the red moon she whispered it makes sense she put a hand tenderly to his arm richard you need to get some rest you cant infer all this from kolos journal alone it was just one journal written a long time ago he yanked his arm away i dont know where else to look shota said the wind was hunting me i dont need to go to sleep to have nightmares in that instant kahlan knew that it wasnt shotas message that was driving him it was the prophecy down in the pit the first part of the prophecy said on the red moon will come the firestorm it was the second part that truly terrified her to quench the inferno he must seek the remedy in the wind lightning will find him on that path for the one in white his true beloved will betray him in her blood she realized that the prophecy frightened him more than he had admitted someone knocked at the door what richard yelled cara opened the door and poked her head in general kerson would like to see you lord rahl richard raked his fingers back through his hair send him in please cara richard put a hand to kahlans shoulder as he stared off toward the window im sorry he whispered youre right i need some sleep maybe nadine can give me some of her herbs to put me to sleep my mind doesnt seem to want to allow it when i try she would sooner let shota give him something kahlan answered with a tender touch fearing to test her voice at that moment general kerson wearing a wide grin marched into the room he saluted with a fist over his heart before coming to a halt lord rahl good morning and a good morning it is thanks to you richard took a sip of his tea whys that the general slapped richard on the shoulder the men are all better the things you orderedthe garlic blueberries quench oak teait worked theyre all well again ive got a whole army of brighteyed men whore ready and able to do as ordered i cant tell you how relieved i am lord rahl your smile just did general im relieved too my men are uplifted that their new lord rahl is a worker of great magic able to turn death from their door every one of those men would like to buy you an ale and toast your health and long life it wasnt magic it was simply things that thank them for the offer but i what about the riots were there any more last night general kerson grunted dismissively its mostly finished the worry went out of people when the moon returned to normal good thats good news general thinks for the report the general rubbed a finger along his smooth jaw ah there was one other thing lord rahl he glanced at kahlan if we could talk the man let out a sigh a woman was murdered last night im sorry was it someone you knew no lord rahl she was a a woman who she accepted money in return for if youre trying to say she was a whore general kahlan said ive heard the word before i wont faint if i hear it again yes mother confessor he turned his attention back to richard she was found dead this morning what happened to her how was she killed the general was looking more uncomfortable by the moment lord rahl ive been looking at dead people a lot of years i cant remember the last time i vomited when i saw one richard rested a hand on one of the leather pouches on his wide belt what was done to her the general glanced to kahlan as if to beg her indulgence as he put an arm around richards shoulder and pulled him aside kahlan couldnt hear the whispered words but the look on richards face told her she didnt want to know richard went to the hearth and stood staring into the flames im sorry but you must have men who can look into it why are you bringing this to me the general grimaced and cleared his throat ah well you see lord rahl it was well it was your brother who found her richard turned with a dark frown what was drefan doing at a house of prostitution ah well i asked him that myself lord rahl he doesnt seem to me a man who would have any troublethe general wiped a hand across his facei asked him and he said that it was his business not mine if he wanted to go to whorehouses kahlan could see the tightly controlled anger etched in richards expression he abruptly snatched his gold cloak from a chair lets go take me there take me where drefan goes i want to talk to the people there kahlan and general kerson rushed after richard as he swept out the door she caught his sleeve and glanced to the general general could you give us a moment please after he moved down the hall kahlan pulled richard in the other direction away from cara raina ulic and egan she didnt think that richard was in any mood at the moment to be looking into such a thing besides she had come to him for a reason richard there are representatives writing to meet with us theyve been waiting days drefan is my brother hes also a grown man richard rubbed his eyes i need to see about this and i have a lot of other things on my mind would you mind talking to the representatives tell them that i was called away on important matters and that they can just as easily give their lands surrender to you and then all the arrangements of command can begin to be coordinated i can i know that some of them would be just as happy to talk to me and not have to face you even in surrender theyre terrified of you i wouldnt hurt them richard objected richard you frightened the wits out of them before when you demanded their surrender you promised to annihilate them if they dared join with the imperial order they fear you might do it anyway on a whim the reputation of the master of dhara precedes you and you fed their fears you cant expect that theyll suddenly be at ease around you just because they agree to your terms he leaned down and whispered in her ear well just tell them how lovable i am i can tell them that you look forward to working with them for our mutual peace and prosperity she said with a smile they trust me and will listen but tristan bashkar the jarian minister is here along with a pair from the royal house in grennidon these three are the important ones the ones with huge standing armies theyre expecting to meet with you it is they who may not be satisfied to surrender to me they will want to discuss terms make them satisfied tristan bashkar is not an affable man but a tough negotiator as are leonora and walter cholbane from grennidon thats one reason i ended the midlaids alliance too many wish to argue and posture arguing and posturing are over the terms of surrender are unconditional richard hooked a thumb behind his wide leather belt his expression hardened the terms are fair to all the same for all and are not subject to discussion theyre either with us or against us kahlan dragged a finger down the black sleeve of his shirt over the rise and fall of his muscles hed been busy with the journal it had been too long since shed been in those arms richard you depend on me for advice i know these lands just having them agree is not the only aim there will be need for sacrifice we need their full cooperation in this war you are lord rahl the master of dhara you made the demands you said that surrender while unconditional will be handled with respect for their people i know these representatives they will expect to see you as a matter of your respect for them you are the mother confessor we are one in this as in everything else you led these people long before i came along you have no less standing than i you have had their respect a good long time remind them of that richard directed a brief gaze up the hall to the waiting general and the others he looked back into her eyes it may not be any of general kersons business as far as drefan is concerned but it is mine ill not be deceived by another brother from what youve said and others have told me he already has women in the palace fawning over him if he catches something from those whores and then gives it to the young women here thats my business ill not have it be my brother bringing diseases to innocent women here who trust him because hes my brother sarah the woman who had been bringing tea to richard was young and trusting she was one of the women captivated by drefan kahlan rubbed his back i understand if you promise you will get some sleep ill go talk with the representatives when you have time to talk to them then you will talk to them they have no choice but to wait you are the lord rahl richard bent and kissed her cheek i love you then marry me soon well go wake the sliph soon richard you be careful marlin said that the sister of the darki dont remember her nameleft aydindril and returned to jagang but he may be lying she could still be out there sister amelia you know i remember her when i first went to the palace of the prophets she was one of vernas friends who met us sisters phoebe janet and amelia i remember amelias tears of joy at seeing verna after all those years jagang has her now he nodded verna must be heartbroken that her friend is in jagangs hands and worse that shes a sister of the dark if verna even knows you be careful despite what jagang says she may still be lurking in aydindril i doubt it but ill be careful he turned and signaled to cara she sprinted up the hall cara id like you to go with kahlan let berdine get some rest ill take raina ulic and egan with me yes lord rahl i will keep her safe richard smiled i know you will cara but thats not going to get you out of your punishment she betrayed no emotion yes lord rail what punishment kahlan asked when they were out of earshot an unjust one mother confessor that bad what is it i am to feed seeds to his chipmunks kahlan suppressed a smile that doesnt sound so bad cara cara flipped her agiel up into her fist that is why it is unjust mother confessor chapter kahlan sat alone in the ornate chair of the mother confessor the tallest one behind the semicircular dais under the ornate fresco of magda searus the first mother confessor and her wizard merritt they were painted onto the dome that capped the enormous council chambers kahlan watched the representatives approaching across the expanse of marble before her from her place of honor overhead magda searus had witnessed the long history that was the midlands alliance she had witnessed too richard ending it kahlan prayed that magda searuss spirit would understand and approve of his reasons they were benevolent despite what it must seem to some cara stood behind kahlans right shoulder kahlan had hastily gathered a number of administrators to handle matters of state such as the signing of documents of surrender and trade instructions and several dharan officers to oversee matters of command they all waited silently behind her left shoulder kahlan tried to focus her mind on the things she must say and do but richards words about the temple of the winds made it hard to think of anything else he thought the temple of the winds was sentient the winds were hunting richard the temple of the winds was hunting him that threat lurked in every dark corner of her mind footsteps of the representatives and boot strikes of the soldiers escorting them echoed off vast expanses of marble and brought her out of her breeding the approaching knot of people strode through glaring shafts of sunlight that streamed in through round windows at the lower edge of the dome kahlan put on her confessors face as her mother had taught her a face that showed nothing and masked what was inside arched openings around the room covered stairways up to colonnaded balconies edged with polished mahogany railings but this day no observers stood behind the railing the group flanked by dharan soldiers came to a halt before the resplendent carved desk tristan bashkar of jaraand leonora and walter cholbane of grennidon stood at the fore behind them waited ambassadors seldon from mardovia wexler from pendisan reach and brumford from togressa kahlan knew that jara and grennidon lands of vast wealth and large standing armies were likely lo be the most obstinate about retaining their prerogative of status in return for their surrender she knew she must shake their confidence first having served in a position of authority and power most of her life first as a confessor then as the mother confessor kahlan knew the task well she knew these people knew how they thought surrender was acceptable as long as they could retain station above certain other lands and as long as they could be assured of unfettered authority in their own business that kind of attitude was no longer acceptable it couldnt be tolerated if all of them were to have a chance against the imperial order kahlan had to uphold richards word and conditions of surrender the future of every land in the midlands depended on this in order for this new union to prevail against the imperial order there could no longer be sovereign lands each with its own agenda they must now all be one under one authority of command working together as one people not a coalition that could fragment at a critical moment letting the imperial order snatch freedom from all lord rahl is occupied with matters of our mutual safety in our struggle i have come in his place to hear your decisions your words will be passed on to him as you speak them to me as mother confessor queen of galea queen of kelton and betrothed of the master of dhara i have the authority to speak on behalf of the dharan empire my word is as final as would be lord rahls the words had come out unbidden but that was what it wasthe dharan empire richard was its supreme leader its supreme authority the representatives bowed and mumbled that they understood wanting these people of authority to know that the order of things was no longer how it had been in these chambers in the past kahlan reversed the order of how such matters were handled ambassador brumford please step forward tristan bashkar and leonora cholbane immediately began objecting it was unheard of to have a lesser land speak first kahlans glare brought them to silence when i ask you to speak for your people then you may speak not before until a land joins with us through surrender of their sovereignty they have no standing before me do not expect that your presumption will be excused as was customary in the past in the alliance of the midlands the midlands alliance is no more you now stand in the dharan empire an icy silence settled over the chambers kahlan had been devastated when she had first heard that richard had spoken much the same words in this very chamber to representatives of the midlands she had come to understand that there was no other way tristan bashkar and the cholbanes to whom she had directed her words stood redfaced but silent when she moved her gaze to ambassador brumford he remembered her orders and scurried forward the amicable ambassador brumford gathered his voluminous violet robes in one hand and put a knee to the marble floor as he sank into a deep bow mother confessor he said as he straightened togressa stands ready to join with you and all free people in our alliance against tyranny thank you ambassador we welcome togressa as a member of the dharan empire the people of togressa will have standing equal to any among us we know your people will do their part they will thank you mother confessor please relay my word to lord rahl that we are joyful to be a part of dhara kahlan smiled sincerely lord rahl and i share your joy ambassador brumford he moved to the side as kahlan called forward the muscled short fieryeyed ambassador wexler from pendisan reach mother confessor he said upon arising tugging his leather surcoat straight pendisan reach is a small land with a small legion of men at arms but we are fierce fighters as any who have come against our swords can attest the mother confessor has always fought for us with the same fierceness we have always held with the midlands and with the mother confessor and so we accord your words great weight with the greatest respect we heed your counsel to join with dhara our swords are lowered to you and lord rahl the people of pendisan reach both those of simple muscle and bone and those with magics talents wish to be at the van of battle against the horde from beyond the wilds so that the enemy may have a bitter taste of our ferocity we will be known to all from this day forward as the dharans from pendisan reach if it so pleases you touched by his words kahlan bowed her head to him the people of pendisan reach did have a flair for the dramatic but they were no less wholehearted for it as small as their land was they were not to be taken lightly the ambassadors bold claim of their ferocity was no idle boast if only their numbers were as great as their fortitude i cant promise you the van ambassador wexler but we will be honored to have your people with us in our struggle we will value them regardless of how they serve she turned a dispassionate face to the ambassador from mardovia the mardovian people were proud too and no less fierce they had to be for their survival in tough country among the wilds though they also were a small land ambassador seldon please come forward and deliver mardovias decision ambassador seldon glided forward wearily eying the others he bowed from the waist his white hair falling forward over the gold braiding on the shoulders of his red coat as he did so mother confessor the assembly of seven of mardovia in our mother city of renwold has charged me with the duty of the long journey to aydindril to relay their decision the assembly of seven has no desire or intention to relinquish rule over our beloved people to outlanders whether they be from dhara or from the imperial order your war with the imperial order is not our war the assembly of seven has ruled that mardovia will remain sovereign and will remain neutral behind her in the silence a soldier coughed the sound of it echoed around the stone chamber ambassador seldon the land of mardovia lies among the eastern wilds not far from the old world you will be vulnerable to attack mother confessor the walls surrounding our mother city of renwold have stood the test of time as you say we lie among the people of the wilds those people in the past have tried to exterminate us none ever succeeded in so much as breaching the walls much less overcoming our stalwart defenders instead the various peoples of the wilds now trade with us and renwold is a center of commerce in the eastern wilds of the midlands respected by all who once sought to conquer us kahlan leaned forward ambassador the order is no tribe from the wilds they will crush you doesnt the assembly of seven have the sense to realize that ambassador seldon smiled indulgently mother confessor i understand your concern but as i have said renwolds walls have stood us in good stead be assured renwold will not fall to the order his expression hardened nor will it fall to this new alliance you form with dhara numbers do not mean much against a knob of stone in the wilds wouldbe conquerors soon tire of breaking their teeth on so small a morsel our small size our location and our walls make us less than worth the trouble should we join with you then we would be vulnerable because we would represent resistance our neutrality is not of hostile intent we will be willing to trade with your alliance as we will be willing to trade with the imperial order we wish harm to no one but we will defend ourselves ambassador seldon your wife and children are in renwold dont you understand the danger to your family my beloved wife and children are safe behind the walls of renwold mother confessor i fear not for them and will your walls stand against magic the order uses those with magic or are you too drunk with the past to see the threat to your future his face had reddened the decision of the assembly of seven is final we dont fear for our safety we have people of magic in turn to protect the walls from magic neutrality is not a threat perhaps you should pray to the good spirits for mercy since it is you who sues for war to live by violence is to invite it kahlan drummed her fingernails against the desktop as everyone awaited her words she knew that even if she could convince this man it would do no good the assembly of seven had made its decision and he could not change it even if he wanted ambassador seldon you will leave aydindril by the end of the day you will return to the assembly of seven in renwold and tell them that dhara does not recognize neutrality this is a struggle for our worldwhether it is to thrive in the light or wither under the shadow of tyranny lord rahl has decreed that there are no bystanders i have decreed no mercy against the order we are of one mind in this you are either with us or you stand against us the imperial order views it the same tell the assembly of seven that mardovia now stands against us one of us either dhara or the order will conquer mardovia direct them to pray to the good spirits and ask that it is we who conquer you and take renwold instead of the order we will impose harsh sanctions for your resistance but your people will live should the order set upon you first they will annihilate your defenders and enslave your people mardovia will be ground into the dust of the past his indulgent smile widened fear not mother confessor renwold will stand against any land even the order kahlan regarded him with cold ire i have walked among the dead inside the walls of ebinissia i have seen the slaughter at the hands of the order i have seen what they did to the living first i will pray for those poor people who will suffer because of the mad delusions of the assembly of seven kahlan angrily gestured to the guards to escort the man from the chambers she knew what would happen to the mardovian people if the order attacked first she knew too that richard could not risk the lives of allies simply to take renwold in order to protect it it was too distant a land she would advise against it as would any of his generals mardovia was lost their neutrality would draw the order as the scent of blood drew wolves she had walked through the gates in the massive walls of renwold the walls were impressive they were not invincible the order had wizards like marlin the walls would not stand against wizards fire despite those of magics talent defending renwold kahlan tried to put the fate of mardovia from her mind as she called the pair from the royal house in grennidon forward how does grennidon stand she growled walter cholbane cleared his throat his sister spoke grennidon a land of great importance a land of vast fields which produce kahlan cut her off i asked how grennidon stands leonora drywashed her hands as she considered the resolve in kahlans eyes the royal house offers its surrender mother confessor thank you leonora we are gladdened for you and for your people please see to it that my officers here are granted any information they need so that your army can be brought under coordination of our central command yes mother confessor she stammered mother confessor are our forces to be bled against the walls of renwold to bring them down grennidon was north of mardovia and in the best position to attack but kahlan knew that grennidon would not relish attacking a trading partner moreover some of the family of the assembly of seven had married into the royal house of cholbane no renwold is a city of the walking dead the vultures will pick it clean in the meantime trade with mardovia is forbidden we trade only with those who join us yes mother confessor mother confessor walter her brother interjected we wish to discuss some of the terms with lord rahl we have things of value to offer and matters of interest to us that we wish to bring to his attention surrender is unconditional there is nothing to discuss lord rahl has instructed me to remind you that there will be no negotiations either you are with us or you are against us now do you wish to withdraw your offer of surrender before you sign the documents and instead cast your fate with mardovia he pressed his lips together as he took a deep breath no mother confessor thank you when lord rahl has the time soon i hope he would very much like to hear what you have to say as a valued member of the dharan empire just remember that you are now part of dhara and he is the master of dhara the master of that empire she had treated them with less respect than the two small lands who had offered their surrender not to do so would have resulted in emboldening them and inviting trouble these two were among those who always requested red rooms walter and leonora seemed to relax now that kahlan had their acquiescence the cholbanes could be tenacious and stubborn to the end but once an agreement was reached and their word given they never looked back never secondguessed what might have been it was a quality that made dealings with them bearable we understand mother confessor walter said yes his sister added and we look forward to the day that the imperial order no longer threatens all our people thank you both of you i know this must seem harsh to you but know that we rejoice to count you and your people among us as they moved off to sign the papers and talk with the officers kahlan turned her attention to tristan bashkar of jara minister bashkar how stands jara tristan bashkar was a member of the royal family of jara in jara the position of minister was one of high rank and trust of those gathered he was the only one with the authority to change his lands commitment without returning home for consultation if he thought there was reason enough he could alter the royal familys instructions and thus jaras stand hardly out of his thirties he wore his age well he also used his looks to distract people from his quick mind after people had been disarmed by his likable smile bright brown eyes and smoothspoken flattery he would extract concessions before they realized they had parted with them he brushed a thick lock of dark hair back from his foreheada compulsive habit or possibly a way to draw interest to his eyes where people were often distracted he spread his hands apologetically mother confessor im afraid its not as easy as a simple yes or no although i wish to assure you that we are in harmony with the great empire of dhara and admire the wisdom of both lord rahl and of course yourself we have always put the advice of the mother confessor above all others kahlan sighed tristan im in no mood for your usual games you and i have sparred in these chambers more times than i can remember dont test me today ill not have it being a member of the royal family he was well trained in all the arts of war and had fought with distinction in the past broadshouldered and tall he cut a handsome figure his easy smile always carried a playful twist that cloaked any threat were there one and there sometimes was kahlan never turned her back so to speak on tristan bashkar he casually unbuttoned his dark blue coat and rested a hand on his hip the ploy revealed an ornate knife sheathed at his belt kahlan had heard it whispered that going into battle tristan bashkar preferred to draw his knife rather than his sword it was whispered too that he got sadistic pleasure from slicing the enemy mother confessor i admit that in the past ive been reticent to reveal our exact position in order to best protect our people from the avarice of other lands but it isnt like that this time you see the way we view the situation im not interested i want only to know if you stand with us or against us if you stand against us tristan i give you my word that by morning we will have troops riding for the royal palace in sandilar and they will return with either unconditional surrender or the heads of the royal family general baldwin is here in aydindril with a sizable keltish force ill send himkeltans never let down their queen nor rest until she is satisfied i am now the queen of kelton do you wish a fight with general baldwin of course not mother confessor we wish no fight but if you will hear me out kahlan slapped a hand to the desk silencing him when the imperial order held aydindril before richard liberated it jara sat on the council allied with the order as was dhara at the time he gently reminded her kahlan glared at him i was brought before the council and convicted of the very crimes committed by the order wizard ranson from the order called for a death sentence the councilor from jara sat at this desk and voted to have me beheaded mother confessor kahlan turned a finger to her right he sat right there and called for me to be put to death she looked back to tristans brown eyes if you look closely i think you will still be able to pick out a stain down the front of the desk over there when richard liberated aydindril he executed those traitorous councilors the stain was left by the jarian councilor i heard that richard cleaved the man nearly in two he was so angered by the betrayal to me and to the people of the midlands tristan stood politely showing nothing of his emotions mother confessor it was not by the choice of the royal family that that councilor spoke for jara he was a puppet of the order then join with us we want to and we intended to in fact i was sent with authorization to make it so whatever it is you want tristan youll not get it we make the same offer to all and no special terms for any mother confessor would it be considered a special term to hear me out kahlan sighed make it short and keep in mind tristan that your smile has no effect on me he smiled anyway as a member of the royal family i have the authority and authorization to surrender jara and join with you given a choice that is what we wish then do it the red moon interrupts those plans kahlan sat up straighter what does that have to do with it mother confessor javas kedar our star guide holds great sway with the royal family he has read the stars in the matter of our surrender and has given his opinion that the stars hold this action with favor before i left home javas kedar told me that the stars would give sign if circumstances changed and to heed any sign the red moon has given me pause in our plans the moon is not the stars the moon is in the sky mother confessor javas kedar councils on the meaning of moon symbols also kahlan pinched the bridge of her nose between a thumb and finger as she sighed tristan are you going to allow harm to visit your people on the basis of such superstition no mother confessor but i am bound by my honor to give heed to the beliefs of our people lord rahl said that surrender would not mean that we had to give up our customs and beliefs tristan you have an annoying habit of leaving out things you wish to ignore richard said that a land wouldnt have to give up its customs as long as they brought harm to no one and broke no laws common to all you are stepping over a dangerous line mother confessor we in no way wish to circumvent his words or to step over any line i wish only some time time time for what time mother confessor to assure myself that the red moon isnt a sign that we have reason to fear joining with dhara now i can either travel back to jara and consul with javas kedar or i can simply wait here for a while if you would prefer to assure myself that the red moon is not a sign of danger kahlan knew that the jarians and the royal family in particular were fervent believers in guidance from the stars as much effort as tristan devoted to chasing skirts kahlan knew that were a beautiful woman to offer him her charms he would flee from her if he believed the stars were against it it would take him at least a month to return to jara consult the star guide and return to aydindril how long would you have to wait in aydindril before you felt comfortable and could in good conscience surrender he frowned thoughtfully for a moment if aydindril remained safe for a couple of weeks after such a significant sign then i would feel safe in knowing that the sign was not a bad portent kahlan drummed her fingers you have two weeks tristan not one day more thank you mother confessor i pray that in two weeks we can consummate our union with dhara he bowed good day mother confessor and i look forward to the stars remaining fair for us he took a step away but turned back by the way would you happen to know of a place i can stay for such a length of time our palace was burned down in your battle with the blood of the fold what with all the damage to aydindril im having difficulty in finding accommodations she knew what he was angling forto be close so he could see if the stars struck out against dharan rule the man thought too much of himself thought himself more clever than he was kahlan smiled oh yes i know a place you will stay right here where we can keep an eye on you until the two weeks are up he buttoned his blue coat why thank you mother confessor for your hospitality it is most appreciated and tristan while you are a guest under my roof if you lay a finger or anything else on any of the women living and working here i will see to it that the anything else is cut off he laughed goodnaturedly mother confessor i never knew you believed the gossip about me im afraid that i often have to resort to the charms of coin for company but im flattered that you would think me so talented at wooing young ladies if i should break your rules i would expect to be put on trial and subjected to your choice of punishment trial richard said that the people who sent the temple of the winds away were put on trial in the wizards keep there were records of all trials held there she had never read any of those books but she had been told of them maybe they could find out from the records of the trial what happened to the temple of the winds as kahlan watched tristan bashkar departing behind a pair of guards she thought about richard and wondered what he would find she wondered if he was about to lose another brother kahlan knew most of the women working at the confessors palace the women at the palace respected richard as a man of honor she wouldnt like to think that they would be prey to a man who would win them by trading on their trust of richard she felt a pang of sadness for richard she knew he was hoping that drefan would be a brother he could be proud of kahlan hoped that drefan didnt turn out to be trouble she remembered his hand on cara kahlan turned to the mordsith three more with us one lost and one yet to decide cara smiled conspiratorially a sister of the agiel must be able to strike fear into peoples hearts mother confessor you wear the agiel well i thought i could hear some of their knees knocking all the way up here chapter armor and weapons clattered and clanged as the soldiers following behind marched up the steep cobbled street narrow houses mostly three and four stories sat cheek by jowl with the upper floors overhanging the lower so that the topmost almost closed off the sky it was a gloomy part of the city soldiers throughout the city had cheered their thanks as richard passed wishing him good health and long life some had wanted to buy him a drink some had run up to bow before him and give the devotion master rahl guide us master rahl teach us master rahl protect us in your light we thrive in your mercy we are sheltered in your wisdom we are humbled we live only to serve our lives are yours they had hailed him as a great wizard for protecting them and healing their sickness richard felt more than a little uncomfortable at their acclaim he had after all simply instructed them to take wellknown cures for intestinal distress he hadnt worked any magic he had tried to explain it wasnt magic that the things they ate and drank had cured them they would hear none of it they had expected magic from him and in their eyes they had gotten it he had finally given up on explaining and took to waving his thanks for their praises had they gone to an herb seller they would no doubt be just as healthy and complaining about the price he had to admit though that it did make him feel good to know that he had helped people for a change instead of hurting them he understood a little of what nadine must feel when she helped people with her herbs he had been warned of a wizards need for balance there was balance in all things but especially in magic he could no longer eat meatit made him sick and suspected it was the gift seeking balance for the killing he sometimes had to do he liked to think that helping people was part of the balance in being a war wizard sullen people going about their business moved to the side of the cramped street tramping through the dirty snow still in the sheltered places in order to squeeze past the soldiers grimlooking groups of older boys and young men watched warily and then vanished around corners as richard and his escort approached richard absently touched the goldworked leather pouch on his belt it contained white sorcerers sand that had been in the pouch when he found the belt in the keep sorcerers sand was the crystallized bones of the wizards who had given their lives into the towers of perdition separating the old and new worlds it was a sort of distilled magic white sorcerers sand gave power to spells drawn with it good and evil the proper spell drawn in white sorcerers sand could invoke the keeper he touched the other goldworked pouch on his belt a little leather purse tied securely inside contained black sorcerers sand he had gathered that sorcerers sand himself from one of the towers no wizard since the towers were built had been able to gather any black sorcerers sand it could only be taken from a tower by one with subtractive magic black sorcerers sand was the counter to the white they nullified each other even one grain of the black would contaminate a spell drawn with the white even one drawn to invoke the keeper he had used it to defeat darken rahls spirit and send him back to the underworld prelate annalina had told him to guard the black sand with his lifethat a spoonful of it was worth kingdoms he possessed several kingdoms worth he never let the little leather purse containing the black sand out of his sight or his reach children layered with ragged clothes for warmth against the cold spring day played catchthefox in the tightly hemmed street running from doorway to doorway giggling with glee at the prospect of finding the fox and more so at seeing the impressive procession coming up their very own street even seeing happy children didnt bring a smile to richards face this one lord rahl general kerson said the general lifted a thumb to a door on the right set back a few feet into the clapboard face of a building the faded red paint was flaking off the bottom of the door where the weather worked on it the most a small sign said latherton rooming house a big stocky man inside didnt look up from a chair behind a rickety table set with dry biscuits and a bottle he stared at nothing with redrimmed eyes his hair was disheveled and his clothes rumpled he seemed in a daze beyond him was a stairway and beside that a narrow hall that ran back into darkness closed he murmured are you silas latherton richard asked his gaze sweeping the clutter of dirty clothes and bed sheets awaiting washing a half dozen empty ewers sat against the wall along with a stack of washrags the man peered up from behind a puzzled frown yeah who are you you look familiar im richard rahl perhaps you see a resemblance to my brother drefan drefan the mans eyes widened lord rahl his chair rasped noisily against the floor as he shoved it back and stood to bow forgive me i didnt recognize you ive never seen you before i didnt know that the healer was your brother i beg the lord rahls forgiveness for the first time silas noticed the darkhaired mordsith at richards side the muscled general at the other side richards two huge bodyguards towering behind him and the phalanx of soldiers spilling out the doorway and into the street he raked his greasy hair back and stood up straighter show me the room where the where the woman was murdered richard said silas latherton bowed twice before hurrying to the stairs tucking in his shirt as he went checking over his shoulder to make sure richard was following he climbed the stairs two at a time they objected to his weight with creaks and groans he finally came to a halt before a door partway down a narrow hall with the walls painted red the candles at either end of the hall provided little illumination the place stank in here lord rahl silas said when he moved to open the door raina snatched his collar and pulled him back out of the way she planted him in place with a sinister look a look like that from raina was enough to give an angry cloud pause she opened the door and agiel in hand stepped into the room before richard richard waited a moment while raina checked the room for threat it was easier than objecting silas stared at the floor while richard and general kerson went into the little room ulic and egan took up posts beside the door and folded their massive arms there wasnt much to see a bed a small pine chest beside it and a washstand a dark stain discolored the unfinished spruce floorboards the bloodstain ran under the bed and covered nearly the entire floor the size of it didnt surprise him the general had told him what had been done to the woman the water in the washbasin looked to be at least half blood the rag hanging over its side was red with it the killer had washed the blood from himself before he left he must either be neat or more likely didnt want to walk out past silas latherton dripping blood richard opened the pine chest it contained orderly stacks of clothes and nothing else he let the lid drop back down richard leaned a hand against the doorway no one heard anything silas shook his head a woman is mutilated like that has her breasts cut off and is stabbed hundreds of times and no one heard a thing richard realized that his exhaustion was putting an edge to his voice his mood wasnt helping either he guessed silas swallowed shed been gagged lord rahl her hands were tied too richard scowled she must have kicked her feet no one heard her kicking if someone was slicing me up and i was gagged and my hands were tied id have kicked the washstand over at least she must have kicked her feet trying to get someones attention i didnt hear it if she did none of the other women heard it either least they never mentioned it and id think they would have come got me if theyd heard anything like that if there was trouble they always came to me they always did they know im not shy about protecting them richard rubbed his eyes the prophecy wouldnt leave him be he had a headache bring the other women here i want to talk to them they left me after silas gestured vaguely except bridget he hurried to the end of the hall and knocked on the last door a woman with rumpled red hair peered out after he spoke quietly to her she withdrew back into her room and in a moment emerged pulling a creamcolored robe closed she tossed a quick knot in the tie as she followed silas up the hall to richard standing in the belly of a stinking whorehouse richard was getting more angry with himself by the moment despite trying to be objective he had begun to let himself be happy about having a brother he was beginning to like drefan drefan was a healer what could be more noble silas and the woman bowed they both looked the way richard felt dirty tired and distraught did you hear anything bridget shook her head her eyes looked haunted did you know the woman who died rose bridget said i only met her once for a few minutes she just came here yesterday do either of you have any idea who murdered her silas and bridget shared a look we know who did it lord rahl silas said a smoldering tone welling in his voice fat harry fat harry whos that where can we find him for the first time silas lathertons features twisted in anger i shouldnt have let him come here anymore the women didnt like him none of us girls would take him anymore bridget said he drinks and when he drinks he gets mean theres no need to put up with that not with the army her words died out as she glanced to the general she resumed with a different tack we have enough clients nowadays we dont have to put up with mean drunks like fat harry the women all told me that they wouldnt see harry no more silas said when he came last night i knew that they would all say no harry was real insistent and seemed sober enough so i asked rose if shed see him as she was new and and didnt know she was in danger richard finished it wasnt like that silas said defensively harry didnt seem to be drunk i knew the other women wouldnt take him though sober or not so i asked rose if she was interested she said she could use the money harry was the last one with her she was found a little while later where can we find this harry silass eyes narrowed in the underworld where he belongs you killed him no one saw who slit his fat throat i wouldnt know who done it richard glanced at the long knife tucked behind silass belt he didnt blame the man if they had captured fat harry he would get the same for his crime as had already been done although he would have had a trial first and he could have confessed just to be sure it was he who had done it that was why they used confessors to be sure they had convicted the guilty man once touched by her magic a criminal would confess all that he had done richard wouldnt want kahlan to hear what had been done to this woman rose especially not from the beast who had done it it made him sick to his stomach to think of kahlan having to touch a man like that a man who had killed a woman in such a brutal fashion he feared he would have killed harry himself to keep kahlan from having to touch the flesh of a man like that he knew she had touched other men who were no better he didnt want her to ever have to do that again he knew it had to hurt her to hear such perverted crimes confessed in detail he feared to think what terrible memories haunted her and visited her dreams richard forced his mind off it and looked at bridget why did you stay when the others ran off she shrugged some of them had children and feared for them i dont fault them their fears but we were always safe here silas has always been fair to me ive been hurt other places but never here it wasnt silass fault that a crazy killer did this silas always respected our wishes when we said we wouldnt see a man again richard felt his stomach tighten and you saw drefan sure all the girls saw drefan all the girls richard repeated he held a tight grip on his anger yeah we all saw him except rose she never got a chance cause she so drefan didnt have a favorite richard had been hoping that drefan had confined himself to one woman he liked and that maybe she would be one who was healthy at least bridgets brow wrinkled up how can a healer have a favorite well i mean was there one he preferred or did he just take who was available the woman stuck a finger into her mat of red hair and scratched her scalp i think you got the wrong idea about drefan lord rahl he never touched us in that way he only came here to do his healing he came here to heal yeah bridget said silas nodded his agreement half the girls had something or other rashes and sores and such most people who sell herbs and cures dont want to help our kind so we just live with our ailments drefan told us how he wanted us to wash he gave us herbs and unguents to put on the sores he came twice before real late after we was done so as not to interfere with us earning a living he checked on the girls children too drefan was special kind with the children one had a bad cough and he got better after drefan gave him something to take he came checking on us early this morning after he saw one of the girls he went to roses room to check on her thats when he found her he came flying out of her room after what he saw and was calling outshe pointed at the floor at richards feetbetween throwing up we all rushed out in the hall and saw him there on his knees heaved his guts out right there so he didnt come here to to and he never bridget guffawed i offeredno charge since he helped me and all with what he gave me he said that that wasnt why he had come he said he only wanted to help that he was a healer i offered mind you and i can be very persuasiveshe winkedbut he said no he has a real handsome smile he does just like yours lord rahl enter came the response to richards knock drefan was kneeling before his array of candles set about on the table against the wall his head was bowed and his hands were folded in supplication i hope im not interrupting richard said drefan looked back over his shoulder and then stood his eyes reminded richard of darken rahl drefan had the same blue eyes with the same indefinably odd unsettling look in them richard couldnt help being disquieted by them it sometimes made him feel as if darken rahl himself were staring at him people who had lived in fear of darken rahl were probably terrified when they looked into richards eyes too what are you doing richard asked praying to the good spirits to watch over the soul of someone whose soul drefan sighed he looked tired and doleful the soul of a woman no one cared about a woman named rose drefan nodded how did you know about her he waved off his own question forgive mei wasnt thinking youre the lord rahl i expect you get reports of such things yes well i do hear about things richard spotted something new in the room i see youve taken to brightening up the decor drefan saw where richard was looking and went to the chair beside the bed he returned with a small pillow he ran his fingers lovingly over the rose embroidered on it this was hers they didnt know where she came from so silashes the man who runs the housesilas insisted i take this for the small help i offer the women there i wont accept their money if they had money to spare they wouldnt be doing what they do richard wasnt an expert but the embroidered rose looked to be done with care do you think she made it drefan shrugged silas didnt know maybe she did maybe she saw it somewhere and bought it because it had a rose on it like her name he gently nibbled his thumb back and forth across the rose as he stared at it drefan what are you doing going to to places like that theres no shortage of people needing healing we have soldiers here who were wounded down by the pit theres plenty for you lo do why were you going to whorehouses drefan dragged a finger down the stem of green thread im seeing to the soldiers i go on my own time before people are up and need me but why go there at all drefans eyes welled with tears as he stared at the rose on the pillow my mother was a whore he whispered i am the son of a whore some of those women have children i could have been any one of them just like rose my mother took the wrong man to her bed no one knew rose no one knew who she was or where she came from i dont even know my own mothers nameshe wouldnt tell the healers she left me with only that she was a whore drefan im sorry that was a pretty stupid question no it was a perfectly logical question no one cares about those women i mean cares about them as people they get beaten bloody by the men who come to them they catch terrible diseases theyre scorned by other people herb sellers dont want them coming into their shopsit gives them a reputation and then decent people wont come around many of the things those women have even i dont know how to cure they suffer sad lingering deaths just for money some of them are drunks and the men prostitute them and pay them with liquor theyre drunk all the time and dont know the difference some of them think theyll find a rich man and be his mistress they think they will please him and gain his favor like my mother instead they have bastard children like me richard was mentally wincing he had been ready to believe that drefan was an unfeeling opportunist well if it makes you feel any better im the son of that bastard too drefan looked lip and smiled i guess so at least your mother loved you mine didnt she didnt even leave me her name dont say that drefan your mother loved you she took you to a place where you would be safe didnt she he nodded and left me there with people she didnt know but she left you because she had to so that you would be safe can you imagine how that must have hurt her can you imagine how it must have broken her heart to leave you with strangers she must have loved you a great deal to do that for you drefan smiled wise words my brother with a mind like that you might make something of yourself someday richard returned the smile sometimes we have to do desperate things to save the ones we love i have a grandfather who has great admiration for acts of desperation i think with your mother im beginning to understand what he means grandfather my mothers father richard idly stroked a finger along the raised gold wire spelling out the word truth on the hilt of his sword one of the greatest men ive ever had the honor of knowing my mother died when i was young and my fatherthe man i thought was my fatherwas often gone on his business as a trader zedd practically raised me i guess im more zedd than anyone else zedd had the gift richard had inherited the gift not only from darken rahl but also from zedd from his mothers side as well as his fathers from both bloodlines richard found comfort in knowing that the gift of a good man flowed in his veins and not just that of darken rahl is he still living richard looked away from drefans blue darken rahl eyes i believe he is i dont think anyone else does but i do sometimes i feel like if i dont believe then he will be dead drefan laid a hand on richards shoulder then keep believing you may be right youre fortunate to have a family i know because i dont you do now drefan you have a brother at least and soon a sisterinlaw thanks richard that means a lot to me how about you i hear you have half the women in the palace chasing after you any of them special drefan smiled distantly girls thats all girls who think they know what they want and are impressed by foolish things that shouldnt matter i see them all batting their eyelashes at you too some people are drawn to power people like my mother me youre seeing things drefan turned serious kahlan is beautiful youre a fortunate man to have a woman of such substance and noble character a woman like that only comes along once in a lifetime and then only if the good spirits smile on you i know im the luckiest man alive richard stared off thinking about the prophecy and the things he had read in kolos journal life wouldnt be worth living without her drefan laughed and slapped richard on the back if you werent my brother and a good one besides id steal her from you and have her for myself on second thought youd better be careful i may yet decide to have her richard smiled with him ill be careful drefan pointed an admonishing finger at richard you treat her right id not know how lo do otherwise richard swept a hand out indicating the small simple room and changed the subject what are you still doing here we can find you better quarters than this drefan gazed about at his room this is a kings room compared to my quarters at home we live simply this room is almost more ostentation than i can bear his brow drew down it isnt what kind of house you have that matters this is not happiness its what kind of mind you have and how you care for your fellow manwhat you can do to help others who can be helped by no one else richard adjusted the bands at his wrists they made him sweat under the leather pads youre right drefan he hadnt even realized it but he had come to be used to his surroundings since he had left hartland he had seen many splendid places his own home back in hartland wasnt nearly as nice as this plain room and he had been happy there he had been happy being a woods guide but as drefan said a person had to help others who could be helped in no other way he was stuck with being lord rahl kahlan was the balance now all he had to do was find the temple of the winds before he lost it all at least he had a woman he loved more than he would ever have thought possible and now too he had a brother drefan do you know the meaning of raugmoss i was taught that its old high dharan meaning divine wind do you know high dharan drefan brushed back his tumbleddown blond hair just that word i hear that youre their leader youve done well for yourself to become the leader of a community of healers its the only life ive ever known being the high priest though mostly means that they have someone to blame when things go wrong if someone we try to help doesnt gel better the healers point in my direction and say he is our leader talk to him being high priest means i have to read the reports and records and try to explain to distraught relatives that we are only healers and we cant revoke the keepers call sounds more impressive than it is really im sure you exaggerate im proud that youve done well what are the raugmoss where do they come from legend has it that the raugmoss were founded thousands of years ago by wizards whose gift was for healing the gift began dying out in the race of man and wizards especially ones gifted for healing became more and more rare drefan told richard the story of how the community of the raugmoss started to change as wizards began dying out worried that their work would die out with them the healers the wizard healers decided to take in apprentices without the gift over time there were fewer and fewer wizards to oversee the work until long ago the last of the wizards died it sounded to richard much like reading in kolos journal how different the keep had been in that time long past when it was filled with wizards and their families now there are no gifted among us drefan said the raugmoss were taught many keys of health and healing but we have nowhere near the talent of the wizards of old we have no magic to aid us we do what we can with the teachings the true healers of old passed down but we can only do so much its a simple life a hard life but it has rewards that comforts of belongings cant provide i understand it must be the best feeling in the world to help people drefans face took on a curious set what of you what is your gift your talent richard looked away from drefans eyes his hand tightened on the hilt of his sword i was born a war wizard he whispered i have been named fuer grissa ost drauka high dharan for the bringer of death the room fell quiet richard cleared his throat i was pretty distraught by that at first but since then ive come to understand that being a war wizard means that i have been born to help others by protecting them from those who would enslave them from those like our bastard fatherdarken rahl i understand drefan said into the uneasy silence sometimes the best use of our ability is to killsuch as to end a life that has no hope but pain or to end the life of one who would bring endless pain to others richard rubbed a thumb over the symbols on the silver bands at his wrist yes i understand what you mean by that now i dont think i did before we both must do things that we dont like but which must be done drefan smiled a small smile not many other than my healers ever understand it im glad you do sometimes killing is the greatest of charity i am careful to whom i speak those words it is good to have my brother understand them the same with me drefan before richard could ask more they were interrupted by a knock at the door raina poked her head in her long dark braid fell forward over her shoulder lord rahl do you have a moment what is it raina raina rolled her eyes indicating someone behind her nadine wishes to see you she seems upset about something and will only speak to you when richard gestured raina opened the door a little wider and nadine pushed her way in oblivious to rainas scowl richard you have to come with me she took up his hand in both of hers please please richard come with me theres someone here who desperately needs to see you who she looked to be genuinely troubled she tugged on his hand please richard richard was still wary mind if i bring drefan along of course not i was going to ask that you did lets go then if its really important she held his hand tight and dragged him behind her chapter richard spotted kahlan coming down the hall toward him she frowned at seeing nadine pulling him along by the hand drefan raina ulic and egan trailed behind him as they all wove their way past palace staff going about their chores and soldiers on patrol richard shrugged to kahlan nadine glared at kahlan before turning down the hall toward her room he wondered what that was all about annoyed richard yanked his hand away from nadines grip but kept following nadine skirted a walnut table against the wall beneath an old tapestry with a herd of whitetailed deer grazing before whitepeaked mountains in the background she checked over her shoulder to make sure richard was still with her kahlan and cara caught up kahlan fell in beside him well cara said from behind as she stroked her thick braid doesnt this look interesting richard shot her a scowl nadine turned and impatiently snatched his hand again you promised come on i promised nothing i said id go with you richard complained i didnt say i would run big strong lord rahl cant keep up with me nadine taunted the woods guide i remember could walk faster than this when he was half asleep i am half asleep he muttered the guards told me you were back and had gone to drefans room kahlan whispered to him i was on my way to meet you there whats this business with nadine her whispered question was laced with aggravation he noticed her quick glance to nadines hand gripping his beats me she wants me to see someone and must you hold her hand to do it she growled under her breath he yanked his hand away again kahlan stole a quick peek at drefan back behind cara and raina she twined her arm through richards how are you doing what did you find out richard put his hand over hers and gave it a squeeze everything is fine he whispered to her it wasnt what i thought ill tell you about it later what about the murderer has anyone found him yet yes someone found him and murdered him for his crime richard told her what about the representatives did you take care of it her answer was a moment in coming grennidon togressa and pendisan reach surrendered jara may yet but they wish to wait for two weeks for a sign from the sky richard frowned mardovia refused to join with us they choose to remain neutral richard jerked to a halt what everyone marching behind almost lurched into him they refuse to surrender they claim to be neutral the order doesnt recognize neutrality neither do we didnt you tell them that kahlans face showed nothing of course i did richard hadnt meant to yell at her he was angry at mardovia not her general reibisch is in the south maybe we could have him take mardovia before the order grinds them into carrion richard they were given a chance they are now the walking dead we cant waste the lives of our soldiers to take mardovia just so that we might protect them it would serve no purpose and it would weaken our effort nadine pushed between them and glared at kahlan you talked to that evil jagang you know what hes like those people will all die if you leave them to the order you just dont care about the lives of innocent people youre heartless from the corner of his eye richard saw a red flash as caras agiel spun up into her hand richard shoved nadine on ahead of him kahlan is right it just took a moment for it to sink in through my thick skull mardovia has chosen their own path they must walk it now if you want to show me someone then show me i have important things to do nadine huffed flipped her thick brown hair back over her shoulder and marched on cara and raina were scowling at the back of her head a scowl from a mordsith was more often than not prelude to a serious consequence richard had probably just spared nadine that consequence someday he was going to have to do something about shota before kahlan tried richard leaned toward kahlan im sorry im dead tired and i just wasnt thinking she squeezed his arm you promised you would get some sleep remember soon as i see to this business with nadine whatever it is at the door to her room nadine snatched richards hand again and tugged him in before he could object he saw the boy sitting on a red chair richard thought he recognized him as one of the jala players he had watched the boy was shuddering in tears when he saw richard coming into the room he jumped down off the chair and swiped the floppy wool hat from his head of blond hair he stood crushing his hat in his fists trembling expectantly tears coursing down his face richard crouched down before the boy im lord rahl i hear you need to see me whats your name he wiped his nose the tears kept coming yonick there now yonick whats the matter he could only get out the word brother before succumbing to gasping sobs richard took the boy in his arms and comforted him he wept in racking sobs as he clung to richard his misery was heartbreaking can you tell me whats the matter yonick please father rahl my brothers sick real sick richard stood the boy on his feet before him he is whats he sick with i dont know yonick cried we bought him herbs we tried everything hes so sick hes just been getting worse since i came to see you before since you came to see me before yes nadine snapped he came begging for your help a few days ago nadine thrust a finger at kahlan she sent him away kahlans face went crimson her jaw worked but no words came out all she cares about are her armies and fighting wars and hurting people she doesnt care about a miserable little boy whos sick she would only care if he was some fancy important diplomat she doesnt know what it is to be poor and sick with a glare richard froze caras advance he turned and glared at nadine thats enough drefan laid a hand on kahlans shoulder im sure you had a good reason you couldnt have known how sick his brother was no one is blaming you richard turned back to the boy yonick my brother here drefan is a healer take us to your brother and well see if we cant help him and i have herbs nadine said ill help your brother too yonick well do everything we can we promise yonick wiped his eyes please hurry kip is real sick kahlan looked on the verge of tears richard put a hand tenderly to her back he could feel her trembling he feared how sick the boys brother might be and wanted to spare her seeing it he feared she might blame herself why dont you wait here while we see to this her wet green eyes flashed up at him im going she said through gritted teeth richard gave up trying to remember the warren of narrow streets and twisting alleys they went down and simply noted where the sun was in the sky in order to keep his bearings as yonick led them through a maze of buildings and walled courtyards hung with laundry chickens flapped and squawked as they scattered out of the way some of the tiny walled courtyards held a few goats or sheep or a pig or two the animals seemed incongruous amid the tightly packed buildings overhead people carried on conversations from opposing windows some leaned out on elbows to have a look at the procession led by a boy it created quite a stir richard knew that it was the sight of lord rahl dressed in his black war wizards outfit with a gold cloak billowing out behind and the mother confessor in her pristine white dress that was the object of wonder rather than the knot of soldiers or two mordsithsoldiers were common and the city people probably didnt have a clue as to who the two women in brown leather were people in the streets and alleyways pushed their carts of vegetables wood or household goods to the side to get out of the way others stood against the walls and watched as if it were a miniature impromptu parade unexpectedly coming through their neighborhood at intersections soldiers on patrol cheered their lord rahl and called out their thanks for his curing their ailment richard held a light grip on kahlans hand she hadnt spoken a word since they left the palace he had made nadine walk behind between the two mordsith he hoped nadine knew enough to keep her mouth shut yonick pointed just up there they followed him as he turned from the street down a narrow alley between stone walls forming the bottom floors of houses with wood above for the second story water dripping from melting snow overhead splashed mud from the alley a few feet up onto the stone with one hand kahlan held richards and with the other she held the hem of her dress up as she followed him down the line of boards laid in the mud yonick paused at a door under a small shed roof people peered out windows to each side when richard caught up yonick opened the door and ran up the stairs calling out for his mother a door at the top of the stairs squeaked open a woman in a brown dress and white apron stared down at the boy running up the stairs maits lord rahl i brought lord rahl the good spirits be praised she said she rested a weary hand on her sons back as he threw his arms around her waist she lifted her other hand toward a doorway at the rear of the small room used as kitchen dining room and living area thank you for coming she mumbled to richard but she broke down in tears before she could finish yonick ran for the back room this way lord rahl richard squeezed the womans arm to reassure her as he swept past following yonick kahlan still gripped his other hand nadine and drefan followed on their heels with cara and raina close behind yonick balked at the bedroom door as the rest of them entered a single candle on a small table struggled to ward off the shroud of darkness a basin of water and soapy rags stood vigil beside the candle the rest of the room mostly taken up with three pallets seemed to be waiting for the candles diligence to flag so night could seize the room a small figure lay on the far pallet richard kahlan nadine and drefan crowded in beside it yonick and his mother silhouetted by the light from beyond the door stood at the brink of the darkness watching the room stank like rotting meat drefan pushed back the hood of his flaxen cloak open the shutters so i can see cara drew both open and folded them against the wall allowing the light to flood into the tiny room and reveal a blondheaded boy covered to his neck with a white sheet and blanket the side of his neck just above the sheet was grossly distended his uneven breaths rattled whats his name drefan called back to the mother kip she said in a whining cry drefan patted the boys shoulder were here to help you kip nadine leaned in yes kip well have you up and about in no time she put her hand back over her mouth and nose against the smell of rot that gagged them all the boy didnt respond his eyes were closed his sweaty hair was plastered against his forehead drefan drew the bed covers down to kips waist below his hands resting on his stomach the boys fingertips were black drefan stiffened dear spirits he breathed he rocked back on his heels and touched the back of his hand to the legs of the two mordsith towering behind them get richard out of here he whispered urgently get him out now without questioning cara and raina thrust hands under richards arms and started to pull him up richard jerked away from their grip whats going on he demanded whats the matter drefan wiped a hand across his mouth he glanced over his shoulder at the mother and yonick his gaze took in the rest of them before settling on richard he leaned closer this boy has the plague richard stared at him what do we have to do to cure him drefan lifted an eyebrow he turned back to the boy elevating a little hand look at his fingers the fingertips were black he pulled the bedcover aside look at his toes his toes were black he opened the boys trousers look at his penis the tip of it was black too thats gangrene it rots the extremities this is why they call it the black death richard cleared his throat what can we do for him drefans voice lowered even more with incredulity richard did you hear what i said black death people sometimes recover from the plague but not when its this advanced if we would have gotten to him sooner nadines imputation trailed off kahlans grip on richards forearm tightened painfully he heard her stifle a cry richard glared at nadine she looked away and do you know how to cure the plague herb woman drefan sneered well i nadine blushed and fell silent the boys eyes fluttered open his head rolled toward them lord rahl he said with a shallow breath richard put a hand on his shoulder yes kip i came to see you im here kip nodded the slightest bit i waited his chest rested longer between each breath what can you do lo help came a tearful question from the doorway how soon will he be well again drefan opened the collar of his white ruffled shirt as he leaned close to richard say something comforting to the boythats all we can do he wont last long ill go talk to the mother its part of the job of healer drefan stood pulling nadine away with him kahlan was leaning against richards shoulder he feared looking at her lest she break down in tears lest he break down in tears kip youll be up and playing jala soon youll be getting over this any day now id like to come watch another of your jala games i promise to come just as soon as youre better a faint smile passed over the boys face his eyelids closed partway his ribs sank as breath abandoned his lungs richard crouched feeling his heart pounding as he waited for the boys lungs to fill again they didnt silence settled into the room patiently waiting for darkness to return richard could hear the wheels of a handcart outside squeaking and the distant raucous cry of ravens the music of childrens laughter drifted in the air this child would never laugh again kahlans head fell against his shoulder soft sobs claimed her as she clutched his sleeve richard reached over to pull the sheet over the body the boys hand rose slowly off his stomach richard froze the hand floated purposefully to richards throat the black fingers curled gathering richards shirt in a death grip kahlan had fallen silent they both knew that the boy had died the boys hand drew richard closer the longsilent lungs filled once more with a breath richard the hair at the base of his neck stiffening put his ear close the winds the dead boy whispered hunt you chapter richard stared in a daze as drefan wrapped the dead boy in the sheet only richard and kahlan had seen what had happenedhad heard what the dead boy had said behind him in the outer room the mother wailed in anguish drefan leaned close to him richard drefan touched his arm richard richard started what what do you want to do do what do you mean drefan glanced over his shoulder at the rest of them back by the door what do you want to tell people about this i mean he died of the plague do you want to try to keep it a secret richard couldnt seem to make his mind work kahlan leaned past richard a secret why would we want to do that drefan took a deep breath well word of a plague might cause a panic if we let people know believe me word of it will beat us back to the palace do you think others have it she asked drefan shrugged i doubt there would be only one isolated case we have to bury or burn the body at once his bedcovers bed and anything else he touched should be burned the room should be treated with smoke wont people want to know why thats being done richard asked wont they guess the reason probably then how could it be kept a secret youre the lord rahl your word is law you would have to suppress any information arrest the family accuse them of a crime have them held until this is over have the soldiers carry off all their possessions to be burned and shut up their home richard closed his eyes and pressed his fingertips to them he was the seeker of truth not the suppressor of it we cant do that to a family who just lost a boy i wont do that besides wouldnt it be better if people knew dont people have a right to know of the danger theyre in drefan nodded if it were my decision i would want people to know ive seen the plague before in small places some have tried to suppress the knowledge of it to prevent panic but when more people started dying it couldnt be kept a secret richard felt as though the sky had fallen on him he struggled to make his mind work but the dead boys words kept echoing around in his head the winds hunt you if we try to lie to people they wont believe anything we say we have to tell them the truth theyve a right to know i agree with richard kahlan said we shouldnt try to deceive people especially about something that could endanger their lives drefan nodded his concurrence were fortunate at least with the time of year plague is worst in the heat of summer it could run rampant if this were summer in the colder weather of the spring it shouldnt be able to get a good foothold with luck the outbreak of plague will be weak and soon over luck richard muttered luck is for dreamers i only have nightmares we have to warn people drefans blue eyes looked to each in turn i understand and i agree with your reasoning the problem is theres not much to be done other than burying the dead quickly and burning their things there are remedies but i fear they are of limited value i just want to warn you news of plague will spread like a firestorm richards flesh prickled with goose flesh on the red moon will come the firestorm dear spirits spare us kahlan whispered she was thinking the same as he richard sprang up yonick he crossed the room rather than make the boy come to his dead brother yes lord rahl his brow creased as he struggled to hold back his tears richard put one knee to the floor and held the boys shoulders yonick im so sorry but your brother isnt suffering any longer hes with the good spirits now hes at peace and hoping we will remember the good times with him and not be too sad the good spirits will watch over him yonick brushed his blond hair aside but i i dont want you to blame yourself nothing could have been done nothing sometimes people get sick and none of us has the power to make them well no one could have done anything even if you had brought me right at the first we couldnt have done anything but you have magic richard felt heartsick not for this he whispered richard hugged yonick for a moment in the room beyond the mother wept onto rainas shoulder nadine was wrapping up some herbs for the woman and giving her instructions the woman nodded against rainas shoulder as she listened and sobbed yonick i need your help i need to go see the other boys on your jala team can you take us to their homes yonick wiped his sleeve across his nose why im afraid they might be sick too we have to know yonick glanced back at his mother with unspoken concern richard gestured for cara yonick wheres your father hes a felt maker he works down the street and three over to the right he works until late every day richard stood cara have some soldiers go and get yonicks father he should be here with his wife right now have a couple of soldiers take his place for today and tomorrow and help out as best they can so that his family wont lose the income tell raina to stay here with her until yonicks father comes home it shouldnt be long then she can catch up with us at the bottom of the stairs kahlan clutched his arm holding him back and asked drefan and nadine to wait outside with yonick while cara went to find his father kahlan closed the door to the alley leaving richard alone with her at the bottom of the dim stairwell she wiped the tears from her cheeks with trembling fingers her green eyes let slip more richard she swallowed and gasped a breath richard i didnt know there was marlin and the sister of the dark i never knew that yonicks brother was so sick or i would never richard held up a finger to silence her he realized though by the dread in her eyes that his scowl was what had silenced her dont you dare dignify nadines cruel lies with an explanation dont you dare i know you and would never believe such things about you never she closed her eyes with relief and fell against his chest that poor child she wept he stroked a hand down her long thick hair i know richard we both heard what that boy said after he died another warning that the temple of the winds has been violated she pushed herself back her green eyes searched his richard we have to reconsider everything now what you were telling me about the temple of the winds was only one source and not an official one at that it was just a journal kept by one man to keep himself occupied while he guarded the sliph besides that youve only read parts of it and its in high dharan which is difficult to translate accurately you may have been getting the wrong idea about the temple of the winds from the journal well i dont know that i would agree youre dead tired youre not thinking we now know the truth the temple of the winds isnt trying to send a warningits trying to kill you richard took pause at the concern on her face besides the grief he saw in her eyes he saw disquiet disquiet for him kolo didnt make it sound like that was what was happening from what ive read i think the red moon is a warning that the temple of the winds has been violated when the red moon came before kolo said everyone was in an uproar he didnt explain the uproar did he maybe it was because the temple was trying to kill them kolo said that the team who had sent the temple of the winds away had betrayed them richard face the facts that dead boy just delivered a threat from the temple of the winds the winds hunt you you hunt something when you want to kill it the temple of the winds is hunting youtrying to kill you then why didnt it kill me instead of the boy she didnt have an answer out in the alley drefans blue darken rahl eyes watched richard and kahlan returning over the boards in the mud it seemed as if the process of deep reflection could be glimpsed through those eyes richard guessed that healers had to be keen observers of people but those eyes made him feel somehow naked at least he saw no magic in them nadine and yonick waited in mute anxiety richard whispered to kahlan to wait with drefan and yonick he took nadines arm nadine would you come with me a moment please she beamed up at him sure richard he helped her step up into the stairwell as richard closed the door she fussed with her hair when the door was shut he turned to the smiling nadine and slammed her back against the wall so hard it drove the wind from her lungs she pushed off the wall richard he seized her by the throat and smacked her against the wall again holding her there you and i were never going to be married the swords magic its fury was bleeding into his voice it was coursing through his veins we never are going to be married i love kahlan i am going to marry kahlan the only reason you are still here is because you are somehow tangled in this you are going to remain here for now until we can figure it out i can and i have forgiven you for what you did to me but if you ever again say or do anything so cruel and deliberately hurtful to kahlan you will spend the rest of your time in aydindril down in the pit do you understand me nadine put her fingers tenderly to his forearm she smiled patiently as if she thought he didnt fully grasp the situation and she would make him see her reasoned side of it richard i know youre upset right now everyone is but i was only trying to warn you i didnt want you to be unaware of what had happened i only wanted you to know the truth about what she had he slammed her against the wall again do you understand me she watched his eyes a moment yes she said as if believing that there was no use in trying to reason with him until he cooled off it only made richard more angry he struggled to rein it in so that he could get across to her that this was more than anger and that he meant what he was saying i know you have good in you nadine i know that you care about people we were friends back in hartland so im going to let this go with a warning you had better mind my words there is trouble about a lot of people are going to need help you always wanted to help people im giving you your chance to do that i can use your help but kahlan is the woman i love and the woman im going to marry i wont have you trying to change that or trying to hurt her dont you so much as think to test this again or i will find another herb woman to help are you clear on that yes richard whatever you say i promise if shes what you really want then ill not interfere no matter how wrong he held up a finger your toe is on the line nadine if you step over it i swear there will be no coming back yes richard she smiled in an understanding patient longsuffering way whatever you say she seemed to be satisfied that he had paid attention to her it reminded him of a child who misbehaved so that a beloved parent would notice her he glared at her until he was sure she would not say another word and only then did he open the door drefan was squatted down whispering words of comfort to yonick while he rested a hand on the boys shoulder kahlans green eyes watched as nadine reached back for richards hand to help her balance as she stepped onto the narrow board in the mud drefan richard said when he had joined them i need to talk to you about some of the things you said in there drefan rubbed yonicks back and then stood what things about how you wanted cara and raina to get me out of there for one thing i want to know why drefan considered richard a moment and then yonick he drew open his cloak hooking it behind one of the leather pouches on his belt he opened the pouch at the front of his belt and poured some dried powder from a leather purse onto a piece of paper he twisted the paper closed and handed it to the boy yonick before we go to see the other boys would you please take this up to your mother and tell her to steep it in hot water for a couple of hours to make a tea and then strain it and see that everyone in your family drinks it tonight it will help build up your familys strength to keep them well yonick looked at the paper in his hand sure ill be back as soon as i tell my mother no rush drefan said well be waiting when youre through richard watched yonick close the door all right i know you wanted me out of there because of the danger of catching the plague from the sick boy but were all in danger arent we yes but i dont know how much you are the lord rahl i wanted you as far away as possible how do you catch the plague drefan glanced to kahlan and nadine and then to ulic and egan back with the soldiers guarding either end of the alley he took a deep breath no one knows how the plague is passed from one person to the next or even if that is the way it spreads there are some who believe that its the wrath of the spirits brought down on us and the spirits decide who they will smite there are others who argue that the effluvia infest the very air of a place of a city endangering everyone others insist that it can only be caught by inhaling the infectious steams of the body of a sick person i can only assume for the sake of caution that like fire the closer you are the more dangerous it is i didnt want you close to that danger thats all richard was so tired that he felt sick only his terror kept him on his feet kahlan had been near the boy too so youre saying that its possible we could all get it just from being in the same house as someone who has it its possible but the sick boys family doesnt have it and they lived with him his mother tended to him wouldnt she have it at least if that were true drefan considered his words carefully several times i have seen isolated outbreaks of the plague one time when i was young and in training i went with an older healer to a town castaglen crossing that had been visited with the plague from this place i learned much of what i know about the sickness it started when a merchant came with his wagon of goods to sell it was reported that when he arrived he was coughing vomiting and complaining of agonizing headaches in other words the plague was already upon him before he arrived in castaglen crossing we never knew where he came to have it but it could have been that he drank envenomed water stayed with a sick farmer or that the spirits chose to strike him with it the townspeople wishing to do a trusted merchant a kindness put him up in a room where he died the next morning everyone remained well for a time and they thought the danger had passed them by they soon forgot about the man who had died among them because of the confusion brought on by the sickness and death by the time we arrived the accounts were varied but we were able to determine that the first townsperson became sick with the plague at least fourteen days by some accounts or as many as twenty days by others after the merchant arrived richard pinched his lower lip as he thought kip was well at the jala game a few days back so that would mean that he really became ill with it sometime before despite being mournful over the boys death richard felt great relief that what he had been thinking didnt seem to be plausible if kip got the plague long before the jala game then jagang didnt have anything to do with it the prophecy wasnt involved but then why the warning of the winds hunting him that would also mean drefan said that the dead boys family may yet become sick they look well at the moment but they may already be fatally infected with plague just as were the people of castaglen crossing then nadine said we may all have caught it just from being in the room with the boy that awful smell was his sickness we may all have the plague from breathing it in but wont know it for a couple of weeks yet drefan shot her a condescending look i cant deny that its possible do you wish to run away herb woman and spend the next two or three weeks preparing for death by living out the things you always wanted to do nadine lifted her chin no im a healer i intend to help drefan smiled in that private knowing way he had good then a true healer is above the phantom evils he chases but she may be right richard said we may all already be infected with the plague drefan lifted a hand warding off the concern we mustnt let fear rule us when i was in castaglen crossing i cared for many people who were in deaths grip people just like that boy so did the man who took me there we never became sick i was never able to determine any pattern to the plague we touched the sick every day and never became sick possibly because we were with the sick so much that our bodies knew it well and were able to strengthen us against its corruption sometimes a member of a family would come down sick and thereafter every member of the family even those who stayed away from the sick room succumbed to the plague and all died in other homes i witnessed one or even several children come down sick with the plague and die yet their mothers who tended them nearly every moment never became ill nor did any other member of the household richard sighed in frustration drefan all this isnt very helpful maybe this maybe that sometimes yes sometimes no drefan wiped a hand wearily across his face im just telling you what ive seen richard there are people who will tell you for sure that it is this or it is that shortly there will be people in the streets who will be selling indisputable cures unquestionable preservatives against the plague hucksters all what i am telling you is that i dont know the answers sometimes knowledge is beyond our limited understanding its one of our tenets as healers that it is a wise man who admits the limits of his knowledge and skill and that pretending either causes harm of course richard felt foolish to have pressed for answers that werent there youre right of course its better to know the truth than hang hope on lies richard looked to see where the sun was in the sky but clouds were moving in obscuring it a cold wind was coming up at least it wasnt hot drefan had said that the plague spread worst in heat he looked back at drefan are there any herbsor anythingthat you do know will help prevent it or cure it a standard precaution is to treat the home of sick people with smoke it is said the smoke may purge the air of the effluvia there are herbs that are recommended for smoking sick rooms i would think it a wise precaution at least but i wouldnt count on it there are other herbs that can help with the complaints of the plaguethe headaches sickness of the stomach things like thatbut none that i know of that will cure the plague itself even with these treatments the person will likely die just the same but they may have some comfort from the herbs before they pass kahlan touched drefans arm do all the people who come down with the plague die are all who catch it doomed drefan smiled in reassurance to her no some recover in the beginning not as many and in the end of the outbreak more sometimes if the infection can be urged to a head and the poison drained away then the person will recover but will complain for the rest of their life about the torture of the treatment richard saw yonick come out the door he put his arm around kahlans waist and pulled her close so we all may already be infected drefan watched his eyes a moment its possible but i dont believe it so richards head was pounding but it wasnt from any plague it was from lack of sleep and dread well then lets go to the other boys homes and see what we can find out we need to know as much as we can chapter the first boy they went to see mark was fine mark was happy to see yonick and wondered why he hadnt seen him and his brother kip for the last few days the young mother was frightened by the important strangers who had appeared at her door inquiring after the health of her son richard was relieved that mark who had been in the jala game with yonick and his brother wasnt sick so far only one boy who had been at the jala game had become sick it was looking more and more as if his fears about jagang were just panicked inferences richard was beginning to feel the warmth of hope yonick told a stunned mark of kips death richard told the mother to send for drefan if any of the family fell ill richard left the home feeling much better the second boy sidney had been dead since morning by the time they found the third boy lying in blankets at the rear of a oneroom house richards hopes had faded bert was gravely ill but at least his extremities werent black as kips had been his mother told them that he had a headache and had been throwing up while drefan saw to the boy nadine gave the woman herbs sprinkle these on the fire nadine told berts mother its mugwort fennel and hussuck theyll smoke and help drive away the sickness bring hot coals to your boy put a pinch of the herbs on the coals and fan the smoke at your son to insure that he breathes enough of it it will help drive the sickness from him do you think that will really help richard whispered when nadine returned to his side near the boy drefan said he doesnt know if it will i was taught that it was said to help serious sickness like the plague she said in a low voice but ive never seen anyone with the plague before so i cant say for sure richard its all i know to do i have to try even though he was dead tired and had a headache richard had no trouble sensing the helplessness in her voice she wanted to help as drefan had said maybe it would do some good richard watched as drefan pulled a knife from his belt he gestured for cara and raina who had both caught up with them after taking care of richards instructions to hold down the sick boy raina gripped berts chin with one hand and held his forehead with the other cara pressed his shoulders into the blankets with a steady hand drefan lanced the swelling at the side of the boys throat berts screams seared richards nerves he could almost feel the knife slicing his own throat the mother wrung her hands as she stood off a ways watching with unblinking eyes richard remembered drefan saying that if the person lived they would complain the rest of their life about the torture of the treatment bert would have cause what did you give kips mother kahlan asked nadine i gave her some herbs to smoke the house the same as i gave this woman nadine said and i made her a pouch of hop cone lavender yarrow and lemon balm leaves to put in her pillow so that she might sleep even so i dont know that she will be able to sleep after her eyes turned away i know that i wouldnt be able to she whispered almost to herself do you have any herbs that you think might prevent the plague richard asked things that would keep people from catching it nadine watched drefan mopping blood and pus from the boys throat im sorry richard but i dont know enough about it drefan might be right he seems to know a lot there may be no cure or preventative richard went to the boy and squatted down beside drefan watching his brother work why are you doing that drefan glanced over as he folded the rag to a clean place as i said before sometimes if the sickness can be brought to a head and drained they will recover i have to try drefan gestured to the two mordsith they gripped the boy again richard winced as he watched drefan slide the sharp knife deeper into the swelling bringing forth more blood and yellowishwhite fluid mercifully bert passed out richard wiped sweat from his own brow he felt helpless he had his sword to defend against attack but it could do no good against this he wished it was something he could fight behind him nadine spoke to kahlan in a soft voice but loud enough for richard to hear kahlan i sorry about what i said before ive devoted my life to helping sick people it makes me so upset to see people suffer thats what i was angry about not you i was frustrated at yonicks grief and i lashed out at you it wasnt your fault nothing could have been done im sorry richard didnt turn kahlan said nothing but she might have offered nadine a smile to accept the apology somehow richard doubted it he knew kahlan and he knew that she expected as much from others as she expected from herself forgiveness was not forthcoming simply because someone asked for it the transgression was weighed into the equation and there were transgressions that outweighed absolution the apology hadnt been for kahlan anyway it had been for richards benefit like a child who had been upbraided nadine was on her best behavior trying to impress him with how good she could be sometimes even though she had once brought him pain a part of him was comforted to have nadine around she reminded him of home and his happy childhood she was a familiar face from a carefree time another part of him was troubled over what her real purpose was in coming despite what she might believe she hadnt decided it on her own someone or something had precipitated her actions another part of him wanted to skin her alive after they left berts home yonick led them down a cobbled alley to a yard behind where darby andersens family lived the srnall yard of mud churned with wood shavings was cluttered with cutoffs and scraps several stickered stacks of lumber protected by tarps some old rusty twoman rip saws two carving benches and warped split or twisted boards leaning up against the buildings to the side darby recognized richard and kahlan from the jala game he was astonished that they had come to his home to have them come to see a jala game was a cause of great pride but to have them come to his home was beyond belief he frantically brushed sawdust from his short brown hair and dirty work clothes yonick had told richard that the whole anderson familydarby his two sisters his parents fathers parents and an auntlived over their small workshop clive anderson darbys father and erling his grandfather made chairs both men having heard the commotion had come to the wide double doors and were bowing forgive us mother confessor lord rahl clive said after darby had introduced his father but we didnt know you were coming or we would have made preparationsid have had my wife make tea or something im afraid that were just simple folk please dont be concerned about any of that master anderson richard said we came because we were concerned about your son erling the grandfather took a stem step toward darby whats the boy done its nothing like that richard said you have a fine grandson we watched him play jala the other day one of the other boys is sick worse two others of them have died darbys eyes widened died who kip yonick said his voice choking off and sidney richard added bert is very ill too darby stood in shock his grandfather put a comforting hand to the boys shoulder my brother drefan richard lifted a hand to the sideis a healer were checking on all the boys on the jala team we dont know if drefan can help but he would like to try im fine darby said in a shaky voice erling an unshaven scrawny man had teeth so crooked richard wondered how he managed to chew his food he noticed kahlans white dress and richards gold cloak billowing in the cold wind and gestured toward the shop please wont you all step inside the wind is biting today its warmer inside out of the weather i think well have snow tonight the way it looks ulic and egan took up posts near the back gate soldiers milled about in the alley richard kahlan nadine and drefan went into the shop cara and raina shadowed them inside but remained on guard near the doors old chairs and templates hung from pegs on the dusty walls cobwebs in all the corners that in a forest would have netted dew here netted loads of sawdust the workbench held chair pieces being glued up a finetoothed saw a variety of smaller finishing and heading planes and a number of chisels several jack and long joiner planes hung on the wall behind the bench along with hammers and other tools partially finished chairs cinched tightly together in twisted ropes as they were being finished or drying in pegandwedge clamps sat about the floor a carving horse where the grandfather had been when they came into the yard held a split billet of ash he had been working with a drawknife clive a broadshouldered young man seemed content to let his father do the talking whats ailing these children erling asked drefan drefan cleared his throat but let richard answer richard was so tired he could hardly stand anymore he almost felt as if he were asleep and this was just a bad dream the plague im relieved to see that darby here is well erlings scruffy jaw dropped dear spirits spare us clive turned white my daughters are sick he turned suddenly and ran for the stairs but stopped abruptly please master drefan will you see them of course show the way upstairs darbys mother grandmother and aunt had been making meat pies turnips were boiling in a pot hung in the hearth and the boiling water had steamed the windows over the three women alarmed by clives calls were waiting wideeyed in the center of the upstairs common room they were shocked by the sight of the strangers but bowed the instant they saw kahlans white dress kahlan in the dress of the mother confessor needed no introduction to anyone in aydindril or most of the midlands for that matter hattie this man here master drefan is a healer and has come to see the girls hattie her short sandycolored hair tied back with a head wrap wiped her hands on her apron her gaze darted among all the people standing in her home thank you this way please how do they fare drefan asked hattie on their way back to the bedroom beth has complained since yesterday of her head hurting hattie said she was sick at her stomach earlier common children ailments thats all it sounded to richard more like a plea than a statement of fact i gave her some black horehound tea to settle her thats good nadine assured her an infusion made of pennyroyal might help too i have some with me ill leave in case she needs it thank you for the kindness hattie said her concern growing with each step she took what of the other girl drefan asked hattie had almost reached the doorway lilys not so sick but just feeling out of sorts i suspect shes just looking for sympathy because her older sister is getting attention and honey tea thats the way of children she has some little round sores on her legs drefan missed a step beth was fevered but not gravely so she had a wet cough and complained that her head hurt drefan all but ignored her he watched lily in that analytical way of his as she sat in her blankets carrying on an earnest conversation with her rag doll the grandmother fussed with her collar and watched from the doorway as hattie fussed with beths covers the aunt mopped beths brow with a wet cloth while nadine spoke words of comfort to the girl nadine really did have a soothing kind way about her she selected herbs from leather pouches in her bag and wrapped them up in several cloth packets giving the intent nodding mother instructions richard and kahlan moved with drefan over to the younger girl kahlan squatted down and talked to her telling her what a lovely doll she had so as to keep her from being frightened by richard and drefan lily cast worried looks in their direction as she chattered with kahlan kahlan hugged an arm around richards waist to show lily that he wasnt anyone to be afraid of richard made himself smile lily drefan said with forced cheerfulness could you show me your dolls sores lily held the doll upside down and pointed out spots on the inside of the dolls thighs she has ouches here and here and here her big round eyes turned up to drefan and do they hurt her lily nodded she goes ouch when i touch them really well thats too bad ill bet shes better soon though he squatted down so that he wasnt towering over her circling an arm around kahlans waist and pulling her back down with him lily this is my friend kahlan her eyes arent so good she cant see the sores on your dolls legs could you show kahlan here the ones on your legs nadine was still talking to the mother about the other girl lily glanced in their direction kahlan brushed lilys hair back and told her what a pretty doll she had lily grinned she was fascinated by kahlans long hair kahlan let her feel it can you show me the ouches on your legs kahlan asked lily hiked up her white nightdress here they are just like my dolls ouches she had several dark spots the size of pennies on the inside of each thigh richard could tell when drefan gently touched them that they were hard as calluses kahlan straightened lilys nightdress back down and drew the blanket back over her lap as drefan patted her cheek telling her what a good girl she was and that her dolls ouches would be better by morning im glad lily said she doesnt like them erling was absently planing a chair seat at the workbench richard could see that he wasnt paying any attention to what he was doing and was ruining it he didnt look up when they came down the stairs at richards urging clive had stayed upstairs with his wife and daughters do they have it erling asked in a hoarse voice drefan laid a comforting hand on the old mans shoulders im afraid so erling took a shaky crooked stroke with his plane when i was young i lived in the town of sparlville the plague came one summer it took a good many people i hoped never to see such a thing again i understand drefan said in a soft voice i too have seen it visit places theyre my only granddaughters what can we do to help them you can try to smoke the house drefan offered erling grunted we did that in sparlville bought cures and preventatives too but people died just the same i know drefan said i wish there was something i could do but ive never heard of a sure cure if you know of anything that you think helped when you were young then try it i dont know of all the treatments by any means at worst it could do no harm and at best may help erling set the plane aside some folk burned fires hot that summer trying to drive the sickness from their blood some said it was because their blood was too hot already with the high summer heat and with the fever on top of that and tried to fan their loved ones to cool their blood which would you advise drefan shook his head im sorry but i just dont know ive heard of people recovering when each was tried and ive heard of people dying just the same with each some things are out of our hands no one can stay the keepers hand when he comes erling rubbed his scruffy chin ill pray that the good spirits spare the girls his voice caught theyre too good too innocent for the keeper to touch them just yet theyve brought untold joy to this house and family drefan returned his hand to erlings shoulder im sorry master anderson but lily has the tokens upon her erling gasped and gripped the bench drefan had been ready and caught him under his arms to keep him from falling when his knees gave out drefan helped him to sit on the carving horse kahlan turned her face away and put it to richards shoulder when erling covered his tears with both hands richard felt numb grandpa darby called from the steps whats wrong erling straightened nothing boy im just worried about your sisters thats all old men get foolish thats all darby eased the rest of the way down the stairs yonick im real sorry about kip if your pa needs anything im sure my pa would let me leave my work and go help yonick nodded he looked in a daze too richard squatted down before the boys did either of you see anything strange at the jala game strange darby asked strange like what richard combed his fingers back through his hair i dont know did you talk to any strangers sure darby said there were lots of people there we didnt know soldiers were there watching the game lots of people i didnt know came to congratulate us after we won do any of them stand out in your mind anything odd about any of them i saw kip talking to a man and a woman after the game yonick said more than like they were just congratulating him they were leaning down talking to him showing him something showing him something what im sorry yonick said but i didnt see i was too busy getting slapped on the back by soldiers richard was trying not to frighten the boy with his questions but he had to press for answers what did this man and woman look like i dont know yonick said his eyes were filling with tears at remembering his brother alive the man was skinny and young the woman was young too but not as young as he she was kind of pretty i guess she had brown hair he pointed at nadine like hers but not as thick or as long richard glanced up at kahlan by the stricken look on her face he knew she was fearing the same thing as he i remember them darby said my sisters talked to that man and woman too but neither of you talked to them no darby said yonick shook his head we were jumping around excited that wed won the game in front of lord rahl a lot of the soldiers were congratulating us and so were a lot of other people i never talked to those two richard took kahlans hand kahlan and i have to go ask beth and lily a question he said to drefan well be right back pressed close together seeking support in each others touch they climbed the stairs richard was dreading what he might hear from the girls you ask them richard whispered to her theyre afraid of me theyll talk easier to you do you think it could have been them richard didnt need to ask who she was talking about i dont know but you told me that jagang said he had watched the jala gamethrough marlins eyes sister amelia was with marlin they were doing something here in aydindril richard reassured the women that they just had a small question to ask the girls the women busied themselves with their work while he went with kahlan back into the bedroom richard doubted they were paying any more attention to their meat pies than erling had been with the chair seat he had been planing lily kahlan asked the younger girl first in a soft voice as she smiled do you remember when you went to watch your brother play jala lily nodded he won we were real happy that he won pa said darby scored a point yes we saw him play and we were happy for him too do you remember the two people you talked to a man and a woman she frowned when ma and pa were cheering that man and woman yes do you remember what they said to you beth was holding my hand they asked if it was my brother we was cheering for thats right beth said from the other bed she had to stop talking as she was taken with a bout of coughing when she recovered and caught her breath she went on they said darby played really good they showed us the pretty thing they had richard stared at her pretty thing the shiny thing in the box lily said thats right beth said they let me and lily see it what was it beth frowned through her headache it was it was i dont know exactly it was in a box that was so black you couldnt see its sides the shiny thing inside was pretty lily nodded her agreement my doll saw it too she thought it was real pretty too do you have any idea what it was they both shook their heads it was in a box that was as black as midnight to look at it is like looking down a dark hole richard said they both nodded sounds like the night stone kahlan whispered to him richard knew well that blackness not only the night stone had been like that but also the outer covering of the boxes of orden it was a color so sinister that it seemed to suck the very light from a room in richards experience that void of light was only associated with immensely dangerous things the night stone could bring beings forth from the underworld and the boxes of orden held magic that if used for evil could destroy the world of life the boxes could open a gateway to the underworld and inside was something shiny richard said was it like looking at a candle or the flame of a lamp that kind of shiny colors lily said it was pretty colors like colored light beth said it was sitting on white sand sitting on white sand the hairs on the back of richards neck stood on end how big was the box beth held her hands not quite a foot apart about this big on a side but it wasnt very thick kind of like a book it was almost like they opened a book thats what the box reminded me ofa book and inside the sand that was inside did it have lines drawn in it kind of like if you were to draw lines in dry dirt with a stick beth nodded as she succumbed to a bout of rattling coughs she panted catching her breath when they finally ceased thats right neat lines in patterns thats just what it was like it was a box or maybe a big book and when they opened it to show us the pretty colors it had white sand in it with careful lines drawn in it then we saw the pretty colors you mean there was something sitting in the sand this thing that made the colored light was sitting in the sand beth blinked in confusion trying to remember no it was more like the light came out of the sand she flopped back on her bed and rolled on her side in obvious distress from her sickness from the plague from black death from a black box richard stroked a hand tenderly down her arm and pulled the blanket back up over her as she moaned in pain thank you beth you rest now and get yourself better richard couldnt thank lily he dared not trust his voice lily lay back her tiny little brow puckered im tired she pouted near tears i dont feel good she curled up and put her thumb in her mouth kahlan tucked lily in and promised her a treat as soon as she was well kahlans tender smile brought a small smile to lilys mouth it almost made richard smile almost in the alley after they had left the anderson house richard pulled drefan aside kahlan told the others to wait and then she joined them what are tokens richard asked you told the grandfather that the youngest had tokens on her those spots on her legs are called tokens and why was the old man nearly struck down with dread when he heard you say the girl had them drefans blue eyes turned away people die of the plague in different ways i dont know the reason except to imagine it has something to do with their constitution the strength and vulnerability of everyones aura is different ive not seen with my own eyes all manner of death the plague causes as thankfully it is a rare occurrence some of what i know i learned from the records that the raugmoss keep the plagues ive seen have been in small remote places in the past many centuries ago there have been a few great plagues in large cities and ive read the records of those with some people it comes on of a suddenvery high fevers intolerable headaches vomiting searing pains in their backs they are out of their minds with the agony of it for many days even weeks before they die a few of these recover beth is like that she will get much worse yet i have seen people like her recover she has a small chance sometimes they look like the first boy with the black death overwhelming them and rotting their bodies others are tortured with horribly painful swellings in their neck armpits or groin they suffer miserably until they finally die bert is like that if the distemper can be brought to a head and encouraged to break and run then they occasionally recover what about lily kahlan asked what about these tokens as you called them ive never seen them before with my own eyes but ive read about them in our records the tokens will appear on the legs and sometimes on the chest people who have the tokens rarely know they are sick until the end they will one day discover to their horror that they have the tokens upon them and be dead shortly thereafter they die with little or no pain but they all die no one with tokens on them ever lives the old man must have seen them before because he knew this the plagues ive seen as violent as the outbreaks were never displayed the tokens the records say that the worst of the great plagues the ones that brought the most widespread death were marked with the tokens some people thought they were visible signs of the keepers fatal touch but lily is just a little girl kahlan protested as if arguing could change it she doesnt seem so sick it isnt possible for her to lily is feeling out of sorts the tokens on her legs are fully developed she will be dead before midnight tonight richard asked in astonishment yes at the very latest more likely within hours i think perhaps even a womans long shrill scream came from the house the horror in it sent a shiver through richards bones the soldiers who had been talking in low voices off at the end of the alley fell silent the only sound was a dog barking down the next street a mans anguished cry came from the house drefan closed his eyes as i was about to say even sooner kahlan buried her face against richards shoulder she clutched his shirt richards head spun theyre children she wept that bastard is killing children drefans brow bunched whats she talking about drefan richard tightened his arms around kahlan as she shooki think these children are dying because a wizard and a sorceress went to a jala game a few days back and used magic to start this plague thats not possible it takes longer than that for people to fall sick the wizard was the one who hurt cara when you first arrived he left a prophecy on the wall in the pit it begins on the red moon will come the firestorm drefan regarded him with a dubious frown how can magic start a plague i dont know richard whispered he couldnt bear to speak aloud the next part of the prophecy the one bonded to the blade will watch as his people die if he does nothing then he and all those he loves will die in its heat for no blade forged of steel or conjured of sorcery can touch this foe kahlan trembled in his arms and he knew she was agonizing over the final part of the prophecy to quench the inferno he must seek the remedy in the wind lightning will find him on that path for the one in white his true beloved will betray him in her blood chapter at the edge of the expansive palace grounds a patrol of dharan soldiers spotted them and snapped to attention just beyond the soldiers in the streets of the city kahlan could see people everywhere going about their business pause to bow to the mother confessor and the lord rahl although the activities of commerce on the surface seemed like any other day kahlan thought she could detect subtle differences men loading barrels into a wagon scrutinized people who passed close by shopkeepers appraised customers carefully people walking on the street skirted those stopped in conversation the knots of people gossiping seemed more numerous laughter was conspicuously absent from the streets after they had solemnly saluted with fists to the leather armor and chain mail over their hearts the patrol of soldiers not far off broke into goodnatured grins huzzah lord rahl they cheered as one huzzah lord rahl thank you lord rahl one of the soldiers shouted toward them you cured us restored our health were well because of you long live the great wizard lord rahl richard froze in midstride not looking at the soldiers but staring at the ground before him his cloak snared in a gust of wind embraced him shrouding him in its golden sparkles the others joined in long live lord rahl long live lord rahl hands balled in fists richard started out once more without looking their way kahlan her arm around his slid her hand down and urged his fist open to twine her fingers in his she gave his hand a squeeze of silent understanding and support from the corner of her eye kahlan could see cara back behind drefan and nadine gesturing angrily at the patrol to silence them and move them along in the distance before them on a gentle rise the expanse of the confessors palace rose up in all its splendor of stone columns vast walls and elegant spires standing out a pristine white against the darkening sky not only was the sun going down but murky clouds scudded by messengers delivering a vow of a storm a few errant snowflakes flitted past on the wind scouting for the horde to come spring had not yet prevailed kahlan gripped richards hand as if clutching at life itself in her minds eye she saw nothing but sickness and death they had seen near to a dozen sick children stricken with plague richards pallid face looked hardly better that the six dead faces she had seen her insides ached holding back her tears her cries her screams had cramped her stomach muscles she had told herself that she couldnt lose control and cry in front of mothers who were terrified that their sick children might be sicker than they had imagined or as sick as they knew but refused to believe many of those mothers were hardly older than kahlan they were just young women faced with a crushing plight who fell to piteous prayer for the good spirits to spare their precious children kahlan couldnt say that she wouldnt have been reduced to the same state in their place some of the parents like the andersons had older members of their families to rely on for advice and support but some of the mothers were young and alone with only husbands hardly more than boys themselves and no one to turn to kahlan put her free hand over the painful spasm in her abdomen she knew how devastated richard felt he had more than enough to carry on his shoulders she had to be strong for him majestic maple trees stood to each side the bare thicket of branches laced together over their heads it wouldnt be long before they budded they passed out from the tunnel of trees onto the winding promenade that led up to the palace behind them drefan and nadine carried on a whispered discussion of herbs and cures to be tried nadine would propose something and drefan would give his opinion as to whether it would be useless or might be worth trying he would gently lecture her on the paths of infirmity and the causes of breaks in the bodys defenses that allowed an affliction to gain hold kahlan got the vague impression that he almost seemed to view those who fell sick with contempt as if because they took so little care with their auras and flows of energy that he talked about all the time it was only to be expected that they would succumb to a pestilence unworthy of those like himself who minded their bodies better she guessed that one with his knowledge of healing people must get frustrated with those who brought disease upon themselves like the prostitutes and the men who went to them she was relieved at least that he wasnt one of those kahlan wasnt sure if she felt drefan was justified in some of the things he was saying or if it was simple arrogance she herself had felt frustration at people who flouted dangers to their health when she was younger there was a diplomat who became ill every time he ate rich sauces with certain spices they always left him with difficulty breathing he loved the sauces then one time at a formal dinner he gorged himself on the sauces he loved and fell dead at the table kahlan could never understand why the man would bring such sickness on himself and had trouble feeling sorry for him in fact she always viewed him with contempt when he came to a formal dinner she wondered if drefan didnt feel much the same way about some people except that he knew much more of what made people sick she had seen drefan do remarkable things with caras aura and she knew too that sickness could sometimes be influenced by the mind kahlan had on a number of occasions stopped in a small place called langden where lived a very superstitious and backward people it was decided by their powerful local healer that the headaches that so bothered the people of langden must be caused by evil spirits possessing them he ordered whitehot irons put to the bottoms of the feet of those with headaches to drive out the evil spirits it was a remarkable cure no one in langden was ever possessed again the headaches vanished if only the plague could vanish so easily if only nadine could vanish so easily they couldnt send her away now when there would be so much need among the people like it or not nadine was going to be around until this was over shota seemed to be tightening her clutches around richard kahlan didnt know what richard had said to nadine but she could imagine nadine had suddenly been stricken with overt politeness kahlan knew nadines apology hadnt been sincere richard had probably told her that if she didnt apologize he would boil her alive with the way caras gaze so often passed over nadine kahlan suspected that nadine had more to worry about than richard kahlan and richard led the rest of their group between the towering white columns set to each side of the entrance through the open doors carved with geometric designs and into the palace the cavernous grand hall inside was lit by windows of pale blue glass set between polished white marble columns topped with gold capitals and by dozens of lamps spaced along the walls a leatherclad figure in the distance wandered toward them across the blackandwhite marble squares someone else approached from the right side from the guest rooms richard slowed to a stop and turned ulic would you please go find general kerson he might be at the dharan headquarters does anyone know where general baldwin is hes probably at keltons palace on kings row kahlan said hes been staying there since he arrived and helped us defeat the blood of the fold richard nodded wearily kahlan didnt think she had ever seen him looking worse his spiritless eyes stared out from an ashen face he swayed on his feet as he squinted looking for egan not ten feet away egan there you are go get general baldwin please i dont know where he is but you can ask around egan cast a quick uneasy glance toward kahlan would you like us to bring anyone else lord rahl anyone else yes tell them to bring their officers ill be in my office bring them there ulic and egan both clapped fists to hearts before turning to their duties as they departed they conveyed a message through quick hand signals to the two mordsith in response cara and raina maneuvered closer to richard screening him as tristan bashkar came to a wary halt berdine meandered up on the other side her rapt attention on the open journal in her hands she seemed completely absorbed in what she was studying and oblivious to anything around her kahlan put out a hand to stop her before she bumped into richard she rocked to a halt like a rowboat that had drifted in and grounded on the shore tristan bowed mother confessor lord rahl who are you richard asked tristan bashkar of jara lord rahl im afraid we havent been formally introduced life sparked into richards gray eyes and have you decided to surrender minister bashkar tristan had been about to bow again at an expected formal introduction he hadnt expected richards questions to come first he cleared his throat and straightened his easy smile welled onto his face lord rahl i do appreciate your indulgence the mother confessor has graciously granted me two weeks to observe the signs from the stars power came to richards voice you risk your people seeing swords instead of stars minister tristan unbuttoned his coat from the corner of her eye kahlan saw caras agiel twitch up into her hand tristan didnt notice his gaze stayed on richard while he drew his coat back holding it open casually by resting his fist on his hip it exposed the knife at his belt raina flicked her agiel up into her hand lord rahl as i explained to the mother confessor our people looked forward with great joy to joining with the dharan empire dharan empire tristan kahlan said were rather busy at the moment we have discussed this already and you have been given two weeks now if you will excuse us tristan brushed back a lock of his hair his bright brown eyes taking her in ill get to the point then ive heard rumors that plague is loose in aydindril richards raptor glower was suddenly in full form its not just a rumor its true how much danger is there richards hand found the hilt of his sword if you join with the order minister you will wish it was the plague on you instead of me kahlan had rarely seen two men so instantly and intently dislike each other she knew richard was exhausted and in no mood after having just seen so many seriously ill or dead children to be challenged by a noble such as tristan inquiring after his own hide jara had also been on the council that had condemned kahlan to death although it wasnt tristan who had voted to behead her it had been a councilor from his land richard had killed that jarian councilor kahlan didnt know why tristan took such an instant dislike to richard except for the fact that this was the man who had demanded jaras surrender she guessed that was reason enough if she were in his place she might feel the same kahlan was expecting the two men to draw steel any second drefan stepped between them im drefan rahl high priest of the raugmoss community of healers ive had some experience with the plague i suggest that you confine yourself to your room and avoid contact with strangers especially prostitutes beyond that you should get enough sleep and proper healthful food those things will help to keep your body strong against the distemper also i will be speaking to the staff here at the palace on strengthening oneself against illness youre welcome to come and hear my guidance as is anyone else of a mind tristan had listened earnestly to drefan he bowed thanking him for his advice well i appreciate the truth lord rahl a lesser man might have tried to deceive me about such a serious problem i can see why youre so busy ill take my leave so that you may see to your people berdine nudged up beside richard as he glared after tristans departing back as intently as she had been studying the journal muttering to herself testing the pronunciation of high dharan words kahlan doubted she had heard anything that had been said lord rahl i need to talk to you berdine mumbled richard put a hand on her shoulder in a signal for her to wait drefan nadine do either of you have anything for a headache a really bad headache i have some herbs that will help richard nadine offered i have something better drefan leaned closer to richard its called sleep perhaps you recall having experienced it in the past drefan i know that ive been awake for a while but many days and nights drefan held up a finger if you try to mask the outcome of lack of sleep with socalled remedies you do yourself no service the headache will return worse than before you will ruin your strength you will be no good to yourself or anyone else drefan is right kahlan said without looking up berdine turned the page she was reading in the journal i agree i feel much better since i got some sleep berdine seemed to have finally noticed that there were other people around now that im alert i can think better richard warded their insistence with a lifted hand i know soon i promise now what was it you wanted to tell me berdine what she was reading again oh i found out where the temple of the winds is richards brow went up what after i got some sleep i could think more clearly i realized that we were limiting our search by looking for a limited number of key words so i tried to think of what the old wizards would do in their situation i reasoned that where is it richard bellowed berdine finally looked up and blinked the temple of the winds is located atop the mountain of the four winds berdine noticed raina for the first time the two women smiled in greeting their eyes sharing a private warmth kahlan shrugged to richards questioning look berdine thats not much help unless you can tell us where it is berdine frowned a moment and then waved in apology oh sorry thats the translationshe frowned againi think richard swiped a hand across his face what does kolo call it berdine flipped the page back and turned the book tapping a finger at a place in the writing richard squinted berglendursch ost kymermossf he read from the journal mountain of the four winds actually berdine said berglendursch means more than just mountain berglen is mountain and dursch can sometimes mean rock though it can also mean other things like strongwilled but in this case i think it means something more along the lines of rock mountain or great mountain made of rock you know rocky mountain of the four winds something like that kahlan shifted her weight on her tired feet mount kymermosst berdine scratched her nose yes that sounds like it could be the same place that has to be the same place richard said looking hopeful for the first time in hours do you know where it is yes ive been on mount kymermosst kahlan said theres no doubt about its being windy up thereand rocky there are some old ruins atop the mountain but nothing like a temple maybe the ruins are the temple berdine offered we dont know how big it is a temple can be small no i dont think so in this case why richard asked whats up there how far is it its not far to the northeast maybe a days ride depending two at the most its a pretty inhospitable place as treacherous as the old trail going up and over the mountain is going over mount kymermosst prevents you from having to go through some very difficult country and saves days of travel at the top is the site of some old ruins just some kind of outbuildings from the look of them ive seen a lot of grand places i recognize architecturally that whats up there isnt the main structure theyre something like the outbuildings here at the confessors palace theres a road through the buildings a bit like the grand promenade here going through the outbuildings richard hooked a thumb behind his wide leather belt well where does it go this grand road kahlan stared into his gray eyes right to the edge of a cliff the buildings are at the edge of a cliff that sheer stone wall drops off for maybe three or four thousand feet is there any kind of stairway carved in the cliff something leading down to the temple itself richard you dont understand the buildings are hard on the edge of the cliff its obvious that the buildings walls and the road itself went on because theyre sheared off abruptly right at the edge there used to be more of the mountain there its gone now its all fallen away a rockslide or something what was beyond the ruins the main structure and the mountain is gone thats what kolo said the team returned and the temple of the winds was gone richard looked devastated they must have used magic to tear away the side of the mountain to bury the temple of the winds so no one could ever go there again well berdine sighed ill keep looking in the journal to see if he says anything about the temple of the winds falling in a rockslide or avalanche richard nodded maybe theres more about it in the journal lord rahl will you have time to help me before you go off to be married a chill silence filled the grand hall berdine richards mouth worked but no more words were forthcoming i heard the soldiers are well berdine said looking briefly at kahlan and then back at richard you told me that you and the mother confessor would be leaving to be wedded just as soon as the soldiers were well the soldiers are well she grinned i know that im your favorite but you havent changed your mind have you gotten cold feet she waited expectantly seeming not to notice that no one was smiling at her joke richard looked numb he couldnt say it kahlan knew that he feared speaking the words feared he would break her heart berdine kahlan said into the heavy hush richard and i wont be going away to be married the wedding is called off for now anyway even though she had whispered the words they seemed to echo off the marble walls as if she had shouted them nadines intently blank face spoke more than if she had grinned it was somehow worse that she didnt because it made it all the more obvious that she was schooling her expression yet no one could have cause to reproach her called off berdine blinked in astonishment why richard stared down at berdine not daring to look at kahlan berdine jagang started a plague in aydindril thats what the prophecy down in the pit was about our duty is to the people here not to our own how would it look if he fell silent the journal in her hands lowered im sorry chapter kahlan stared out the window at the falling night at the falling snow behind her richard sat at his desk his gold cloak laid over the arm of his chair he was working on the journal with berdine while he waited for the officers to arrive berdine did most of the talking he grunted occasionally when she told him what she thought a word meant and why kahlan didnt think that as tired as he was he was much use to berdine kahlan glanced back over her shoulder drefan and nadine were huddled together beside the hearth richard had asked them to come along to answer any questions the generals might have nadine confined her attention to drefan scrupulously avoiding looking at richard and especially at kahlan probably because she knew that kahlan would detect the glint of triumph in her eyes no this wasnt a triumph for nadinefor shota this was only a postponement just until until what until they could halt a plague until most of the people of aydindril died until they themselves got the plague and died as the prophecy foretold kahlan went to richard and laid a hand on his shoulder desperately needing his touch thankfully she felt him put a hand over hers just a postponement she whispered as she leaned close to his ear this doesnt change it richard this only delays it for a little while thats all i promise he patted her hand as he smiled up at her i know cara opened the door and leaned in lord rahl theyre coming now thanks cara leave the door open and tell them to come in raina lit a long splinter in the hearth she put a hand to berdines shoulder to balance herself as she leaned past to light another lamp at the far end of the table her long dark braid slipped over her shoulder tickling berdines face berdine scratched her cheek and gave raina a brief smile to see those two touch or even acknowledge one another in front of others was rare in the extreme kahlan knew that it was because of the things raina had seen that day she too was feeling lonely and in need of comfort as deadening as their training had been as numb as they were to agony their human feelings were beginning to be rekindled kahlan could see in rainas dark eyes that witnessing children suffer and die had affected her kahlan heard cara out in the hall telling men to go in muscular graying general kerson looking as imposing as ever in his burnished leather uniform marched through the doorway muscles bulged under the chain mail covering his arms behind him came the commander of the keltish forces the robust general baldwin he was an older man with a whiteflecked dark mustache the ends of which grew down to the bottom of his jaw as always he looked distinguished in his green silklined serge cape fastened on one shoulder with two buttons a heraldic emblem slashed through with a diagonal black line dividing a yellow and blue shield was emblazoned on the front of his tan surcoat lamplight flashed off his ornate belt buckle and silver scabbard he looked as fierce as he was dashing before the phalanx of officers accompanying them had all entered the room both generals were bowing in the lamplight general baldwins pate shone through his thinning gray hair as he bent low my queen general baldwin said lord rahl kahlan bowed her head to the man as richard stood pushing his chair back berdine scooted her chair over to be out of his way she didnt bother to look up she was mordsith and busy besides lord rahl general kerson said with a salute of his fist to his heart after he had straightened mother confessor behind them the officers were all bowing richard waited patiently until it was all finished kahlan imagined that he couldnt be eager to start he did so simply gentlemen i regret to inform you that there is a plague upon aydindril a plague general kerson asked a plague of what a distemper a plague that makes people sicken and die that kind of plague the black death drefan put in with a somber voice from behind kahlan and richard the men all seemed to take a collective breath they waited in silence it started not long ago richard said so fortunately we will be able to take a few precautions as of this moment we know of less than a couple of dozen cases of course there is no telling how many have it and have yet to fall ill of the ones we know were stricken almost half are already dead by morning the number will grow general kerson cleared his throat precautions lord rahl what precautions are there to be taken do you have another cure for the men for the people of the city richard rubbed his fingertips on his forehead as his eyes turned to the desk before him no general i have no cures he whispered everyone heard his words though it was that silent in the room then what richard straightened himself what we need to do is to separate the men disperse them my brother has seen the plague before and has read of great plagues in the past we believe that its possible that it spreads from person to person much as when one person in a family has a sore throat chest congestion and stuffed nose then the others in the family from their proximity to the sick person come down with the same illness ive heard that the plague is caused by bad air in a place one of the officers in the back put in i am told that this too is possible richard said i have also been told that it could be caused by any number of other things bad water bad meat heated blood magic someone asked richard shifted his weight that too is a possibility it is said by some that it could be a judgment by the spirits on our world and a punishment for what they find i myself dont believe such a thing ive been out this afternoon seeing innocent children suffering and dying i cant believe that the spirits would do such a thing no matter how displeased general baldwin rubbed his chin then what do you think it is that spreads it lord rahl im no expert but i lean toward my brothers explanation that its like any other sickness that it can be passed from person to person through odors in the air or close contact this makes the most sense to me although this sickness is much more serious the plague i am told is almost always fatal if it is in fact passed from person to person then we must not delay we must do what we can to keep the plague from our forces i want the men split up into smaller units general kerson spread his hands in frustration lord rahl why cant you simply use your magic and rid the city of this plague kahlan touched richards back reminding him to hold his temper he seemed though to have no anger in him im sorry but right now i dont know what magic can cure this plague i dont know that any wizard has ever before cured a plague through the use of magic you have to understand general that just because a person can command magic that doesnt mean that they can stay the keeper himself when the time for his touch has come if wizards could do that i assure you graveyards would vanish for want of clients wizards have not the power of the creator our world has balance to it just as we all especially soldiers can aid the keeper in bringing death we all can also be a part of the creators work of creating life we know better than most perhaps that soldiers are charged with protecting peace and life itself the balance to that is that we sometimes must take life to stay an enemy who would do greater harm for this we are remembered not for the lives we try to preserve a wizard too must be in balance in harmony with the world he lives in the creator and the keeper both have a part to play in our world it is not within the power of a mere wizard to dictate to them what shall be he can work for events to combine toward a resulta marriage for example but he cannot direct the creator himself to bring forth a life as a result of that marriage a wizard must remember always that he works within our world and must do his best to help people just as a farmer would help a neighbor who has a harvest to bring in or a fire to douse there are things a wizard can do that those without magic cannot much the same as you men are strong and can wield a heavy battleaxe whereas an old man could not even though you have the muscle to do this that doesnt mean that your muscles can do what they arent meant to do such as exercise wisdom the old man has from his experience he may defeat you in battle through his knowledge rather than his muscle no matter how great a wizard may be he could not bear a new life into this world a young woman without magic experience or wisdom could do such a thing but he could not perhaps she has more to do with magic than he in the end what im trying to tell you men is that just because i have been born with the gift that doesnt mean that the gift can stop this plague we cant depend on magic to solve all our problems knowing the limitations of his power is just as important for a wizard as knowing the limitations of his men is for an army officer many of you have seen what my sword can do against the enemy yet as awesome a weapon as it is it cannot touch this invisible enemy other magic may prove as impotent in your wisdom we are humbled general kerson quoted softly from the devotion men voiced their agreement and nodded at the logic of richards explanation kahlan was proud of him that at least he had convinced them she wondered if he had convinced himself its not so much wisdom richard murmured as it is simple common sense please be assured all of you he went on that that doesnt mean i have no intention of trying to find a way to end this plague i am looking into every possible means of stopping it he laid a hand on berdines shoulder she glanced up berdine is helping me with the old books from wizards past to see if they left us any wisdom if there is a way for magic to stop it then i will find that way for now though we must use other means at our disposal to protect people we need to have the men split up split up and then what general kerson asked split up and get out of aydindril general kerson stiffened the links of his chain mail reflected the lamplight so that he seemed to sparkle like a vision of a spirit leave aydindril undefended no richard insisted not undefended what i propose is to have our forces divide up so there is less chance of the plague spreading among them and move to separate positions around aydindril we can put detachments of our forces at all the passes all the roads and access valleys that way no force can advance against us what if one does general baldwin asked then those smaller separate forces may be insufficient to drive off an attack we will have sentries and scouts well have to increase them so that we dont have any surprises i dont think there are any forces of the order this far north yet but if any attack does come then we will have warning and can gather our forces quickly we dont want them too far apart to be able to defend the city if they must but they must be far enough apart to keep from passing the plague throughout the whole of the army any ideas you men have would be valued thats one reason i asked you here if you have ideas about any of this then please feel free to speak up drefan stepped forward it needs to be done quickly the sooner the men are away the better the chance that none of them will have come in contact with the sickness the officers all nodded as they pondered the officers who went with us today should remain here drefan said they may have come in contact with someone who has the plague make a list of any they work closely with and have them isolated here in aydindril too well see to it at once general kerson said tonight richard nodded each group of our forces must communicate with the others of course but messages must be spoken only no written messages passing from hand to hand the papers could carry the plague these men who pass commands and messages should talk at a distance at least the way we are here in this room with me at this end and you at the other isnt that a rather extraordinary precaution one of the officers asked i have heard drefan said that people who have the plague but have not yet fallen sick and therefore dont know of their affliction can be detected by the distinctive odor of the plague on their breath men nodded with interest but to smell that fatal odor would infect you with the plague and you too would be stricken and die mumbling spread back through the men thats why we dont want the messengers to get too close to one another richard said if one were to already have the plague we dont want him spreading it to another group of our forces there is no use in going to all of this trouble if we arent scrupulous in our attention to everything this is a deadly poison if we act quickly and act as wisely as we know how we may spare a great many people from death if we dont take these precautions seriously nearly every one of the people in this city and every one of our men could be dead within weeks serious worried talk swept back through the room we are giving you the worst look at it drefan said bringing their attentive gazes back we dont want to pretend the danger is less than it is but there are things in our favor the most important is the weather the plagues i have seen and read about spread worst in the high heat of summer i dont think it will be able to get a foothold in the cool weather of this time of year we have that much men sighed with renewed hope kahlan didnt one other thing richard said as he looked from eye to eye we are dharans we are people of honor our men will act accordingly i dont want any of us lying to people about the danger telling people that there is no risk and on the other hand i dont want anyone deliberately panicking people everyone will be frightened enough as it is you are also soldiers this is no less a battle than if any other enemy attacked our people this is part of our job some of the men will have to stay in the city to help there may need to be men at arms to hold down any uprising that may be stirred up if there are any riots like there were with the red moon i want them put down at once use whatever force is necessary but no more remember the people of this city are our people we are their protectors not their wardens we will need men to help with digging graves i dont think we can be burning that many dead if the plague gets hot among the population how many do you think could die lord rahl one of the officers asked thousands drefan answered tens of thousands his blueeyed gaze took them all in if it gets bad enough more i read of a plague that in three months took the life of nearly three of every four people in a city of close to half a million a low whistle came from an officer in back one other thing richard said some people will panic they will want to run from aydindril to remove themselves from the danger most will want to stay not only because this is the only home they know but because their livelihood is here we cant allow people to flee aydindril and spread the plague to other places in the midlands or even beyond to dhara it must be confined here if people want to rush away from the city and go to the surrounding hills separating themselves from their neighbors who they fear have the plague upon them we must be understanding of their fears they are to be allowed to run to the countryside if they wish but they must remain in the area i want our soldiers who will be in these separate units to ring the city and surrounding country protecting all routes to and from aydindril the people must stay within these limits any person fleeing could be infected with the plague and not know it thus endangering people in other places as a last resort force must be used to prevent them from taking the plague abroad please keep in mind that these are not malevolent people but simply people frightened for the lives of their families the ones who flee the city to wait out the plague will soon be short of food and succumb to starvation remind people to take food as they are not likely to find it in the countryside they will be no less dead if they die of hunger rather than plague remind them of this and that looting of farms will not be tolerated we will not allow anarchy well i guess thats about all i have to say what are your questions will you be leaving tonight my queen lord rahl or in the morning general baldwin asked and where will you be staying richard and i wont be leaving aydindril kahlan said what but you must get away general baldwin insisted please both of you must escape this we need you to lead us we didnt know what we were dealing with until it was too late kahlan said we may have already been exposed to the plague we dont think that likely richard said wanting to assuage their fears but i must stay to see if there is any magic that will stop this plague i will need to be going up to the keep if were up in the hills we cant be of any use and i might miss a chance of finding a solution we will remain here and oversee the command of the city drefan is the high priest of the raugmoss healers from dhara the mother confessor and i could be in no better hands he and nadine will be staying too to see what relief can be brought to people as the men asked questions and discussed matters of food and supplies kahlan moved to the window watching the snow and wind build in the spring storm richard was speaking to his men the way a commander spoke on the eve of a battle to instill in them a sense of purpose to harden them to the battle ahead as in any battle death would run rampant despite what drefan believed about the plague not being able to build to full strength in the cold weather kahlan knew that it wasnt true in this case this was no ordinary plague this was a plague started by magic by a man who wanted to kill them all down in the pit jagang had called it jala dh jinthe game of life jagang was incensed that richard had changed the ball to a lighter one so that all the children could enjoy playing instead of just the strongest the most brutal jagang started the killing with those children it was no accident it was a message it was the game of life this would be jagangs world ruled by such savagery if he won chapter for the next hour the men asked questions mostly of drefan the two generals offered suggestions to richard regarding command and logistics options were briefly discussed plans were made and officers were assigned duties the army was to begin moving that very night there were a great many blood of the fold who had surrendered and although they had since sworn loyalty to richard it was still thought wise to divide them too sending some with each unit rather than letting them remain together richard concurred with the suggestion when at last they had all departed to begin the work richard dropped heavily into his chair he had come a long way from being a woods guide kahlan was proud of him she opened her mouth to say so but nadine spoke the words in her stead richard mumbled a flat thanks nadine tentatively touched her fingertips to the back of his shoulder richard you were always i dont know richard to me a boy from home a woods guide today and especially tonight with all those important men i think i saw you differently for the first time you really are this lord rahl richard put his elbows on the table before him and his face in his hands i think id rather be at the bottom of the cliff buried with the temple of the winds dont be silly she whispered bristling kahlan moved to his side nadine glided away richard kahlan said you have to get some sleep now you promised we need you strong if you dont get some sleep i know he pushed away from the table and stood he turned to drefan and nadine do either of you have anything to make a person go to sleep ive tried lately i just lie there my mind wont be quiet a feng san disharmony drefan announced at once you bring it on yourself with the way you push past the limits of your body there are bounds to what we can do and if drefan richard said cutting him off with a gentle voice i know what you mean but i do what i must you just have to understand that jagang is trying to kill us all it will do me no good to be as highspirited as a squirrel in spring if it means we all end up dead drefan grunted i understand but that doesnt get you strong so ill try to be good later what about going to sleep tonight meditation drefan said that will calm your energy flows and begin bringing them into harmony richard rubbed his brow drefan hundreds of thousands of people are in danger of dying because jagang wants to put the whole of the world under his boot hes shown us that he has no bounds to his determination hes starting the killing with children richards knuckles turned white as his hands fisted just to send me a message children he has no conscience hes showing me what hes willing to do to win to make me surrender he thinks it will break me in contrast to his knuckles richards face had gone scarlet hes wrong id never give our people over to that kind of tyrant never ill do whatever i must to stop this plague i swear it the room rang with the sudden silence kahlan had never seen richard angry in quite this way when he had the deadly fury of the sword of truths magic in his eyes the object of his rage was usually at hand the rage was invoked by and directed at a palpable threat this was frustrated anger at an invisible enemy there was no threat he could get his hands on now he had no direct way to fight it kahlan could see in his eyes that this anger wasnt the magic of the sword this was purely richards rage his face finally cooled he took a calming breath as he wiped a hand across his face he regained control of his voice if i try to meditate i will only see those sick and dead children again in my mind please i cant bear to see that in my sleep i need to go to sleep and not have dreams go to sleep and not have dreams you are bothered by dreams nightmares i have them all day too when im awake but theyre real the dream walker cant enter my dreams but he has found a way to give me nightmares nonetheless please dear spirits at least when im asleep grant me some peace a sure sign of a feng san meridian disharmony drefan confirmed to himself i can see that you are going to be a difficult patient but not without a cause he slipped the bone pin from the loop of leather and opened the flap on one of the pouches at his belt he pulled out a few leather purses he put one back no that will kill pain but not be much aid to sleep he sniffed another no that will make you vomit he searched his other things and finally closed the flaps on the pouches im afraid i didnt bring anything so simple with me i only brought rare items richard sighed thanks for trying anyway drefan turned to nadine she was bottled zeal pressing her lips together with restrained delight as the others talked the things you gave yonicks mother wouldnt be strong enough for richard drefan said to her do you have any hops sure she said calmly but obviously pleased that someone had at last asked her in tincture of course perfect drefan said he slapped richard on the back you can meditate another time tonight you will be asleep in no time nadine will fix you a preparation ill go start checking with the staff and giving them my recommendations dont forget to meditate richard muttered as drefan departed berdine remained behind studying the journal as nadine cara raina ulic egan and kahlan all followed richard to his room not far away ulic and egan took up posts outside in the hall the rest of them went into the room with richard inside richard tossed his gold cloak over a chair he pulled the baldric over his head and laid the sword of truth atop it he wearily drew his goldtrimmed tunic over his head and removed his shirt leaving him with a black armless undershirt nadine watched from the corner of her eye while she softly counted each drop aloud as it dripped into a glass of water richard flopped down on the edge of the bed cara would you pull my boots off for me please cara rolled her eyes do i look like a valet she squatted to the task when richard smiled he leaned back on his elbows tell berdine that i want her to look for any reference to this mountain of the four winds place see what else she can find out about it cara looked up from his feet what a brilliant idea she said with mock enthusiasm i bet she would never have thought of that on her own allwise and knowing master all right all right i guess im not needed hows my magic potion coming over there just finished nadine said in a cheery voice cara grunted as she yanked off his other boot undo your pants and ill pull them off too richard scowled down at her ill manage thank you cara smirked to herself as he rolled off the bed and went to nadine she handed him the glass of water with the tincture of hops she had put something else in the glass of water too dont drink it all i put in fifty drops thats way more than you should need but i wanted to leave you with extra drink about a third and then if you wake in the night you can always drink another swallow or two i put in some valerian and skullcap too to help insure you go into a deep and dreamless sleep richard downed half of it his face contorted as bad as this tastes it will put me to sleep or else kill me nadine smiled at him youll sleep like a baby babies dont sleep all that well from what ive heard nadine laughed in a soft lilt youll sleep richard i promise if you wake too early just take a little more thanks he sat down on the edge of the bed looking from one woman to the next ill manage with my pants i swear cara rolled her eyes and headed for the door urging nadine along before her kahlan kissed his cheek get in bed ill come back in and tuck you in and kiss you good night as soon as i see to the guards raina followed kahlan out and closed the door nadine was waiting rocking back and forth on her heels hows the arm do you need a poultice my arm is much better kahlan said i think its fine now but thank you for asking kahlan clasped her hands and stood watching nadine cara watched nadine raina watched nadine nadines gaze moved from one woman to the next she glanced to ulic and egan who were watching her too all right then good night good night kahlan cara and raina said as one they watched as nadine strolled off i still say you should have let me kill her cara said under her breath i may yet let you kahlan said she knocked on the door richard you in bed yes cara started to follow as kahlan opened the door kahlan turned ill only be a minute i dont think he can spoil my honor in a minute cara frowned with lord rahl anything is possible raina laughed and slapped caras arm making her leave kahlan be i wouldnt worry with what weve seen today neither of us would be in the mood kahlan said she shut the door a single candle was lit richard was covered to his stomach kahlan sat on the edge of the bed and took his hand she held it to her heart are you terribly disappointed he asked richard we will be married ive waited my whole life for you were together thats all that really matters richard smiled his tired eyes sparkled well not all kahlan couldnt help smiling herself she kissed his knuckles just as long as you know that i understand she said i didnt want you to go to sleep thinking i was heartbroken that we cant be married just now well be married when we can he put his other hand to the back of her neck and pulled her into a gentle kiss she laid a hand on his bare chest feeling his warm flesh his breathing his heartbeat if she hadnt been so devastated by the suffering children she had seen that day the feel of him would have ignited longing in her own breast i love you she whispered i love you now and always he whispered back she blew out the candle sleep well my love cara eyed kahlan suspiciously as she closed the door that was two minutes kahlan ignored caras little jab raina would you guard richards room until you go to bed and then have a guard posted yes mother confessor ulic egan with that sleep potion richard may not be able to awake if he were in danger id like one of you to be here when raina goes to bed ulic folded his massive arms mother confessor neither of us has any intention of leaving this spot as long as lord rahl is asleep egan pointed at the floor against the opposite wall one of us can take a nap if need be well both be here dont be concerned for lord rahls safety while he is sleeping thank you all of you one other thing nadine isnt to be allowed into his roomfor any reason none whatsoever they all nodded in satisfaction kahlan turned to the blondheaded mordsith cara go get berdine im going to get a cloak both of you should bring your cloaks too its a foul night and where are we going ill meet you both out in the stables the stables why do you want to go out there its time for dinner cara would never really balk at a duty over a matter so petty as dinner she was suspicious grab something from the kitchens that we can take with us then cara clasped her hands behind her back where are we going for a ride a ride mother confessor where are we going the wizards keep both cara and raina lifted an eyebrow caras surprise turned to a frown of disapproval does lord rahl know that you want to go up to the keep of course not if i had told him why im going he would have insisted on going too he needs sleep so i didnt tell him and why are we going because the temple of the winds is gone the wizards who did it were put on trial there are records in the keep of all the trials held there i want to find that record tomorrow richard can read it over after hes gotten some sleep it could help him makes sense going to the wizards keep after dark i will go get berdine and some food and meet you in the stables well make a picnic of it cara said with blithe sarcasm chapter kahlan batted the big wet snowflakes from her lashes and pulled the hood of her cloak forward as she considered the foolishness of not thinking to change out of her white confessors dress she stood in the stirrups reached between her legs and pulled more of the back of the dress under her bare legs to protect them from the cold saddle fortunately her boots were high enough that hiking up the dress to sit in the saddle didnt expose her calves to the wind she was glad though to be back on nick the big warhorse her galean soldiers had given her nick was an old friend cara and berdine looked just as uncomfortable as she but kahlan knew that it was because they feared going to a place of magic they had been in the wizards keep before they didnt want to return back at the stables they had tried to talk her out of it kahlan had reminded them of the plague nicks ears twitched even before the dark shapes of soldiers appeared out of the swirling snow to challenge them kahlan knew they had reached the stone bridge the soldiers were posted just to the city side of it the men sheathed their swords when cara growled at them pleased to have someone handy upon whom to vent her foul mood terrible night to be out mother confessor one of the soldiers said happy to address someone other than the mordsith terrible night to be stationed out here she said the man looked back over his shoulder any night youre stationed on watch up here at the keep is a terrible night kahlan smiled the keep looks sinister soldier but its not so bad as it looks if you say so mother confessor myself i think id just as soon stand guard over the underworld itself no one has tried to get in the keep have they if they had youd have heard about it or found our bodies mother confessor kahlan urged her big stallion on nick snorted and surged ahead on the slick snow she trusted him in such conditions and let him lead the way cara and berdine both swayed easily in their saddles as they followed behind back in the stables cara had snatched her horses bit looked the animal in the eye and ordered it not to give her any trouble kahlan had the odd feeling that the bay mare understood the warning kahlan could just see the stone walls at the sides of the bridge just as well that the horses couldnt see the chasm beyond she knew nick wouldnt spook but she wasnt sure about the other two the sheer rock walls of the yawning abyss dropped for thousands of feet unless you had wings there was only this one way into the wizards keep in the snowy darkness the vast keep its soaring walls of dark stone its ramparts bastions towers connecting passageways and bridges all blended into the inky darkness of the side of the mountain into which it was built to those without magic or those who didnt understand magic the keep presented an unmistakable spectacle of sinister menace kahlan had grown up in aydindril and had been up to the keep uncountable times more often than not alone even as a child she had been allowed to go alone to the keep as were the other young confessors when she was little wizards had tickled her and chased her through the halls laughing with her the keep was a second home to her comfortably safe welcoming and protective she knew though that there were dangers in the keep just as in any home a home could be a safe welcoming place as long as one wasnt foolish enough to walk into the hearth there were places in the keep you didnt walk into either it was only when she was older that she no longer went to the keep alone when a confessor became older it was dangerous to go anywhere alone after a confessor had begun taking confessions it wasnt safe for her to be without the protection of her wizard when she was older a confessor earned enemies family of the condemned rarely believed that a loved one had committed violent crimes or they blamed confessors for the mans death sentence even though she was only the means of confirming its justice there were always attempts on the lives of confessors there was no shortage of people from commoners to kings wanting a confessor dead how are we going to go through the shields without lord rahl berdine asked his magic enabled us to pass through before we wont be able to get through the shields kahlan smiled assurance to the two mordsith richard didnt know where he was going he just blundered through the keep going where he needed to go on instinct i know the ways to go that dont require magic to pass there may be a few mild shields that will keep people out but i can pass those if i can pass then i can get you through them by touching you when you pass through the same way richard took you through the more powerful shields cara grunted disagreeably she had been hoping that the shields would stop them cara ive been in the keep thousands of times its perfectly safe were just going to the libraries just as you are my protector out in the world in the keep i will be yours we are sisters of the agiel i wont let you get anywhere near dangerous magic trust me well i guess you are a sister of the agiel i can trust a sister of the agiel they passed under the huge portcullis and onto the keep grounds once inside the massive outer walls the snow melted as it touched the ground kahlan pushed back her hood inside the walls it was warm and comfortable she shook the snow from her cloak and took a deep breath of the springfresh air filling her lungs with the familiar soothing scent nick whinnied agreeably kahlan led the two mordsith across the stretch of gravel and stone chips to the arched opening in the wall that tunneled under part of the keep as they passed through the long passageway the lamps hanging from cara and berdines saddles lit the arched stone around them in an orange glow why are we going through here cara asked lord rahl took us in that big door back there i know thats one reason youre afraid of the keep that was a very dangerous way to go in im taking us to the way i usually enter its much better youll see its not the way visitors entered either but the way used by those who lived and worked here the public came in at a different door a place where they were greeted by a guide who saw to their wants beyond the tunnel all three horses eyed the expansive paddock lush with grass the gravel road ran beside the wall that held the main entrance to the keep with a fence on the other side of the road enclosing the paddock to the left part of the paddock was bounded by the walls of the keep rather than a fence at the rear were stables kahlan dismounted and opened the gate after removing saddles and tack all three of them turned their horses loose in the paddock where they could crop grass and frisk in the mild air if they wished a dozen wide granite steps worn smooth and swayback over the millennia led up into a recessed entryway to the simple but heavy double doors into the keep proper cara and berdine followed behind with the lamps the anteroom swallowed the lamplight into its vast space only allowing the weak flames to hint at the columns and arches whats that berdine asked in a low whisper it sounds like a storm drain there arent rats in here are there actually its a fountain kahlan said her voice echoing into the distance and yes cara there are rats in the keep but not where im taking you promise here give me your lamp let me show you the bones of this menacing dungeon kahlan took the lamp and strode to one of the key lamps on the wall to the right she could walk there without the aid of the lamp she had done it so often but she needed the lamps flame she found the key lamp tilled back the tall chimney and lit it with the flame from caras lamp the key lamp took to flame with a succession of whooshing sounds the rest of the lamps in the room lithundreds of themtwo at a time in pairs one to each side each whoosh was followed almost simultaneously by another as the lamps around the huge room took to flame from the key lamp the light in the room grew the effect was like turning up the wick on a lamp in a span of seconds the anteroom was nearly as bright as day bathed in the mellow yelloworange glow of all the flames cara and berdine stood slackjawed at the sight a hundred feet overhead the glassed roof was dark but in the day it flooded the room with warmth and light at night if the sky was clear you could turn down the lamps and gaze at the stars or let the moonlight wash the room in the center of the tiled floor stood a clover leafshaped fountain water shot fifteen feet into the air above the top bowl to cascade down each successive tier into ever wider scalloped bowls finally running from evenly spaced points in the bottom one in perfectly matched arcs into the lower pool an outer wall of variegated white marble was wide enough to act as a bench berdine stepped down one step of the five that ringed the room its beautiful she whispered in astonishment cara gazed about at the red marble columns holding the arches below the balcony that ran all the way around the ovalshaped room she had a smile on her lips this is nothing like the place lord rahl took us cara frowned the lamps that was magic there is magic in here you said you would keep us away from magic i said i would keep you away from dangerous magic the lamps are kind of like a shield except in reverse instead of keeping people out theyre an enabling shield to welcome and help them enter its a friendly kind of magic cara friendly sure come on we came here for a purpose we have work to do kahlan took them to the libraries via the elegant warm halls rather than the frightening way they had gone before they encountered only three shields kahlans magic allowed her to pass these and by holding cara and berdines hands it was possible to get them through too though both complained about a tingling sensation these shields didnt guard dangerous areas and so were weaker than others in the keep there were shields that kahlan couldnt pass like the ones richard had taken her through to go down to the sliph though kahlan thought there might be other ways to get down there there were shields which richard had gone through that in her experience no wizard had ever crossed before they came to an intersection with a hall of light pink stone running down both sides at places the hall opened into commodious rooms ringed with padded benches for conversing or reading beyond double doors in each of these large outer rooms was a library ive been here berdine said i remember this yes richard brought you here but by a different route kahlan continued on to the eighth sitting room and went through the double doors into the library there she used her lamp to light the key lamp and as before all the rest lit lifting the room out of its pitch blackness bringing it to life the floors were polished wood with walls paneled in the same honeycolored oak during the day glassed windows on the far wall bathed the room with light and provided a beautiful view of aydindril now through the snow kahlan could only occasionally see the lights of the city below she strode down the aisle between the reading tables and the rows upon rows of bookshelves looking for the one she remembered in this room alone there were one hundred and fortyfive rows of books there were comfortable chairs to use while reading but tonight they would need the tables to lay out the books so this is the library cara said in dhara at the peoples palace there are libraries much larger than this this is only one of twentysix rooms like this i can only imagine how many thousands of books are here in the keep kahlan said then how are we ever going to find the ones were looking for berdine asked it shouldnt be as hard as it sounds the libraries can be a bewildering maze when you wish to find something i used to know a wizard who searched on and off his whole life for a bit of information he knew was in the libraries he never found it then how can we because there are a few things that are specialized enough that they are kept together books of language for example i can take you to all the books on any specific language because theyre not about magic and so theyre in one place i dont know how books on magic and prophecy are organized if they even are anyway this library is where certain records are kept such as the records of trials held here ive not read them but i was taught about them kahlan turned and led them between two rows of shelves nearly midway down the fiftyfootlong aisle she came to a halt here they are i can see by the writing on the spines that theyre in different languages since i know all the languages but high dharan ill search all the ones in other languages cara you look at the ones in ours and berdine you take the ones in high dharan the three of them started picking books from the shelves and carrying them to the tables separating them into three stacks there werent as many as kahlan had feared berdine had only seven books cara had fifteen and kahlan eleven in a variety of languages for berdine it would be slow going translating the dharan but kahlan was fluent in the other languages and she would be able to help with caras stack as soon as she finished her own as kahlan started in she quickly found that it was going to be easier than shed first thought each trial began with a statement of the type of crime making it simple to eliminate those that had nothing to do with the temple of the winds there were charges against the accused ranging from the taking of a cherished object of little worth to murder a sorceress was accused of casting a glamour but was found innocent a boy of twelve was accused of starting a fight in which another boys arm was broken because the aggressor had used magic to cause the injury the sentence was the suspension of his training for a period of one year a wizard was accused of being a drunkard a third offense the prior punishments having failed to halt his belligerent behavior he was found guilty and sentenced to death the sentence was carried out two days later when he had sobered habitually drunken wizards were viewed not with tolerance but as the true dangers they were capable in their inebriated state of causing mass injury and death kahlan herself had seen wizards drink to excess only one time the accounts of the trials were fascinating but the seriousness of their purpose kept kahlan skimming through the books looking for a reference to the temple of the winds or to a team charged with a crime the other two were making quick progress too in an hour kahlan had finished all eleven books in the other languages berdine had only three left and cara six anything kahlan asked cara lifted an eyebrow i just found an account of a wizard who fancied hiking up his robes in front of women in the market on stentor street and commanding them to kiss the serpent i never knew wizards could get themselves in such a variety of trouble theyre people just like any other people no theyre not they have magic cara said so do i have you found anything berdine no not what were looking for just common crimes kahlan reached for one of the books cara hadnt been through but paused berdine you were down in the room with the sliph berdine made a show of shivering and producing a sound of revulsion from deep in her throat dont remind me kahlan shut her eyes trying to remember the room she remembered kolos bones and she remembered the sliph but she only vaguely recalled what else was in the room berdine do you remember if there were any other books down there berdine bit down on the end of a fingernail as she squinted in concentration i remember finding kolos journal open on the table an inkwell and pen i remember kolos bones lying on the floor next to the chair with most of his clothes long ago rotted away his leather belt was still around him kahlan remembered much the same thing but do you remember if there were any books on the shelves berdine turned her eyes up as she thought no no there werent or no you dont remember no i dont remember lord rahl was really excited about finding kolos journal he said it was something different from the books in the library and he felt it was what he had been searching for something different we left right after that kahlan stood you two keep looking through these books im going down there and have a look just to be sure caras chair clattered against the floor as she stood i will go with you there are rats down there her expression vexed cara put a hand on her hip ive seen rats before i will go with you kahlan remembered well caras story about the rats cara theres no need i dont need your protection in the keep outside yes but in here i know the dangers better than you i told you i wouldnt take you near dangerous magic down there is dangerous magic then there is danger to you no because i know about it you dont the danger would be to you not me i grew up here my own mother let me have the run of the keep when i was a little girl because i was taught about the dangers and how to avoid them i know what im doing please stay here with berdine and finish going through the books it will save us time and its important the sooner we find the one were looking for the sooner we can get home to watch over richard thats where our real concern is caras leather creaked as she shifted her weight i guess you would know the dangers of the magic here better than i think youre right about getting home nadine is back there chapter kahlan tried to overlay her mental map of the keep on the passageways stairwells and rooms she traversed as she wound her way lower rats squeaked and skittered away from her lamp although she had often seen the tower outside kolos room from the ramparts and walkways up on top of the keep she had never been down inside it until richard had taken her there unfortunately richard had taken her there by way of dangerous passages through shields she would never be able to get through on her own she was confident that there were other routes down to kolos room there were vast areas of the keep that werent protected by any shields at all she had only to find a way without shields or with shields that her magic would be able to pass the areas that richard had taken her protected by dangerous shields she didnt know at all since she had never been beyond those before but she was familiar with a myriad of ways to get around them oftentimes the hard shields as the wizards used to call them were meant to protect something just beyond rather than specifically to prevent passage to another area many of the rooms richard had taken her through were like that places of menacing magic she had never seen before they oftentimes provided a more direct route but required special magic if she was correct that richard had traversed a maze through dangerous places rather than going through hard shields specifically protecting the tower then there would be a way around the dangerous areas and into the tower room in her experience that was the way the keep worked if the tower room was meant to be offlimits then it would be protected by its own hard shields if it wasnt forbidden then there would be at least one way she could enter she had but to find it even though she had spent a great deal of time in the keep much of that time was spent in the libraries studying she had explored of course but the keep was almost inconceivably vast not only was the part that could be seen from the outside immense but much more of the keep was burrowed into the mountain the outer walls were only the tip of the keep the visible part of the tooth with much more of the root hidden beneath kahlan went through an empty room chiseled from bedrock to one of the passages on the other side there were numerous empty rooms in the wizards keep some of them like the one she had just passed through seemed nothing more than junctions where various passages connected possibly enlarged to provide reference points the squaresided passage through the rock ahead appeared carefully cut and smoothed her lamp illuminated bands of symbols incised in the granite with round areas in the field of swirling carvings polished to a high luster each encircling band marked the location of a mild shield that tingled against her flesh as she passed through ahead she saw the hall split into three passageways before she reached the junction the air about her suddenly hummed it took two steps before she could halt her onward rush each of those two steps caused the hum to raise in pitch to an uncomfortable buzzing her long hair lifted from her shoulders and back to stand straight out in all directions the band carved in the stone ahead immediately began to glow red kahlan retreated several paces the humming lowered in pitch her hair settled down she cursed under her breath a humming shield was an urgent warning to stay away the red glow displayed the region of the shield itself the hum warned that you were entering the field of a dangerous shield some of these hard shields would actually prevent a person without the required magic from getting too close by making the very air get as thick as mud and then stone some of the humming shields didnt prevent entry but walking into one would sear the flesh and muscle right off a persons bones the lesser shields were meant to keep people without magic and thus knowledge from getting close to the danger kahlan turned and held up the lamp as she quickly retraced her steps to the room she took a different passageway that ran in the general direction she wanted to go it was a much more congeniallooking hall with whitewashed walls and ceiling making the lamp better able to brighten her way she encountered no shields at all in the white hall a stairway took her lower into the keep another stone hall at the bottom provided quick travel devoid of shields in her mind she was retracing the halls rooms stairs and cramped tunnels and was pretty sure that by eliminating the false routes she had taken there was a way to get to and from the tower without encountering any shields kahlan threw open the door at the end of the stone hall and stepped out onto a walkway with an iron railing she held the lamp up in front of her she stood at the bottom level of the tower the walkway ringed the hall stairs wound their way up around the inside of the immense stone tower with landings at other doors along the way in the center at the bottom of the tower lurked a pool of black water rocks broke the surface of the water here and there bugs skittered across the inky surface of the pool salamanders rested on the rocks their eyes rolling to watch her this was the place where she and richard had fought the mriswith queen her stinking broken eggs still littered the rock small bits of the door blasted from kolos room still floated in the pool providing islands for fat bugs that hissed at the intrusion across the water on the opposite side of the round tower room was the opening to kolos room kahlan quickly made her way around the walkway to the wide platform outside kolos room the doorway had been blown open leaving blackened jagged edges in some places the stone itself was melted like candle wax the tower wall outside the doorway was streaked with blackened lines of soot from the unleashed power that had opened kolos room for the first time in millennia when richard had destroyed the towers of perdition it had destroyed the magic seal on this room too the towers had sealed the old world away from the new in the great war three thousand years before they had also sealed the room with the sliph and sealed in the man who had been unfortunate enough to be the one guarding her at the time stone fragments crunched under her feet as kahlan stepped into the room where kolo had died the room where dwelled the sliph the silence was oppressive it droned in her ears making her welcome the relief of her footsteps richard had awakened the sliph after thousands of years the sliph had taken richard to the old world and had brought him and kahlan safely back to aydindril when they returned richard had put the sliph back to sleep all the years kahlan had spent in the keep and she had never known the sliph was there kahlan couldnt even imagine the magic the wizards of old could use to conjure a being such as the sliph or how they could have put her to sleep for all that time so that she could wake again only at the fringes of her imagination could she conceive of the power richard wielded but didnt comprehend what would the war wizards of old who knew their gift well have been able to do with such unfathomable magic what terrors would a war among those with that kind of power have been like the very thought gave her shivers it would have been things like the plague that had been set upon them now they could do those kinds of things the lamplight fell across kolos bones beside the chair the pen and inkwell still sat on the dusty table the round room nearly sixty feet across was capped with a highdomed ceiling itself nearly as tall as the room was wide in the center was a round stone wall like a well twentyfive or thirty feet across there dwelled the sliph kahlan held the light over the wall of the well and glanced briefly down the smooth stone walls of the dark shaft that fell away seemingly forever the walls of the room were scorched in ragged lines as if lightning had gone wild in the placeanother result of the same magic richard had invoked when he destroyed the towers and when the doorway had been blasted open kahlan strode quickly around the room checking to see if there was anything that might be useful there was nothing in the room other than the table chair and kolo except for a dusty set of shelves kahlan was disappointed to find that there were no books on the shelves there were three faded blue glazed lidded containers probably once holding water or soup for the wizard on duty guarding the sliph a white glazed bowl held a silver spoon a neatly folded cloth or embroidery of some sort sat on one of the shelves when she touched it it disintegrated into dust and little flakes where her fingers contacted it kahlan bent lower seeing that the bottom shelf held only a few spare candles and a lamp an abrupt sensation of icy alarm inundated her she was being watched she froze holding her breath telling herself that it was just her imagination the fine hairs at the back of her neck stiffened she felt a cold wave of gooseflesh run up her arms she strained to hear a telling sound her toes cringed inside her boots she feared to move carefully quietly she let her lungs draw a needed breath slowly ever so slowly so as not to make a sound she straightened a little she dared not move her feet lest the stone chips crunch courage as thin as eggshells urged her to hide behind the wall of the sliphs well from there she could determine if it was only her imagination spooking her perhaps it was just a rat she twisted to check the distance to the stone wall kahlan sucked a cry as she flinched back chapter the quicksilver face of the sliph had risen above the edge of the stone wall and was watching her the glossy metallic female features of the sliph reflected the lamplight and the room in a living mirror it was obvious why kolo called the sliph she the sliph was a silver statue except it moved with liquid grace kahlan pressed a hand to her hammering heart as she panted getting her breath the sliph watched her as if curious about what kahlan might do next kolo often said in his journal that she was watching him sliph kahlan stammered what are you doingawake the face distorted into a puzzled frown do you wish to travel the eerie voice echoed around the room her lips hadnt moved as she spoke but she smiled pleasantly travel no kahlan took a step toward the well sliph richard put you to sleep i was here master he woke me yes richard woke you he traveled in you he rescued me and i traveled back with him in you kahlan recalled that strange experience with a certain fondness to travel in the sliph you had to breathe her in it was frightening at first but with richard there holding her hand kahlan had been able to do it and had discovered the enthralling sensation of traveling to breathe the sliph was rapture i remember the sliph said once you are in me i remember but dont you remember richard putting you to sleep again he woke me from the sleep of ages but he did not put me back into the long sleep he put me at rest until i was needed but we thoughtwe thought you had gone back to sleep why are you not at rest now i felt you near i came to look kahlan stepped to the stone wall sliph has someone traveled in you since richard and i last did yes i was used suddenly realization broke through her surprise a man and a woman they traveled in you didnt they the sliphs smile turned sly but she didnt answer kahlan touched her fingers to the stone wall who was it sliph who traveled in you you should know that i never betray those i hold within me i should know how would i know you have traveled in me i would not reveal you i never betray my clients you traveled so you must understand kahlan licked her lips patiently sliph im afraid that i dont know anything about you really you are from a time before my timefrom another age i only know that you can travel and that you helped me before you were a valuable aid in defeating some very bad people i am glad that you were pleased with me perhaps you would like to be pleased again would like to travel again a shiver ran up kahlans spine this had to be why marlin was trying to get to the keep he and sister amelia must have come to aydindril from the old world in the sliph jagang had said he had waited to reveal himself until she returned how else could she have returned to him so fast except in the sliph kahlan swept out an imploring arm sliph some very evil people she halted sucking a breath through her open mouth her eyes widened sliph she whispered you took me to the old world before ah i know the place come we will travel no no not there sliph can you travel other places of course where many places you must know you have traveled name the place that would pleasure you and we will travel kahlan leaned toward the alluring smiling silver face the witch woman can you take me to the witch woman i do not know this place its not a place its a person she lives in the rangshada mountains in a place called agaden reach can you go there to agaden reach ah i have been there kahlan touched her trembling fingers to her lips come and we will travel the sliph said her haunting voice echoing around the ancient stone walls the sound died out slowly letting silence settle once more covering everything like the veil of dust in the room kahlan cleared her throat i have to go do something first will you still be here when i get back will you wait for me if i am at rest you can let me know of your need and we will travel you will be pleased you mean if youre not right here i should call down to you and you will come to me and we will travel yes we will travel kahlan rubbed her hands together as she backed away ill be back ill be back soon and we will travel yes the sliph said watching kahlan retreat we will travel kahlan snatched the lamp from where she had set it on the floor near the shelves she paused at the door looking back at the quicksilver face floating in the gloom ill be back soon we will travel yes we will travel the sliph said as kahlan started running kahlan had to struggle to think where she was going as she ran her mind spun with arguments while she grappled with her alternatives she also tried to pay attention as she turned down halls raced through rooms and dashed upstairs she seemed to reach library hall before she was ready huffing she realized that she couldnt run in on cara and berdine in such a state they would know something was wrong not far from the library where the two mordsith waited kahlan collapsed onto a padded bench letting the lamp slip to the floor she leaned back against the wall and stretched out her aching legs she fanned her face with one hand she gulped air and tried to convince her heart to slow down she knew her face must be red as an apple she couldnt walk in on the other two like this kahlan made plans as she rested waiting for her heart to slow her lungs to recover her face to cool shota knew something about the plague kahlan was sure of it shota had said about richard may the spirits have mercy on his soul shota had sent nadine to marry richard kahlan vividly recollected nadines tight dress her flirtatious smiles her accusations telling richard that kahlan was heartless the look in nadines eyes when she talked to him kahlan thought about what she must do shota was a witch woman everyone feared the witch woman even wizards feared shota kahlan had never done anything against her but that had never stopped shota from hurting her shota might kill her not if kahlan killed her first the distraction of making plans had allowed her to regain her composure she stood smoothed down her dress and took a deep settling breath kahlan put on her confessors face and strode through the doors to the library where the other two waited cara and berdine popped out from behind a row of bookshelves the books were gone from the table cara eyed kahlan suspiciously youve been gone long enough it took me a while to find a way with shields i could pass berdine came out from behind the shelves well did you find anything find anything like what berdine spread her hands books you went to look for books no nothing cara was frowning did you have any problems no im just upset about all this about everything the plague and all im upset that i couldnt find anything to help what about you two berdine swiped a stray strand of hair back from her face nothing nothing about the temple of the winds or the team who sent it away i dont understand kahlan said mostly to herself if there was a trial as kolo said then there should be a record of it well berdine said we were looking through the other books to see if we missed any of the records of the trials we didnt find any where else can we look kahlan sagged in disappointment she had been sure they would find a record of the trial for richard nowhere if it isnt here then there must be no record of the trial or else it was destroyed from what kolo said the keep was in an uproar at the time they may have been too busy to keep a record berdine cocked her head but were going to keep looking for part of the night at least kahlan looked about the library no it would be a waste of time the time would be better spent if you kept working on kolos journal if we dont have the record of the trial translating the journal would be the best help to richard maybe you can find something important in the journal in the brightness of the library kahlans resolve was beginning to falter she began to reconsider her plan well cara said i guess we better get back then no telling what nadine will be up to if she gets into lord rahls room shell get blisters kissing him while hes asleep and helpless berdine pressed her lips tight and smacked caras shoulder whats the matter with you the mother confessor is a sister of the agiel cara blinked in surprise forgive me i was only making a joke she touched kahlans arm you know that i will kill nadine if you wishyou have but to ask dont worry raina would not let nadine into his room kahlan wiped a tear from her cheek i know its just that with all thats going on know her mind was made up it might help richard find an answer it might help richard discover something that would stop the plague kahlan knew she was only making excuses to herself she knew why she was going did you find what you were looking for raina asked as kahlan cara and berdine approached no kahlan said there was no record of the trial im sorry raina said kahlan gestured to the door has anyone tried to bother him raina smirked she came by she wanted to check on lord rahl to make sure he was sleeping she said kahlan didnt have to ask who came by her blood heated and you let her in raina smiled that dark smile of hers i put my head in saw that lord rahl was asleep and told her so i didnt let her have so much as a peek at him good but shell probably be back rainas smile widened i dont think so i told her that if i caught her in this hall again tonight she would feel my agiel against her bare bottom when she left there was no doubt in her mind that i meant it cara laughed kahlan couldnt raina its late why dont you and berdine go get some sleep kahlan caught the quick glance to berdine berdine just like lord rahl needs to get some rest so that she can work on the journal tomorrow we all need some rest ulic and egan here will watch over richard raina slapped the back of her hand against ulics stomach you boys up to it can you handle it without me ulic scowled down at the mordsith we are the lord rahls bodyguards if anyone tried to get into his room there wouldnt be enough left for you to pick your teeth with raina shrugged i guess the boys can handle it lets go berdine its about time you got a good nights sleep for a change cara stood beside kahlan as she watched berdine and raina stride off down the hall passing a critical eye over soldiers on patrol you are right about rest you need to get some sleep too mother confessor cara said you dont look well i i want to check on richard first ill be able to sleep better if i know hes all right ill be back out in a minute she gave cara a firm look to discourage any ideas she might have about going in with her why dont you go get some sleep too cara clasped her hands behind her back i will wait richards room was dark but the light coming from the window proved enough to find the bed kahlan stood beside him and listened to his even breathing she knew how distressed richard was by recent events she felt the same pain how many families were suffering in grief this night how many more would be suffering the next and the night after kahlan sat lightly on the edge of the bed she slipped an arm under his shoulders and strained to gently lift him he murmured her name under his breath in his sleep but didnt wake as she sat him up a bit and leaned the heavy weight of him against her kahlan reached behind and picked up the glass with the sleeping potion nadine had made it was still half full she held it to his mouth and tipped it letting the potion slide to his lips he stirred slightly and swallowed as she tipped the glass higher drink richard she urged in a whisper she kissed his forehead drink my love it will help you sleep she tipped the glass a little more each time he swallowed forcing him to drink more when he had taken most of it she set it behind once more he murmured her name again kahlan hugged his head holding his cheek to her breast she pressed her cheek to the top of his head as a tear rolled over the bridge of her nose and fell into his hair i love you so much richard she whispered no matter what dont ever doubt how much i love you he mumbled something she couldnt understand except for the word love kahlan eased him back onto the pillow and slipped her arm out from underneath him she pulled up his covers she kissed her finger and gently pressed the kiss to his lips before she left the room on the way to her own room she again told cara that she should go get some sleep i will not leave you unguarded cara insisted cara you need sleep too cara glanced over out of the comer of her eye i have no intention of letting lord rahl down again when kahlan started to protest cara spoke over her words i will be posting soldiers outside your room too i can nap there and if anything happens i will be at hand ill get enough sleep kahlan had things to do she needed cara out of her hair you saw how richard was when he didnt get enough sleep cara let out a dismissive chuckle mordsith are stronger than men besides he was like that because he hadnt slept for days i slept last night kahlan didnt want to argue she was frantically trying to think of how to overcome this obstacle in skintight leather she couldnt let cara know what she was doing sister of the agiel or not cara would tell richard there was no doubt of that that was the last thing kahlan wanted under no circumstances did she want richard knowing what she was going to do she would have to think of a new plan i dont know if im ready for bed im kind of hungry you look tired mother confessor you need sleep not food you wont sleep as well if you eat right before bed i want you to get a good sleep like lord rahl you can sleep well knowing that nadine will not be going near him i have a good idea of what raina said to nadine and i can assure you that as brazen as that strumpet is she has enough sense to heed a warning from raina you have no cause for fear tonight so you can sleep well cara what are you afraid of besides magic and rats cara scowled i dont like rats i am not afraid of them kahlan didnt believe a word of it she waited until they were out of earshot of a patrol passing in the opposite direction what scares you what do you fear nothing cara kahlan admonished its me kahlan a sister of the agiel everyone is afraid of something i wish to die in battle not weak and sick in a bed at the hands of some unseen foe i fear lord rahl getting the plague and leaving us without a master of dhara im afraid of that too kahlan whispered im afraid of richard getting the plague and everyone else i love you berdine raina ulic egan and everyone i know here at the palace lord rahl will find a way to stop it kahlan hooked some hair behind her ear are you afraid of not finding a man who will love you cara flashed kahlan an incredulous look why would i be afraid of that i have but to give any man permission to love me and he would kahlan let her gaze drift from cara to the columns at the sides of the room they were passing through their boot strikes echoed off the marble floor i love richard a confessors magic will destroy a man if she loves him you know when theyre together only because richard is special has special magic can he love me in return im terrified of losing him i want no one but richardeverbut even if i wanted i couldnt no other man could express his love for me except richard i could never have anyone else caras voice softened in sympathy lord rahl will find a way to stop the plague they passed from the marble floor onto the quiet of carpets running up the stairs toward kahlans room cara im terrified of losing richard to nadine lord rahl does not care for nadine i can see it in his eyes that he has no interest in her lord rahl only has eyes for you kahlan ran her fingers along the smooth marble railing as she ascended the stairs cara a witch woman sent nadine cara had no answer for that magic was involved when they came at last to the door to her rooms kahlan paused she looked into caras blue eyes cara will you make me a promise as a sister of the agiel if i can with all thats going onso much has gone wrong already will you promise me that if if something happens if i somehow make a mistake the worst mistake ive ever made and i somehow get things wrong will you promise me that you wont let it be her instead of me who has richard what could happen lord rahl loves you not that woman anything could happen the plagueshotaanything please cara i couldnt bear to think that if anything happened nadine would have my place with richard kahlan clutched caras arm please im begging you promise me caras intent blue eyes stared back mordsith didnt take oaths lightly kahlan knew that she was asking for something of solemn importance she was asking cara to swear her life on this for that was what it meant for a mordsith to give her word cara brought her agiel up in her fist she kissed it nadine will not have your place with lord rahl i swear it kahlan nodded words failing her for a moment get some sleep mother confessor i will be here watching your rooms no one will bother you you can sleep well knowing that nadine will never take your place you have my oath thank you cara kahlan whispered in gratitude you truly are a sister of the agiel if you ever want a favor in return you have but to name it chapter kahlan was finally able to send away nancy and her helper telling them that she was exhausted and wanted only to go to bed she had to decline an offer of a bath having her hair brushed a massage and food but she let nancy help her with her dress so as not to raise the womans suspicion kahlan rubbed her bare arms in the chill after she was alone at last she tested her wound under the bandage it was healing well and hardly hurt her anymore drefan had helped it and she supposed that nadines poultices had been a benefit too kahlan slipped on a dressing gown and went to the writing desk beside one of the hearths the heat felt good but it only warmed one side of her she pulled paper and pen from a drawer as she took the silver lid from the ink bottle she tried to organize her thoughts and what she would write at last she dipped the pen my dearest richard i have something important to do and i have to do it alone i am serious about this not only because i respect you but because you are the seeker i bow to what you sometimes do that i wish would be otherwise i understand that i must sometimes allow you to do what you know you must i am the mother confessor you must understand that i must sometimes do what i must this is one of those times please if you love me then you will respect my wishes not interfere and leave me to do what i must i have had to trick cara which i greatly regret she does not know anything of what i plan she did not know i was leaving if you hold her liable for this i will view it with the greatest displeasure i dont know when i will return but i expect that i will be gone for a few days i am doing this to help our situation i beg you to understand and not be angry with me must do this signed the mother confessor your queen your love for all time in this world and those beyondkahlan kahlan folded the letter and wrote richards name on the outside she opened it and read it again just to be sure she hadnt revealed anything she didnt want to him to know she was satisfied with to help our situation it was vague enough to mean anything she hoped she wasnt being too harsh with the way she insisted he not interfere kahlan brought a candle close and heated the end of a stick of colored sealing wax from the drawer she watched the wax drip onto the letter making a red pool and then pressed the mother confessors sealtwin lightning boltsinto the warm wax she kissed the letter blew out the candle and propped the letter against it so it couldnt be missed she never used to know why the mother confessors seal was twin lightning bolts but she did now it was the symbol of the con darthe blood ragean ancient component to a confessors magic it was magic so rarely invoked that she had never known of it her mother had died before she could teach kahlan to call it forth if needed after she had met richard and fallen in love with him she had invoked it by instinct in the grip of that magic she had painted a lightning bolt on each cheek as a warning to others not to get in her way a confessor in the con dar couldnt be reasoned with the blood rage was the subtractive side of a confessors magic invoked for retribution kahlan had brought it to life within herself when she thought darken rahl had killed richard it was called forth on behalf of someone and could only be used to defend that person it couldnt be used to defend herself like her confessors power which she had always felt in the core of her being the con dar was always there now just below the surface a menacing storm cloud on the horizon she had felt it instantly rip through her when she needed it to protect richard blue lightning that destroyed all before it without the subtractive as well as the common additive magic a person couldnt travel in the sliph the sisters of the dark and the wizards who had become the keepers minions could call on subtractive magic too kahlan went into her bedroom she stripped off the dressing robe and tossed it on the bed she pulled open the bottom drawer of the ornately carved chest and pawed through her things looking for what she needed inside were clothes she had worn before when she had been on her journeys better suited to what she was going to do than was her white mother confessors dress she stepped into dark green pants she pulled out a heavy shirt and threw it on buttoning it up with shaking fingers she tucked in the shirt and buckled the wide belt she left the waist pouch from the back of the drawer kahlan retrieved an object carefully wrapped in a square of white cloth she set it on the floor and crouching over it laid back the corners of the cloth even though she knew what it was and what it looked like she couldnt help feeling a shiver when she actually saw it again atop the cloth sat the spirit knife chandalen had given her it was a weapon made from the arm bone of his grandfather this knife had saved her life before she had used it to kill prindin a man who had been her friend but who had turned to the keeper at least she thought she had killed him she didnt remember exactly what had happened that day she had at the time been under the influence of the poison prindin had been giving her she wasnt entirely sure that it wasnt the spirit of chandalens grandfather who had saved her prindin had lunged atop her and the knife seemed just to be there in her hand she remembered his blood running down the knife and over her fist inky black raven feathers spread in a fan from the round knob of bone at the top raven was powerful spirit magic to the mud people it was associated with death chandalens grandfather had sought the aid of the spirits to protect his people from slaughter by another people of the wilds who had gone mad with the blood lust of war no one knew the reason but the result was a bloodbath chandalens grandfather had called a gathering to ask the spirits for their help his people were peaceful and didnt know how to defend themselves the spirits had taught chandalens grandfather how to kill the jocopo and in so doing they became the mud people the mud people defended themselves and eliminated the threat there were no more jocopo chandalens grandfather had taught his son to be a protector of his people and chandalens father had in turn taught chandalen kahlan knew few men who were as good protectors of their people as chandalen in a battle with the army of the imperial order chandalen had been death itself so had she chandalen wore this spirit knife made from his grandfathers bones and one made from his fathers chandalen had given kahlan the one made from his grandfather so that it might protect her indeed it once had maybe it would again kahlan reverently lifted the bone knife in her hands grandfather of chandalen you helped me before please protect me now she kissed the sharpened bone if she was to face shota kahlan didnt want to do it unarmed she could think of no better weapon to carry she tied the band made of woven prairie cotton around her arm and slipped the knife through it it lay against her upper arm with the black feathers draped down over it it was a surprisingly quick weapon to draw held to her arm as it was even though she was going to see a woman she feared kahlan felt decidedly better with grandfathers spirit knife kahlan pulled a light tan cloak from another drawer she would have liked to have taken one that was heavier considering the spring snowstorm but she wasnt liable to be out in it all that long agaden reach wouldnt be cold as it was in aydindril she was hoping that the light color would help her slip unnoticed past the guards up at the keep and besides with the light cloak she could draw the knife faster she wondered if it was folly to think she could draw her bone knife faster than shota could cast a spell or if such a weapon would even be of any use against a witch woman she threw the cloak around her shoulders the knife was all she had other than her confessors power shota was wary of a confessors power no one was immune to the touch of a confessor if kahlan could touch shota that would be the end of her shota had magic that in the past had prevented kahlan from getting close enough to use her power though but kahlan wouldnt have to be touching shota for the blue lightning of the con dar to work she gave a mental sigh she couldnt invoke the con dar to defend herself kahlan had defended richard with the lightning before when the screeling had attacked him and when the sisters of the light had come to take him kahlan felt a wave of realization course through her mind richard loved her and wanted to marry her to be with her always shota had defied his wishes and sent nadine to marry him he didnt want that even disregarding the fact that richard loved kahlan nadine had caused him anguish hurt him he didnt want to be with her and only tolerated her presence because shota was up to something and he feared to let that threat out of his sight but he desperately didnt want to be forced to marry her shota was banning richard richard was in danger because of shota kahlan could call the con dar to defend him she had done it before at the threat of the sisters taking richard against his wishes kahlan could use the blue lightning to stop shota shota had no defense against that kind of magic kahlan knew how magic worked this was magic from within her like the magic of richards sword it worked through perception if kahlan felt justified in its use to defend richard the con dar would do her bidding she knew richard didnt want shota using him controlling him dictating what his life would be kahlan had justification shota was harming richard the con dar would work against her kahlan paused sitting back on her heels and prayed to the good spirits that they would guide her she wouldnt want to think she was doing this for vengeance or that she was setting out to murder someone she didnt want to think that she intended to kill shota she wondered if she was trying to put justification to something that couldnt be justified no she wasnt going with the intention of killing shota she was just going to get to the bottom of this business with nadine and to find out what shota knew about the temple of the winds but if she had to kahlan intended to defend herself moreover she intended to defend richard against shotaagainst her plans to ruin his future kahlan had had enough of being at the unfavorable end of shotas capricious ire if shota tried to kill her or tried to force this suffering on richard then kahlan would end the threat kahlan already missed richard for so long they had struggled to be together and here she was leaving him if the situation were reversed would she be as understanding as she was expecting him to be at the thought of richard she slowly pulled open the top drawer to her most prized of possessions reverently she lifted her blue wedding dress from its place as the only item in the drawer her thumbs stroked the fine fabric kahlan clutched the dress to her breast as tears took her she carefully set the dress back in its place in the drawer before she got tears on it for a long moment she stood there with one hand on the dress she pushed the drawer closed she had a job to do she was the mother confessor whether she liked it or not shota lived in the midlands and was therefore one of her subjects kahlan didnt want to die and never see richard again but she could no longer tolerate shotas meddling in their livesher tampering with their future shota had sent another woman to marry richard kahlan wouldnt allow that kind of interference to go unchecked her resolve hardened she reached into the back of a wardrobe and pulled a knotted rope from a peg it was there in case of fire so that the mother confessor could escape from the balcony opening the glass doors gave her a shock of snarling wind and snow kahlan squinted against the storm and pulled the doors shut behind her she drew up the hood and stuffed her hair inside it it would do no good to have people recognizing the mother confessorif anyone was even out on a night like this but she knew that the guards up at the wizards keep would be she quickly secured the rope around one of the vaseshaped stone balusters and tossed the rest of the heavy coil out over the railing in the darkness she couldnt see if it reached to the ground she would have to trust that whoever had put the rope in the wardrobe had checked to make sure that it was long enough kahlan swung a leg over the stone railing gripped the rope in both hands and started down kahlan had decided to walk it wasnt that far and besides if she took a horse she would have to leave it at the keep and it might be found giving her away or else shed have to turn it loose before she got there only raising fears as to what had happened to her a horse would also make it more difficult to get past the guards up at the keep the good spirits had provided her with a spring snowstorm the least she could do was take advantage of it tramping through the heavy wet snow she was beginning to wonder if going on foot was the wise thing to do she stiffened her resolve if she was already beginning to secondguess her decisions she had no business going through with the rest of it most of the buildings were shuttered the few people she encountered were too worried about making their own way to be concerned with a huddled figure struggling into the wind in the darkness no one would even be able to tell if she was a man or a woman before long she was out of the city and on the deserted road up to the keep all the way up the road she pondered the best way past the guards these were dharan soldiers it was always a mistake to underestimate dharan soldiers it wouldnt do to have them recognize her they would report it killing sentries was the easiest way to get past them but she couldnt do that they were her men now fighting for their cause against the imperial order killing them was out of the question whacking them across the skull to knock them unconscious was no good either that was never a dependable way to silence someone in her experience hitting a man across the head rarely had the desired result sometimes they would not be knocked unconscious and would scream at the top of their lungs before anything else could be done raising an alarm and bringing other guards ready to kill the intruder besides she had seen men suffer and die from a blow on the head she didnt want that you only hit someone on the head if you intended to kill them because you most likely would the sister and marlin had probably used magic to get by the guards unseen she didnt have any magic that could do that her magic would destroy their minds that left either a trick or stealth dharan sentries were trained in every kind of trick and probably knew more of them than she could even imagine she was down to stealth she wasnt sure exactly where she was but she knew she was getting close the wind was coming from the left so she stayed to the right of the road downwind of them crouching lower us she went on when she got close enough she would have to crawl if she laid down on the snow spread her cloak out over her and waited for a short time the snow would cover her back and hide her then she would have to proceed slowly and if she saw a soldier simply lie still until he passed she wished she had remembered to bring gloves deciding that she was as close as she dared get she moved off the right side of the road she knew that the bridge would be the hardest part it would funnel her into a relatively narrow space with no option of moving away from the soldiers but the soldiers feared the magic of the keep and would probably not be close to the bridge they had been twenty or thirty feet from it when she had seen them before and in the darkness and snow visibility wasnt great she was beginning to feel better about her chances of getting by unseen the snow would provide enough cover kahlan froze in her tracks as a sword blade appeared in front of her face a darting glance revealed a sword to each side another man rested a lance on her back at the base of her neck so much for stealth who goes there came a gruff voice from the man in front of her kahlan had to think of a new plan and fast she quickly settled on a bit of truth mixed in with their fear of magic captain you nearly scared me to death its me the mother confessor show yourself kahlan pushed back her hood i thought id be able to get past you unnoticed i guess dharan sentries are even better than i thought the men lowered their weapons kahlan was the most relieved to feel the lance lift from the back of her neck that was the killing weapon in a challenge mother confessor you gave us a fright you did what are you doing up here again tonight and on foot no less kahlan sighed in resignation get all your men together and ill explain the captain tilted his head over here we have a shelter to get you out of the wind kahlan let them lead her to the other side of the road where stood a simple threesided structure meant to give some relief from wind and wet weather it wasnt big enough for her and all six men they insisted she take the driest spot farthest inside she was torn between satisfaction that even in a snowstorm no one got past dharan guards and wishing she had it would have made it much easier now she was going to have to talk her way out of it all of you listen carefully she began i dont have a lot of time im on an important mission i need your confidence all of you you all know about the plague the men grunted and nodded that they did shifting their weight uncomfortably richard lord rahl is trying to find a way to stop it we dont know if there is a way but he wont give up you know that he would do anything it takes to save his people the men were nodding again whats that got to do with im in a hurry lord rahl is sleeping right now hes exhausted from trying to find a cure for the plague a cure that involves magic the men straightened a bit the captain rubbed his chin we know that lord rahl wont let us down he cured me a few days back kahlan looked to all the eyes watching her well what if lord rahl comes down with the plague himself before he can find an answer then what were all dead thats what the anxiety on their faces was clear for dharans to lose a lord rahl was a calamitous event it cast all their futures into doubt what can be done to protect him the captain asked what can be done is up to you men here tonight what can we do lord rahl loves me you men all know how he protects me he has those mordsith shadowing me all the time he sends guards with me wherever i go he wont let danger come within miles of me he wont let harm even get a view of me well i dont want him harmed either what if he gets the plague then we all lose him i may have a way to help him stop the plague before it can touch us all before he can get it as surely he will they gasped what can we do to help the captain asked what im doing involves magicvery dangerous magic if im successful i may be able to protect richard from the plague protect all of us from the plague but like i said its dangerous i need to go away for a few days with the aid of magic to see if i might be able to help lord rahl stop the plague you men know how he guards me he would never let me go he would rather die than let me be exposed to danger he cant be reasoned with when it comes to my being in danger thats why i tricked the mordsith and my other guards no one knows where im going if anyone finds out then richard will come after me and be in the same danger as me what good will that do if im killed then he would be killed too if im successful theres no reason to expose him to the danger i intended for no one to find out where i went tonight but you men are better than i gave you credit for now its up to you im risking my life to protect lord rahl if you want to protect him too then you must swear to secrecy even if he looks you in the eye you must tell him that you havent seen me that no one came up here the men shuffled their feet cleared their throats and looked at one another the captains fingers fretted with his sword hilt mother confessor if lord rahl looks us in the eye and asks us we cant lie to him kahlan leaned closer to the man then you may as well slay him on the spot thats what youll be doing do you want to endanger your lord rahls life do you want to be responsible for his dying of course not wed all lay down our lives for him im offering to lay down my life too if he finds out what im doing where i went this night then he will come after me he can be of no help and he may die because of it kahlan pulled her arm out from under her cloak and passed a finger before each mans face you will be responsible for endangering lord rahls life you will be exposing him to harms view to no purpose you may be killing him the captain looked into the eyes of each of his men he straightened and rubbed his face as he considered at last he spoke what is it you wish us to do swear on our lives no kahlan said i want you to swear on lord rahls life at the captains lead the men all went to one knee we give our oath on lord rahls life to tell no one that we saw you again tonight and further to swear that no one went up to the keep except you and your two mordsith earlier he looked about at his men swear it when they had all sworn the men stood the captain placed a fatherly hand on kahlans shoulder mother confessor i dont know anything about magic thats lord rahls business and i dont know what youre up to tonight but we dont want to lose you either youre good for lord rahl whatever youre about to do please be careful thank you captain i think you men are the most danger ill see tonight tomorrow is another matter if you are killed it ends our oath if you die we will have to tell lord rahl what we know if that happens we will be executed no captain lord rahl wouldnt do something like that thats why we have to do what we must to protect him we all need him lest we be ruled by the imperial order they have no respect for lifeit is they who started this plague they started it among children kahlan swallowed as she stared into the silver face of the sliph yes im ready what do you want me to do a lustrous metallic hand rose up from the pool and touched the top of the wall come to me the voice said echoing around the room you do not do i do kahlan climbed up onto the wall and youre sure you can take me to agaden reach yes i have been there you will be pleased kahlan didnt know about being pleased how long will it take the sliph seemed to frown kahlan could see herself reflected in the shiny surface of the sliphs face from here to there that long i am long enough i have been there kahlan sighed the sliph didnt seem to understand that she had been asleep for three thousand years either what was a day more or less to her you wont tell richard where you took me will you i dont want him to know the silver face distorted into a sly smile none who know me wish others to know i never betray them be at ease no one will know what we do together no one will know of your pleasure kahlans face assumed a perplexed expression the liquid silver arm came up and slipped around her the warm undulating grip held her tight do not forget you must breathe me the sliph said do not be afraid i will keep you alive when you breathe me when we reach the other place you must then breathe me out and breathe in the air you will be just as afraid to do that as you will be to breathe me but you must do it or you will die kahlan nodded as she panted she rocked from one foot to the other i remember she couldnt help fearing to be without air all right im ready without further word the sliphs arm lifted her gently from the wall and plunged with her down into the quicksilver froth kahlans lungs burned her eyes were squeezed shut she had done it before and knew she must but she was still terrified to breathe in this liquid silver richard had been with her the last time alone this time panic snatched at her she thought about shota sending nadine to marry richard kahlan let the air go from her lungs she pulled a deep breath inhaling the sliphs silken essence there was no heat no cold she opened her eyes and saw light and dark in a single spectral vision she felt movement in the weightless void at once fast and slow rushing and drifting her lungs swelled with the sweet presence of the sliph it felt as if she were taking the sliph into her soul time meant nothing it was rapture chapter through the warm swirl of color zedd could hear ann calling his name it was a distant plea even though she stood only a short distance away in the flux of power atop his wizards rock it might as well have come from another world in many ways it did her voice came again irritating insistent urgent zedd all but ignored her as he lifted his arms into the rotating smoke of light shapes before him hinted at their spirit presence he was almost through abruptly the wall of power began to collapse the sleeves of his robes slipped down his arms as zedd threw his contorted hands higher trying to coerce more puissance into the field of magic trying to stabilize it he was madly hauling a bucket from the well and finding it empty sparkles of color fizzled the twisting eddy of light degenerated into a muddy gloom of color with gathering speed it slumped foundering impotently zedd was dumbfounded with a thump that shook the ground the whole elaborately forged warp in the world of existence extinguished zedds arms windmilled as ann snatched the back of his collar and yanked him from atop his wizards rock he tumbled back knocking them both to the ground deprived of enlivening magic the rock too collapsed zedd hadnt done it his wizards rock had reverted to its inert state of its own accord now he truly was baffled bags woman whats the meaning of this dont you curse at me you contrary old man i dont know why i bother trying to save your skinny hide why did you interfere i was almost through i didnt interfere she growled but if it wasnt youzedd shot a glance at the dark hills you mean i suddenly lost the link with my han i was trying to warn you not stop you oh zedd said in a thin voice thats very different he stretched out and snatched up his wizards rock why didnt you say so he slipped the rock into an inner pocket ann scanned the darkness did you find out anything before you lost contact i never made contact her gaze shot back at him you never what do you mean you never made contact what were you doing all that time trying he said as he reached for a blanket something was wrong i couldnt reach through get your things wed better get out of here ann scooped up a saddlebag and began stuffing their gear into it zedd she said in a worried tone we were counting on this now that you have failed i didnt fail he snapped at least it wasnt my fault that it wasnt working she slapped his hands away when he pushed her toward her horse why wouldnt it work the red moons she twisted and stared at him you think its not something i do often or lightly ive only made contact with the spirit world a handful of times in the whole of my life my father warned me when he gave me the rock that it must only be used in the most dire of circumstances such contact risks letting the wrong spirits through and worse tearing the veil when i had trouble making contact in the past it was because of a disharmony the red moons were a warning of disharmony of a sort were running out of things to try she yanked her arm from his grip whats gotten into you zedd grunted whats this you said about not being able to touch your han ann stroked a hand along the flanks of her horse letting it know she was close to its hindquarters the horse pawed a front hoof as it whickered when you were up on your rock i was casting sensing webs to make sure no one was near this is the wilds after all and you were making quite a show with all the light all of a sudden when i reached to touch my han again it was like falling on my face zedd flicked his hand casting a simple web to flip over a fistsized rock lying at his feet nothing happened it felt rather like trying to lean against something and finding out too late that it wasnt there like falling on his face zedd reached into an inner pocket and pulled out a pinch of concealing dust he cast it in the direction they had come the breeze carried it away it didnt sparkle were in trouble he whispered she huddled close to him you wouldnt mind being more specific would you leave the horses he took her arm again come on this time she didnt object as he took her arm and led her at a trot zedd what is it she whispered this is the wilds he stopped lifted his nose and sniffed the air my guess would be nangtong he pointed in the dim moonlight down here in this ravine we must do our best to stay out of sight we may have to split up and try to escape in separate directions zedd held her arm helping her as her feet slipped on the dewy grass and wet clay of the steep sides who are the nangtong zedd reached the bottom first he put his hands on her wide waist and helped her down her legs were short and she didnt have the reach with them that he had with his without the aid of magic her weight almost toppled him with a hand she caught a tangled mat of bur bush roots to steady herself the nangtong zedd whispered are a people of the wilds they have magic of their own they cant exactly use their magic for anything the way we use it but it leaches the strength right out of other magic like rain on a campfire thats the trouble with the wilds there are any number of people in the wilds who cause odd things to go wrong with your attempts to use magic there are creatures and places here too that are trouble in ways you dont expect its best to stay clear of the wilds thats why i was so perturbed when after nathan said we had to go to the jocopo treasure verna told us that the jocopo used to live somewhere in the wilds nathan might as well have told us to reach into a roaring fire and pull out a hot coal there are hazards everywhere in the wilds the nangtong are only one of them so what makes you think its these nangtong people who are causing the trouble with our magic with most peoples of the wilds who have this effect it steals the strength out of our magic but my concealing dust would still have worked it doesnt the nangtong are the only ones i know of who can do that ann held her arms out to the sides to help balance herself and keep her footing as she crossed behind him on a fallen log the moon slipped behind the clouds the return of darkness pleased zedd because it helped hide them but it made it nearly impossible to see where to step they would be no less dead if they fell and broke their necks than if they were run through with a poison arrow or spear point maybe we could show them that were friendly ann whispered from behind him she nabbed his robes so she could follow in the dark as he hurried along the flat beside the stream youre always boasting and telling me to let you do the talking as if you have a magic honeyed tongue to hear you tell it why dont you simply tell these nangtong that were looking for the jocopo and we would appreciate their help many people who would seem to be trouble turn out to be reasonable if you only talk with them he turned his head back so he could keep his voice low and she would still be able to hear him i agree but i dont speak their language so i cant win them over if these people are so dangerous and you know it then why would you be so foolish as to take us right into them i didnt i skirted their lands by a wide margin so you say it would appear youve gotten us lost no the nangtong are seminomadic they have no exact permanent home but they stay within their own homelands i stayed out of their homelands its probably a spirit raiding party a what zedd halted and crouched low studying the lay of the land he couldnt see anyone in the faint light and he could only vaguely detect the foreign smell of sweat it could be that it had been carried on the breeze for miles a spirit raiding party he said as he put his mouth close to her ear its a long story but the ending is that they offer sacrifices to the spirit world it is their belief that the newly departed spirit will carry the nangtongs respects and requests to their departed ancestors and in return the spirits will look kindly upon them the hunting parties hunt things to sacrifice people sometimes if they can get away with it they arent very brave when they encounter strong oppositionthey would rather run than have a fightbut they will gladly pick off the weak or defenseless in the name of creation what kind of place is this midlands letting people get away with such things i thought you people were more civilized than that i thought you had this alliance through which everyone in the midlands cooperated and saw to the common good the confessors come here to try to insure the nangtong dont murder people but its a remote place the nangtong are always servile when a confessor comes her magic is one of the few not altered by the nangtongs power it could be that because a confessors power has an element of the subtractive to it it isnt altered why would you fools leave these people to their own devices if you know what they are capable of zedd scowled at her in the darkness part of the reason for the midlands alliance was to protect those with magic who would be slaughtered by stronger lands they dont have magic you said they couldnt do anything with magic since they can nullify magic make it impotent then that means that they have magic those without magic could not do such a thing its part of the way these people defend themselves its their teeth so to speak used to defend themselves against those with powerful magic who would subjugate or destroy them we leave alone people and creatures with magic they have as much right to exist as we but we try to insure that they dont murder innocent people we may not like all forms of magic but we dont believe in exterminating the creators beings to make a world in the image of those with the most power she remained silent so he went on there are creatures that can be dangerous such as a gar but we dont go out and kill all the gars instead we leave them be let them have their own lives the way the creator intended it is not up to us to judge the wisdom of creation the nangtong are diffident when challenged by strength but deadly when they think they have the upper hand theyre a kind of scavengerlike vultures or wolves or bears it wouldnt be right to eliminate those creatures they have a part to play in the world she put her face close so she could express her displeasure without yelling and what part do the nangtong play ann i am not the creator nor do i have conversations with him to discuss his choices in creating life and magic but i am respectful enough to allow that he may have a reason and it isnt my place to say he is wrong that would be naked arrogance in the midlands we allow all forms of creation to exist and if its dangerous we simply keep away from it you of all people with your dogmatic teachings of your version of the creator should be able to sympathize with this view anns words whispered though they were became heated our duty is to teach heathens such as this to respect the creators other beings tell that to the wolf or the bear her growl could have been either sorceresses and wizards are meant to be custodians of magic to protect it just as a parent protects a child zedd said it is not up to us to decide which are good enough to have a right to exist which is worthy of life down that path lies jagangs view of all magic he thinks we are dangerous and that we should be eliminated for the good of all you seem to be siding with the emperor if a bee stings you do you not swat it i didnt say we shouldnt defend ourselves then why havent you defended yourselves and eliminated such threats in the war with darken rahls father panis your own people called you the wind of death you knew how to eliminate a threat then i did what i had to do to protect innocent people who would have been slaughteredwho were being slaughtered i will do the same against jagang if i must the nangtong havent warranted annihilation they dont try to rule others through murder torture and enslavement their beliefs result in harm only if we are careless enough to intrude theyre dangerous you should never have let the threat continue he shook a finger at her and why havent you killed nathan to eliminate the threat he represents would you equate nathan with those who sacrifice people for heathen beliefs and i can tell you that when i get my hands on nathan again i will set him on the right path good but in the meanwhile this is a poor time to debate theology zedd smoothed back his wavy hair unless you wish to begin teaching the nangtong your beliefs i would suggest we follow mine and remove ourselves from their hunting grounds ann sighed perhaps you have a point or two your intentions at least were benevolent with a shooing motion she signaled for him to get going zedd followed the twisting gorge trying to stay out of the sluggish ribbon of water running through it the ravine led southwest he knew that would take them away from the nangtong homeland he hoped it would also conceal them while they fled the nangtong had spears and arrows when the moon came out between a break in the clouds zedd put out a hand to stop ann and squatted down to take a quick appraisal of the landscape while there was light enough for a moment he saw little but the eight to tenfoothigh walls of the banks and beyond the nearly barren hills there were scattered copses on distant hills in the low valley ahead the stream ran into a thicket of woods zedd turned back to tell ann that their best bet might be to hide in the brush and woods the nangtong might be leery of a trap and stay out of such a place the moon was still out he saw behind them their perfect pair of tracks through the mud he had forgotten that he couldnt hide their trail he pointed so she would see them too she gestured with a thumb indicating that they should get out of the muddy gully twin reedthin screams in the distance cut through the stillness the horses he whispered the screams silenced abruptly their throats had been cut bags those were good horses do you have anything with which to defend yourself ann flicked her wrist and brought forth a dacra i have this its magic wont work but i can still stab them what do you have zedd smiled fatalistically my honeyed tongue maybe we should split up before your weapon gets me killed zedd shrugged i wouldnt hold it against you if you wish to strike out alone we have important business maybe it would be better if we split up to give a better chance of at least one of us making it she smiled you just want me to miss out on all the fun well get away were a goodly distance from the horses lets stay together zedd squeezed her shoulder maybe they only sacrifice virgins but i dont want to die alone zedd chuckled softly as he moved on searching for a place ahead where he could take them up and out of the ravine he finally found a cut through the bank roots of gnarled bushes hung down like hair providing handholds the moon slid behind a thick cloud in the inky darkness they climbed slowly blindly feeling their way with their hands zedd could hear a few bugs buzzing about and in the distance the mournful call of a coyote other than that the night was still and silent hopefully the nangtong would be busy picking through zedd and anns things back with the horses zedd reached the top and turned to help pull ann up stay on your hands and knees well crawl or at least crouch as we go ann whispered her agreement she made her way atop the bank with him they struck out away from the gully the bright moon came out from behind the cloud in a semicircle right in front of them blocking their way stood the nangtong there were perhaps twenty of them zedd reasoned that there were more about nearby nangtong hunting parties were larger they were not tall and were nearly naked wearing only a thong and a pouch of sorts that held their manhood necklaces made of human finger bones hung around their necks heads were shaved bald they all had sinewy arms and legs and pronounced bellies the nangtong had all smeared white ash over their entire body the area around their eyes was painted black giving them the appearance of living skulls zedd and ann peered up at spears their barbed steel points glinting in the moonlight one of the men chattered an order zedd didnt understand the words but he had a good idea of what it meant dont use the dacra he whispered over to ann theres too many theyll kill us on the spot our only chance is if we can stay alive and think of something he saw her slip the weapon back up her sleeve zedd grinned up at the wall of grim faces would any of you men happen to know where we could find the jocopo a spear jabbed at him then signaled them to stand he and ann reluctantly complied the men not up to zedds shoulders but about as tall as ann crowded in around them suddenly jabbering all at once men pushed and poked at them their arms were pulled back and their wrists tightly bound remind me again ann said to him about the wisdom of leaving these heathens to their unenlightened practices well i heard from a confessor once that they are quite good cooks perhaps we will sample something new and delightful ann stumbled but caught herself as she was pushed on ahead im too old she muttered to the sky to be mucking about with a crazy man an hour of brisk marching brought them to the nangtong village broad round tents perhaps thirty of them made up the mobile community the low tents hunkered close to the ground presenting the least possible purchase to the wind enclosures made of tall stick fences held a variety of livestock chattering people wrapped head to toe in unadorned cloth to hide their identities from the sacrificial offerings about to take their prayers to the spirit world turned out to watch zedd and ann being prodded at spearpoint through the village their captors covered in the white ash and with their eyes painted black were hunters in the guise of the dead so there would be no danger of their being recognized as one of the still living zedd was jerked to a halt before a pen while men undid the rope tie at the gate the gate swung open in the moonlight it seemed that the whole nangtong village had followed behind they hooted and hollered as the two prisoners were hustled through the gate apparently wanting to give messages to the two spirits about to go speak on the nangtongs behalf to their ancestors zedd and ann their wrists still bound behind their backs both fell when they were forcefully shoved into the pen it was a muddy landing snorting shapes loped away the pen was occupied by pigs the way they had churned the ground into a quagmire the village must have occupied this place for at least the past few months it smelled like what it was the spirit hunting party nearly fifty as zedd had guessed split up some went back to tents surrounded by gleeful children and stoic women others of the hunters encircled the pen to stand guard most of the people who stood around watching were calling out to the prisoners giving their messages for the spirit world why are you doing this zedd called to their guards he nodded his head and inclined it toward ann why he shrugged one of the guards seemed to understand he made a cutting gesture across his throat and then indicated the imaginary blood running from the pretend wound with his spear he pointed at the moon blood moon ann asked under her breath red moon zedd whispered in realization the last id heard the confessors had secured a pledge from the nangtong that they would no longer sacrifice people i was never sure if they held to their promise just the same people stayed away the red moon must have frightened them made them think the spirit world was angry thats probably why were to be sacrificed to placate the angry spirits ann squirmed uncomfortably in the mud beside him she gave zedd a murderous look i only pray that nathans situation is worse than ours what was it you said zedd asked absently about mucking about with a crazy man chapter what do you think clarissa asked she turned a little one way and then the other trying to mimic a natural stance while feeling anything but natural she wasnt sure what to do with her hands so she clasped them behind her back nathan was lounging in a chair as splendid as any she had ever seen its padded seat and back covered with striped tan and gold fabric his left leg was draped casually over one of the chairs ornately carved arms as he slouched with his elbow propped on the chairs other arm his chin rested thoughtfully in the heel of his hand his swords finely crafted silver scabbard hung down so that its point touched the floor in front of the chair nathan smiled that smile he had that said he was sincerely pleased my dear i think you look lovely really youre not just saying that you really like it i dont look silly he chuckled no most definitely not silly ravishing perhaps but i feel i dont know presumptuous ive never even seen clothes so fine much less tried them on he shrugged then its about time you did the dressmaker a thin neat man with only a wisp of long gray hair covering the bald expanse atop his head returned through the curtained doorway he gripped each end of the tape measure draped around his neck seesawing it nervously back and forth madam finds the dress acceptable clarissa remembered how nathan had instructed her to conduct herself she smoothed the rich blue satin at her hips its not the best fit the dressmakers tongue darted out to wet his lips well madam had i known you were to grace my shop or if you had sent the measurements on ahead i would certainly have made the appropriate alterations he glanced to nathan his tongue darted out again be assured madam i can make any necessary minor adjustments the man bowed to nathan my lord what think you i mean if it were altered to suit you nathan folded his arms as he studied clarissa the way a sculptor studied a work in progress he squinted as he considered rolled his tongue around inside his cheek and made little sounds in his throat as if unable to decide the dressmaker twiddled with the end of his tape measure like madam says it fits a little sloppily at the waist sir have no fear the dressmaker whisked around behind her tugging sharply at the material see here i have but to take a dart or two madam is graced with an exquisite figure i rarely have ladies so fine of form but i can have the dress altered in a matter of hours i would be most honored to do the work this very night and have it delivered to you atatwhere would you be staying my lord nathan flicked a hand ive yet to seek accommodations any place you could recommend with confidence the dressmaker bowed again the briar house would be the finest inn in tanimura my lord if you wish id gladly have my assistant run over there and make arrangements for you and madam nathan straightened himself in the chair and fingered a gold coin from his pocket he flipped the coin to the man followed by a second and then a third yes thank you that would be very kind of you nathan frowned in thought and then tossed the man another gold coin its late but im sure you could convince them to keep their dining room open until we arrive weve been on the road all day and could use a decent meal he shook a finger at the man their best rooms mind you ill not have them sticking me in some cramped little sty i assure you my lord the briar house has no room that could remotely be considered a sty even by one such as yourself and how long shall i have my assistant tell them you will be staying at their establishment nathan stroked the ruffles on the front of his shirt until emperor jagang requires me of course of course sir and would you like the dress my lord nathan hooked a thumb in the little pocket in the front of his green vest letting his hand hang it will have to do for common wear what do you have that would be more elegant the dressmaker smiled and bowed let me bring some others for your approval and madam can try on the ones you fancy yes nathan said yes that would be best im a man of wide experience and refined taste im used to better bring something to dazzle me of course my lord he bowed twice and rushed off clarissa grinned in wonder after the man had gone nathan this is the finest dress ive ever seen and you wish him to show us something better nathan lifted an eyebrow nothing is too good for a concubine to the emperor the woman carrying the emperors child her heart fluttered to hear the prophet say that again sometimes when she looked into his azure eyes she almost saw something there almost had the vaguest impression if only for an instant that nathan was quite beyond mad but when that serene smile of his came to his face she melted in his confidence he was more daring than any man she had ever met his daring had saved her from the brutes back in renwold since then his daring had saved them in circumstances that to her seemed worse than hopeless there had to be a grain of madness in daring that far beyond bold nathan i trust in you and will do whatever you ask of me but please would you tell me if this is just a story to pass us here or do you really see such a horrid thing for my future nathan brought his leg down and rose to his full towering height he lifted one of her hands bringing it to his heart as if it were the most fragile of blossoms his long silver hair slipped over the front of his shoulder as he stood ever so close to her and looked into her eyes clarissa it is just a tale to accomplish my goals it in no way reflects anything i see about the future i wont lie to you and tell you that there are not dangers ahead but be at ease for now and enjoy this much of it we must wait for a while and i wanted you to have an enjoyable time of it you are pledged to do what you must i trust in your word in the meantime i wanted nothing more than to do you a simple kindness but shouldnt we hide where people wont know of us somewhere alone and out of sight that is the way criminals or unskilled runaways would hide thats why they get caught it makes people suspicious if anyone is hunting them they look in all the dark holes never thinking to look in the light as long as we must hide the best place to hide is in the open the story is too preposterous for people not to believe in its truth no one would ever consider that anybody would have the audacity to invent such a tale and so no one will question it besides we arent really hiding no one is hunting us we simply dont want to make people suspicious hiding would make them so she shook her head nathan you are a marvel clarissa eyed the bodice of the beautiful dress what she could see of it anyway beyond the exposed flesh of her breasts which were pushed up so high that they nearly tumbled out she tugged at the bone stays lying against her ribs under her bosom she had never worn such strange and uncomfortable undergarments she couldnt imagine why they were all required she smoothed the silken skirt of the dress does it look good on me i mean honestly tell me the truth nathan im just a plain woman doesnt it look silly on a plain woman nathans eyebrow arched plain is that what you think of course im no fool i know im not nathan waved her to silence maybe you should have a look for yourself he pulled the sheet off the standing mirror this was a showing room for gentlemen when he had instructed her on matters of decorum and propriety he had told her that the mirrors in such a place were rarely used and she wasnt to look in one unless asked it was the look in the gentlemans eyes that mattered in such an exclusive shop not the look in the mirror nathan gently took her elbow and walked her before the mirror forget what you see in your mind and look at what others see when they look at you clarissas fingers fidgeted over the bunched frills at her waist she nodded at nathan but feared to look in the mirror and be disappointed by what she always saw when she looked at herself he gestured again wincing just a little out of embarrassment she turned to gaze at her reflection her jaw dropped at what she saw clarissa didnt recognize herself she was not this younglooking a woman not a young fickle woman but a woman in the full glory of her maturity a woman of elegance and bearingstared back nathan she whispered my hair my hair wasnt this long how did the woman who worked on it this afternoon make it longer ah well she didnt i used some magic to do it i thought it would look better if it was just a bit longer you dont object i pray no she whispered its lovely her soft brown hair was done in ringlets with delicate violet ribbons tied into them she moved her head the ringlets sprang up and down and swayed side to side clarissa had once seen a woman of standing come to renwold and she had hair like this it was the most beautiful hair clarissa had ever seen now clarissas hair looked just like that she stared at herself in the mirror her shape was so shapely all those hard tight things under her dress had somehow rearranged her figure clarissas face blushed to see her bosom straining up the way it did half exposed for all to see she had always known of course that women like manda perlin werent really shaped as they appeared she knew that when they had their clothes off their shapes were not a great deal different from any other womans but clarissa had never known just how much of it was due to the dresses those attractive women wore in the mirror in this dress with her hair done in such a fashion and with the paint on her face she looked the equal of any of them perhaps older but that age seemed only to add bearing to what she saw not a spent unattractive quality as she had always thought and then she saw the ring in her lip it was gold not silver nathan she whispered what happened to the ring oh that well it wouldnt do to have you supposedly a concubine to the emperor himself and carrying his little emperor heir and have a silver ring through your lip everyone knows that the emperor only brings those with gold rings to his bed besides you were wrongly marked with a silver ring it should have been gold from the beginning those men were just plain blind he gestured in a grand fashion i of course am a man of vision he held his hand out toward the mirror look for yourself that woman is too beautiful to wear anything but a gold ring in the mirror the woman staring back was getting tears in her eyes clarissa wiped a finger across her lower lids she feared to ruin the paint the woman had put on her face when her hair was being curled nathan i dont know what to say you have done magic you have made a plain woman into something beautiful he finished but why his face screwed up with an odd expression are you daft i couldnt very well have you looking plain he swept a hand down indicating himself no one would believe a man as dashing as myself would be seen with a woman any less stunning clarissa grinned he didnt look so old to her as he had seemed when she had first met him he really did look dashing dashing and distinguished thank you nathan for having faith in me in more ways than one its not faith its vision for what others are too blind to see now they do she glanced to the curtain where the dressmaker had disappeared but this is all so very expensive this dress alone would cost me near to a years wages and all the other things the lodging the coaches the hats the shoes the women who did my hair and face it all costs so much you are spending money like a prince on holiday how can you possibly afford it the sly smile oozed back onto his face im good at making money i could never spend all i can make dont be concerned about it it means little to me oh she glanced back at the mirror of course he cleared his throat what i mean is that you are more important than petty matters of gold people are more important than such considerations if it was my last copper i would have spent it with no less enthusiasm or greater worry when the dressmaker finally returned with a selection of stunning dresses nathan chose a number for her to try on clarissa went into the dressing room with each and with the aid of the dressmakers woman tried on each clarissa didnt think she would have been able to lace tie and button any of them by herself nathan smiled at each dress she came out in and told the dressmaker he would buy it by the end of the next hour nathan had selected a half dozen dresses and had passed a handful of gold to the dressmaker in all her life she had never imagined a place of such wealth that dresses were already made it was another measure of how much her life had changed with nathan only the very rich or royalty would buy dresses this way i will make the necessary alterations my lord and have the dresses delivered to the briar house he darted a look at clarissa perhaps my lord would wish me to leave several of them loosefitting to accommodate madam when she grows with our emperors child nathan waved a hand dismissively no no i enjoy having her look her best i will have a seamstress let them out when necessary or simply purchase others to fit her then it suddenly embarrassed clarissa to realize that this dressmaker thought that she was concubine not only to the emperor but to nathan the ring through her lip gold though it was still meant she was nothing more than a slave a slave would mean little to the emperor with child or not gold ring or not nathan boldly told people that he was emperor jagangs plenipotentiary which kept them furiously bowing and scraping clarissa was merely property shared with the emperors trusted agent the dressmakers sidelong glance finally struck home she was a whore in his eyes maybe a whore in a fine dress and maybe not a whore by choice but a whore nonetheless a whore who was enjoying herself being dressed in fine clothes and kept by an important man at the finest inn in the city the fact that nathan didnt think the same thing was all that kept her from running from the dress shop in humiliation clarissa reproached herself this was the pretense nathan had crafted for them to keep them safe it kept the soldiers they encountered at every turn from hauling her away to a tent deprecating glances were a small thing indeed for her to bear in return for all that nathan had done for her and for the respect he always showed her it was what nathan thought that mattered besides she was used to disapproving lookslooks of sympathy at best scorn at worst people had never looked upon her with favor let these people think what they would she knew she was doing something worthwhile for a man of worth clarissa lifted her chin as she strutted to the door the dressmaker bowed again as they stepped out into the dark street to the waiting carriage thank you lord rahl thank you for allowing me to serve the emperor in my small way the dresses will be delivered before morning you have my word nathan waved an offhanded dismissal to the man in the dim dining room of the elegant briar house clarissa sat across a small table from nathan she now noticed the surreptitious glances she got from the staff she sat up straighter and put her shoulders back defying them to have a good look at her bosom she reasoned that in the murky candlelight and under all the face paint they wouldnt be able to see her face reddening the wine warmed her and the roasted duck finally sated her gnawing hunger people kept bringing foodfowl and pork and beef along with gravies and sauces and a variety of side dishes she nibbled at a few not wanting to appear a glutton and afterward she was satisfied nathan ate with zeal but didnt overeat he enjoyed the different dishes wanting to try them all the staff hovered around him slicing meat pouring sauces and moving plates and platters around as if he were helpless he encouraged them asking for things sending others away and in general made himself appear an important man in their midst she guessed that he was he was the emperors plenipotentiary a man not to be crossed no one wanted lord rahl to be anything but most pleased if his pleasure required seeing to clarissas desires they did that too clarissa was relieved when they were finally shown to their rooms and nathan had at last closed the door she sagged at last unburdened of the responsibility of acting a fine lady or a fine whore she wasnt exactly sure how to play the part she did know that she was glad to be away from the eyes that played over her nathan strode around the two rooms inspecting the painted walls with gold molding applied to form huge sweeping panels with reversecurved corners rich carpets in deep colors covered nearly every inch of floor everywhere there were couches and chairs one room had several tables one for taking meals there another with a slant top for writing the writing table held neatly arranged sheets of paper silver pens and goldtopped ink bottles with various colors of ink in the other room was the bed clarissa had never seen a bed like it four elaborately turned posts held up a canopy of lace and rich red fabric with gold designs splashed boldly over it the bed cover matched it was a huge bed she had trouble imagining why such an expanse of bed was needed well nathan said as he strolled back into the room with the bed i guess it will have to do clarissa giggled nathan a king would be delighted to sleep in such a room nathans expression contorted in a casual manner perhaps but i am more than a king i am a prophet her smile faded as her mood turned earnest yes you really are more than a king nathan went around the room blowing out most of the dozen lamps he left the one beside the bed and the one on the dressing stand he halfturned and gestured to the other room ill sleep on a couch in there you may have the bed ill take the couch i wouldnt be comfortable in such a bed im a simple woman not accustomed to such grand things you are you should have the bed nathan cupped her cheek get used to them take the bed it would be uncomfortable for me knowing such a lovely lady was sleeping on a couch im a man of the world and such things dont faze me he bowed grandly from the doorway sleep well my dear he paused with the door half closed clarissa i apologize for the looks you had to endure and for what people might have thought of you because of my story he truly was a gentleman no apology is necessary it was rather fun pretending as if i were in a play on a stage he laughed with that sparkle in his blue eyes as he flung his cape around himself it was fun wasnt it having those people think we were other than we were thank you for everything nathan you made me feel pretty today you are pretty she smiled that was just the clothes beauty comes from within he winked sleep well clarissa ive left a protective shield on the door so no one can enter be at ease here you will be safe he closed the door gently feeling a warm glow from the wine clarissa ambled about the room inspecting all the fine things she ran her fingers over the inlaid silver on the small tables beside the bed she touched the cut glass on the lamps she ran her hand over the finely woven bed covers when she turned them down standing in front of the dressing table she looked at herself in the mirror as she unlaced the bodice of her dress she almost hated to take off the dress and be just herself again although she wouldnt be unhappy about being free of the bone stays that confined her with the laces loose she was at last able to take a full breath she slipped the top of the dress off her shoulders the things still pressing from underneath held the dress up over her bosom she sat on the edge of the bed as she tried to reach the buttons up the back some of them were too high sagging in frustration she settled on removing her new shoes made of supple napped leather she rolled off her stockings and wiggled her toes glad to have them free clarissa thought about home she remembered her cozy bed little as it was she missed home not because she was so happy there but simply because it was home and all she knew as fancy as this place was it felt cold to her cold and frightening she was someplace she didnt know and she could never go home again suddenly clarissa was very lonely with nathan she felt the comfort of his confidence he always knew where he was going what to do and what to say he never seemed to have any doubts clarissa was full of them now that she was alone in the bedroom it was odd but she missed nathan more than home and he was right in the next room nathan was almost her home now the carpet felt good under her bare feet as she went to the door gently she rapped against the white panel in the center of the gold molding she waited a moment and then knocked again nathan she called softly she knocked and called his name once more when still no answer came she cracked the door open and peeked in only a single candle cut the still gloom nathan was in one of his trances again he was sitting in a chair staring blankly at nothing clarissa stood at the door for a time watching his steady breathing she had been frightened the first time she found him stiff and unblinking but he had assured her that it was something he had done nearly his whole life he hadnt gotten angry that first time when she shook him thinking there was something wrong nathan never got angry with her he always treated her with respect and kindnesstwo things she had always longed for but had never gotten from her own people and here was a stranger who gave them without effort clarissa called his name again nathan blinked and looked up at her is everything all right he asked yes i hope im not disturbing you in your reflection nathan waved away her concern no no well i was wondering could you help me undo my dress i cant reach the buttons in the back and i seem to be stuck in it i didnt want to lie down in it and ruin it nathan followed her back into the bedroom she had blown out the lamp on the dressing table so that she wouldnt be embarrassed only the one beside the bed allowed him to see what he was doing with both hands clarissa held her hair up out of the way as his strong fingers worked their way down the buttons it felt good to have him near nathan she whispered when he had reached the last of them at her waist he made a questioning sound in response she feared he would ask what the thumping sound was and she would have to tell him that it was her heart clarissa turned having to hold the dress over her breasts now that it was undone nathan she said as she gathered her courage and looked up into his beautiful eyes nathan im lonely his brow drew together as he gently laid one of his big hands on her bare shoulder no need my dear im right in the next room i know but i mean that im lonely in a bigger way than that i mean im lonely for the way you i dont know how to say it when im alone i start thinking about what i will have to do to help those people you talked about and all kinds of fearful things come into my head and before i know it im sweating in a terror its often more worrisome to ponder something than it is to actually do it just dont think about it try to enjoy the big bed and the fine room if you can who knows one day we may have to sleep in a ditch she nodded she had to look away from his eyes lest she lose her courage nathan i know im a plain woman but you make me feel special no man ever made me feel pretty feel desirable well as i said before she reached up and put her fingers to his lips to silence him nathan i really she looked up into his wonderful eyes she swallowed and changed what she was going to say nathan im afraid you are just too dashing a man for me to resist will you come spend the night in this big bed with me he smiled with one side of his mouth as she took her fingers away dashing she nodded very she could feel the curls springing he rested his arms around her waist it made her heart beat even faster clarissa you owe me nothing i saved you from what was happening in renwold but you in return have promised to help me you owe me nothing beyond that i know its not she wasnt making herself clear she knew she stretched up on her tiptoes her arms circling his neck and pressed her lips to his his arms drew her tight she abandoned herself in those arms and to those lips he pulled back clarissa im old youre a young woman you dont want someone whos as old as how long had she hurt because she thought she was too old to have someone how often had she felt forlorn because she was too old and now this man this wonderful vibrant handsome man was telling her she was too young nathan what i want is to be thrown on the bed to have this fancy expensive dress pulled off me and for you to have your way with me until i hear the spirits sing in the silence nathan stared at her at last he reached down put an arm behind her legs and swept her off her feet he carried her to the bed but instead of throwing her onto it as she had suggested he set her down gently his weight sank into the bed as he reclined beside her his fingers stroked her forehead they looked into each others eyes tenderly he kissed her since her dress was all untied and unbuttoned it easily slipped down to her waist she ran her fingers through his long silver hair as she watched him lovingly kiss her breasts his lips were warm against her for some reason she found that surprising and marvelous a soft moan escaped her throat at the feeling of her nipples being kissed in such a manly passionate fashion nathan may have lived longer than she but he was not an old man in her eyes he was dashing daring and thoughtful and he made her feel beautiful she found herself panting at the sight of him without his clothes no man had ever touched her with such tender purpose and the sureness of that touch further heated her passion his kisses trailed down the front of her each making her gasp to catch her breath in sweet startled desire when he at last took his place atop her she totally and unashamedly succumbed to her need she felt cradled not only in the canopy bed but in his ardent embrace at long last as her whole body stiffened with her cry of release she could hear the spirits sing chapter like a hawk in a dive kahlan silently shot ahead and at the same time like an eagle in an updraft she serenely hovered in place light and dark heat and cold time and distance had no meaning yet they meant everything it was a marvelous confusion of sensations heightened by the sweet presence of the sliph each time kahlan drew the living quicksilver into her lungs into her soul it was rapture with an abrupt explosion of perception it ended light erupted in kahlans vision sounds of birds breezes and bugs hurt her ears trees draped with streamers of moss rocks incrusted with lichen and snarled in roots and vines and patches of damp dark mist crowded in all around the overpowering presence of it all terrified her breathe the sliph told her the thought horrified her no the sliphs voice seemed to sear through kahlans mind breathe kahlan didnt want to be thrust from the serene womb of the sliph into this garish loud world she remembered richard and with richard the threat to him shota kahlan expelled the sliph from her lungs the liquid silver sloughed from her yet she was not wet she gasped a deep breath of the strange sharp air she covered her ears and shut her eyes as the sliph set her on the edge of the well we are where you wished to travel the sliph said kahlan reluctantly opened her eyes and lowered her hands the living world seemed to slow and settle into harmony with what she expected it to be the comforting hand of the sliph slipped from kahlans waist thank you sliph it was a pleasure the sliphs fluid face smiled i am pleased that you found it pleasurable i hope not to be long and then we must travel back i will be ready when you wish to travel again the sliph said her voice echoing out into the gloom i am always ready to travel if i am awake kahlan swung her legs down off the stone wall of the sliphs well parts of an ancient structure were visible but it seemed mostly to have crumbled into the damp tangled forest she could see a bit of a wall here half of a column there some paving stones on the ground all covered with vines and roots and leaves kahlan didnt know exactly where she was but she knew she was in the somber woods around the witch womans home kahlan remembered going through this dangerous mysterious forest when shota had captured her and taken her to agaden reach in order to draw richard there jagged peaks like a wreath of thorns sheltered the murky forest high up in the vast spine of the rangshada mountains the dark and dangerous woods in turn surrounded and protected shotas remote home these woods kept people away from agaden reach away from the witch woman whoops clicks and calls echoed through the stagnant stink kahlan rubbed her arms even though the air was damp and warm her chill came from within through small rare gaps in the forest canopy kahlan could detect the pink glow of the sky it must be just dawn she knew that the brightening day would bring no relief to the gloom of these woods on the sunniest day this morose place was never anything more than dismally dark kahlan stepped carefully watching the forest floor the hanging vines and the drifting fog that seemed to conceal creatures issuing strings of hissing clicks and hooting calls in the expanses of stagnant water lurking under the thick vegetation she could see eyes just breaking the surface kahlan took another careful step and then paused she realized that in the directionless forest she didnt know where she was going there was no telling north from south east from west this wood looked the same in all directions she realized too that she didnt even know if shota was home the last time richard and kahlan had seen shota was at the mud peoples village shota had been driven from her home by a wizard aligned with the keeper shota might not be here no nadine had visited her shota was here kahlan took another step something snatched her ankle and yanked her feet from under her she landed on her back with a hard thud a heavy dark shape sprang onto her chest driving the wind from her lungs a hiss carried on fetid breath came from between sharp teeth packed with gray spongy filth pretty lady kahlan gasped to catch her breath samuel get off me powerful fingers squeezed her left breast bloodless lips drew back with a wicked grin maybe samuel eat pretty lady kahlan pressed the point of the bone knife up into the folds of skin at samuels neck she seized one of his long fingers and bent it back until he squealed and released her breast she jabbed the knife against his throat maybe ill feed you to the things in the water over there what do you think shall i slit your throat or do you want to get off me the hairless splotchy gray head drew back yellow eyes like twin lanterns in the dim light glared hatefully down at her he carefully rolled to the side to let her up kahlan kept the bone knife trained on him dead leaves and forest debris stuck to his waxy skin a long arm lifted to point off into the dark mist mistress wants you how does she know im here the grotesque face split with a hissing grin mistress knows everything follow samuel he skittered a few steps and then stopped to look back over his shoulder when mistress is finished with you samuel will eat you i may just have something for shota she isnt expecting shes made a mistake this time when im finished with her you may not have a mistress the squat figure stared appraising her his bloodless lips pulled back and he hissed your mistress is waiting get going the stocky hairless longarmed figure finally moved on through the undergrowth he skirted dangers kahlan didnt see and grudgingly pointed at things for her to avoid vines he circumvented reached for her as she passed but she was too far away for them to catch her roots samuel bypassed snarled up trying to snare her the short figure dressed only in pants held up with straps glanced over his shoulder occasionally to make sure she followed a couple of times he gurgled his odd laugh as he bounded along after a time they picked up a trail of sorts and not long after that the light coming through the tangled mass of branches overhead became brighter as kahlan followed the repulsive little creature they came at last to the edge of the dark wood and the edge of a cliff far below lay the verdant valley where lived the witch woman that it was as beautiful a place as any in the midlands didnt ease the anxious knot in kahlans stomach all around the valley the massive rocky peaks of the surrounding mountains soared nearly straight up the budding trees in the placid valley below swayed gently in the early morning breeze descending the sheer walls of rock looked to be impossible but kahlan knew from being here before that there were steps carved in the rock samuel led her through a morass of brush tight trees and ferncovered boulders to a place that would be nearly impossible to find without him to guide her a trail hidden behind rocks trees ferns and vines ran to the edge of the precipice and the steps leading down the cliff walls samuel pointed off down into the valley mistress i know get moving kahlan followed samuel down the cliffs edge part of it was a narrow trail but most of the way down was comprised of thousands of steps cut into the rugged rock wall they twisted and turned downward sometimes spiraling back under ones above below far off in the center of the valley among the streams grand trees and rolling fields sat shotas graceful palace colorful flags flew atop towers and turrets as if to announce a festival kahlan could hear the distant flags snapping in the wind she had trouble seeing it for the splendid place it was she saw it as the center of the spiderweb a place where threat lurked threat for richard samuel sprang down the steps ahead happy to be going back to the protection of his mistress no doubt thinking about cooking kahlan in a stew when his mistress was finished with her kahlan hardly noticed the hateful glances from the big yellow eyes she too was lost in a world of loathing shota wanted to harm richard kahlan kept that thought foremost in her mind it was key shota wanted to deny richard happiness shota wanted richard to suffer kahlan could feel angry power welling up inside her ready to do her bidding and eliminate the threat against richard kahlan had at last found the way to defeat shota shota had no shield against subtractive power it would slice through any magic she threw out kahlan had found the path the gateway through the labyrinth of protection layered over her magic to the core of its power this side of her magic was protected by precepts that governed its use like the wizards keep protected by shields of all kinds there was a way to get through she had found a way to get through the keep and she had used her reason to find the justification that traced its way through the maze of rationale forbidding this magics use she had tapped its ancient strength its destructive power kahlan felt the power coursing up through her and down her arms blue light snarled and snapped around her fists she was nearly lost in a trance of purpose for the first time kahlan wasnt afraid of the witch woman if shota didnt swear to leave richard alone to let him have his own life shota was going to be dust before this day was out at the bottom of the cliff kahlan followed behind samuel as he bounded along the road among treedotted hills and green fields snowcapped peaks all around soared up past a scattering of clouds blue deepened in the sky as the sun rose over those peaks kahlan felt as if she had enough power blazing within her to level those peaks shota had only to say or do the wrong thingto prove herself a threat to richard and she would be no more the road led up a gentle rise from which kahlan could see the spires of the palace through the trees ahead samuel glanced back to make sure she was still following but kahlan didnt need his direction she knew that shota waited in the grove of trees below the witch woman was the last person kahlan ever wanted to see again but if it was to be then this time she intended it to be on her terms samuel halted and pointed with a long finger mistress yellow eyes glowered back at kahlan mistress wants you kahlan lifted a warning finger to his face threads of blue light crackled around the finger if you get in my way or interfere you will die he glanced from her finger back into her eyes his bloodless lips drew back as he hissed and then he skittered off into the trees in a cocoon of seething magic kahlan advanced down the slope toward the waiting witch woman the breeze was springwarm the day bright and cheerful kahlan felt no cheer sheltered among the towering maples ash and oak sat a table covered with a white cloth and set with food and drink beyond the table atop three square white marble platforms stood a massive throne carved with goldleaf vines snakes and other beasts shota sat regally one leg crossed casually over the other her ageless almond eyes watching kahlans approach shotas arms rested on the chairs high widely spaced arms with her hands draped arrogantly over gold gargoyles the gargoyles nuzzled her hands as if hoping to be stroked a rich canopy draped with heavy red brocade and trimmed with gold tassels shaded the thrones occupant from the morning sun yet her luxuriant auburn hair shimmered as if touched by streamers of sunlight kahlan halted not far away under the witch womans rockhard penetrating gaze the blue lightning screamed for release shota clicked her lacquered fingernails together a selfsatisfied smile spread across her full red lips well well well shota said in her velvety voice the child assassin arrives at last i am not an assassin kahlan said nor am i a child but i have had enough of your games shotas smile slipped away she put her hands to the chairs arms and stood points of her wispy lowcut variegated gray dress lifted in the gentle breeze her gaze never left kahlan as she gracefully descended the three white marble platforms youre late shota held a hand out to the table the tea is getting cold kahlan flinched when a bolt of lightning struck from the blue sky hitting the teapot amazingly it didnt shatter shota glanced down at kahlans hands and then back to her eyes there i believe its hot now please wont you have a seat we will have tea and conversation knowing shota had seen the ominous blue light kahlan returned the selfassured smile in kind shota drew out a chair and sat she again held out a hand in invitation please have a seat i imagine you have things you wish to discuss kahlan slid into a chair as shota poured tea holding on the white top with her other hand as she did so steam rose from the cups the tea was indeed hot shota lifted a goldtrimmed platter offering kahlan toast kahlan warily pulled a goldencrisp slab from the platter shota slid a bowl of honeyed butter across the table well shota said isnt this unpleasant against her will kahlan smiled very shota picked up her silver knife and spread honeyed butter across her slice of toast she took a sip of tea eat child murder is always best accomplished on a full stomach i have not come to murder you shotas sly smile returned no i suppose you have managed to justify it to yourself retribution is it or perhaps selfdefense punishment recompense justice the smooth smile widened an eyebrow arched bad manners you sent nadine to marry richard ahh jealousy then shota leaned back as she sipped her tea a noble motive were it justified i hope you realize that jealousy can be a cruel taskmaster kahlan nibbled her crunchy toast richard loves me and i love him were engaged to be married yes i know for one who professes to love him i would think you would be more understanding understanding of course if you love someone you want them to be happy you want whats best for them i make richard happy he wants me im best for him yes well we cant always have what we want now can we kahlan sucked honeyed butter from her finger just tell me why you wish to hurt us shota looked genuinely surprised hurt you is that what you think you think i am being spiteful why else would you always try to keep us apart to hurt us shota took a dainty bite of toast she chewed for a moment has the plague come yet the cup paused partway to kahlans lips how do you know about that im a witch woman i see the current of events let me ask you a question if you visited a young child sick with the plague and the childs mother asked you if her child was going to recover and you told her the truth would you be guilty of causing the childs death because you foretold it of course not ah it is only i then who am to be judged by different standards im not judging you i simply want you to stop interfering with richards and my life together a messenger is often blamed for the message shota the last time we saw you you said that if we stopped the keeper you would owe us a debt you asked me to help richard we stopped the keeper it cost us dearly but we did it you owe us yes i know shota whispered that is why i sent nadine kahlan could feel the rage of power surge within her seems a strange way to show your appreciationsending someone to try to ruin our lives no child shota said gently you see things through blind eyes kahlan had to help richard by finding out all she could but she would defend herself and richard if she had to until that became necessary she could endure this wandering conversation if it would help get the answers they needed and they did need answers what do you mean shota sipped her tea have you lain with richard kahlan was taken off guard by the question but she recovered quickly she shrugged one shoulder in an offhanded manner yes as a matter of fact i have shotas gaze rose from her tea youre lying pleased by the smoldering tone in shotas voice kahlan lifted an eyebrow its the truth you dont like the message and so now you hold malice toward the messenger shotas eyes narrowed her gaze locked on kahlan as if drawing a bow and aiming an arrow where mother confessor where did you lie with him kahlan felt triumphant at shotas obvious displeasure where what difference does that make have you turned from witch woman to gossip now i was with him in that way and thats the truth whether you like it or not im no longer a virgin i was with richard thats all that matters shotas gaze turned dangerous where she repeated shotas tone was so threatening that kahlan forgot she neednt be afraid of the witch woman in a place between worlds kahlan said suddenly embarrassed to reveal the details the good spirits took us there she stammered the good spirits they wanted us to be together i see shotas gaze cooled her small smile returned im afraid that doesnt count doesnt count what in the name of all thats good does that mean i was with him thats all that matters youre just vexed because its true true you were not with him in this world child this is the world we live in you were not with him here where it counts in this world you are still a virgin thats absurd shota shrugged think what you will i am satisfied that you have not been with him kahlan folded her arms this world or another it doesnt matter i was with him shotas smooth brow puckered with mirth restrained and if you have been with him in the place between worlds where the good spirits took you then why have you not been with him in this world since you are no longer a virgin here as you say kahlan blinked well i we thought it best to wait until we were wedded thats all shotas soft exultant laugh drifted out through the morning air you see you know the truth of what i say she held the teacup between the tips of the fingers of both hands as she sipped more balmy laughter escaping between each sip kahlan fumed somehow feeling she had lost the argument she tried to look confident as she leaned back and took a drink of her own tea if it pleases you to delude yourself with punctilios then be my guest i know what we did kahlan said i dont know why its any concern of yours anyway shota looked up you know why its my concern mother confessor every confessor bears a confessor if you have his child it will be a boy i told you both to remember that before you lay together lust dims thoughts of the consequences from you the boy would be a confessor from richard he would have the gift such a dangerous melding has never taken place before with a patient reasoned tone meant almost as much for herself as for the witch woman kahlan hid her inner terror at shotas prediction shota you are a witch woman of great talent and you may know it would be a boy i grant you that but you could not know he would be like most of the male confessors born in the past not all were like that you have as much as admitted that you dont know if it would be so you are not the creator you cant know what he will choose to doif he even chooses to give us a child i dont need to see the future in this almost every male confessor was like that they were beasts without conscience my mother lived in the dark times caused by a male confessor you would visit upon the world not only a male confessor but one with the gift you cannot even envision such a cataclysm it is for this very reason that confessors are not supposed to love their mates if she bears a male child she must ask the husband to kill the baby you love richard you would not ask that of him i have warned you that i have the strength to do what you will not i also told you that it will not be personal you talk about the distant future as if it has come to pass it has not kahlan said events do not always unfold as you say yet other things have already come to pass because of richard you still live you told us that if richard and i were able to close the veil saving you and everyone else from the keeper you would be forever grateful to us both and so i am kahlan leaned forward you show your gratitude not only by threatening to murder my child should i have one but also by trying to kill me when i come to ask your help shotas brow twitched i have made no attempt on your life you sent samuel up there to attack me and then you have the effrontery to rebuke me for coming prepared to defend myself the little monster threw me on the ground and attacked me if i hadnt had a weapon who knows what he would have done this is your gratitude he said that when you were through with me you would let him eat me and then you expect me to believe in your benevolence you dare to profess gratitude shotas gaze shifted toward the trees samuel she set down her teacup samuel come here at once the squat figure loped out of the trees using his knuckles to help himself bound across the grass he ran to shota and nuzzled against her legs mistress he purred samuel what did i tell you about the mother confessor mistress told samuel to go get her shota looked into kahlans eyes what else did i tell you to bring her to you samuel she said with rising inflection mistress said not to harm her you attacked me kahlan put in you threw me on the ground and jumped on me you said you were going to eat me when your mistress was through with me is that true samuel samuel not hurt pretty lady samuel grumbled is what she says true did you attack her samuel hissed at kahlan shota thunked him on the head with a finger he shrank back against her leg samuel what did i tell you what were my instructions samuel must guide mother confessor back samuel must not touch mother confessor samuel must not hurt mother confessor samuel must not threaten mother confessor shota drummed her fingers on the table and did you disobey me samuel samuel hid his head under the hem of her dress samuel answer my question at once is what the mother confessor says true yes mistress samuel whined im very disappointed in you samuel samuel sorry we will discuss this later leave us the witch womans servant skittered away into the trees shota turned back to face kahlans eyes i told him not to harm or threaten you i can understand why you would be upset and think i meant you harm please accept my apology she poured kahlan more tea you see i have no intention of hurting you kahlan took a sip from her full cup samuel is the least of it i know you want to hurt me and richard but im not afraid of you anymore you can no longer harm me shotas smug smile returned really id suggest you not try to use your power against me my power all things i do all things everyone does is using their power to breathe is to use my power im talking about hurting me if you dare try it youll not survive the attempt child i have no wish to harm you despite what you think a brave thing to say now that you know you cant really did you ever think that the tea might be poisoned her smile widened when kahlan stiffened you of course not i told you i have no wish to harm you if i wished to harm you i could do any number of things i could have simply put a viper behind your heels vipers dislike sudden movement if there was one thing kahlan hated it was snakes and shota knew it relax child there is no viper under your chair shota took a bite of her toast kahlan eased her breath out but you wished to make me think there might be what i wished is for you to realize that confidence can be overrated if it will please you i will tell you that i have always regarded you as singularly dangerous for any number of reasons that you have found a way to tap the other side of your magic means little to me it is the other things you do that frighten me your womb frightens me your arrogant certitude frightens me kahlan nearly leaped to her feet in anger but then she suddenly thought of the children dying back in aydindril how many of them hung near death shivering in fear for their lives while kahlan stubbornly debated fault and imputation with shota shota knew something about the plague and about the winds hunting richard what significance was kahlans pride in the face of that she remembered too part of the prophecy no blade forged of steel or conjured of sorcery can touch this foe in much the same way crossing swords with shota wasnt going to work this was serving no purpose and worse solving nothing kahlan admitted to herself that she had come for vengeance her true duty should be to help people who were suffering and dying how would anything but pride be satisfied by striking out at shota she was stubbornly putting herself and her insecurity above innocent lives she was being selfish shota i came with hurt in my heart because of nadine i wanted you to leave richard and me be you say you have no wish to harm us and that your intent is to help i also wish to help people who are desperate and dying why dont we for the moment at least agree to take each others word as true shota watched over her teacup what an outrageous concept kahlan reasoned with her inner fear her inner rage her anguish at the things nadine did made kahlan want to strike out at shota what if it wasnt shotas fault what if nadine was acting on her own much the same way as samuel had what if shota was telling the truth if she had not meant to cause harm if that were true then kahlan was guilty of a grievous wrong in wanting to strike out at shota kahlan admitted to herself that shota had been right that she had been justifying vengeance simply to be able to tap her deadly power she hadnt been willing to listen kahlan placed her hands on the table shota sipped her tea as she watched the blue glow around kahlans hands fade and finally extinguish kahlan didnt know if she would be able to call it forth should shota strike but she realized it didnt matter failure in her true task was too great a price to pay for pride kahlan felt that this was the only thing that could truly have a chance of saving her future of saving richard and of saving those innocent people back in aydindril richard always said to think of the solution not the problem she would trust in shotas word shota kahlan whispered i always thought the worst of you fear has been only part of it as you warned jealousy has been my taskmaster i beg you forgive my obstinacy and insolence i know that you have tried to help people before please help me now i need answers lives depend on this please talk with me ill try to hear with an open mind the things you say knowing that you are the messenger and not the cause shota set down her teacup congratulations mother confessor you have earned the right to ask me questions have the courage to hear the answers and they will be of aid to you i swear to do my best kahlan said chapter shota poured them more tea what do you wish to know kahlan reached for her cup do you know anything about the temple of the winds no kahlan paused cup in hand well you told nadine that the winds hunt richard i did could you explain that what you meant shota lifted a hand in a vague gesture i dont know how to explain to a woman who is not a witch how i see the flow of time the passing of future events i guess you could say that its something like memories when you think about a past event or a person say the memory comes to you sometimes you more vividly remember past events some things you cant recall my talent is like that except i am also able to do the same with the future to me there is little difference between past present and future i ride a current of time seeing both upstream and down to me seeing the future is as simple as it is for you to remember the flow of past events but sometimes i cant remember things kahlan said it is the same with me i cant recall whatever happened to a bird my mother would call when i was very young i remember it sitting on her finger as she spoke soft tender words to it i dont remember if it died or if it flew away other events such as the death of a loved one i remember vividly i remember the texture of the dress my mother wore on the day she died even today i could measure out for you the length of the loose thread on the sleeve i understand kahlan stared down into her tea i too remember well the day my mother died i remember every horrid detail even though i wish i could forget shota placed her elbows on the table and twined her fingers together the future is that way with me i cant always see pleasant future events that i wish to see and i sometimes cant avoid seeing those things i abhor some events i can see with clarity and others despite how much i wish to see them are only shadows in the fog what about the winds hunting richard with a distant look shota shook her head that was disturbing it was as if someone elses memory was being forced on me as if someone else was using me to pass on a message do you think it was a message or a warning a thoughtful frown creased shotas brow i wondered that myself i dont know the answer i passed it on through nadine because i thought richard should know in either case kahlan rubbed her forehead shota when the plague started it started among children who had been playing or watching a game jala yes thats right emperor jagang the dream walker kahlan looked up you know of him he visits my future memories occasionally he plays tricks trying to get into my dreams i wont allow it do you think it possible that it was the dream walker who gave you this message about the winds hunting richard no i know his tricks take my word it was not a message from jagang what of the plague and the jala game well jagang used his ability as a dream walker to slip into the mind of a wizard he sent to assassinate richard he was at the jala game the wizard i mean jagang saw the game through this wizards eyes jagang was incensed that richard had changed the rules so that all the children could play the plague started among those children thats one reason we think jagang was responsible the first child we went to see was near death kahlan closed her eyes and covered them with her fingertips at the memory she took a settling breath while richard and i knelt at his side he died he was just a boy an innocent boy his whole body was rotting from the plague i cant imagine the suffering he endured he died before our eyes im sorry shota whispered kahlan composed herself before looking up after he had died his hand reached up and grabbed a hold of richards shirt his lungs filled with air he pulled richard close and he said the winds hunt you a troubled sigh came from across the table then i was right it was not something i saw but a message sent through me shota richard thinks it means that the temple of the winds is hunting him he has a journal from a man who lived during the great war of three thousand years ago the journal tells of how the wizards of that time placed things of great value and great danger in the temple and then they sent the temple away frowning shota leaned forward away away where we dont know the temple of the winds was atop mount kymermosst i know the place there is no temple there only a few bits of old ruins kahlan nodded its possible the wizards used their power to blast the side of the mountain away and bury the temple in a rockslide whatever they did its gone from information in the journal richard believes that the red moons were a warning from the temple he further believes that the temple of the winds is also known more simply as the winds shota tapped a finger against the side of her teacup so the message could have come directly from the temple of the winds do you think that possible how could a place send a message the wizards of that time could do things with magic we can only wonder at the sliph for example from what i know and what you have told me my best guess would be that jagang has somehow stolen something deadly from the temple of the winds and used it to start the plague kahlan felt a cold wave of fright flood through her how could he do such a thing he is a dream walker he has access to untold knowledge despite his crude objectives he is anything but stupid i have been touched by his mind in my sleep when he hunts in the night he is not to be underestimated shota he wishes to extinguish all magic shota lifted an eyebrow i have already told you i will answer your questions there is no need to convince me of my own interest in this matter just as the danger from the keeper jagang is no less a threat to me he promises to eliminate magic but to accomplish those ends he uses magic but how could he have stolen this plague from the temple of the winds do you think it even possible really i can tell you that the plague did not start of its own account your guess is correct it was ignited through magic how can we stop it i know of no cure for plague shota took a sip of her tea she glanced up at kahlan on the other hand how could a plague be started magic kahlan frowned you mean you mean that if magic could start it even though we dont know how to cure the plague magic may be able to stop it is that what youre suggesting shota shrugged i know no more how to start a plague than to cure it i know magic started this one if magic started it then it would stand to reason that magic could halt it kahlan straightened then there is hope we can stop it and save all those people from dying possibly if we were to put the pieces together it would at least suggest that jagang stole from the temple of the winds magic to start the plague and that the temple is trying to warn richard of the violation why richard why do you think what makes richard different from anyone else kahlan felt transfixed by shotas small sly smile hes a war wizard he has subtractive magic its how he defeated the spirit of darken rahl and stopped the keeper richard is the only one with the power to do whatever it is that can help keep that in mind shota whispered into her teacup kahlan was suddenly getting the feeling that she was being led down a path she dismissed the feeling shota was trying to help kahlan gathered her courage shota why did you send nadine to marry richard why nadine shotas lips spread in a sad smile it was the question for which she had been waiting because i care about him i wanted it to be someone in whom he could find at least some small comfort kahlan swallowed but he finds comfort in me i know but he is to marry another the flow of the future tells you this your future memory shota gave her a single nod it wasnt your idea you didnt simply want to send someone to marry him so i wouldnt no shota leaned back in her chair and stared off into the trees i saw that he will marry another i see great pain for him in this i exerted all my influence so that it would be someone he knew someone in whom he would find at least some solace i wanted to spare him as much pain in it as i could kahlan didnt know what to say she felt as she had when she was struggling against the flow of water down in the drainage tunnel when she was fighting marlin she remembered the weight of the water the way it pinned her in place but i love him was all she could think to say i know shota whispered back it was not my choice to have him marry another i was only able to influence who it would be kahlan struggled to pull a shaky breath as she looked away from the witch womans ageless eyes i had no say shota added in who would be your husband kahlans gaze returned to shota what what do you mean you are to be wedded it is not richard i could not influence that part of it that is not a good sign kahlan felt stunned what do you mean the spirits are somehow involved in this they would only accept limited influence they have their reasons for the rest of it those reasons are veiled from me kahlan felt a tear run down her check shota what am i to do ill lose my only love i could never love anyone but richard even if i wished it im a confessor shota sat still as stone as she watched kahlan the good spirits have granted us all they could in allowing me to have a say in who will be richards bride i searched and could find no other woman for whom he feels even this limited empathy she was the best i could do if you truly love richard then you should try to find comfort in the fact that he will have nadine a woman he knows and for whom he at least has some feeling however small perhaps with a woman such as this he will someday find happiness and come to love her kahlan put her trembling hands in her lap she felt sick to her stomach it would do no good to argue with shota this wasnt her doing the spirits were involved to what purpose what good will it do for him to marry nadine for me to be mated to one i dont love shotas voice came soft and compassionate i dont know child just as some parents for a variety of reasons choose their childrens spouses so have the spirits chosen for you and richard if the spirits were involved why would they desire our misery they took us to that place so we could be together kahlan struggled against the weight of the floodwaters why would they want to do this to us perhaps shota whispered as she watched kahlan it is because you will betray him kahlans throat clenched shut locking her breath in her lungs the prophecy screamed through her head for the one in white his true beloved will betray him in her blood kahlan shot to her feet no her hands balled into fists i would never hurt him i would never betray him shota calmly sipped her tea sit down mother confessor kahlan fought to keep the tears back as she sank into her chair i dont control the future memories any more than i control the past i told you you must have the courage to hear the answers she tapped a finger to her temple not only hereshe tapped the finger over her heartbut here too kahlan made herself take a deep breath forgive me its not your fault i know that shota lifted an eyebrow very good mother confessor learning to accept the truth is the first step to gaining control of your destiny shota i dont mean this to sound disrespectful but seeing the future does not provide all the answers before you told me that i would touch richard with my power i thought that would destroy him i tried to kill myself to prevent your words from coming to pass to prevent myself from hurting him richard wouldnt allow me the chance at suicide as it turned out your seeing of the future was true but there was more to it and it turned out differently than we thought i touched richard but his magic protected him and my touch didnt harm him i didnt see the result of the touch only that you would touch him this is different i see you both being wedded kahlan felt numb who is it to be that i will marry i see only a misty form i cannot see the person i do not know his identity shota i was told that a witch womans seeing of future events is a form of prophecy who told you this a wizard zedd wizards shota muttered they dont know what is in a witch womans mind they think they know everything kahlan pushed her long hair back over her shoulder shota we were going to be honest with each other remember shota let out a dainty grumble well i guess that in this case they may be mostly right prophecy does not always turn out how it seems the dire dangers can be avoided or changed do you think there is any way i can change the prophecy shota frowned the prophecy the one you mentioned betraying richard shotas frowned deepened into suspicion are you saying that this was also foretold in a prophecy kahlans eyes turned away from the witch womans intense gaze when the wizard came with jagang possessing his mind jagang said that he had invoked a prophecy to trap richard it too says i will betray him do you remember this prophecy kahlan rubbed her finger around the rim of her teacup its one of those memories that we spoke of the memories we wish we could forget but we cant on the red moon will come the firestorm the one bonded to the blade will watch as his people die if he does nothing then he and all those he loves will die in its heat for no blade forged of steel or conjured of sorcery can touch this foe to quench the inferno he must seek the remedy in the wind lightning will find him on that path for the one in white his true beloved will betray him in her blood shota leaned back taking her teacup with her it is true as you say that the events in prophecy can be altered or avoided but not in a double bind prophecy this one is such a prophecy a trap that ensnares its victim the red moon proves that the trap has sprung but there must be a way kahlan pushed her hands back into her hair shota what am i to do you are to be wedded to another she whispered as is richard what is beyond i dont see but this much of it is the future shota i know youre speaking the truth but how can it be that i would betray richard im telling you the truth i would die before i would betray him my heart wont allow me to betray him i couldnt shota smoothed a loose wisp of her dress think mother confessor and you will see that you are wrong just as i showed you that you were wrong that i could no longer harm you how how could i do such a thing when i know it isnt in mefor any reasonto betray him shota took a patient breath it is not nearly so difficult as you wish to think what if you knew for example that you had only one way to save his life and that way was to betray him but in so doing you would lose his love would you make the sacrifice of his love to preserve his life the truth now kahlan swallowed past the lump in her throat yes i would betray him if it was to save his life so you see it is not as impossible an event as you imagined i guess not kahlan said in a small voice she pushed at a few crumbs on the table shota what is the purpose of all this why would the future hold that richard will marry nadine and that i will marry another man there must be a reason it goes against everything we both want so there must be some force pushing events down that path shota said after a moments deliberation the temple of the winds hunts richard the spirits have a hand in this kahlans face sank wearily into her hands you said to nadine may the spirits have mercy on him what did you mean by that the underworld contains more than just the good spirits the spiritsgood and the evilare all involved in this kahlan didnt want to talk anymore it was too painful talking about the ruination of her dreams and hopes as if they were pieces on a game board to what purpose she mumbled the plague kahlan looked up what it has something to do with the plague and the thing of magic the dream walker stole from the temple of the winds you mean that it could be that this could somehow be part of our attempt to find the magic to stop the plague i believe it is so the witch woman said at last you and richard are desperately seeking a way to stop the plague and save the lives of countless people i see in the future that you each wed other people for what other reason would both of you make such a sacrifice but why would it be necessary you seek something i cannot answer i cannot alter what will be nor do i know the reason for it we are forced to consider the possibilities think if the only way to save all those people from dying in a firestorm of plague were for richard and you to sacrifice your life together perhaps say to prove your true devotion to protecting innocent lives would you both do such a thing kahlan put her trembling hands in her lap under the table she had seen the pain in richards eyes when he had watched that boy die she knew her own pain they had both seen innocent sick children who were going to die how many more would die she would never be able to live with herself if the only way to save those children was to sacrifice her love and she refused how could we not even if it would kill us how could we not but how could the good spirits demand such a price kahlan suddenly remembered dennas spirit taking the keepers mark from richard and freely choosing to go in richards place to eternal torment at the keepers hands that it turned out that denna didnt have to face that fate didnt matter she thought that she would and had sacrificed her soul in the place of one she loved the branches of a nearby maple tree clacked together in the gentle breeze kahlan could hear the flags atop shotas palace snapping in the wind the air tasted of spring the grasses were a bright new green life was beginning to bud all around kahlans heart felt like dead ashes then i will tell you one other thing shota said as if from a great distance kahlan listened from the bottom of a well of despair you have not heard the last message from the winds you will receive one more involving the moon this will be the consequential communion do not ignore it nor dismiss it your future richards future and the future of all those innocent people will hinge on this event both of you must use all you have learned in order to comprehend the chance you will be offered chance chance for what shotas gaze riveted kahlan the chance to carry out your most solemn duty the chance to save all the innocent lives of those who depend upon you to do what they cannot how soon i only know it will not be long kahlan nodded she wondered why she wasnt crying it seemed as if this was the most devastating personal tragedy she could imaginelosing richardand yet she wasnt crying she guessed she would but not now not here kahlan stared at the table shota you would try to stop us from having a child wouldnt you a boy child yes you would try to kill our son if we had one wouldnt you yes then how do i know that this isnt just some plot on your part to prevent us from having a child you will have to judge the truth of my words with your own mind and heart kahlan remembered the dying boys words and the prophecy somehow she had known all along that she would never marry richard it was all just an impossible dream when she was young kahlan had asked her mother about growing up and having a love a husband a home her mother had stood before her beautiful radiant statuesque but wearing her confessors face confessors dont have love kahlan they have duty richard was born a war wizard he had been born for a purpose duty she watched the breeze roll a few of the crumbs from the table i believe you kahlan whispered i wish i didnt but i do youre telling me the truth there was nothing else to say kahlan stood she had to lock her knees to stay upright on her trembling legs she tried to remember where the sliphs well was but she couldnt seem to make her mind work thank you for the tea she heard herself say it was lovely if shota answered kahlan didnt hear it shota kahlan grasped the back of the chair to steady herself could you point me in the right direction i cant seem to remember shota was there taking her arm i will walk partway with you child shota said in a soft compassionate voice so you may find your way they walked the road in silence kahlan tried to find cheer in the warm spring morning it was still so cold in aydindril it had been snowing when she left still she couldnt find any cheer in the fine day as they climbed the stone steps cut into the cliff kahlan fought to regain a sense of purpose if she and richard could somehow save all those people from the plague it would be a wonderful thing most wouldnt care about the sacrifice they made but that wouldnt lessen the relief she would feel in the sound of a childs laughter or the sight of a mothers joy in her childs safety there would still be things to live for she could fill the void with the happiness to be seen in the eyes of her people she would have done something no other could do she and richard would have stopped jagang from harming all those people near the top of the cliff kahlan paused at a turn in the steps and looked out at agaden reach it truly was a beautiful place this valley nestled among the peaks of jagged mountains she remembered that the keeper had sent a wizard and a screeling to kill shota shota had barely escaped with her life she had vowed to regain her home im glad you got your home back im glad for you shota i really am agaden reach belongs to you thank you mother confessor kahlan looked to the witch womans almond eyes what did you do to the wizard who chased you out what i said i would do i tied him up by his thumbs and i skinned him alive i sat back and watched as his magic bled from his skinless carcass she turned and gestured back down into the green valley i covered the seat of my throne with his hide kahlan remembered that that was precisely what shota had promised to do it was small wonder that even wizards rarely dared to enter agaden reach shota was more than a match for a wizard one wizard at least had learned that lesson too late i cant say i blame youthe keeper sending him to kill you and all if the keeper had gotten you well i know how much you feared that i owe you and richard a debt richard prevented the keeper from having us all im glad the wizard didnt send you to the keeper shota kahlan really meant it she still knew shota was dangerous but the witch woman seemed also to have a compassion that kahlan hadnt expected do you know what he said to me this wizard shota asked he said he forgave me can you believe it he granted me forgiveness and then he begged mine the wind carried some of kahlans hair across her face she pulled it back seems a strange thing for him to say considering the wizards fourth rule he called it he said that there was magic in forgiveness in the fourth rule magic to heal in forgiveness you grant and more so in the forgiveness you receive i guess the keepers minion would say anything to try to get away with what he had done and to get away from you i can understand you not being in the mood to forgive him light seemed to vanish into the ageless depths of shotas eyes he forgot to place the word sincere before forgiveness chapter kahlan watched the witch woman disappear back into the gloomy forest vines hanging down from craggy branches reached out to touch their mistress as she passed while tendrils and roots stretched up to brush her leg she vanished into a shroud of mist unseen creatures called in low whistles and clicks from the direction she had gone kahlan turned back to the mosscovered boulder shota had shown her and just beyond found the sliphs well the silver face of the sliph rose from beyond the round stone wall to watch as kahlan approached kahlan almost wished the sliph hadnt come as if somehow if kahlan couldnt get back none of the things she had learned would come to pass how was she going to look into richards eyes and not scream in anguish how was she ever going to be able to go on how would she find the will to live do you wish to travel the sliph asked no but i must the sliph frowned as if well puzzled if you wish to travel i will be ready kahlan sank to the ground put her back to the sliphs well and folded her legs under herself was she to give up this easily was she to submit meekly to the fates she didnt have a choice think of the solution not the problem somehow things didnt seem as desperate as they had back in the reach there had to be a way to solve this richard would not so easily give in he would fight for her she would fight for him they loved each other and that was more important than anything else kahlans mind felt as if it were in a fog she tried to focus with more resolve she couldnt just give up she had to face this with her old determination she knew that witch women bewitched people they didnt necessarily do it out of malice it was just the way they were it was like a person not being able to help the fact that they were tall or short or the color of their hair witch women bewitched people because that was the way their magic worked shota had bewitched richard to an extent only the magic of the sword of truth saved him the first time the sword of truth richard was the seeker this was the kind of thing a seeker did solved problems she was in love with the seeker he would not so easily give up kahlan plucked a leaf and tore little strips from it as she began to reconsider everything she had been told by shota how much of it dare she believe it was all beginning to seem like a dream from which she was just coming awake matters could not possibly be as desperate as she had thought her father had told her never to give up to fight with every breath with the last breath if need be nor would richard give in easily this wasnt ended yet the future was still the future and despite what shota said the matter was not yet decided something at her shoulder was bothering her as she thought she flicked her hand at it and then went back to tearing strips off the big leaf there had to be a way to solve this when she swatted at her shoulder again her fingers hit the bone knife it felt warm kahlan drew the knife and held it in her lap the knife was warm it seemed to pulse and vibrate it grew so hot that it became uncomfortable to hold kahlan watched wideeyed as the black feathers stood up they danced and waved and twisted in a breeze her hair hung limp the air was dead still there was no breeze kahlan shot to her feet sliph the sliphs silver face was right there close kahlan backed away a bit sliph i need to travel come we will travel where do you wish to go the mud people i need to go to the mud people the liquid features contorted in thought i do not know this place its not a place theyre people people kahlan tapped her chesttheyre people like me i know different peoples but not these mud people kahlan pushed back her hair trying to think they live in the wilds i know places in the wilds which one do you wish to travel to name it and we will travel you will be pleased well its a place thats flat its a grassland flat grassland no mountains like here kahlan gestured around but realized that the sliph could see only trees i know several places like that which places maybe ill recognize them i can travel to a place overlooking the callisidrin river to the west of the callisidrin the mud people are farther west i can travel to tondelen vale the harja rift kea plains sealan herkon split anderith pickton the jocopo treasure the what what was the last one she knew most of the rest of the places the sliph named but they werent close to the mud people the jocopo treasure do you wish to travel there kahlan held out the warm bone knifegrandfathers knife chandalen had told her how the jocopo had made war on the mud people and the ancestor spirits had guided chandalens grandfather in how to defend his people against the jocopo chandalen had said they used to trade with the jocopo before their war the jocopo had to be close to the mud people say the last place again kahlan said the jocopo treasure at the echoing words the black feathers danced and twisted kahlan shoved the bone knife back in the band around her upper arm she sprang up onto the stone wall thats where i wish to go the jocopo treasure i wish to travel to the jocopo treasure can you take me there sliph a silver arm swept her off the stone wall come we will travel to the jocopo treasure you will be pleased kahlan gasped one quick breath before she was plunged into the quicksilver froth she let the breath go and inhaled the sliph but this time numbed by troubling thoughts of losing richard of his marrying nadine she felt no rapture zedd cackled like a madman ann was upside down in his vision he stuck out his tongue at her and blew making a long crude sound you neednt attempt to pretend she growled it seems to be your natural state zedd moved his legs as if trying to walk upside down through the air the blood was rushing to his head do you wish to die with your dignity he asked her or would you rather live ill not play a fool thats the wordplay dont just sit there in the mud play in it she leaned over putting her head close to his he was standing on it in the mud zedd you cant possibly think such a thing would work you said it yourself you are mucking about with a crazy man it was your suggestion i suggested no such thing perhaps you didnt suggest it but you were the one who gave me the inspiration ill be happy to give you full credit when we tell people the story tell people in the first place it wont work in the second place i realize full well that you would be only too delighted to tell people thats just one more reason why i wont do it zedd howled like a coyote he stiffened his legs and his spine letting himself topple like a felled tree mud splashed on ann fuming she wiped a small splat from her nose at the tall stick fence grimfaced nangtong guards watched the two prisoners the two sacrifices zedd and ann had sat in the mud with their backs to one another and untied the ropes binding their wrists the guards armed with spears and bows didnt seem to care the prisoners couldnt get away zedd knew they were right happy people had begun to stop by the pigpen at dawn as the morning wore on the crowd grew as more people stopped by to chatter with the guards and take a look at the fine offerings apparently everyone was in a good mood because they now had a sacrifice for the spirits their lives would be safe after the unhappy spirits were appeased the guards and the people of the nangtong village watching from the other side of the fence were now looking less pleased they fidgeted with the cloth covering their faces making sure it hid enough and that it was secure the guards began wiping more ash on their faces and bodies apparently one couldnt be too careful lest the spirits recognize them zedd tucked his head down between his knees and rolled himself through the wet sticky slop he laughed maniacally as he rolled in a circle around anns squat figure sitting on the cold ground would you stop that zedd spread supine in the mud before her he swept his rigid arms and legs through the mud ann he said in a low tone we have important business i think we might have better success if we attempt to carry out those tasks in this world rather than in the underworld after we are dead i know we cant help if were dead it would stand to reason then that we need to get away now wouldnt it of course it would she grumbled but i dont think zedd plopped himself down in her lap she winced in disgust her nose wrinkled when he rested his muddy arms around her neck ann if we do nothing we die if we try to fight these people we will die without the use of our magic we cant escape them our only option is to convince them to let us go we cant speak their language and even if we could i doubt we would be able to persuade them yes but we have only one chance as i see it we must convince them that we are quite loony this sacrifice is a sacred service to their spirit ancestors look at the guards behind my back do they look happy well no if they believe that were crazy then they just might think twice before sacrificing us to their spirits wouldnt the spirits be insulted to receive a lunatic as a sacrifice wouldnt that be disrespectful we have to make them fear insulting their spirits with two loony people but thats crazy look at it this way a sacrifice is something like a treaty wedding between two peoples the bride is the sacrifice of one people to another in the flesh of the new husband all in the hope for a peaceful and productive future the brides new people treat her with respect the brides people treat the husband and his people with respect its all an arrangement symbolizing unity continuity and hope for the future we are like the bride being offered to the spirits how would it look if the nangtong offered an unworthy demented bride if you were one of the spirits wouldnt you be offended if i got you in the bargain i would be zedd howled at the sky ann winced and pulled away from him its our only chance ann he leaned close whispering in her ear i swear an oath as first wizard that i will never tell anyone how you behaved he drew back and grinned at her besides its fun remember how much fun it was as a child to play outside to play in the mud why it was the grandest of things but it might not work even if it doesnt wouldnt you rather die having fun on the last day of your life instead of sitting here afraid and cold and dirty wouldnt you rather have some childlike fun one last time let yourself go prelate and recall what it was to be a child let yourself do anything that comes into your head have fun be a child with a serious expression ann considered his words you wont tell anyone you have my word you can act with childish glee and no one but i will ever knowand the nangtong of course another of your acts of desperation zedd the time for desperation is upon us lets play ann smiled a sly smile she stiffarmed him in the chest knocking him back into the mud with a riot of laughter she leaped on top of him they wrestled like children rolling through the slop after a half dozen turns ann was a mud monster with arms legs and two eyes the mud split revealing a pink mouth as she howled with him at the sky they made mudballs and used the pigs as targets they chased the pigs they flopped onto the hard round backs of the squealing creatures riding them around until they were tossed off into the mud zedd doubted that ann had ever been this dirty in her nine centuries of life he realized while they were having a onelegged game of tag that involved more falling in the mud than hopping progress that her laughter had changed ann was having fun they stomped through puddles they chased the pigs they ran around the enclosure rattling sticks against the fence and then they hit upon the idea of making faces at the guards they drew whimsical expressions on each others faces in mud they made every rude noise they could think of they jumped and laughed and pointed at the solemn guards ann and zedd got to laughing so hard that they couldnt stand and like two drunks they rolled on the ground holding their sides the crowd grew worried whispers swept through the onlookers ann stuck her thumbs in her ears and wiggled her fingers as she made faces at them zedd stood on his head and sang a few lewd ballads he knew ann laughed hysterically as he mispronounced key words zedd fell to laughing and then fell in the mud and then ann fell on him she sat on his stomach pinning him to the ground as she tickled him under his arms while he gasped for breath between laughter and tickled her ribs the two of them had never had so much fun the pigs cowered in the corner suddenly buckets of water were dumped over the both of them as they were furiously engaged in trying to find each others most ticklish spots they looked up more water rained down on them as fast as the mud was washed off them they dived back into it ashcovered guards seized them by the arms and held them at spearpoint while they were once again washed off zedd peered over at ann she peered back she looked ridiculous her face emerging from streamers of slop he giggled and made a face at her she giggled and made a face back the men yelled zedds cheeks puffed with attempts to halt his laughing the guards shoved them forward spears poking in their backs it reminded him of being tickled and they both laughed it was as if once uncorked the laughter had a life of its own if they were to be sacrificed what difference did it make they might as well have the last laugh the crowd of shrouded figures parted as the two prisoners were led out of the pigs pen giggling zedd held his arm high and waved wave at the people annie she made faces instead zedd liked the idea and imitated her people shrank back as if seeing a horrifying sight some of the women wept and wailed zedd and ann laughed and pointed at them as the women ran from the crowd seeking refuge from the lunatics the tents and onlookers were soon left behind as their captors prodded them on with spears before long the two dirty smelly happy sacrifices were out in the hills thirtyfive or forty nangtong spirit hunters all holding ready spears or bows followed behind zedd noticed that some of them had brought packs and provisions first wizard zeddicus zul zorander and prelate annalina aldurren skipped along ahead of the spears laughing and making outrageous everincreasing claims as to how many onions they could eat without producing tears zedd hadnt a clue where they were going but it was a fine morning to be going there wherever it was its kind of funny lord rahl lieutenant crawford said richard gazed out over the boulder field whats funny about it the lieutenant bent his head back to peer up the cliff well i meant its odd i grew up in rugged mountains so ive seen places like these mountains my whole life but this place is odd he turned and pointed see that mountain over there you can see where the rockslide came from richard put a hand over his brow to shield his eyes from the low afternoon sun the mountain the lieutenant was pointing to was rugged and covered with trees except for the uppermost reaches on the steep side facing them a part of it had given way leaving naked rock to scar the mountain where the rock had broken off at the bottom of the barren scar lay a boulder field what about it well look at all the rock at the bottom thats the portion that broke off the face of the mountain he gestured to the boulder field they stood atop this isnt the same another soldier approached and saluted with a fist to his heart he cast a wary glance at ulic and egan who were standing with their arms folded while he waited silently nothing lord rahl he said when richard acknowledged him not so much as a flake of rock thats been worked with tools keep looking try the outer fringes of the boulder field look for places where you can crawl down under some of the larger boulders and check under there too the soldier saluted and hurried off there wasnt much of the day left richard had told them that he didnt want to stay the next day he wanted to get back to aydindril kahlan would probably be back that night or possibly tomorrow he wanted to be there if she came back if she was still alive he broke out in a sweat at the very thought his knees felt weak he banished the thought she would be back that was all there was to it she would be back he made himself quit thinking about it and put his mind to the problem at hand so what do you think lieutenant lieutenant crawford pitched a stone watching it bounce first off one boulder and then another the sharp sound echoed off the cliff behind them it could be that the face of this mountain broke off much longer ago then over all that time things started growing in dying making soil for larger things to grow and then they died making yet more soil it could be that its been covered over richard knew what lieutenant crawford was talking about he knew how a forest in time could cover over rockslides if you dug in the forest at the bottom of a cliff you often encountered the bones of the fallen mountain i dont think so in this case the lieutenant looked over at him may i ask why you think not lord rahl richard stared across the rift to the next mountain well look at that cliff the face of it is rough and uneven yet the rock of the mountain left behind after the face fell away is weathered now so much of it isnt sharp its been worn by time some of it is sharp though water gets in the cracks freezes and breaks off more of the rock with time you can see some of those sharp places but most of it has a softer look it has the look to me that it happened long before this slide here yet you can still see most of the rock lying at the bottom of the cliff here theres much less scree egan unfolded his arms and brushed back his blond hair could just be the lay of the land this cliff faces south letting the sun in to help things grow whereas that one faces north so its in shade most of the time the forest wouldnt grow in as well over there and that would leave the scree exposed egan had a point theres more to it richard tilted his head back and looked up the thousands of feet of sheer cliff face towering above them half this mountain is gone that one over there is just a small slide in comparison look up at this mountain and try to imagine what it would have looked like before this happened its cleaved from the very top all the way down like a log round split in half all the rest of the mountains around here are more or less coneshaped this one is only half a cone even if im wrong and half the mountain isnt gone and it used to be shaped much as we see it now there would still be an immense amount of rock down here i mean even if it used to be much this shape and only a shell of rock ten or twenty feet thick collapsed by the towering height alone there would have to be a huge pile of rubble this rock is sharp so it might be pieces broken off by the working of water freezing but probably since i cant see any timeworn places it happened more recently yet i just dont see any evidence of the mass of rock that would have had to come off this mountain even if it had been covered over in time id think that where were standing would be a huge mound the lieutenant glanced about you have a point this is pretty much level with the bottom of the rift if all that rock broke off theres no mound under the forest down here richard watched the soldiers all about searching through the rock and woods for any sign of the temple of the winds none looked to be finding anything i cant see that its down here i just dont see any reason to believe that the mountain fell down here ulic and egan folded their arms again the matter settled as far as they were concerned lieutenant crawford cleared his throat lord rahl if the half of mount kymermosst that used to be there isnt down here then where is it richard shared a long look with the man thats what id like to know if it isnt down here then it must be someplace else the blondheaded lieutenant shifted his weight to his other foot well it didnt just get up and walk away lord rahl richard turned his scabbard out of the way as he started climbing down off the rocks he realized he was frightening the man richard seemed to be suggesting something that hinted at magic it must be as you say lieutenant it must have fallen and grown over perhaps the cleft between the mountains was deeper back then and the fall simply filled it in rather than making a mound the lieutenant liked the idea it gave him a rock solid reality richard didnt believe it the cliff face looked peculiar to him it was too smooth as if cleaved with a huge sword yes there were jagged places but that would explain the rock that was at the bottom it looked to him as though the mountain had been cut off and taken away and over time water and ice had worked at the smooth face of the cliff breaking off pieces and making it more craggy but it was nowhere near as rough as the other cliffs round about that might explain it lord rahl the lieutenant said if thats true though that would mean that the temple youre looking for must be buried deep underground with his two huge guards right at his heels richard made for the horses i want to have a look up on top i want to see the ruins up there their guide a middleaged man named andy millett was waiting with the horses he wore simple wool clothes of browns and greens much like richard used to wear his shaggy brown hair hung past his ears andy was immensely proud that lord rahl had asked him to guide them to mount kymermosst richard felt a bit sheepish about that andy was simply the first person richard found who knew where it was andy id like to go up to the ruins on top andy handed richard the reins to the big roan sure enough lord rahl theres not much up there but id be glad to show you just the same big as his two guards were they mounted lightly their horses hardly moving under the sudden weight richard swung up into the saddle and wiggled his right boot into the stirrup can we get up there before dark most of that spring snowstorm is melted the trail should be open andy glanced at the sun which was just about touching a mountain with the way you ride lord rahl id say long before usually important people slow me down i think im the one slowing you down richard smiled he remembered the same thing himself the more important the person he guided the slower they went it seemed the sky was streaked with golds and reds by the time they reached the ruins the surrounding mountains were cast in deep shadow the ruins seemed to glow in the honeyed light there were some once elegant structures now crumbling that looked to have been a part of a larger place just as kahlan had said here and there on the barren mountaintop parts of walls still stood their stones not covered by vine and wood as they would have been down below but covered with a rust of lichens instead richard dismounted and handed his reins to lieutenant crawford the building to the left of the broad road was large by any standards richard had grown up with but compared to castles and palaces he had seen since it was an insignificant structure the doorway stood empty crumbling evidence of a doorfrarne remained still partly covered with gold leaf inside the walls echoed with his footsteps a stone bench sat in one room of the roofless building in another room a stone fountain held snowmelt a twisting hall with most of its barrel ceiling still in place led richard past a warren of rooms the hall split leading he surmised to rooms at either corner of the building he followed the left branch to the room at the end like all the rooms on this side it faced the cliff hollow rectangles gaped where windows once shielded the room from wind and rain beyond through the openings was a view past the edge of the cliff to the blue haze of the mountains beyond this was the place where visitors and supplicants to the temple would have awaited admittance during their wait they would have had a glorious view of the temple of the winds if they were turned away they left with at least that much he could almost see what those who had stood in this very spot had seen it was his gift he knew that was telling him this much the way the spirits of those who once held the sword of truth guided him when he used that magic as he stood staring he could almost imagine it there just beyond the edge a place of grandeur and might this was where the wizards had taken things of powerful magic for safekeeping the wizards of old some of them richards ancestors had probably stood where he stood looking out at the temple of the winds richard strolled around outside in the fading light past the stately columns peering into guard huts and once magnificent garden structures touching the deteriorating walls even though it all was now crumbling it was easy for him to imagine the majestic scene it must once have been he stood in the center of the broad road that ran through the crumbling ruins feeling his gold cloak billowing out behind in the wind trying to visualize the place as it had been trying to get the feel of it the road more than the buildings gave him the eerie feeling of the presence of the temple beyond this road had once led right into the temple of the winds he strode the wide roadway imagining striding toward the temple of the winds the winds that had said they were hunting him he passed along part of a wall and between the hollow stone buildings feeling the timeless quality of the place feeling the life that once was here but where had it gone how was he to find it where else could he look it had been here and even now richard could almost see it feel it sense it as if his gift were pulling him onward pulling him home abruptly he was jerked to a halt ulic on one side of him and egan on the other had seized him under his arms and pulled him back he looked down and saw that another step would have taken him out into thin air vultures soared in the updraft not twenty feet straight in front of him he felt as if he was standing at the edge of the world the view was dizzying the hair on the back of his neck stiffened more should lie beyond the edge at his feet he knew it should but there was nothing there the temple of the winds was gone chapter breathe kahlan did as she was told expelling the sliph and pulling in the sharp cold air the sound of a hissing torch roared in her ears her own breath echoed painfully but she knew what to expect by now and calmly waited for the world around her to twist back to normal except this was not normal at least it was not the normal she expected sliph where are we her voice reverberated around her where you wished to travel the jocopo treasure you should be pleased but if you are not i will try again no no it isnt that im not pleased its just that this wasnt what i expected she was in a cave the torch wasnt the familiar kind she was accustomed to a length of wood with pitch at the head but instead was made of bundled reeds the ceiling nearly brushed her head as she swung her legs down from the sliphs well and stood kahlan pulled the bundledreed torch from where it was wedged in a split in the rough stone wall ill be back she told the sliph ill have a look around and if i dont find a way out ill come back and well go somewhere else she realized that there must be a way out or the torch wouldnt have been there or else when im through finding what im looking for ill be back i will be ready when you wish to travel we will travel again you will be pleased kahlan nodded to the silver face reflecting the dancing torchlight then stepped into the cave there was only one way out of the room she was in a wide low passageway so she went through it following it as it twisted and turned through the dark brown rock there were no other corridors or rooms so she kept going the passageway led to a broad room perhaps fifty or sixty feet across and she found out why this place was called the jocopo treasure torchlight reflected back in thousands of golden sparkles the room was filled with gold some was stacked in crude ingots or spheres as if the molten metal had been poured into pots the pots then broken away simple boxes were piled high with nuggets other boxes with handles at both ends so they could be carried by two men held a rubble of golden objects there were several tables still holding gold disks and shelves along one wall the shelves held several gold statues but were filled mostly with rolled vellum scrolls kahlan wasnt interested in the jocopo treasure she didnt take time to inspect the objects all around and instead made for the corridor on the other side of the room she didnt want to linger in the room because she was worried and wanted to get to the mud people but even if she had been interested in looking around she wouldnt have stayed long the air smelled awful and made her gag and cough the foul stench made her head spin and start to hurt the air in the passageway was better though not what she would call good she reached over and felt the bone knife and found it still warm at least it wasnt hot as it had been the tunnel began slanting upward as it twisted along as she went higher the dark rock became dirt in places held back with beams she didnt see any other passages branching off until she began to smell fresh air one tunnel branched left and in a few paces another right she felt cool air drifting down from the one straight ahead and so went that way the flame of the torch whipped and fluttered as she stepped out into the night the sky glittered with stars a figure not far away sprang up kahlan backed a few paces into the cave glancing both ways to see if there was anyone else waiting outside mother confessor came a voice she knew kahlan took a step forward and held out the torch into the night air chandalen chandalen is it you the muscular figure rushed into the torchlight he had no shirt and was smeared with mud grass bundles were tied to his arms and head his straight black hair was slicked down with the sticky mud the hunters used even though his face was also smeared with the mud she recognized the familiar wide grin chandalen she said with a sigh of relief oh chandalen im so happy to see you and i you mother confessor he advanced toward her to slap her face in the traditional mud people greeting to show respect for anothers strength kahlan held her hands out warding him no stay away he straightened to a halt why because there was sickness where i came fromin aydindril i dont want to get too close to any of you for fear i might pass the fever on to you and our people the mud people were indeed her people she and richard had been named mud people by the bird man and the other elders and were now members of the village even though they lived apart chandalens pleasure at seeing her faded there is sickness here too mother confessor kahlans torch lowered what she whispered much has happened our people are afraid and i cannot protect them we called a gathering grandfathers spirit came to us he said that there was much trouble he said he must speak with you and that he would send you a message to come to us the knife she said i felt his call through the knife i came right away yes just before dawn he told us this one of the elders came out of the spirit house and said i was to come to this place to wait for you how did you come to us from the hole in the ground its a long story it was magic chandalen i dont have the time to wait until we can call another gathering to speak with the ancestor spirits theres trouble i cant afford to wait three days he lifted the torch from her hand his face was grim under the mud mask there is no need to wait three days grandfather waits for you in the spirit house kahlans eyes widened she knew that a gathering lasted only through the one night it was called how can that be the elders still sit in the circle grandfather told them to wait for you he too waits how many are sick chandalen held all his fingers up once and then only one hand a second time they have great pain in their heads they empty their stomachs even though they have nothing in them they burn with fever some begin to turn black on their fingers and toes dear spirits she whispered to herself have any died one child died this day just before grandfather sent me here he was the first to become sick kahlan herself felt sick her head spun as she tried to come to grips with what she was hearing the mud people didnt usually tolerate other people coming to their village and they rarely ventured from their lands how could this have happened chandalen have any outsiders come he shook his head we would not allow it outsiders bring trouble he seemed to reconsider one may have tried to come but we would not allow her to come to the village her yes some of the children were playing at hunting out in the grassland a woman came to them asking if she could come to the village the children ran back to tell us when i took my hunters to the place we could not find her we told the children that their spirit ancestors would be angry if they played such tricks again kahlan feared to ask because she feared the answer the child who died today he was one of those children who said they saw the woman wasnt he chandalen cocked his head you are a wise woman mother confessor no im a frightened woman chandalen a woman came to aydindril and talked to children they have begun to die too did the boy who died say that she showed him a book when i went on my journey with you you showed me these things called books that you use to pass on knowledge but the children here do not know of such things we teach our children with living words as our ancestors taught us the boy did say that this woman showed him pretty colored lights that does not sound like the books i remember kahlan put a hand to chandalens arm a touch that once would have frightened him with the implied threat of a confessors power but now worried him for other reasons you said we should not be close it doesnt matter now she reassured him i can cause no further harm the same sickness is here that is in aydindril i am sorry mother confessor that this sickness and death should visit your home too they embraced in friendship and shared fear chandalen what is this place this cave i told you of it once the place with the bad air and the worthless metal then were north of your home north and some west how long will it lake us to get back to the village he gave his own chest a thump with a fist chandalen is strong and runs fast i left our village as the sun was going down it takes chandalen only a couple hours even in the dark she surveyed the moonlit grassland beyond the low rocky hill on which they stood there is enough moon to see our way kahlan managed a small smile and you ought to know that im as strong as you chandalen chandalen returned the smile it was a wonderful sight to see even under the circumstances yes i remember well your strength mother confessor we will run then the moonlight conveyed intimately the ghostly boxy shapes of the mud peoples village lying hidden on the dark grasscovered plain few lights burned in the small windows at this late hour not many people were out and kahlan was glad for that she didnt want to see the faces of these people see the fear and sorrow in their eyes and know that many of them would die chandalen took her directly to the spirit house among the communal buildings at the north side of the village most of these buildings were bunched close together but the spirit house sat apart moonlight reflected off the tile roof richard had helped to make guards chandalens hunters ringed the windowless building outside the door on a low bench sat the fatherly figure of the bird man his silver hair hanging down around his shoulders shone in the moonlight he was naked black and white mud covered his body and face in a tangle of whorls and lines a mask all in the gathering wore so the spirits could see them two pots one with white mud and the other holding black sat on the ground at the bird mans feet she could tell by the glazed look in his eyes that he was in a trance and speaking would do her no good she knew what was required kahlan unbuckled her belt chandalen would you mind turning your back please and ask your men to do the same it was the greatest concession to her modesty that circumstances would allow chandalen called out the order to his men in his own language my men and i will guard the spirit house while you and the elders are inside chandalen said to her over his shoulder when she had slipped off all her clothes and at last stood naked in the cool night air the silent bird man began applying the gooey mud so that the spirits might see her too sleepy chickens sat watching from the nearby low wall the wall still bore a slash from richards sword she knew she had to do this to go in and speak with the spirits but she wasnt eager speaking with the spirit ancestors was only done in times of dire need and while the results sometimes brought the answers needed they never brought joy when the bird man had finished covering kahlan with the black and white mud he silently led her inside the six elders sat in a circle around the skulls of ancestors arranged in the center the bird man took his place sitting crosslegged on the floor kahlan sat in the circle opposite him to the right of her friend savidlin she didnt speak to him he too was in a trance seeing the spirit in the center of the circle that she could not yet see a woven basket sat behind her knowing why it was there she picked it up and reached inside hesitantly she seized a squirming red spirit frog and pressed its back between her breaststhe one place she wasnt painted the slime from the frog tingled against her skin she released the spirit frog and took up hands with the elders to either side it wasnt long before she felt herself spiraling into a daze the room began its dizzying spin she was lifted away from the world she knew and carried into a revolving vortex of light shadow aroma and sound the skulls spun with her time twisted much as it did in the sliph but not in the same comforting way this was a disorienting experience that brought sweat to her brow it also brought the spirit his glowing form was before her yet she couldnt recall when it had appeared to her it was simply there grandfather she whispered in the tongue of the mud people chandalen had said that it was his grandfather who had come in the gathering but she recognized him on a more visceral level he had become her protector she felt the connection to the bone that had been his in life child the unearthly sound of his voice coming through the bird man tingled against her flesh thank you for heeding my call what does our ancestors spirit wish of me the bird mans mouth moved with the spirits voice that which has been partly entrusted to us has been violated entrusted to you what was entrusted to you the temple of the winds kahlans naked flesh prickled with goose bumps entrusted to the spirits the implications made her head swim the spirit world was the underworld the world of the dead how could something like a temple built mostly of inert materials like stone be sent to the underworld the temple of the winds is in the spirit world the temple of the winds exists partly in the world of the dead and partly in the world of life it exists in both places both worlds at once both places both worlds at once how could such a thing he possible the glowing form like a shadow made of light lifted a hand is a tree a creature of the soil like the worms or is it a creature of the air like the birds kahlan would have preferred a simple answer but she knew better than to argue with the dead honored grandfather i guess the tree is of neither world yet exists in both the spirit seemed to smile so if does child the spirit said through the bird man as does the temple of the winds kahlan leaned forward you mean the temple of the winds is like the tree with its roots in this world and its branches in your world it exists in both our worlds in this world in the world of life where is it where it always was on the mountain of the four winds you know it as mount kyntermosst mount kymennosst kahlan repeated in a flat tone honored grandfather i have been to that place the temple of the winds is no longer i here its gone you must find it find it it looks to have been there at one time but the rock of the mountain where the temple used to be has collapsed the temple is gone except for a few of its outbuildings there is nothing to find im sorry honored grandfather but in our world the roots have died and crumbled the spirit stood silently kahlan feared it might become angry child the spirit said but not through the bird man the voice came from the spirit itself the sound was so painful it was almost more than she could bear she felt as if the flesh would burn from her bones something was stolen from the winds and taken to your world you must help richard or all my blood in your world all our people will die kahlan swallowed how could something be stolen from the spirit world the world of the dead and be brought back to the world of the living can you help me can you tell me anything that might help me to know how to find the temple of the winds i have not called you here to tell you how to find the winds the way of the winds will come with the moon i have called you here to see the extent of what has been released and what will become of your world should this be allowed to stand grandfathers spirit spread his arms soft light cascaded from them like water coming over a ledge the light spread in her vision until she saw only white light the light cleared and she saw death corpses like leaves littering the ground in the autumn lay everywhere they were strewn in the street where they fell they sat on steps slumped against railings they lay in doorways and on deadcarts kahlans vision was carried through windows as if on the wings of a bird bodies lay rotting in homes she saw them in beds in chairs in halls stretched out on floors and slumped over one another the stench gagged her with her floating vision kahlan swept to towns and cities she knew and everywhere it was the same death had taken nearly everyone their bodies black and rotting even before they had died the few still living wherever she viewed wept in unrelieved anguish her floating vision returned to the mud peoples village she saw the corpses of people she knew beside dead cook fires lay dead mothers holding dead children in their arms dead husbands held dead wives here and there orphaned children with tearstained faces wailed hysterically beside the corpses of parents everywhere the stench was so thick it made her eyes water kahlan gasped back a sob as she closed her eyes it did no good the sight of the dead burned through to the vision in her mind this the spirit said is what will come to pass if that stolen from the winds isnt flailed what can i do kahlan whispered through the tears the winds have been violated that which was entrusted was taken the winds have decided that you are the path of the price i have come to show you the results of this violation and to beg you on behalf of my living descendants to fulfill your part when you are asked and what is the price i have not been shown the price but i forewarn you that i do know that there is no way for you to circumvent or avoid it it must he as it will lie revealed to you or all will be lost i ask that when the winds show you the path you fake it lest what i have shown you comes to be kahlan tears streaming down her cheeks didnt have to consider i will grandfather thank you child there is one other thing i would fell you in our world where the souls of those departed from your world now reside there are those existing in the light with the creator and those who are forever shadowed from his glory by the keeper you mean that there are both good and evil spirits in this that is an oversimplification that nearly obscures the truth but it is as near as you in your world would be able to come to comprehending this world in this our world ail make it what if is the winds must allow all to mark out the path can you tell me how the magic was stolen from the winds the path was betrayal betrayal who did they betray the keeper kahlans jaw dropped she immediately thought of the sister of the dark who had been in aydindril sister amelia it had to be her the sister of the dark has betrayed her master this souls path was to enter the temple of the winds through the hall of the betrayer that is the only way to achieve the initial breach it was created as a precaution to tread the hall of the betrayer a person must betray completely and irrecoverably that in which they believe since they have irreparably betrayed their cause they would no longer have reason to enter the dream walker found a prophecy that could be used to defeat his foe but to ignite if he needed magic from the winds the dream walker found a way to force this soul to betray her master the keeper yet still carry out the dream walkers wishes he did this by at first allowing her to maintain her oath to the keeper and by relegating himself to the role of her secondary master her master in your world alone then with the use of a double bind he forced her to betray her primary master she was able to tread betrayers hall with her charge from the dream walker and her obligation to if intact in this way the dream walker violated the winds and obtained what he wanted those who sent the temple into the winds did however make contingency plans should such a thing happen the red moon was the ignition of these plans the very word betray had made kahlans heart pound is this the way we must gain entrance to the winds the spirit considered her as if weighing her soul once the temple of the winds has been violated that path is closed and another must be used but this is not your concern the winds will issue their requirements in conjunction with the precepts of balance the five spirits guarding the winds will dictate the path accordingly honored grandfather how can a place issue instructions you make it seem as if the winds are alive i no longer exist in the world of life yet when called i can pass information through the veil kahlans head hurt from trying to understand she wished richard were here to ask questions she feared to miss the important one but honored grandfather you can do this because you are a spirit you lived once you have a soul the spirit began fading the boundary the veil was damaged by this event in the winds i can remain no longer the skrin the guardians of the boundary between worlds pull me hack because the violation in the winds altered the balance we cannot return again in a gathering unless the balance is restored the spirit faded until she could hardly see it grandfather i must know more is the plague itself magic the voice came from a great distance the magic sent into the winds is of vast power to use it fully requires vast knowledge it was used without understanding what was released or how to control it the plague was begun by this magic much as a bolt of lightning from a wizard is magic but if the lightning strikes a tinder grassland the resulting firestorm is not magic the plague is like this it was begun with magic but it is now simply a plague as others beforerandom and unpredictableyet heated by magic the plague is in aydindril and here will it stay confined no jagang didnt realize what he had done this could end up killing him too if allowed to burn out of control is it as you showed me already in other places has it already been started in these oilier places too the light of the spirit extinguished like the weak flame of a lamp gone out yes came the distant echoing whisper they had hoped that they could confine the plague to aydindril that was hope lost the whole of the midlands the whole of the new world was about to be consumed in the firestorm started by that spark of magic from the temple of the winds in the center of the circle where the spirit had been the air swirled as the spirit vanished back into the underworld in the distance in the underworld kahlan heard the soft echo of laughter from a different spirit the malevolent chuckle made her skin crawl as kahlan came out of the trance of the gathering the elders were there standing around her they were more used to this altered state than she her head still spun sickeningly elder breginderin reached down offering her his hand to help her up as she took his hand under the covering of black and white mud she saw the tokens on his legs she gazed up into his face at his kindly smile of assurance he would be dead within the day her friend savidlin was there holding out her clothes kahlan despite the mud suddenly felt very naked she started pulling on her clothes trying not to betray her embarrassment and at the same time chiding herself for such mundane concerns in the face of the impending catastrophe the gathering was about calling the spirits of the dead not about being man or woman still she was the only one of the latter and they were all the former thank you for coming mother confessor the bird man said we know this homecoming is not the one of joy we all wished no she whispered its not my heart sings lo see my people again but the song is tempered by sadness you know honored elders that richard and i will do what we must we will not rest until this is stopped do you think you can stop such a thing as a fever sunn asked savidlin placed a hand on her shoulder as she buttoned her shirt the mother confessor and richard with the temper have helped us before we know their hearts our ancestor said that this is a fever caused by magic the mother confessor and the seeker have great magic they will do what they must savidlin is right we will do what we must savidlin smiled at her and then when you have finished you will come home to your people and be wedded as you planned my wife weselan wishes to see her friend the mother confessor wedded in the dress she made for you kahlan swallowed back a cry there is nothing i could wish that would bring me greater joy except to see all our people well you are a great friend to all our people child the bird man said we look forward to the wedding when you have finished with these matters of the spirits and magic kahlan glanced at all the eyes watching her she didnt think these men had witnessed the visions of death she had been shown or the true nature or dimensions of the epidemic they faced they had all seen fevers come before but never one like the plague honored elders if we fail if we her voice faltered the bird man came to her rescue if you should fail child we know it will not be because you didnt do everything you could if there is a path we know you will do all you can to find if we trust in you thank you she murmured tears were watering her vision she forced herself to hold her chin up she would only frighten these people if she showed her fear kahlan you must wed richard with the temper the bird man chuckled softly as if trying to cheer her he escaped wedding a mud woman before as i had planned for him he will not escape wedding you if i have any say he must marry a mud woman she felt too numb to return the smile will you stay the rest of the night savidlin asked weselan would find joy in seeing you forgive me honored elders but if i am to save our people i must return at once i must go to richard and tell him what i have learned with your help chapter a woman stepped out of a doorway into the narrow deserted alleyway he had to stop or collide with her under her shawl she wore a thin dress and he could tell by the way her nipples stood out with the cold that she wore nothing underneath the dress she thought his smile was for her it wasnt it was amusement at the way opportunity sometimes stepped into his path when he least expected it he guessed it was his extraordinary nature that drew such events to him expecting it or not he was never unprepared to bend events to his advantage she returned the smile as she ran her hand up his chest and with a single finger stroked the bottom of his chin there there love care for a bit of pleasure she wasnt attractive nonetheless the nature of the chance opportunity instantly ignited his need he knew what this was about by the way she stood close commanding his attention he knew he had had this kind of encounter before in fact he sometimes sought it out it was more of a challenge with challenge came a rare form of fulfillment it wasnt an ideal situationthere were distinct disadvantages such as not being able to allow her screams to bring attention yet there were still pleasures to be had even like this his senses opened to it already he was taking in the details like dry earth took in a soaking rain he let the lust take him well he said drawing the word out do you have a room he knew she wouldnt have one he knew what this was about she rested a wrist over his shoulder dont need no room love just a half silver discreetly as possible he swept his gaze over the close buildings the windows were all dark only a few lights in the distance reflected off the wet stone this was a warehouse district no one lived in these buildings there werent likely to be many people about except passersby like himself still he knew he had to temper his lust with prudence a little cold to be undressing out here on the cobblestones isnt it she put one hand on the side of his face to keep his attention focused on her her other hand touched him between his legs she purred with satisfaction at what she found not to worry love for a half silver ill have someplace warm for you to put it he was enjoying the game it had been too long he put on his most innocent inexperienced expression for her well i dont know this seems somewhat crude to me i usually like it best when theres time for the young lady to enjoy it too oh i do enjoy it love you dont think i do this just for the half silver do you course not i enjoy it its my pleasure she was backing toward the doorway she had come from he let her fingers curled behind his neck guide him with her i dont carry any money that small he could almost see her eyes light with her luck she had yet to learn that her luck this night was going to be bad you dont she said as if preparing to withdraw her offer now that she thought she had snared him with tempting thoughts of what she was offering well a lady has to earn a living i guess ill have to move along and see if i can find the smallest i have is a silver but id be willing to give you the whole silver if it would mean you took your time and enjoyed it too i like lovely young ladies like you to enjoy it thats what pleases me what a love she said with clumsy exaggerated delight as she took the silver coin when he held it out she stank her smile brought no beauty to her face yet he reveled in the details coarse hair the smell of her body the humped nose and small eyes she was common less than a man of his stature was used to but this had its own delights to offer he listened carefully as he watched her other details were even more important if he was to have his full pleasure from this she backed into the shallow doorway and sat on a stool waiting there the doorway was just deep enough to hold them both with his back to the alleyway as he stood before her it aggravated him that she thought him so ignorant so foolish so impetuous she would learn just how wrong she was she planted a kiss on the front of his trousers as she fumbled with his belt it wouldnt be long she wouldnt want it to take too long before she moved on to another place reaping all the coin she could in the cloak of night before she undid his trousers he gently took her wrists in one hand it wouldnt do to have his trousers down around his knees when it started no that wouldnt do at all she smiled up at him clearly puzzled but just as clearly sure she was bewitching him with her smile he wouldnt have to suffer it for long it wouldnt be long it was dark enough too dark to see for sure what he was doing people saw what they expected while she still smiled at him before she had time to question he reached down with his other hand and gripped her neck she thought he simply wished to hold her while she performed her service the way her head was tilted back was perfect with a thumb and a small grunt of effort he crushed her windpipe the smile transferred to his face the choking sound wouldnt immediately raise suspicions people heard what they expected to hear just as they saw what they expected to see he hunched over her to make it look as expected while he crushed the life out of her surprise he whispered to her bulging eyes he luxuriated in her startled strangled expression when her arms went limp he let them drop and held her up by a fistful of her hair he bent her head back over his thigh to help hold her up as he waited he had to wait only seconds before he heard the careful footsteps approaching from behind more than one man as he had expected he knew what this was about robbery mere seconds more and they had closed the distance to him time stretched with the anticipation with the details of sights sounds and smells he was the most rare of men he owned time he owned life he owned death and now it was time for the rest of his pleasure he pushed his knee up against her spine and with a quick yank snapped her neck over his leg he spun bringing his knife up into the man right behind slicing him open from his groin to his sternum he spun past the man as guts slopped out into the alley he expected another man there were two a woman like this usually had two men to rob the man he had never before seen three the unexpected danger of this development made him reel with lust the second man on the right swung an arm he saw the knife in the fist and with a step back escaped the sweep of the blade as the third man advanced he drove him back with a boot to the point at the base of the breastbone the man smacked the wall behind and stumbled to his knees with a grunt of pain unable to regain his breath the man on the right froze in that instant it was one on one the face was that of a boy really hardly a man yet with a boys courage he broke and ran he smiled there was no more perfect target as they ran than a persons head the head remained nearly still while the arms and legs flailed furiously that target was a core of stability in his vision he loosed his knife the boy ran as fast as his rapidly pumping legs would carry him the knife was faster hitting home with a solid thunk the young thief went down instantly the third man was coming up from his knees he was older muscled heavy and violently angry good a side kick broke the mans nose howling in pain and rage the man sprang forward he saw a flash of steel and dodged to the side as he swept a leg beneath the man taking his feet from under him it all happened in a blink it was a glorious event this dangerous raging bull charging madly he pulled in the details the mans clothes the small rip in the back of his coat his bald spot reflecting the distant light his curly greasy hair the nick missing out of his right ear the way he flopped when the boot landed between his shoulders it was when he was twisting the mans arm behind his back that he saw the blood blood was something he kept careful track of this blood surprised him he hadnt cut the manyet nor was this blood from the mans crushed nose he rarely had a thrill of surprise such as this unexpected blood brought he realized the man was screaming in pain he screamed louder when the shoulder joint popped he dropped onto the mans back and smacked his head with the heel of a hand breaking the loans teeth against the cobbles and quieting him somewhat he gripped the greasy hair in a fist and pulled the mans head back listening to the sound of the grunts robbery is a dangerous business time you paid the price we wouldnt have hurt you the man burbled just robbed you you bastard bastard is it carefully slowly enjoying the detail of every inch he slit open the mans throat as he thrashed what unexpected pleasure this night had brought he lifted his hands curling his fingers slowly sweeping the quintessence of death from the air capturing the silken substance of it as it lifted in the darkness and pulled it back to himself he was the fulfillment of their lives he was the balance he was death he savored seeing that awareness in their eyes he liked it best when he could bask in that look that knowledge that terror it brought him fulfillment it made him complete he stood swaying in ecstasy at the cloying scent of blood he regretted it hadnt lasted longer he regretted not being able to enjoy prolonged screams screams were rapture he craved them needed them lusted after them screams fulfilled him made him whole he needed the screams not the actual sound of themhe often gagged his partnersbut the attempt at them and what they represented terror being denied the chance to leisurely enjoy the screaming terror left him unfulfilled his lust unsated he glided up the alley and found that his skill was as sharp as ever as was his knife it had found its target the boy lay crumpled on his side he looked delicious with the knife buried to the cross guard at the back of his head and the point of the heavy blade jutting from his forehead just slightly off center immersed in a pool of sensation he realized he felt a new one pain surprised he inspected his arm and discovered the source of the unexpected blood he had a gash a good six inches long on the outside of his right forearm it was deep it would need to be stitched the pleasure of such an unexpected occurrence made him gasp danger death and damageall in one night in one chance encounter this was nearly too much the voices had been right about coming to aydindril still he hadnt had what he neededthe prolonged terror the careful cutting the slicing the binge of blood the giving of endless exquisite pain the orgy of frenzied stabbing at the end but the voices from the ethers promised him he would have those things promised him he would have the ultimate conquest the ultimate balance the ultimate pairing they promised him he would have the ultimate consummation of debauchery they promised him he would have the mother confessor his time was coming her time was coming soon when verna dabbed the wet cloth against warrens forehead his eyes opened she let out a long breath of relief how are you feeling he tried to sit up with a firm hand on his chest she gently pushed him back down into the hay just you lay there and rest he winced in pain and then smacked his lips i need a drink verna twisted and lifted the dipper from the bucket she held it to his lips his hands cupped the dented bowl of the dipper as he greedily gulped down all the water he panted catching his breath after the long drink more verna dragged the dipper through the bucket and let him drink his fill she smiled down at him glad to see you awake it looked to be an effort for him to return the smile glad to be awake how long have i been out this time she shrugged discounting his concern a few hours he glanced around the inside of the barn verna lifted the lamp so he could see his surroundings rain drummed against the roof making it feel cozy inside verna set down the lamp and rested on an elbow beside him not fancy lodging but at least its dry he had been nearly unconscious when they found the farm the family who owned the farm was sympathetic verna had refused the offer of their bed not wanting to force them to sleep in their own barn on her journey of over twentyodd years verna had often slept in such places and found the accommodations agreeable if a little rough she liked the smell of hay when she was on her journey she had thought she hated it but once returned to the cloistered life at the palace of the prophets she changed her opinion and found herself longing for the smell of hay dirt grass and rainclean air warren laid a gentle hand over hers verna im sorry im slowing us down so verna smiled she recalled a time when her impatient nature would have had her pacing and fretting warren and his love brought out a little of her calmer nature he was good for her he was everything to her she pushed back his curly blond hair and kissed his forehead nonsense we had to stop for the night anyway the rain would have made traveling slow and miserable a good rest will result in more progress in the end take my word ive had plenty of experience at such things but i feel souseless you are a prophet that provides us with information that is far from useless that in itself has saved us from traveling days in a wrong direction his troubled blue eyes turned to the rafters the headaches are coming more often with time i fear to think that when i close my eyes i may never come awake again she scowled for the first time that night ill not hear that sort of talk warren we will make it he hesitated not wanting to argue with her if you say so verna but im slowing us down more all the time ive taken care of that you have what have you done i hired us transportation for a ways at least verna you said you didnt want to hire a coach that it would draw attention to us you said you didnt want to risk being recognized and you didnt want nosy people inquiring as to who was riding a coach not a coach and i dont want to hear a string of objections i hired this farmer to take us south for a ways in his hay cart he said we could lay in the back and you could rest hell cover us with hay so we wont have to worry about people bothering us warren frowned why would he do this for us i paid him well more than that though he and his family are loyal to the light he respects the sisters of the light warren relaxed back into the hay well i guess that sounds good youre sure hes willing you didnt twist his nose did you he was going anyway really why verna sighed he has a sick daughter shes only twelve he wants to go to get some tonic for her suspicion darkened warrens expression why didnt you cure the girl verna held his gaze i tried i couldnt cure her she has a high fever shes cramping and vomiting i tried my best i would have given nearly anything to have been able to cure that poor child of her suffering but i couldnt any idea why not verna shook her head sadly the gift doesnt cure everything warren you know that if she had a broken bone i could help her if she had any number of ills i could help her but the gift is of limited use for fever warren looked away seems unfair they offer to help us and we can do next to nothing for them i know verna whispered she listened to the rain against the roof for a time i was able to ease the pain in her gut at least shell rest a little more comfortably good thats good at least warren fussed with a piece of straw have you been able to get in contact with prelate annalina has she left you a message in the journey book yet verna tried not to betray how troubled she was no she hasnt answered my messages nor has she sent one of her own shes probably busy she doesnt need to be bothered by our little problems well hear from her when she has time warren nodded verna blew out the lamp she snuggled up to him putting her forehead against his shoulder she rested her arm across his chest we best get some sleep at sunrise well be moving on i love you verna if i die in my sleep i want you to know that vernas fingers stroked the side of his face in answer clarissa rubbed the sleep from her eyes dawn was leaking in around the edges of the heavy dark green drapes she sat up in the bed she didnt think she had ever awakened feeling this good she reached over to tell nathan as much nathan wasnt with her clarissa sat up and swung her legs over the edge of the bed when she stretched her leg muscles protested they were sore from the nights activities she guessed it was simply the thought of the cause that made her smile at the mild ache she had never known that sore muscles could be so pleasant she stuffed her arms through the lovely pink robe nathan had bought for her she snugged the ruffles up around her neck and then tied the silk belt she wiggled her toes in the thick carpet luxuriating in the feeling nathan was at the writing desk bent over a letter he smiled up at her as she stood in the doorway sleep well clarissa halfclosed her eyes and sighed i should say so she grinned what sleep i got anyway nathan linked at her he dipped the pen in a bottle of blue ink and went back to his scratching clarissa strolled around behind him and put her hands on his shoulders he was wearing his trousers and nothing else with her thumbs she kneaded the muscles at the base of his neck he made an agreeable sound deep in his throat so she continued she liked to hear his sounds of pleasure and liked even more being their cause as her thumbs worked along the muscles of his shoulders she glanced down at what he was writing scanning the letter she saw that it was instructions about moving troops to places she had never heard of nathan wrote on admonishing a general about the bond to the lord rahl and the dire repercussion should he ignore it the tone of the letter was the same authoritative tone he used when he expected people to treat him as the man of importance that he was he signed the letter lord rahl clarissa bent and nuzzled his neck giving his ear a little nip nathan last night was beyond wonderful it was magic you were magnificent im the luckiest woman in the world he gave her a roguish grin magic yes there was some of that in it too im an old man i need to use what ive got she combed her fingers through his hair ordering it old man i dont think so nathan i hope i was half as pleasing to you as you were to me he laughed as he folded his letter i guess i did manage to keep up with you he slipped a hand inside her robe and pinched her bare bottom she jumped with a squeak it was one of the high points of my life to be with such a beautiful and loving woman she hugged his head to her breasts well were still alive no reason we cant reach for some more of those high points his sly smile grew as he put his hand back on her bare bottom and gave it a squeeze he had that lusty twinkle in his eye let me dispense with this bit of business and well see about getting our moneys worth out of that big bed with a diminutive copper spoon he scooped little nuggets of red wax from a tin and dumped the tiny spoonful on the folded letter nathan silly youre supposed to melt the sealing wax onto the letter one of his eyebrows arched you should know by now my dear that my way is better she let out a throaty laugh my mistake he twirled a finger over the nuggets of wax sparkles of light danced from his finger onto the lumps of wax they glowed briefly and then melted into a red puddle on the letter she gasped with delight nathan was one neverending little surprise after another she felt her cheeks warm as she remembered that his fingers were magic in more ways than one she bent and whispered intimately in his ear id like you and that magic finger of yours back in bed with me lord rahl nathan lifted his magic finger in proclamation and it shall be my dear just as soon as i send this letter on its way he again twirled the finger over the letter and it lifted off the desk as if of its own accord clarissas eyebrows rose in astonishment the letter floated in the air ahead of him as he walked to the door he twirled his other hand dramatically and the door glided open a soldier sitting on the floor in the hall leaning against the opposite wall rose to his feet he saluted with a fist to his heart nathan standing there in only his trousers with his white hair hanging down to his shoulders had the look of a wild man she knew he wasnt but standing there as tall as he was as commanding as he was she knew he must look that way to others people were afraid of nathan she could see it in their eyes she could understand their fear though she remembered how much she had feared him before she had come to know him she could hardly remember now just how much the sight of the towering prophet had terrified her when he turned those azure eyes on people and his hawklike brow lowered in displeasure she thought he could make a whole army turn and run nathan stretched his arm out and the letter floated to the grimfaced soldier you remember all my instructions dont you walsh the soldier snatched the letter out of the air and stuffed it inside his tunic this soldier though respectful didnt seem intimidated by nathan of course you know me better than that nathan nathan lost a bit of his lofty attitude and scratched his head i guess i do clarissa wondered where nathan had found the soldier and when he had had time to give him instructions she guessed he must have gone out while she was asleep this soldier looked to be somewhat different from most of the others she had seen he had a traveling cloak with leather packs at his belt and his clothes were of a higher quality than those of the regular soldiers she was getting used to seeing his sword was shorter too and his knife longer he was not a small man either he was as big as nathan but nathans bearing made him seem bigger than anyone to her give the letter to general reibisch nathan said and dont forget if any of those sisters start asking you questions you warn them about what i said and tell them that lord rahl ordered you to keep what you were told to yourself that will keep their jaws locked tight the soldier smiled knowingly i understand lord rahl nathan nodded good what about the others soldier walsh gestured vaguely bollesdun will be around to let you know what he finds out im pretty sure it was only jagangs expeditionary force but bollesdun will find out for sure large as it was it wasnt much compared to the main force i dont see any evidence that his main force down near grafan harbor has come north yet from what ive heard jagang is content to sit and wait for something i dont know what that something is but hes not rushing troops north into the new world he thrust the army i saw deep into the new world i still think it was just his expeditionary force jagang is a patient man it took him years to conquer and consolidate the old world under his rule he used much the same tactics sending out the expeditionary force to take a key city or capture information of one sort or another mostly records and books those men are brutal thats part of their purpose too but its the books theyre sent to get they would send back whatever they captured and wait to go wherever jagang sends them next bollesdun has some of our men checking into it but they have to be careful and it may take them awhile so just enjoy the wait nathan stroked his chin as he pondered yes i imagine jagang isnt eager to send his army into the new world yet he returned his gaze to walsh youd best be on your way walsh nodded his gaze shifted and his eyes met clarissas he looked back to nathan a small smile coming to his lips a man after my own heart nathan chuckled softly one of natures wonders matters of the heart the way nathan said the words made clarissas own heart swell with pride to be included in matters of his heart you be careful here in the rats nest eh nathan id not like to hear that you dont have eyes in the back of your head after all he patted his tunic where he had put the letter especially not after i deliver this i will lad you just be sure you get that letter delivered you have my word after nathan shut the door and business was finished he turned to her he had that twinkle in his eye that lusty twinkle his sly smile returned alone at last my dear clarissa squealed and ran for the bed in mock fright chapter what do you think is going on ann asked zedd stretched his head up to try to see it was hard to get much of a look past the wall of legs around them the nangtong spirit hunters jabbered orders which he couldnt understand but some of the spears pointing down from the circle surrounding them settled on his shoulders delivering an unequivocal message that he had better stay where he was he and ann sat crosslegged on the ground guarded by a ring of nangtong while others of them were sitting in conference a ways off with a party of si doak theyre too far away to hear clearly but even if we could hear them it probably wouldnt help much i only speak a few words of si doak ann plucked a long blade of grass and wound it around a finger she didnt glance over at zedd they didnt want to give their captors the idea that they were sane and capable of plotting ann let out a highpitched cackle just to keep up appearances what do you know about these si doak zedd flapped his arms like a bird about to take to wing i know they dont sacrifice people a guard thunked a spear shaft on zedds head as if to discourage him from any ideas of flying off zedd howled with laughter instead of cursing which he was longing to do ann glanced over out of the corner of her eye beginning to reconsider your attitude about letting these nangtong live as they wish zedd smiled if i wanted to let them live as they wish wed be in the spirit world by now just because you believe in letting wolves be that doesnt mean you have to let them eat your flock at will she grunted to concede the point off in the distance beside a slight rise the negotiations dragged on about ten of the nangtong and an equal number of the si doak sat crosslegged in a circle the nangtong counted out loud accompanied by exaggerated arm movements they pointed zedds way they made unintelligible but seemingly heartfelt speeches zedd leaned toward ann and whispered the si doak are peaceful enough as far as i know ive never heard of them making war or using force against neighbors even weaker neighbors but when it comes to matters of trade theyre ruthless most people in this part of the wilds would just as soon bargain with a wolf other peoples teach their young people to fight the si doak teach them to barter ann looked off in the other direction as if disinterested what makes them so good at it zedd glanced up at their guards they were all watching the bargaining and paying little attention to the helpless prisoners they have the rare ability to walk away from a deal others get their mind set on something and soon start settling for less just to have a deal the si doak wont do that theyll simply walk when need be theyll cut their losses without regret and move on to something else one of the si doak the one wearing a rabbit fur over his head slapped a pile of blankets in the center of the circle he pointed off to a small heard of goats and made an offer zedd understood to include two of the animals the offer seemed to incense the nangtong their chief negotiator leaped to his feet and stabbed his spear at the sky repeatedly apparently to express his outrage at the low price zedd noted that he didnt walk away there was honor involved the nangtong had that much invested zedd nudged ann he tilled his head back and howled like a coyote ann getting the message joined in they both yelped and bayed as loud as they could the negotiators fell silent as they all looked toward the prisoners the head nangtong negotiator sat back down a thunk on both their heads silenced zedd and ann talking resumed over at the bartering session a nangtong emissary was sent to have a better look at the goats zedd scratched his shoulder the dry mud was getting uncomfortable he guessed it was less uncomfortable than having his heart cut out or his head cut off or whatever it was the nangtong did to sacrifices im hungry he muttered they havent fed us all day its near to midafternoon and they havent fed us he barked at his captors to show his displeasure the negotiations halted for a moment while they once again looked toward the prisoners the si doak all folded their arms and remained silent as they stared at the nangtong the nangtong quickly resumed talking their tone changing becoming conciliatory chuckling interspersed their casual chatter the si doaks response was short and curt the one with the rabbit skin on his head gestured toward the afternoon sun and then off toward his home the nangtong man in charge pulled a blanket from the stack in the center and inspected it with grudging admiration he passed the blanket to his fellows they nodded with appreciation of its worth as if just discovering it the man sent to have a look at the goats returned with two he showed them off to his associates and they oohed and aahed as if realizing for the first time that these goats were much more impressive than they had at first thought and not at all the scraggly animals they had expected lo find the nangtong had apparently decided that no matter what they didnt want to return home with the prisoners any useful commodities were better than two crazy people they couldnt very well send the spirits two crazy people any exchange for them was better than nothing especially in view of the waning interest of the si doak the si doak remained stonefaced the nangtong had made a mistake they had betrayed their need to sell what they had there was nothing the si doak valued more than a motivated seller a price whatever it was zedd couldnt tell was suddenly agreed upon the head si doak and the head nangtong stood hooked arms at the elbows and turned around each other three times while so locked together when they parted both sides fell to happy chatter a bargain had been struck the nangtong started lifting blankets the goats were tethered the si doak headed for their prizes the guards thunked zedd and ann on the head as the si doak approached apparently in warning not to spoil the deal zedd had no intention of spoiling the deal the si doak didnt sacrifice people as far as he knew they were gentle people the worst punishment they dispensed to someone who committed a grievous wrong was banishment a banished si doak sometimes starved to death because he was so heartsick at being sent from the only home he knew a misbehaving child was set straight by everyone ignoring him for a day it was a horrifying punishment to a si doak child and resulted in best behavior for a good long time after of course zedd and ann werent members of the si doak community so it was entirely possible in fact probable that such treatment didnt extend to them zedd leaned toward ann and whispered i dont think these people would hurt us so keep that in mind if they decide not to take us the nangtong may just slit our throats rather than have to suffer the humiliation of having to return with two crazy people first you want me to play in the mud and now you want me to be a good little girl zedd smiled at her sarcasm just until our new keepers take us away from the old the si doak elder the one with the rabbit fur over his head squatted before his new acquisitions he reached out and felt zedds arm muscles he grunted disapprovingly he felt anns arms and made a sound as if pleased at what he found ann lifted an eyebrow to zedd seems im more agreeable to them than a skinny old man zedd smiled i think they find you better suited as a human oxen theyll give you the hard work her satisfied expression vanished what do you mean he shushed her another si doak squatted down beside the elder he had goat antlers fixed to his head he wore what had to be a hundred necklaces over his buckskin tunic the necklaces some hanging to his crotch others tight at his throat and the rest every length in between held teeth beads bones feathers pottery shards metal disks gold coins small leather pouches and carved amulets he was the si doak shaman the shaman took zedds hand and gently held his arm out he released it zedd let it drop the shaman chattered his disapproval zedd understood enough to gather that he was supposed to hold his arm up he didnt let on that he understood any of the words and instead let the shaman lift the arm out again and use a hand signal to indicate he meant zedd to hold it there while the nangtong guards still held spears on the two prisoners the shaman retrieved long coiled stalks of grass from one of the pouches at his waist he chanted as he wove the grass around zedds wrist when finished he wove the grass around zedds other wrist and then did the same to ann any idea what this is about she asked it binds our magic the nangtong need do nothing to render our magic useless but the si doak have to use some kind of magic of their own to suppress ours this shaman is a man of magic he has the gift hes something like the si doaks wizard zedd glanced at her out of the corner of his eye or maybe you could say hes like the sisters of the light with their collars like the collars we wont be able to get these wristbands off once they had the grass woven around their wrists the nangtong withdrew their weapons picked up their portion of the blankets collected their two goats and quickly made good their escape the elder the one with the rabbit skin on his head leaned toward zedd and spoke when zedd frowned and shrugged that he didnt understand the man added sign language seemingly invented on the spot he indicated chores to be done and time by showing the seasons digging at the ground and pretending to plant the heat of summer and the freezing of winter zedd couldnt understand a great deal of it but he understood enough he turned to ann i believe that these fellows here have purchased us out of our death sentence we are to be in servitude to them for a period of about two years to repay them for our cost plus a profit for their trouble weve been sold into slavery it would appear so but only for a couple of years quite generous of them actually considering that the nangtong were going to kill us maybe we could buy our way out to the si doak this is a personal debt we owe them and can only be repaid with personal servitude to their way of looking at it they have returned our lives to us and so we must use part of those lives to show our gratitude and to clean up after them clean up were to scrub floors to repay our debt i imagine theyll want us to cook carry things sew care for their animals those sorts of things as if to confirm what zedd had told her the si doak began pulling the thongs holding their waterskins off over their heads and passing them to zedd and ann what do they want ann asked him zedd lifted an eyebrow they want us to carry their water three more of the si doak appeared with the remaining blankets divided them and handed them to their new bearers do you mean to tell me ann growled that the first wizard of the midlands and the prelate of the sisters of the light have been sold into slavery for the price of some blankets and two goats with a shove from behind zedd staggered after the departing si doak i know what you mean he said over his shoulder for the first time i know of the si doak have overpaid zedd stumbled and dropped half his load of waterskins as he regained his balance he stepped on one that had snagged a thorny berry bush bending to retrieve the waterskins his stack of blankets toppled into the mud puddle created by the burst waterskin he put a knee to the ground to regain his balance as he gathered up the scattered waterskins his knee squashed the berries under the blanket oops he waved an apology to the si doak sorry the si doak leaped about in agitation demanding he pick everything up at once the man whose waterskin zedd had ripped open over a thorn bush pointed angrily at his damaged property while jabbering demands of recompense i said i was sorry zedd protested even though they couldnt understand him he bent to gather up the wet blankets he lifted one up high and held it out between his widespread arms inspecting it oh dear look at that well never get that stain out chapter lord rahl you have had a hard ride berdine said i think you should be resting we should go back so you can rest i mean the massive rampart lit by the mellow light of the low sun spread out before the three of them like a broad road he wanted to be out of the keep before dark not that the light of day would save him from dangerous magic but somehow being in the wizards keep after dark seemed worse raina leaned past him to speak it was your idea berdine my idea i never suggested any such thing quiet both of you richard murmured he was considering the feel of magic against his skin they had advanced halfway across the long rampart toward the first wizards private enclave before the distinct caress of magic began tingling against his flesh both mordsith had balked at its feel kahlan had told him about this place about the first wizards private enclave she said that she used to come up to this rampart because it provided a beautiful view of aydindril and indeed there was that but there was also the magic of powerful shields those shields kept everyone out of this small corner of the wizards keep kahlan had told him that in her life there had never been a wizard with enough power to pass these shields wizards had tried but failed the wizards living and working in the keep as kahlan was growing up simply didnt have the magic required to enter this part of it zedd was the first wizard no one had been in the first wizards enclave since before kahlan and richard were born when zedd had left the midlands kahlan had said that these shields exerted more magic as you got closer that they made your hair stand on end and made it difficult to breathe she had also said that if a person didnt have enough magic of their own just getting too close to the shields could be deadly richard didnt discount in the slightest what she had said but he had need to go in there kahlan had also said that to enter required placing your hand on the cold metal plate beside the door something no wizard she knew had ever been able to do richard had encountered shields like this one at the palace of the prophets ones passed by touching a metal plate but as far as he knew none of those were potentially deadly he had been able to pass those shields and he had been able to pass others in the keep that required magic only he possessed so he reasoned that he might be able to pass this one he needed to get in there berdine rubbed her arms distressed by the tingle of the magic are you sure you arent tired you rode all that way it wasnt that hard a ride richard said im not tired he was too worried to rest he had thought kahlan would be back by now he had been sure he would find her back home when he returned from mount kymermosst she should have been back by now but she wasnt he would wait only until morning i still dont think we should be doing this berdine muttered how is your foot i dont think you should be on it richard finally looked down at her she was pressed up against his left side raina was pressed to his right each held her agiel in her fist my foot is just fine thank you he shifted his body to force them away a bit to give himself breathing room i only need one of you no loss of face if you wish to remain here raina can go if you dont want to berdine scowled up at him i didnt say i wasnt going i said you shouldnt be doing it i have to it wasnt anywhere else it has to be here i was told that important things things not meant to be seen by just anyone were kept in the first wizards enclave berdine rolled her shoulders easing the tension in her muscles if you insist on going then im going too ill not let you walk in there without me raina he asked i dont need both of you do you want to wait here raina gave him a dark mordsith glare in answer all right then now listen to me i know that the shields here are dangerous but thats all i know about them they may not be like the others ive taken you through have to touch that metal plate down there on the wall i want you two to wait here while i go see if i have the proper magic to open the door if it opens then you both can come the rest of the way this isnt a trick is it raina asked you tricked us one other time to keep us out to keep us from going where there was danger mordsith are not afraid of danger the wind lifted his gold cloak no raina its not a trick this is important but i dont want either of you risking your lives needlessly if i can open the door then i promise to take you both with me satisfied both women nodded richard gave them each an appreciative squeeze on the shoulder he absently adjusted the metal bands on his wrists as he gazed at the towering bastion waiting at the end of the rampart a cold wind buffeted him as he started across he could feel the pressure of the shield like the weight of water when you swam toward the bottom of a pond the fine hairs at the back of his neck stiffened as he progressed the pressure made it difficult but not impossible to draw a breath as kahlan had said she had experienced six immense columns of variegated red stone stood to each side of the goldclad door holding up a protruding entablature of dark stone the architrave was decorated with brass plaques as richard approached it he recognized some of their symbols as the same ones on his wristbands belt and boot pins the frieze held round metal disks with other of the more circular symbols the more linear of symbols he wore were also carved into the stone of the cornice seeing the symbols he recognized reassured him even though he didnt know their meaning he wore these things by obligation duty and righthe was born to them that much he knew why he didnt know even if he wished it could be otherwise it wasnt he was a war wizard distracted by the uncomfortable pressure and tingling of the shields he reached the door almost before he realized it the door was at least twelve feet tall and a good four feet wide goldclad and embellished in the same symbolic motifs embossed in the center was the more prominent of the symbols he wore two rough triangles with a sinuous double line running around and through them richard rested his left hand on the hilt of his sword as he fingered the symbol with his other hand tracing its oval undulating outer margin with the act of touching it tracing it following its pattern he understood the spirits who had used the sword of truth before him passed their knowledge on to him as he used the sword but they didnt always convey that knowledge in words in the heat of combat there wasnt always time sometimes it came to him in images symbols these symbols this one on the door like the ones on his wristbands was a kind of dance used for fighting when outnumbered it conveyed a sense of the movements of the dance movements without form the dance with death it made sense he wore the outfit of a war wizard richard had learned from kolos journal that in kolos time the first wizard named baraccus had also been a war wizard as was richard these symbols had meaning to a war wizard much as a tailor painted shears on his window or a tavern sign had a mug on it or a blacksmith nailed up horseshoes or a weapons maker displayed knives these symbols were signs of his craft bringing death richard realized that his fear had vanished he stood in the wizards keep which had always before set his nerves on edge and worse stood now before the most restricted and protected place in the keep yet he felt calm he touched a starburst symbol on the door this symbol was an admonition keep your vision allinclusive never allowing it to lock on any one thing that was the meaning of the starburst symbol look everywhere at once see nothing to the exclusion of all elsedont allow the enemy to direct your vision or you will see what he wishes you to see he will then come at you as you become bewildered looking for his attack and you will lose instead your vision must open to all there is never settling even when cutting know your enemys moves by instinct not by waiting to see them to dance with death meant to know the enemys sword and its speed without waiting to see it dancing with death meant being one with the enemy without looking fixedly so that you could kill him dancing with death meant being committed to killing committed with your heart and soul dancing with death meant that you were the incarnation of death come to reap the living berdines voice drifted across the rampart lord rahl richard looked over his shoulder what whats wrong berdine shifted her weight to her other foot well are you all right youve been standing there for a long time staring at the door are you all right richard wiped a hand across his face yes im fine i was just just looking at the things written on the door thats all he turned and without thinking slapped his hand to the cold metal plate in the polished gray granite wall kahlan had told him it was said that to touch that metal plate was like touching the cold dead heart of the keeper himself the metal plate warmed the gold door silently swung inward dim light came from beyond richard took a careful step into the doorway like a wick on a lamp being slowly turned up the dim light coming from inside brightened he took another step and the light brightened more he scanned the inside as he motioned the two waiting mordsith forward whatever magic prevented people from approaching apparently was now withdrawn berdine and raina walked to him without any difficulty that wasnt so bad raina said i didnt feel anything so far so good richard said inside there were glass spheres about a handwidth in diameter set atop green marble pedestals against the wall to his left and right richard had seen glass spheres similar to these before down in the lower reaches of the keep like those these too provided light the inside of the first wizards enclave was an immense cavern of ornate stonework four columns of polished black marble at least ten feet in diameter formed a square that supported arches just beyond the outer edges of a central dome dotted by a high ring of windows between each pair of columns a wing ran off from the vast central chamber he noticed that much of the stonework repeated the palmleaf pattern that adorned the gold capitals atop the black marble columns the polish of the marble was so high that it reflected images like glass finely worked wroughtiron sconces decorated with the same palmleaf pattern held candles fluidly worked iron formed railings at the edge of the expansive sunken central floor this was not the sinister lair richard expected this was a place of grand splendor to match any he had seen the place was so beautiful that it left him awestricken the wing in which the three of them stood the entry hall appeared to be by far the smallest of the four wings sixfoottall white marble pedestals marched in a long double row beside the walkway laid with a long red carpet over a goldflecked dark brown marble floor richard wouldnt have been able to touch fingers were he to put his arms around one of the pedestals the ribbed barrel ceiling thirty feet overhead made the fat pedestals look miniscule sitting atop some of the pedestals were objects richard recognized ornate knives gems set in brooches or at the ends of goldworked chains a silver chalice filigree bowls and delicately worked boxes some sat on squares of cloth trimmed with gold or silver embroidery others on stands carved from buried wood other pedestals held contorted objects that made no sense to him he would have sworn that they changed shape when he looked at them he decided it would be best not to look directly at such things of magic and warned the other two the distant wing opposite them across the central area under the huge dome ended at a roundtopped window that had to be thirty feet tall before the window was a huge table piled with a clutter of objects glass jars bowls and coiled tubes a massive but simple iron candelabrum covered with ages of wax stacks of scrolls several human skulls and a chaos of smaller items richard couldnt make out from such a distance the floor all around the table was similarly cluttered along with things stacked up and leaning against the table the wing to the right was dark richard felt uncomfortable even looking in that direction he heeded the warning and looked to the left in that wing he saw books thousands of them there richard said as he gestured to the left thats what were here for remember what i told you dont touch anything he glanced at them both as they looked about with wide eyes i mean it i dont know how to save you if you get in trouble touching something in here both pairs of eyes looked back at him we remember berdine said we know better than to tempt magic raina said we re just looking around thats all we wouldnt touch anything good but i suggest that you dont even look at anything either except what we need to look at for all i know simply looking at something in here could trigger its magic do you think raina asked in astonishment what i think is that id rather not find out after its too late come on lets get this over with so we can get out of here oddly even though he had said the words and knew they made sense he didnt really feel like leaving as potentially dangerous as he knew the place to be he found that he liked the first wizards enclave berdine smirked lord rahl fears magic as much as we do youre wrong berdine i know a little about magic he started down the red carpet i fear it more ten broad steps at the end led down into the central area an expanse of creamcolored marble covered the floor a border of darker brown marble ran around the floor near the edge when richard reached the bottom step and his foot touched the floor it hummed and began to glow he quickly retreated back up onto the red carpet the glow extinguished what now raina asked he pried her fingers from his arm did either of you put your foot to the floor they both shook their heads try as richard waited on the step berdine gingerly tried to test the marble she withdrew her foot i cant something stops my foot before i can get it on the floor richard stepped out onto the marble again again it glowed and hummed it must be a shield then here take my hand and try again holding richards hand berdine was able to step onto the marble with him raina took his other hand and followed all right he said since its some kind of shield dont let go of my hand while were on this part we dont know what would happen for all i know if you let go of my hand you could fry like bacon on a griddle their grips on his hands tightened as they stepped onto the steps up to the wing with the books the floor went silent without richard to hold their hands on the way out they would be trapped inside this place unable to return across the central floor the wing with the books wasnt the kind of library he had expected there were rows of shelves but they were in disarray with books stacked every which way chunks of rock served as bookends for the few standing upright among the disorder here and there books were in piles as if someone had pulled them from the shelves and simply tossed them in a heap most were closed but a significant number lay open some faceup some facedown but that wasnt the biggest surprise everywhere it seemed there were books stacked up on the floor a few stacks were short maybe three or four feet tall but many more were tall pillars of books some of the irregular stacks lowered twelve or fourteen feet they looked as if the mere act of breathing could make them topple the columns of books were every where creating a maze richard couldnt fathom the reason for the books being stacked in such disarray but the mystery of it made him sweat richard took an arm of each woman my grandfather told me that there were books in the keep that were extremely dangerous kahlan told me that the most dangerous things were kept in here where no one could get to them not even the wizards she knew berdine shot him a look you mean you think that the books themselves could be dangerous not just the information in them but the actual books richard thought of the description of a book that sister amelia had used to start the plague im not sure but we had better treat them as such look but dont touch berdines brow drew down with a dubious frown lord rahl there must be thousands of books i can see just standing here there are bound to be more down the aisles it will take us weeks to find the one we wantif its even here richard took a deep breath berdine was right he hadnt expected to find so many books in here he thought the libraries held most of the books and there would only be a few in here if you want to be out of here before dark we dont have long raina said we might as well come back tomorrow and get an early start richard was beginning to feel intimidated by the task ahead well just have to stay after dark well stay all night if we have to raina rolled her agiel in her fingers if you say so lord rahl richards heart sank as he stood staring at the forest of books he needed information not a search for one leaf in a forest if only he could use magic to find that one leaf he idly adjusted the bands at his wrist under his fingers he felt the starburst pattern on one of them look without fixing your sight i have an idea he said wait here ill be right back richard returned to the pillars he went to one that held a crackledglass bowl upon a large square of black cloth what good is that going to do raina asked when he came back holding the cloth out for them theres too much to see im going to use this as a blindfold so i wont see all the things i dont want to see berdines face twisted with incredulity if youre blindfolded then how are you going to see the thing were looking for with magic im going to try to let my gift guide me sometimes it works that waythrough need all these books are too confusing if im blindfolded i wont see them and ill be able to feel the one im looking for at least thats what i hope raina gazed out over all the books well you are the lord rahl you have magic if it has a chance of getting us out of spending the night in here then i say do it richard placed the black cloth over his eyes and began tying its tails behind his head just guide me and keep me from touching anything dont forget what i said about you two not touching anything either dont worry about us lord rahl raina said were not about to touch anything when he finished tying the blindfold over his eyes richard turned his head this way and that testing to make sure that he couldnt see he rubbed a finger over the starburst on his wristband his world was pitchblack he sought the inner peace the inner calm where dwelled his gift if the plague was started by magic from the temple of the winds then maybe they had a chance to halt it if he did nothing then untold thousands of people were going to die he needed that book he thought about the boy he had watched die about the little girl lily who told him about the sister of the dark showing her the book that was how the plague started he knew it was that precious child had the tokens on her richard hadnt inquired but he knew that she at least would be dead by now he couldnt bear to inquire he needed that book he put a foot out nudge me with your fingers if im about to run into anything try not to talk but if you must dont be afraid to speak up he felt their fingers lightly touch his arm as he stepped forward they guided him with that touch keeping him from colliding with the towering stacks of books as he waded deeper into the maze richard didnt know what it was he should feel he didnt know if it was magic a hunch or his imagination guiding him by the way he seemed to he winding up and down aisles and snaking through the stacks he feared it was no more than his imagination he tried to ignore the things that kept his thoughts skipping about and running in every direction he tried to concentrate on the book and his need to find it thinking of the sick children he was able to focus better they needed him they were helpless richard felt himself jerk to a halt he wondered why he turned left when he expected that he was going to turn right it had to be the gift with that thought his thoughts scattered in every direction again he focused once more the two mordsith forcibly snatched his arm to halt him he understood another step and he would have collided with a stack wondering which way he would be turned he found himself squatting instead his arm lifted and he reached out careful berdine whispered its a big irregular stack be careful or youll knock it over richard nodded not wanting to distract himself by answering with words he was concentrating on feeling the object of his need he felt it near his fingers lightly brushed the books running down the stack touching the bindings of some and the pages of others because they were turned around the other way his fingers stopped on a binding this one he tapped the leather binding this one what does it say berdine propped a hand on his thigh to support herself as she leaned in its high dharan something about the temple of the windstagenricht osf fuer mosst verlaschendreckmch greschlechten temple of the winds inquisition and trial richard translated in a whisper weve found it chapter breathe the sliph said kahlan let go the silken essence and pulled a deep breath of the alien air the dim world of the sliphs well down in the keep whirled around her stone of the walls and floor finally settled in her vision the dome overhead seemed to slow its spinning something unexpected waited in the sliphs room tilled back in the chair with her feet propped up on the table sat a figure in red leather kahlan sat down dangling her feet over the edge of the stone wall to gather her senses the front legs of the chair thunked down well well the wandering mother confessor returns at last kahlan hopped down onto the floor she almost lost her footing with the way it seemed to twist and tilt cara what are you doing down here cara gripped kahlan under her arm you better sit down until you regain your feet im all right kahlan glanced over her shoulder to the silver face behind her thank you sliph do you wish to travel the sliphs haunting voice echoed off the walls and dome overhead for a long moment no ive had enough traveling for the time being im going to stay here when you wish to travel call me and we will travel you will be pleased i dont know about that kahlan muttered as the sliph seemed to melt back into her well shes a spooky companion to have down here cara said she invited me to travel with her too and then told me i didnt have the magic required she comes and stares at me with that eerie smile cara what are you doing down here cara leaned kahlan back against the sliphs well she gave kahlan the strangest look as she shook her head to herself when lord rahl read your letter it didnt take him long to figure out what you had done berdine told him how you had brought us here to look for that book on the trial record he came down here but the sliph wouldnt tell him where she had taken you lord rahl said that now that he knew the sliph was not sleeping as he had thought it wasnt safe to leave her alone he said that others like the sister and marlin could come through kahlan hadnt thought about that about another one of jagangs minions coming to aydindril through the sliph the sliph seemed to have no loyally she would travel with anyone who had the required price of magic so richard left you here he said he couldnt remain down here all the time to guard the sliph caras chin lifted with pride he said that a mordsith must guard the well at all times since we have the power to stop someone with magic the lord rahl has always used the mordsith to protect him against magic the wizards of old obviously had this same problem with the sliph and had left wizards like kolo down here to guard her kolo said that the enemy sometimes arrived suddenly by way of the sliph and that only the quick reactions of the one on guard had prevented disaster you mean he brought you down here and just left you no he searched for hours until he found a way without magic so we could get down here on our own he didnt want to have to bring each of us down here for our turn and he didnt want us trapped down here either we have to take shifts i dont like it because we should be close to lord rahl in order to guard him not this silver thing but i guess that we are guarding lord rahl by doing this so i agreed to it kahlan found her feet steady at last if we had known the sliph was awake and had been guarding her before then marlin wouldnt have been able to come to try to assassinate richard and the sister wouldnt have been able to start the plague kahlans chest constricted with a hot cutting pang of regret they could have prevented the whole thing all the awful things she had learned would not be threatening her people her world and her love the realization of the chance lost left her nauseous lord rahl also wanted us to wait until your return from the witch woman in case you needed help richard knew where i went the sliph wouldnt tell him but he said he knew anyway he said you went to the witch woman he knew and he didnt chase after me cara pulled her long blond braid over her shoulder i was surprised too i asked him why he wouldnt go after you he said that he loved you he did not own you really richard said that yes a smirk tightened caras lips you are training him well mother confessor i approve and then he kicked a chair i think he hurt his foot but he denies it so richard is angry with me cara rolled her eyes mother confessor this is richard we are talking about the man is fool in love with you he wouldnt be angry with you if you told him to marry nadine instead of you kahlan swallowed at the renewed twist of pain why would you say that cara frowned i only meant he could never be angry with you no matter what you were supposed to laugh not jump like i had poked you with my agiel mother confessor he loves you he is worried sick but he is not angry with you what about kicking the chair cara stroked her long blond braid and smirked again he claimed the chair gave him just cause i see kahlan couldnt seem to find pleasure in caras sense of humor how long have i been gone not quite two days and i expect you to tell me how you managed to slip past those dharan guards out there by the bridge it was snowing they didnt see me cara didnt look to believe it she was giving kahlan that odd look again and did you kill the witch woman no kahlan changed the subject what has richard been doing while i was gone well first he asked the sliph to take him to the temple of the winds but she said she didnt know that place and couldnt take him there so he rode to mount kymermosst he went there kahlan snatched caras arm what did he find nothing he said that there was nothing to find he said that if the temple of the winds was once there it is now gone kahlan released caras arm he went to mount kymermosst and hes back already you know lord rahl when he gets something in his head he charges after it the men who went with him said they rode hard they slept little and rode much of the night lord rahl expected you to return last night and wanted to be back for you when you did not return as expected he paced and fretted but still he did not go after you whenever he looked like he was about to change his mind he read your letter again and went back to pacing instead i guess my letter was a little strong kahlan said as she glanced down at the floor lord rahl showed it to me caras face was unreadable sometimes it is necessary to threaten men or they get to thinking that they are the ones who say what will be you dissuaded him of that idea with your threats i didnt threaten him kahlan thought that her tone sounded too much like a plea cara watched kahlans eyes for a moment you are probably right the chair must have given lord rahl cause as he said i did what i had to do richard would understand that i guess id better go explain it to him cara gestured behind to the door you just missed him he was here not long ago he came to see if i was back he must be worried sick berdine told him about the book you were searching for he came here and found it kahlan blinked in astonishment he found it but we looked it wasnt there how did he find it he went to a place he called the first wizards enclave and found it there kahlans jaw dropped he went in there he went into the first wizards enclave alone without me he shouldnt have gone there thats a dangerous place really cara folded her arms and of course you would never do anything so foolish as to get it in your head to go run off alone to a dangerous place maybe you should reprimand lord rahl for his impulsive behavior since you are so prudent and above such reckless conduct yourself the echo of caras voice lingered uncomfortably before it died out kahlan understood even though richard did as she had asked by not coming after her cara had tried even though she didnt like magic cara had tried to go to protect kahlan cara she said in a meek voice im sorry i tricked you too cara shrugged but still showed no emotion i am just a guard you have no obligation to me yes i do you are not just a guard you may be our protector but you are more i consider you my friend you are a sister of the agiel i should have told you what i was doing but i feared that if i did richard would be angry with you for not stopping me i didnt want that cara said nothing still she showed no emotion kahlan breached the uncomfortable silence cara im sorry i guess i was afraid you would try to stop me i tricked you youre a sister of the agiel i should have trusted you and taken you into my confidence please cara i was wrong i beg you forgive me a smile finally spread on caras face we are sisters of the agiel i forgive you kahlan managed a small smile do you think richard will be as understanding as you cara let out an amused grunt well you have better ways to persuade him to forgive you it is not so difficult to melt a mans frown i only wish i had good news so i could bring a smile to his face but i dont she paused at the doorway what has nadine been up to while ive been gone well ive been down here guarding the sliph much of the time but from what ive seen she has been giving the staff herbs to try to protect them and to use in smoking the palace its a good thing the place is made mostly of stone or it would have been burned down by now she has been conferring with drefan and helping him in talking to the staff and others who come for advice lord rahl asked her to go out to visit herb sellers and such to make sure they are not hucksters out to swindle people who are in fear for their lives the city seems to be sprouting shameless mountebanks the way the sudden warmth seems to be bringing green grass nadine also gives reports to lord rahl but he has been gone much of the time and as busy as she seems to be trying to help people the visits since he returned are short kahlan tapped the side of her fist against the doorway thanks cara she looked into the others blue eyes there are rats down here are you all right there are worse things than rats indeed there are kahlan whispered chapter it was late and with the dark people on the streets didnt recognize her without her usual escort of guards they had no reason to give her a second look no reason to suspect she was the mother confessor out among them just as well there were some people who wished the mother confessor harm mostly people kept their distance from her as they did with everyone else hoping to keep the plague from themselves as cara had said there were hucksters everywhere hawking potions to ward off the plague or to cure your loved ones already stricken others strolled the streets with trays held up on straps over their shoulders neatly laid out with amulets possessing magic to protect against the plague kahlan remembered seeing some of these same people not long ago selling the same amulets as magic to find a husband or wife or to enthrall an unfaithful spouse old women with small carts or simple wooden stands sold carved spellinvested plaques made to hang over the door to a home as a sure way to keep the plague from entering the house as late as it was business seemed brisk even the vendors selling meats and produce extolled the healthful virtues of their goods and their value in promoting continued health if eaten regularly of course kahlan would send the soldiers out to put a stop to some of these swindlers but she knew that such intervention would likely be viewed with hostility on the part of the buyers if she tried to use the army to stop such foolish practices desperate people would concoct theories about those in power wanting to stop the cures so that the decent working folk would get the plague despite common sense or evidence to the contrary many people believed that those in power were always scheming to harm them if they only knew the truth if kahlan were to order the sale of these items stopped the cures would be sold in secret and for a higher price no matter how insupportable the claims of these cures their benefits would be vehemently supported as selfevident truth wizards first rule people would believe any lie either because they wanted to believe it was true or because they feared it was these people were desperate and would become more so yet many wanted to believe kahlan tried to imagine what she would do if richard had the plague would she be despairing enough to put her faith in such trickery hoping against hope that it would save him sometimes hope was all people had groundless as it was she couldnt take that hope away from them it was all they had and all they could do it was up to kahlan and richard to do that which would help these people as she made her way through the familiar splendor of the confessors palace on her way to find richard kahlan paused at the open double doors to a large room used for formal receptions the room was a calming blue color with dark blue drapes over the tall narrow windows the granite floor had a starburst pattern of darker and lighter stone radiating out from the center lamps on cherrywood stands around the edge of the room lent a mellow light to the gathering hall the table where small foods were sometimes set out for guests now held only an array of candles kahlans attention had been drawn by the sound of drefans voice he stood to the right before the table with the candles speaking to perhaps fifty or sixty people they sat crosslegged on the floor before him listening with rapt attention as he spoke of the way of health of keeping the body sound by being in touch with the inner self most of the people nodded absently as they listened to drefan explaining how by defiling their bodies with unhealthy thoughts and actions people opened the pathway for sickness to enter he told them that the creator had endowed them with the ability to fight off things such as the plague if only they would do as nature provided by eating the right foods that would strengthen the auras that defended the body and by using inner reflection to direct the vigor of various energy fields to their proper function in harmony with the whole many of the things he said made sense not eating foods that you knew gave you headaches because it interfered with the minds ability to regulate the body not eating foods that you knew caused pains and cramps in the gut because it interfered with the bodys ability to digest the good foods you needed not eating heavy meals right before sleeping because it interfered with your body getting the rest it needed to remain strong and how all of these things disrupt the auras that give us strength and protect health people marveled openly that drefan could make it all so simple for them to understand they spoke as if they had been blind and now for the first time had vision they watched with unblinking eyes as he went on telling them that we had within us the power to control our own bodies and that disease could only afflict us if we allowed it to he spoke of herbs and foods that purged poisons from the body and left people truly healthy for perhaps the first time since their birth these people werent listening to lord rahls brother they were listening to drefan rahl high priest of the raugmoss as one they followed the high priests instructions when he told them to close their eyes and draw the breath of life and healthy steams through their noses and down into their inner core by using the muscles low in their bellies he explained how to let it reach deep into the source of the power of each persons unique aura to draw out the poisons from the furthest darkest coiners of their beings and expel it out through the mouth to be replaced with a renewing breath of life drawn in again through the nose better kahlan guessed that these people would come to drefan for advice that might help them and at least sounded like it could do no harm than spend their savings on false hope from the hucksters in the street paying attention to their bodys needs with things like proper food and rest seemed sound advice as they all drew the slow deep breaths in through their noses drefan turned his head and locked his darken rahl eyes on kahlan as if he had known all along that she had been standing there outside the doorway he gave her a kindhearted smile that sparkled benevolently in his blue eyes she could see why these people put their trust in him she made herself return a little smile kahlan remembered the talk she had had with shota about how difficult it was to banish unpleasant memories kahlan wished she could forget drefans hand between caras legs drefan was trying to help people he was doing everything he could to halt the plague he was a great healerthe high priest of the raugmoss she tried to put the image of him comforting those sick children in place of the memory of his forcing his big hand down between caras legs drefan had explained at the time why he had done that to cara he had saved caras life a mordsith screaming in pain then unconscious and drefan had brought her back richard found comfort in drefan as did everyone else kahlan broke eye contact with him and continued on her way to find richard tristan bashkar the jarian ambassador staying at the confessors palace while he waited for further signs from the stars further word from above before surrendering paused at a balcony as she passed below as was his habit he drew back his coat and rested his hand on his hip it displayed the wicked dagger he wore at his belt oftentimes in conversation he would also put a boot up on a chair or stool and casually rest his forearm on his knee it provided those in conversation with him the opportunity to see also the knife he kept in his boot the more she saw tristan in the palace watching her with his cunning eyes the more she disliked his presence if there was a man who acted more childish kahlan didnt know him tristan watched silently as she hurried on her way kahlan was glad he was up on a balcony so that she wouldnt have to waste time playing word games with him ulic and egan gave kahlan an odd look as she greeted them before whisking through the door to the small room richard liked to use to study kolos journal he was sitting with his head in his hands his fingers buried in his hair as he read from another book that lay open on the table two candles and a lamp on the table beside him provided light and a small fragrant fire of birch logs added warmth to the cozy room his cloak lay over a nearby chair but he wore his sword richard looked up when he saw her he shot to his feet without the gold cloak he was like a big black shadow gliding across the room before he could speak kahlan rushed into his arms kahlan pressed the side of her face to his chest as she hugged him please richard dont yell at me please just hold me tears choked her voice please dont say anythingjust hold me it was ecstasy being with him again it never failed to astound her whenever she saw him just how much she needed and loved him richards arms enclosed her in comforting shelter she listened to the fire crackle and the sound of his heart under her ear she could almost imagine in the safety of his strong arms that everything was fine and that they had a future she remembered her mothers words confessors dont have love kahlan they have duty kahlan clutched his black shirt as she fought a losing battle to hold back tears he held her and stroked her hair she had asked him to hold her and not speak and he was doing just that that only made her feel worse he must have questions he must want to say something to her to tell her how relieved he was to see her sate to tell her how worried he had been to ask her where she had been and what she had found out to tell her what he had found to yell at her but he didnt instead without protest he did as she had asked relegating his own desires to secondary after hers how would she go on without his love how would she draw a breath how would she manage to make herself go on until she was old and could finally finish her duty and at last die richard im so sorry i made that letter sound threatening i didnt mean to threaten you i swear i just wanted you to be safe im so sorry if i hurt you he squeezed her a little tighter and kissed the top of her head kahlan wished she could just die in his arms now and not have to face her duty not have to face the finality of the future the finality of losing him hows your foot she asked my foot cara said you hurt it on a chair oh my foot is fine the chair died but i dont think it suffered against all odds kahlan laughed she looked up through her tears into his gentle smile all right i think your hug has revived me you can yell at me now he kissed her instead the feeling of being pulled up in his arms was rapture being in the sliph didnt even come close so he finally said what did our ancestors spirits have to say our ancestors how did you know that i went to the mud people richards brow curved into a bewildered cast kahlan your face is all painted so the ancestors spirits could see you in a gathering did you think i wouldnt notice kahlan touched her fingers to her forehead to her cheek i was in such a hurry i never even gave it any thought no wonder people have been giving me such odd looks as she had raced through the palace looking for him three different women on the staff had offered to draw her a bath everyone must have thought she had gone mad richards expression turned serious as he settled his arms around her waist so what did the ancestors spirits have to say kahlan steeled herself she tilted her head indicating the bone knife on her arm grandfathers spirit called me through his bone knife he had to speak with me he told me that the plague isnt confined to aydindril its spread all over the midlands richard tensed do you think its true elder breginderin had the tokens on his legs hes probably dead by now some children reported that they saw a woman near the mud peoples village she showed them something with colored light just like what lily told us she saw one of those children has already died sister amelia was there dear spirits richard whispered it gets worse the spirit showed me other places i know in the midlands he said that the plague has spread to all these places too the spirit showed me what will be if the plague isnt stopped death will sweep the land few will survive the spirit told me that magic stolen from the temple of the winds started the plague but that the plague itself isnt magic jagang has used magic more powerful than he understands if allowed to rage unchecked the plague could eventually sweep into the old world too small consolation did the spirit say how jagang stole this magic from the temple of the winds kahlan nodded as she looked away from his eyes you were right about the red moons it was a warning that the temple of the winds had been violated kahlan told him about the hall of the betrayer and how sister amelia had been able to tread that path kahlan recounted the rest of her meeting with the spirit of chandalens grandfather as best as she could remember it including the part about the temple being at least partially sentient as richard had suspected richard leaned an arm against the mantel as he stared into the fire he pinched his lower lip as he listened patiently kahlan told him how the spirit had told her that to stop the plague they must get into the temple of the winds how it existed in both worlds at the same time and how both the good and the evil spirits were involved and had a say in this and the ancestors spirit could give you no indication how we were to get to the temple of the winds no kahlan said in fact he wasnt interested in that part of it he said that the temple would reveal what must be done shota said the same thing engrossed in thought richard nodded while he considered her words kahlan twisted her fingers together while she waited what about shota he asked at last what happened with her kahlan hesitated she knew she had to tell him at least some of it but she was reluctant to tell him all of what shota had said richard i dont believe shota was trying to cause trouble he looked back over his shoulder she sends nadine to marry me and you dont think that kind of interference trouble kahlan cleared her throat into her fist shota didnt send nadine exactly richards hawklike gaze continued to fix on her so she went on the message about the winds hunting you was not her idea the temple of the winds was sending you a message through her just as it was sending you a message through that boy who died shota wasnt trying to harm us richards brow lowered what else did the witch woman tell you kahlan interlocked her fingers behind her back she looked away from his penetrating glare richard i went there to put an end to shotas interference i was prepared to kill her if she threatened you or tried to harm me i thought the worst of her i did i was convinced she was trying to harm us i talked with her really talked shota isnt as malicious as i thought she admitted she doesnt want us to have a child but this isnt about trying to keep us apart she has a talent for seeing the future and she is only telling us what she sees to try to help you shes just the messenger in this shes not directing these events she said the same thing as the ancestors spirit that the plague was started by magic and not of its own accord with three strides richard closed the distance between them he seized her by the upper arm she sent nadine to marry me she sent nadine to keep us apart shes trying to put a wedge between us and you are taken in by her tricks kahlan backed away from him no richard you have it wrong as did the spirits sent you a bride shota was only able to influence who it would be she used that influence so that the bride sent would be nadine shota says she sees that you will marry this bride sent by the spirits and so she wanted it to be someone you knew she was only trying to ease your pain in this and you believe her have you lost your mind richard youre hurting my arm he released her sorry he muttered as he withdrew to the hearth kahlan could see the muscles in his jaw flexing as he ground his teeth you said she told you the same as the ancestors spirit do you remember her words kahlan tried frantically to separate what she knew she had to tell him from what she didnt want him to know she realized how unwise it was to try to hide information from richard but she reasoned that if she had to she could always tell him everything if she could get away with withholding some of it though shota said we have not heard the last message from the winds she said we will receive one more involving the moon involving the moon how i dont know just like the spirit the how didnt seem to be important to her what she did say was that this message from the moon will be the consequential communion as she called it she said we must not ignore or dismiss it did she now and did she say why exactly she said our futureand the future of all those innocent peoplewill hinge on this event she said it would be our only chance to carry out our duty to save the innocent lives of all those who depend upon us to do what they cannot richard turned to her it was like death itself rounding on her his eyes had that look like drefans like darken rahls she told you something else that youre holding back what is it he growled it wasnt richard speaking it was the seeker she knew in that instant why a seeker was so feared he was a law unto himself those gray eyes were looking right into her richard she whispered please leave it at that his glare cut to her soul what did she tell you kahlan swallowed as she panted with dread she could feel hot tears coursing down her face shota saw the future kahlan heard herself speaking even though she had intended to remain silent she saw that you will wed another she used her influence to make it someone you knew under his glare she found remaining silent impossible she could not influence who i am to wed i will be married too it will not be you who becomes my husband richard stood frozen for a moment a boiling thunderhead gathering he yanked the baldric off over his head and tossed it and the scabbard holding the sword on a chair richard what are you doing and then he was moving he went for the door kahlan put herself in front of him it was like stepping in front of an enraged mountain richard what are you going to do he grasped her by the waist picked her up and set her aside as if she were no more than a child in his way im going to kill her kahlan threw her arms around his waist from behind trying to drag him to a halt it slowed him no more than if she had been a gnat he was leaving his sword because he couldnt travel in the sliph with the magic of the sword of truth richard richard please stop if you love me stop he halted and turned his wrathful glare on her his voice came like a crack of thunder what richard do you think im stupid of course not then do you believe i want to marry someone else no richard you have to listen to me shota said she saw the future she isnt making the future she just saw it she told me these things so that what she saw might help us ive had all of the help from shota i intend to have ill have no more of it she has taken one liberty too many it will be her last richard we have to figure out what to do we have to do what we can to stop this plague you saw those sick dying children the spirit of chandalens grandfather showed me countless other dead childrendead people of all sorts that will be the future if you do this do you want those children and their parents to die because you refuse to use your head his fist was gripping some sort of ornament on an elaborate necklace she realized she had never seen it before even though he wasnt wearing his sword its magic drove him he was a cauldron of lethal rage death was dancing in his eyes i dont care what shota says ill not marry nadine nor will i stand by while you i know she whispered richard i know how you feel how do you think this makes me feel but use your head this is not the way to change what shota says you always said before that the future is not yet decided and that we couldnt act on what shota says you always said that we couldnt allow ourselves to put our faith in what she says and let it direct our actions his eyes shone with deadly wrath you believe her kahlan took a calming breath trying to regain her composure i believe she saw the future richard dont you remember how she also said that i would touch you with my power look at how that turned out she was right but it wasnt the calamitous event i feared it was what brought us together and allowed us to have our love how can your marrying someone else turn out good kahlan abruptly realized what this was really about he was jealous she had never seen him this jealous before but thats what it wasa jealous rage i would be lying if i told you i knew kahlan gripped his broad shoulders richard i love you and thats the truth i could never love anyone else you believe me dont you i trust in your love for me and i know that you dont love nadine dont you believe in me dont you trust me he visibly cooled of course i do i do trust you frustration replaced the rage in his eyes he released the amulet in his fist but but nothing we love each other and thats all there is to it whatever happens we have to believe in each other if we dont believe in each other then we are lost in this at last he pulled her into his arms she knew his anguish she felt it too hers though was worse because she didnt believe there was a way out of shotas prediction kahlan lifted the strange amulet at his neck in the center surrounded by a complex of gold and silver lines was a teardropshaped ruby as big as her thumbnail richard what is this where did you get it he lifted the gold and silver object from her fingers to peer down at it its a symbol like the others i wear i found it in the keep in the first wizards enclave yes it was part of this outfit but unlike the rest of it this was left in the first wizards enclave the man who wore it was the first wizard in kolos time his name was baraccus cara told me that you found the record of the trial what did it look like in there richard stared off it was beautiful i didnt want to leave have you found out anything from the book yet no its in high dharan berdine is working on kolos journal ill work on this one ive only had an hour or so to start translating it i havent really done much yet i was too worried about you to be able to think about anything else kahlan touched the amulet hanging around his neck do you know what this symbol represents yes the ruby is meant to represent a drop of blood it is the symbolic representation of the way of the primary edict the primary edict his voice turned distant as if speaking to himself more than to her it means only one thing and everything cut once committed to fight cut everything else is secondary cut that is your duty your purpose your hunger there is no rule more important no commitment that overrides that one cut his words chilled her to the bone as he went on the lines are a portrayal of the dance cut from the void not from bewilderment cut the enemy as quickly and directly as possible cut with certainty cut decisively resolutely cut into his strength flow through the gaps in his guard cut him cut him down utterly dont allow him a breath crush him cut him without mercy to the depths of his spirit it is the balance to life death it is the dance with death it is the law a war wizard lives by or he dies chapter clarissa sat curled up in a chair sewing the hem of a new dress nathan had bought for her he had wanted to let the seamstress do the work but she had insisted on doing it herself mostly to have something to do nathan had smiled and told her that if it would please her then it was all right with him she didnt know what she would do with all the dresses he kept buying for her she had told him to stop but he just kept doing it nathan returned from the door having had a long discussion with a soldier named bollesdun about the movements of jagangs expeditionary force they were the men who had attacked her home of renwold clarissa had learned she tried not to listen to nathans talks with his soldier friends who showed up from time to time she didnt like to think about the nightmare of renwold nathan told her that he wanted to end the killing so there would be no more renwolds he called it a waste of life clarissa touched nathans leg when he came close is there anything i can do to help his blue eyes turned toward her watching her for a long moment no not yet i must write a letter im expecting someone soon dont go into the bedroom to answer the door when they come stay in here i dont want them to get a look at you you dont have magic so they wont know youre in here clarissa caught the tone of disquiet in his voice do you think they will cause trouble they wont try to hurt you will they a sly smile took his face that would be the last mistake they ever made ive laid so many traps around this place that the keeper himself wouldnt dare to try to take me here he winked at her as if to reassure her watch through the keyhole if you wish it may be good for you to remember the faces of these people theyre dangerous her stomach churning with anxiety clarissa began embroidering little vines and leaves along the hem of the dress because she thought they would be pretty and to pass the time while nathan wrote his letter when he finished he clasped his hands behind his back and paced when the knock finally came he looked toward the bedroom where stood the door to the hall he turned to her and crossed his lips with a finger clarissa nodded he shut the door to the sitting room as he went to answer the knock she set aside her needlework and knelt at the door to peek through the keyhole she had a good view of the hall door as nathan pulled it open two attractive women about clarissas age stood in the hall two young men waited behind them the scowls on the women could have cut stone clarissa was astonished to see that each woman had a small gold ring through her lower lip as did clarissa well well one of the women said contemptuously if it isnt the prophet himself we thought it was probably you nathan messing about in things that arent your business nathan grinned as he bowed dramatically from the waist sister jodelle sister willamina how nice to see you again and thats lord rahl even to you sister jodelle lord rahl sister jodelle said in a flat mocking voice so weve heard nathan waggled his fingers in greeting to the two young men standing out in the hall behind the two women vincent pierce how good to see you two boy wizards again still trying to master prophecy are you come for some advice maybe a lesson in a little over your head arent you old man one of the young men asked nathans amusement vanished he flicked his finger the young man cried out and dropped to the floor i told you pierce its lord rahl nathans voice turned as deadly as clarissa had ever heard it dont test me again sister willamina scowled back at pierce whispering a harsh admonishment as he staggered to his feet nathan held his arm out in invitation wont you ladies please come in bring your boys too clarissa didnt think they really looked like boys as nathan called them she thought they looked to be in their late twenties at least the four warily stepped inside and stood in a bunch hands clasped before them while nathan shut the door pretty risky na lord rahl to let the four of us get this close sister jodelle said i wouldnt think you would be this careless now that youve somehow convinced some feebleminded sister to take pity on you and remove your radahan nathan slapped his knee and howled with laughter none of the other four so much as cracked a smile risky he asked as his fit of laughter died out why what have i to fear from the likes of you four and ill have you know that i took off the radahan by myself i think it only fair to tell you that while you foolishly chose to view me as a crazy old man i was studying things you cant even fathom while all of you sisters get to the point sister jodelle growled nathan held up a finger the point is my fine people that i have no ill will toward you or your leader but i can weave webs you couldnt even understand much less defend against should you wish me harm for example im sure you detect the simple shields ive placed here and there but there is more hidden beyond those things you sense should you sister jodelle lost her patience and cut him off again we didnt come here to listen to the babble of a doddering old man do you think us stupid we detected the pathetic magic you have so proudly laced about this place and i can tell you with confidence theres not a bit of it that one of us alone couldnt slice apart with ease while at the same time enjoying a bowl of soup vincent shoved the two sisters aside ive heard just about enough from this driedup old jackass he always was full of himself its about time he learned just who hes dealing with nathan made no move to defend himself as vincent lifted his hands clarissas eyes went wide in fright as the young mans fingers curled and his face twisted with hate clarissa covered her mouth in terror as light shot from vincents hands toward nathan a brief whine sang through the air the light from the young man scattered there was a thump that clarissa could feel in the floor as light flared through the other room when the sound and light cleared vincent was gone on the floor where he had stood clarissa could see a small pile of white ash nathan went to the wall and retrieved a broom leaned there just behind a curtain he opened the door and swept the ash out through the door into the hall thank you for coming vincent sorry you have to leave now let me show you out with a flourish nathan swept the last of the ash out into the hall creating a small cloud as he did so he shut the door and turned back to the gaping gazes of the three people left now as i was saying you will be making the last mistake of your lives if you underestimate me or what it is you think me capable of your negligible intellects couldnt even understand it if i showed it to you nathans brow drew down in a way that frightened even clarissa now show proper respect and bow to the lord rahl reluctantly the three people bowed each touching a knee to the floor what is it you want sister jodelle asked after she had straightened her voice had lost some of its edge you can tell jagang that im interested in peace peace sister jodelle fussed back some of her dark hair what position are you in that you could make such an offer nathan lifted his chin i am lord rahl i will soon be master of dhara i will be in command of the new world i believe it is a war with the new world in which jagang is embroiled sister jodelles eyes narrowed what do you mean you are soon to be the master of dhara just tell jagang that his daring plan is about to be successfully completed he will soon have eliminated the present lord rahl jagang has made a mistake though he forgot about me but but sister jodelle sputtered you arent the lord rahl nathan leaned toward them with a sly smile if jagang succeeds which as a prophet i can foresee he will then i will be the lord rahl i am a rahl born with the gift all dharans will become bonded to me as you know that bond will prevent the dream walker from using his talent to take the new world jagang has made a mistake nathan thunked pierce on the head hes been using amateur prophets like this witless tadpole pierce turned red im no amateur prophet nathan regarded him with a look of contempt really then why didnt you warn jagang that by using prophecy to eliminate richard rahl it would get him nowhere but into a worse predicament because it would leave me to become the lord rahl master of dhara and most of the major powers in the new world did you warn him about that result while richard may be determined he knows next to nothing about magic whereas i know a great deal about it a very great deal nathan lowered over pierce just ask vincent a real prophet would have realized the danger lurking behind my simple shields waiting to be triggered if anyone attacked did you sister willamina put out an arm forcing pierce back and just in time it appeared to clarissa as nathan looked to be about to make another pile of white dust what is it you want lord rahl she asked jagang can either listen to my terms or he can have really big trouble on his hands trouble a lot worse than richard rahl terms sister jodelle drew the word out suspiciously the present lord rahl is young and idealistic he would never surrender to jagang i on the other hand am older and wiser i know the foolishness of a war that would take the lives of countless people and to what purpose just for the right to put a name to the one who is the leader richard is a young fool who doesnt know how to use his power i am not a young fool and as you saw i know how to use my gift im willing to entertain the possibility of letting jagang rule the new world as he wishes and in return nathan casually flicked his hand i simply want some of the spoils for myself in return for my assistance i will have the rule of dhara under his leadership of course i will be his man running the affairs of dhara other than jagang no one will outrank me quite fair i think the young pierce was still white as a sheet and trying to look invisible behind the two women the two sisters on the other hand were looking suddenly a lot less unhappy they wore small interested smiles how would jagang know that you could be trusted trusted does he think im as stupid as the young lord rahl leading the new world right now i saw what was done to renwold if i didnt rule dhara as jagang wished allowing him generous tribute he might come in and try to crush us wars are expensive id rather have the wealth for myself sister jodelle smiled politely and in the meantime how do we know you really mean this so its assurance you want nathan rubbed his chin as he stared up at the ceiling there is a dharan army of close to a hundred thousand men north of here youll never find them without my help until they descend on jagangs expeditionary force when jagang finishes eliminating the present lord rahl then this armys bond will transfer to me they will be loyal to me as soon as that happens i will surrender that army to his giving him even more men at arms dharans have a long tradition of warring for plunder theyll fit right in with jagangs force surrender an army sister jodelle said in a reflective tone you see my kind sisters jagang is trying to use prophecy to win this war in that he has made a mistake he is using wizards who are not real prophets i could provide the expert service of a real prophet his alternative is to have a real prophet as his enemy and amateurs to aid him the aid of amateurs is what got him into this predicament dont you see for a small insignificant slice of the spoils i can get him out of it im sure you can understand that after all those years under the care of you fine sisters id like to spend my few remaining years enjoying the pleasures of life with my help there will be no more resistance from the new world than that offered by renwold if jagang should choose to be unreasonable well who knows with a real prophet on the side of the new world they might even win sister jodelle studied nathans eyes yes i see what you mean nathan held out his letter here give this to jagang it explains my proposal and terms in return for my surrender of the new world as i said im sure he will find me much more reasonable than the present lord rahl i know that there is no profit in war one leader or another it means little why should hundreds of thousands of people die over the name put to that leader both sisters glanced around the luxurious room and smiled conspiratorially at nathan why you crafty old man sister jodelle said and here all this time we thought you were just an old fool living out your life down in your apartments well lord rahl we will pass your words along to emperor jagang i think he will find them most interesting had the present lord rahl been so reasonable he wouldnt be in his present fatal difficulties all those years do give a man time to think sister jodelle turned back from the door i cant speak for the emperor lord rahl but i think he will be most pleased with this news i think we can dare to see the end to this war and the victory that will result in jagang being the name put to the leader of all people i just want the killing to stop it would profit us all sister oh and tell jagang that i am sorry about vincent but the boy wasnt really serving him well anyway sister jodelle shrugged youre right lord rahl he wasnt chapter richard ran his fingers through his hair as he rested his forehead in his palms he looked up when he heard someone enter the room it was kahlan his heart lifted at her smile her bright green eyes the lush fall of her thick hair at how beautiful she was he marveled at her beauty and that she loved him the safety he felt in that love was something he had never imagined he would feel he had always imagined being in love with someone but he had never imagined the feeling of security and peace it would bring to his soul if shota ever did anything to harm that security kahlan carried a steaming bowl of soup i thought you might like something to eat youve been at this for a hand of days now i think you need to get more sleep too he glanced at the big white bowl in her hands thanks her brow wrinkled richard whats wrong your face is white as ashes he leaned back in his chair and sighed i feel a little sick she turned white as ashes too sick richard it isnt no its not that its this book on the temple of the winds inquisition and trial i almost wish id never found it kahlan leaned over as she set down the bowl here eat some of this what is it richard asked as he watched the lush curve of her cleavage rise and fall above the square neckline of her white confessors dress lentil porridge eat some what have you found out richard sucked in through his mouth to cool the spoonful of porridge i havent translated much yet its taking forever but from just the little bit ive been able to figure out these people these wizards they they executed all the wizards who sent away the temple of the winds the temple team they called them almost a hundred men he pulled a finger across his throat kahlan sat on the edge of the table opposite him what did they do to warrant death richard stirred the porridge well for one thing they left a way into the temple of the winds as they were directed to do but they made it so hard to get back into the temple that when these people wanted to get back in to retrieve some magic in order to fight the war they couldnt kolo said that there were the red moons that the temple sent the warning you mean the wizards of old were never able to answer the warning that wasnt the way it worked they did get back in he waved his spoon for emphasis in fact that was the reason for the red moon it was the second attempt to get in to answer the red moons caused by the first person sent that they failed at kahlan leaned toward him while richard ate a spoonful of porridge but this first person got in oh yes he got in in that was the problem kahlan shook her head im not following this richard set down his spoon and leaned back in his chair he met her gaze the temple team who sent away the temple of the winds were also the ones who placed the magic in it you know about some of the terrible magical creations that were made in the war things made out of people like the mriswith like the dream walkers well the people of the new world were fighting the people of the old world who wanted to eliminate magic much as jagang does today these wizards who took the things of power to the safety of the temple were somewhat in sympathy with those in the old world who wanted to eliminate magic they thought that using people lo create these terrible weapons was as evil as some of the very things they fought against fascinated kahlan leaned toward him you mean they turned to the side of the enemy they were really working for those in the old world to eliminate magic no they werent working to defeat the new world or to stop all magic but they felt that they viewed the whole matter on a wider scope than just the war unlike the wizards in charge here at the keep they sought the middle ground they decided that to an extent the war and all their troubles were related to the misuse of magic they decided that something had to be done kahlan hooked some hair behind her ear done like what you know the way the keep used to be full of wizards the way wizards used to have both sides of the magic the way the wizards of old wielded much more power than even zedd does now as first wizard the way those born with the gift are more and more rare all the time i think these wizards used the temple of the winds to withdraw some of magics power from this worldthey locked it away in the underworld where it couldnt be used to cause harm as they saw it in this world kahlan put a hand to her chest dear spirits what gave them the right to decide this they are not the creator who gave all things including magic richard smiled the head of the inquisition said much the same thing he demanded to know exactly what they had done and have you found the answer havent translated much yet and i dont understand the way the magic worked but i think that what the temple team did was to lock away the subtractive portion of the wizards magic its the subtractive part that was used to turn people into these weapons with it hey took away parts of who these people were the parts these wizards didnt want and then with additive magic the wizards added in the things they did want so they could use these people as weapons what about you you were born with both sides if the power was locked away how does that explain your gift i too have an element of subtractive magic to my confessors power darken rahl used subtractive magic as do some of the sisters there are creatures yet today who have some of this element to their magic richard wiped a weary hand across his face i dont know im not even positive about what ive told you theres still most of this book to translate ive only just begun even when i translate it all im not sure it will provide the answers we want this was an inquisition and trial they werent trying to teach me history it was common knowledge at the time they didnt need to explain it what im beginning to think the temple team did was to halt subtractive magics ability to be passed on to the offspring of wizards your magic isnt passed on from a wizard so perhaps thats why it wasnt affected darken rahl learned to use subtractive magic he wasnt born with it therein perhaps lies the difference maybe they miscalculated how taking subtractive magic out of those born with the wizards gift would affect the balance and so didnt anticipate the way it would cause fewer and fewer to be born with the gift maybe they did know maybe thats what they wanted maybe thats why they were executed what about the red moons well when those in charge found all this out they sent someone to undo what these wizards had done they needed one with tremendous power and conviction hoping he would have enough strength to succeed they sent the most zealous proponent of magic among them a fanaticthe head prosecutor a powerful wizard named lothainto the temple of the winds to undo the damage kahlan drew her lower lip between her teeth what happened he got in through betrayers hall just like you told me it worked just as you said lothain entered but in so doing he betrayed them im not sure what it was that he did many of the words i think have to do with specific magic that i dont understand but from what i gather he reinforced what the wizards who sent the temple away had done and made it even worse he betrayed those in the new world because he had to alter the way the temple of the winds held this magic it set off the warnings of the red moons when the temple sent the red moons and the call for aid a wizard was sent because the temple was sending for help the wizards were glad for the call since it meant that they wouldnt have to enter through betrayers hall they thought they would be able to get in and at last remedy the problem he never came back they sent another more powerful and experienced wizard he never returned either finally in view of the seriousness of the situation the first wizard himself went to the temple of the winds richard lifted the amulet at his chest baraccus baraccus kahlan breathed in wonder did he get into the temple they were never sure richard pushed his thumb back and forth along the edge of the table baraccus came back in a dazed stupor they followed after him but he didnt react or respond to anything they said or did he went into the first wizards enclavehis retreatand left this there richard held up the amulet at his chest showing it to her he came out removed the rest of his outfitthese things i wearand then walked to the edge of the rampart and jumped off the side of the mountain to his death kahlan sat back up straight while richard cleared his throat and gathered his voice before going on after that the wizards abandoned any further attempt to get into the temple of the winds to answer the call of the red moons as impossible they were never able to get in to undo the damage the temple team and then lothain had done kahlan watched him with a sober look as he stared off at nothing how did they know all this richards fist tightened around the amulet at his chest they used a confessor magda searus the first mother confessor herself she lived in that lime she was there in this war i never knew that richard rubbed his fingertips across the furrows on his brow lothain wouldnt tell them what he had done the wizards conducting the trial were the ones who ordered the creation of the confessors magda searus was the first they knew that they wouldnt be able to torture the truth out of lothainthey triedso they took this woman magda searus created the magic of the confessors and instilled the power in her she touched lothain with her power and got the truth out of him he confessed the extent of what the temple team had done and what he had done richard looked away from her green eyes the wizard who did this to magda searus created the confessors power was named merritt the tribunal was so pleased with the results of merritts conjuring that they commanded an order of confessors to be created and wizards assigned to safeguard them merritt became protector to magda searus her wizard in return for the life the duty to which he had condemned her to which he had condemned all the descendants of confessors to follow the room fell silent kahlan was wearing her confessors face the blank expression that showed nothing of her feelings he didnt need to see an expression on her face to know her feelings richard pulled the porridge back and ate some more it had cooled considerably richard kahlan finally whispered if these wizards with all that power with all that knowledge if even they couldnt get into the temple of the winds after it sent its warning with the red moons then her voice trailed off richard put words to the rest of it then how can i hope to richard ate lentil porridge as the uncomfortable silence dragged on richard kahlan said in a quiet voice if we dont get into the temple then what the spirit showed me will come to pass death will sweep the land untold numbers of people will die richard nearly leaped lo his feet and screamed at her that he knew that nearly screamed asking what she expected him to do instead he swallowed back the screams along with the porridge i know he whispered he went back to eating his porridge in silence when he had finished and was sure he had composed himself he went on one of the temple team a wizard named ricker made a statement before they executed him richard pulled the piece of paper with the translation out of the disorderly stack and read it to her can no longer countenance what we do with our gift we are not the creator nor are we the keeper even a vexatious prostitute has the right to live her life what was he talking about kahlan asked i think that when the wizards used peopledestroyed themto create the things they needed to right the war i think they used people who were troublesome for one reason or anotherpeople they didnt mind destroying ive heard it said that a wizard must use people i doubt they knew the ghastly origin of the maxim he saw dismay haunting her eves richard do you think then from what youve read that its hopeless do you think we can do nothing then richard didnt know what to say he reached over and clasped her hand the temple team before they were executed said in their own defense that they hadnt sealed the temple away for good as they might have easily done but instead left a way in to answer the call they said that if the need was truly great enough it could still be entered i will get in kahlan i swear it a small measure of relief came briefly to her beautiful eyes but the haunted look settled back into them richard knew what she was thinking it was the same as hed wondered himself as he read of the madness that was the war and of what people had done to each other kahlan we dont use magic to destroy people for our own purposes we use it to fight against a cause that murders helpless children we tight for freedom from terror and killing a small smile returned as she squeezed his hand they both looked up when they heard a knock on the open door it was drefan can i come in im not interrupting anything am i no its all right richard said come in i just wanted you to know that i ordered the carts like you wanted its gotten to that point richard rubbed his fingertips across his forehead how many a little over three hundred last night if the reports are all in as you suspected might be the case the people cant handle that many dead anymore and the numbers grow each day richard nodded we cant let the dead wait it could spread the plague even faster to have them rotting in the open air they have to be buried as soon as they die tell the men i want the deadcarts sent out just as soon as they have it organized i give them until sunset i already told them as you say we cant allow bodies infected with the plague to go untended it could make the plague worse it can get worse richard mocked drefan didnt answer im sorry richard said that wasnt called for have you found anything that is of any use drefan tugged down the sleeves of his white shirt richard there is no cure for the plague at least i know of none the only hope is to stay healthy speaking of which it isnt healthy to sit in here all day and most of the night you arent getting enough sleep again i can see it in your eyes ive warned you about that before and you need to walk around get some air richard was sick of trying to translate the book and sick of the things he found out when he succeeded he flipped it closed and pushed back his chair this is doing no good anyway lets go for that walk you suggested richard yawned as he stretched and what have you been doing to keep busy he asked kahlan while ive been shut up in this stuffy room kahlan cast a furtive glance at drefan iive been helping drefan and nadine helping them helping them do what drefan smoothed the ruffles on the front of his shirt kahlan has been helping with the staff some of them are ill richard looked from kahlans eyes to drefans the plague is in the palace im afraid so sixteen of them have come down sick a few are common illnesses the rest richard heaved a weary sigh i see raina was standing guard outside his room she straightened when richard came through the door raina were going for a walk i suppose youd better come along or ill never hear the end of it from cara raina smiled as she brushed back a wisp of dark hair she knew he was right and was obviously glad he was cooperating lord rahl raina said i didnt want to disturb you while you were working but the captain of the city guard came by with a report i know i heard three hundred people died last night rainas leather creaked as she shifted her weight that too but they wanted me to tell you that they found another woman last night she was cut up like the other four richard closed his eyes as he wiped a hand across his mouth he noticed that he hadnt remembered to shave that day dear spirits dont we have enough people dying without some madman going around killing more of them was this one a prostitute like the others drefan asked the captain said he wasnt positive but he was pretty sure she was drefan shook his head with disgust youd think hed be worried about the plague if not getting caught the plague is running wild among the prostitutes more so than among the populace at large richard caught sight of berdine coming up the hall as much as id like to do something about it we have bigger worries he turned to raina when we get back tell the captain that i want his men to spread the word among those women that theres a killer among them and that for their own safety we hope they will cease their profession at least for the time being im sure the soldiers will know where to find all the prostitutes he added under his breath have them get the word out at once if these women dont stop selling their bodies theyre likely to find themselves in the company of the wrong customer their last customer richard waited until berdine reached them arent you supposed to be up in the keep taking your turn guarding the sliph richard asked her berdine shrugged i went up there to relieve cara but she said she wanted to stay for another watch richard raked back his hair why would she want to do that berdine shrugged again she didnt say kahlan took his arm i think its the rats what i think shes trying to prove something to herself kahlan hesitated cara doesnt like rats i dont blame her raina muttered filthy creatures drefan put in i dont blame her either if any of you tease her about it kahlan warned you will answer to me when caras done with you its not funny no one looked in the mood to challenge kahlan nor were any of them in a mood to see anything as funny where are you going berdine asked were going for a walk richard said youve probably been sitting as much as i have if youd like come along nadine came around the corner and caught sight of them just as they started out whats going on nothing richard said how are you doing nadine nadine smiled fine thank you ive been busy smoking sick rooms as drefan asked we were just going out for a walk kahlan said youve been working hard nadine why dont you come along with us richard frowned at kahlan she didnt look back at him nadine studied kahlans eyes for a moment sure id like that the six of them made their way through the marble halls past imposing tapestries and elegant furniture and across sumptuous carpets on their way toward the main palace gates soldiers on patrol bowed or clapped fists over heart as the six of them passed the staff richard saw going about their business seemed to be in a state of shock he saw people weeping as they hurried about their tasks before they made the door they encountered tristan bashkar richard was in no mood to speak with the jarian ambassador tristan sauntered to a halt before them there would be no avoiding him this time tristan bowed his head mother confessor lord rahl im glad i ran into you what do you want tristan kahlan asked in a level tone he watched her cleavage as she spoke his gaze moved to richard i want to know richard cut him off did you come to offer jaras surrender tristan pulled his coat back and rested his fist on his hip the time i was allotted is not yet expired im concerned about this plague youre lord rahl youre supposed to be running everything now i want lo know what youre going to do about the plague richard restrained himself what we can tristan glanced to kahlans chest again well im sure that you can understand that i need assurance his gaze returned to richard a sly smile spread on his face after all how can i in good conscience surrender my land to a man overseeing what may prove to be the greatest cataclysm in the history of the midlands no offense intended the skies speak the truth to me im sure you can understand my position richard leaned toward the pompous ambassador you are rapidly running out of time ambassador you had better be prepared to surrender jara soon or i will see to itmy way now if youll excuse us were going to get some fresh air it suddenly stinks in here tristan bashkars expression darkened when his eyes turned toward kahlan again richard yanked the knife from tristans belt scabbard before he could so much as blink everyone froze richard pressed the point to the mans chest and if i ever again catch your lecherous eyes anywhere on kahlan but her face ill cut out your heart richard turned and loosed the knife burying it in a round oak ball atop a nearby newel the twang echoed through the marble halls without waiting for a response he took kahlan by the arm and marched away his golden cloak billowing out behind kahlans face was red the two mordsith followed grinning broadly drefan smiled too as he followed after nadine showed no reaction chapter in the distance a dog barked as richard led them lip the cobbled alley he brought his escorts to a halt outside the small yard behind the anderson familys home the yard was still cluttered with cutoffs wood scraps shavings stickered lumber and the two carving benches richard heard neither the sound of wood being worked nor voices he swung open the gate and made his way through the clutter the workshop remained silent a knock produced no response richard pushed open one of the double doors and called out there was no reply clive richard called again darby erling is anyone home old chairs and templates still hung from pegs on the dusty walls and the cobwebs still hung in all the corners upstairs instead of the aroma of meat pies and boiling turnips like the last time richard had been to the anderson home there was the heavy stench of death in one of the chairs he had made sat clive anderson he was dead in his arms he was holding the stiff corpse of his wife richard stood stunned at the sight behind he heard kahlan let out a mournful cry drefan went to the bedrooms after a brief look he returned and shook his head richard stood staring at the dead husband and wife he tried to imagine clives misery as he sat there sick with the plague holding his dead wife in his arms his dreams and hopes dead in his arms drefan eased a hand under richards arm and pulled him away richard theres nothing to be done wed best go and have a deadcart sent kahlan pressed her face against his shoulder as she wept he saw the stricken look on the faces of berdine and raina he saw their fingers find one another and curl togethera furtive comforting touch nadine glanced away from the rest of them richard felt sudden sorrow for her she was alone among them thankfully drefan rested a comforting hand on her shoulder the room droned with painful silence richard held kahlan to him as they went down the stairs the others followed behind when they reached the workshop he took a breath at last the stench upstairs had nearly gagged him just then erling the grandfather walked through the door he started at seeing the six people standing in his workshop im sorry erling richard said we didnt mean to invade your home we came to check we came erling nodded distantly my boys dead hattie too i had to go out i couldnt carry them by myself well have a cart sent right away there are some soldiers on the next street over ill send them right away to help you erling nodded again that would be kind of you the rest of them are they erlings bloodshot eyes turned up my wife daughter son his wife darby and little lilyall dead his mouth worked as his eyes watered up beth she recovered got well again she did i couldnt care for her i just now took her to hatties sister so far their home is still sound richard laid a hand gently on erlings arm im so sorry dear spirits im so sorry erling nodded thank you he cleared his throat long as ive lived youd think it would be me not the younguns the spirits werent fair in this not fair at all i know richard said theyre at a place of peace now we all go there sooner or later theyll be with you again out in the alley after they had made sure that erling didnt need anything they all paused to gather their wits raina richard said please run over to the next street where we saw those soldiers get them over here right now tell them to get those bodies out of there for erling of course she said before dashing away her dark braid flew behind as she ran i dont know what to do richard whispered what do you do for someone who has just lost his whole family everyone he loved i felt a fool i didnt know what to say drefan squeezed richards shoulder you said the right things richard you did he took comfort in your words richard nadine said that was all you could do all i can do richard repeated as he stared off kahlan squeezed his hand berdines hand touched his he gripped it the three of them stood linked in shared sorrow richard paced as he waited for raina to return the sun was almost down it would be dark before they got back to the palace the least he could do was wait until erling had help getting his dead son and daughterinlaw out of the house kahlan and berdine stood close together leaning against the wall beside the andersons yard drefan hands clasped behind his back looking to be lost in thought strolled a ways back down the alley nadine went to the other side of the alley alone and leaned against the clapboard wall richard paced as he thought about the temple of the winds and the magic stolen by jagangs order richard could think of no way to stop this slaughter when he thought about tristan bashkars eyes on kahlan richards blood boiled richard paused his head came up nadine was behind him he had the oddest sensation the hair on the back of his neck stiffened richard heard the air whine as he spun the world slowed sound dragged he floated as he moved the air felt as thick as mud everyone seemed a statue in his vision time was his his arm stretched out as he drifted ahead he commanded the thickness of the air in the eerie silence he could hear the feathers singing he could hear the hiss of blade time was his nadines startled blink took forever he closed his fist with a slam of sound the world crashed back with a wild rush in his fist richard held a bolt from a crossbow the blade wasnt three inches from nadines wide eyes a fraction of a second more and it would have killed her that fraction of a second had been an hour to him richard nadine panted how did you catch that arrow i hope you can understand that it gives me the creeps not that im complaining she was quick to add drefan was there his jaw hanging open how did you do that he whispered im a wizard remember richard said as he turned looking in the direction from which the arrow had come he thought he saw movement kahlan clutched a trembling nadine are you all right nadine nodded and let out a belated frightened cry as kahlan pulled her to her in a reassuring embrace richards eyes locked on a movement as his fist snapped the arrow in half he took off running berdine raced after him richard turned as he ran find some soldiers i want this whole area closed off i want him caught berdine cut down a street going after soldiers richard ran like the wind on a storm rage inundated him someone had tried to kill nadine in that instant nadine wasnt a woman sent by shota to marry him a woman who was causing him trouble in that instant she was simply an old friend from home the full fury of the magic took him buildings flashed by dogs barked as he raced past people in the alley cried out and dived for safety a woman screamed as she cowered against a small crooked storage building richard vaulted the low board fence where he had seen the movement in midleap he drew his sword the air rang with the unique sound of steel he rolled as he landed coming to his feet with the sword in both hands he found himself facetoface with a white goat there was no man there a crossbow lay on the ground between the board fence and a squat goat shed richard looked around in all directions sheets and shirts hung from lines a woman her hair wrapped in a blue scarf stood on a balcony beyond the flapping laundry richard slid his sword back into its scabbard and cupped his hands around his mouth did you see a man here he yelled up at the woman she lifted her arm pointing off to her right i saw someone running that way she called from the distance richard dashed off in the direction the woman had pointed the alley narrowed beyond the tunnel of buildings the passageway opened onto a street he looked both ways he seized the arm of a young woman a man came through here which way did he go in fright she tried to pull away at the same time holding her hat on with her other hand there be people all about which man richard released her arm up the street to his left he saw a man righting an overturned handcart full of fresh greens the man looked up when richard skidded to a panting halt before him what did he look like the man who ran through herewhat did he look like the man straightened his broadrimmed hat dont know he pointed i was looking for a good spot i heard the sound as my cart fell over i saw a dark shape running up that way richard ran on the ancient part of the city branched into a warren of alleys streets and twisting passageways only by keeping track of the golden glow in the western sky could he keep his bearings that didnt mean though that the man he chased had run in a specific direction he was probably just running trying to get away richard came across a patrol of a dozen soldiers before they had time to salute he was talking a man came running through here somewhere did any of you see him we saw no one running what did he look like i dont know he attacked us with a crossbow and then ran i want him found spread out and start searching before they could be on their way raina came running up the street with a good fifty men did you see where he went she asked gasping for breath no i lost him in here somewhere i want all of you to spread out and find him one of the soldiers a sergeant spoke up lord rahl a man who wants to escape would make himself obvious by running a man with any sense at all would simply round a corner and walk away the sergeant gestured back up the street to make his point there were people everywhere going about their business although a good many were staring at the excitement on their street any number of them could have been the man he was chasing any idea at all what this assassin looks like richard shook his head in frustration i never got a look at him he raked back his hair as he caught his breath split up half of you go back in the direction we came from question everyone you can find to see if anyone got a look at him at a man running he may be walking now but until he got somewhere along in here he was running raina agiel in hand took up her defensive position close beside him the rest of you come with me richard said well pick up some more men i want to keep searching maybe well come across someone walking and hell panic and try to run again if he does i want him alive it was late in the night by the time they returned to the confessors palace soldiers there were already on high alert men stood with swords and battleaxes to hand arrows nocked and spears leveled others patrolled the expansive grounds a mouse wouldnt have escaped their intense scrutiny as kahlan berdine raina drefan and nadine accompanied him into the gathering hall inside richard saw tristan bashkar waiting there hands clasped behind his back as he paced he halted and looked up when he heard them coming richard drifted to a stop as the contritelooking ambassador approached those escorting richard gathered in a knot behind him except kahlan who stood close at his side with a hand in the air tristan hailed them lord rahl may i have a word with you please richard swept his gaze over the man noticing that he didnt rest his hand on a hip so as to show off his fancy knife richard held up a finger one moment please richard turned a little to the rest of them its late we have a lot of work to do so i want you to get some rest berdine i want you to go up to the keep and stand guard with cara tonight berdine frowned both of us richard scowled isnt that what i said yes both of you with this trouble i dont want to take any chances i will guard the mother confessors room then raina said no richard lifted a thumb i want you guarding nadines room she was the one who was attacked yes lord rahl raina stammered ill see to setting up a guard of soldiers outside the mother confessors room then if i wanted soldiers around kahlans room id have told you so now wouldnt i rainas face reddened i want all the soldiers doing their jobs patrolling the entrances the palace grounds and a perimeter around the grounds every one of them the danger is from out there not in here kahlan is perfectly safe inside the palace i dont want men who should be guarding outside instead sitting on their bottoms around kahlans room inside ill not have it do you hear me but lord rahl dont question me im not in the mood kahlan touched his arm richard she whispered are you sure that someone tried to kill nadine they nearly succeeded or did some of you miss the significance of that ill not take any more chances i want her protected and i dont want to hear any more arguments drefan i want you to start carrying a sword at once healers are a target everyone stared at the floor in silence good richard turned his glare on tristan what is it tristan spread his hands lord rahl i just wanted to say that im sorry i realize i seemed insensitive but ive been worried about the people here who are sick and dying it set my nerves on edge i meant to cause no ill will between us i hope you will accept my apology richard studied tristans eyes yes of course apology accepted and im sorry that i lost my temper i too have been out of sorts richard put a hand on nadines shoulder someone tried to kill one of my healersa person devoted to helping others people are beginning to blame healers because the plague continues to spread i cant allow harm to come to people who are only trying their best to help yes of course you are most kind to accept my apology thank you lord rahl just dont forget ambassador that your time runs out tomorrow tristan bowed i realize that and you will know my stand by tomorrow lord rahl you have my word good night then richard rounded on the rest of them we have a lot of work to do tomorrow its very late as drefan is constantly reminding me we need to get some sleep you all have your orders any questions each answered with a silent shake of the head two hours after they had returned to the palace and richard had sent them all to bed kahlan thought she saw something move in her room the lamp on the far wall was turned down low the clouds hid the moon so there was no light coming in the glassed doors to the balcony the thick carpets silenced the sound of footsteps if there were any the weak flame from the lamp was all that betrayed the shape she thought she saw another motion came from across the rooma hint of shadowed movement she hadnt seen a person enter her rooms it could be nothing other than her imagination the day had left her in an edgy state with the next silent step there was no doubt there was someone in her room someone slipped ever closer to her bed as furtive as the movements were he had closed the distance in remarkably short order kahlan didnt move a muscle as she saw the knife glint in the dim lamplight she held her breath a powerful arm stabbed hatefully into her bed the arm rose and fell stabbing in quick succession with a finger richard pushed on the balcony door it swung open on silent hinges berdine glided across the room the instant richard gave her a hand signal when she was in place he tapped the glass once berdine turned up the wick on the lamp tristan bashkar straightened beside kahlans bed knife in hand panting with the effort of what he had just been doing toss down the knife ambassador richard said in a quiet tone tristan spun the knife in his fingers seizing the blade in preparation to throw it berdines agiel to the back of his neck dropped him instantly she pressed the agiel down on his shoulder to support herself as she bent and picked up the knife tristan howled in pain berdine straightened coming up with three knives you were right richard drefan said from behind i cant believe it nadine said as she stepped up into the lamplight believe it general kerson said as he too came in from the balcony id say tristan bashkar has nullified his immunity as a diplomat richard put two fingers between his lips and whistled raina charged through the door ahead of a large contingent of dharan soldiers bristling steel two of them lit more lamps richard hooked his thumbs behind his belt as he stood beside kahlan a towering black form defined with gold trim on his tunic and silver ornaments buckles and wristbands watching the soldiers haul tristan to his feet you were right richard she said he attacked nadine to draw the guard off me it was me he was after all along for a while she had thought he had lost his mind his performance had convinced everyone including tristan thanks for believing me richard whispered when he had first told her what he was doing kahlan had suspected that richard had accused tristan because of the incident earlier kahlan had not put words to it but she had wondered if richard was simply acting out of jealousy since she had told him what shota said he had now twice displayed jealousy something she had never before seen from him he didnt have any reason to be jealous but shotas words played on his mind casting in doubt whenever she looked at nadine kahlan understood his feelings whenever she saw nadine so much as standing near him kahlan felt the hot claws of jealousy rake through her insides she knew that shota and the spirit had told her the truth she knew that she would not have richard her mind tried to put rational thought to it to tell her that it would work out that they would be together but her heart knew better richard would marry nadine kahlan would marry another man richard refused to believe it at least he said he refused to believe it she wondered in her minds eye kahlan saw clive anderson sitting dead in his chair holding his dead wife in comparison to the tragedy that had befallen the anderson family and so many others what price was an unhappy marriage wouldnt it be worth that price if it would stop the appalling suffering and death nadine slipped up next to richard on the other side drawing the guard off kahlan or not id have been dead thank you richard ive never seen anything like the way you caught that arrow right in front of my face richard gave her a quick onearmed hug nadine youve said thank you enough times youd have done the same for me kahlan felt those hot claws again she suppressed the feeling as shota had said if she loved him she would want him to have at least the small comfort of it being someone he knew but what if he had killed me i mean if he just wanted to draw the guard away from kahlan what if he had killed me what good would that have that done him he knows i have the gift and counted on that if he had happened to kill you it might still have worked or he could have faked something similar with drefan reinforcing our belief that the target was healers and not kahlan why didnt he just shoot kahlan with the arrow richard watched the onesided struggle on the other side of kahlans bed because he likes to use that knife of his he wanted to feel it when he killed her his words gave kahlan a chill she knew tristan richard might be right tristan would have gotten pleasure from it the soldiers wrestled tristans arms behind his back as they hauled him to his feet he was still full of fight but he was grossly overpowered more lamps were lit as the room filled with soldiers kahlan felt embarrassed to have all those people in her bedroom she guessed it was because the mother confessors rooms had always been a private sanctuary a safe place a man had invaded that sanctuary a man intent on stabbing her to death whats this all about tristan shouted oh we just thought wed like to watch a man stabbing a nightdress stuffed with tow richard said general kerson inspected the prisoner to assure himself that berdine had found all his weapons when he was satisfied he turned to richard what would you like done lord rahl behead him kahlan turned in shock richard you cant do that you saw him he thought he was killing you but he didnt he only stabbed my empty bed the spirits mark a difference between intent and deed he tried to kill nadine too i did no such thing tristan shouted that wasnt me havent even left the palace tonight richard turned a cold glare on tristan you have white hairs on your knees white goat hairs you knelt behind that fence while you aimed the crossbow and got the goat hairs on you kahlan glanced down and saw that richard was right youre crazy i never did richard kahlan said he didnt kill nadine either he may have tried but he didnt you cant execute him for intent richard closed his fist around the amulet at his chest the amulet representing the dance with death no mercy the generals eyes left kahlan and returned to richard lord rahl richard kahlan insisted you cant richard glared at tristan he killed those women he sliced them up with his fancy knife you like to cut people dont you tristan what are you talking about i never killed anyoneexcept in war no richard said and you didnt try to kill kahlan and you didnt try to kill nadine and there arent white goat hairs on your pants tristans panicked brown eyes turned to kahlan mother confessor i didnt kill you i didnt kill her you said it yourself the spirits mark a difference between intent and deed i didnt kill anyone you cant let him do this kahlan recalled the whispers about tristan the whispers that when he went into battle he drew his knife instead of his sword and that he got sadistic pleasure from cutting people those women were killed for sadistic pleasure what was it you told me tristan that you often had to resort to the charms of coin for the company of a woman and that if you broke our rules you would expect to be subjected to our choice of punishment what about a trial ive killed no one intent is not the same as deed and what was your intent tristan richard asked why did you intend to kill kahlan it wasnt because i wanted to it wasnt for pleasure as you think it was to save lives richard lifted an eyebrow killing to save lives youve killed people you dont do it for the pleasure of killing but to save the lives of innocent people thats all im guilty oftrying to save innocent lives the imperial order sent representatives to the royal palace in sandilar they told us to join with them or die javas kedar our star guide told me f must watch the skies for a sign when the red moons came and the plague started i knew what they meant i was going to kill the mother confessor in order to try to gain favor with the order so that they wouldnt send the plague to us too i was only trying to save my people richards eyes turned to kahlan how far is sandilar a month there and back maybe a few days less richard looked back at the general get some officers together to take command of the jarian forces and capital have them take tristans head to the royal family and tell them that he was executed for attempting to kill the mother confessor the officers are to offer jara surrender to dhara under the peaceful terms already offered its a month there and back the king himself is to return with the surrender documents i expect him and the dharan guard sent to accompany him back here within one month from tomorrow tell the king that if they dont surrender and our men dont return safely i will personally ride into sandilar at the head of an army and i will behead every member of the royal family we will then conquer jara and occupy the capital the occupation will not be friendly general kerson clapped a fist to the chain mail over his heart it will be as you say lord rahl richard kahlan whispered what if what he says is truethat he didnt kill those women i could touch him with my confessors power and we would know for sure no ill not have you touching him or hearing the things he did to those women hes a monster i dont want you to have to touch him but what if hes telling the truth what if he didnt kill those women richards fist gripped the amulet at his chest im not having him put to death for the murder of those women he tried to kill you i saw it as far as im concerned the intent is the same as the deed he is going to pay for the intent the same as he would have paid for the deed richard turned a cold dark glare back to the soldiers last night alone three hundred people died of the plague he would have joined with the murders who caused it i want the men on their way to jara first thing in the morning and i want his head to go with them you have your orders get him out of here chapter when she saw drefan coming from the other direction kahlan set down the basket of clean bandages and rags she was carrying even though richard had only ordered it as part of his ruse to convince tristan that his plan was working drefan was still wearing a sword perhaps it wasnt such a bad idea some people were beginning to resent healers because they spoke out against the potions and cures being sold on the streets she brushed back her hair how are they drefan sighed as he glanced back up the hall one died last night most are worse we have six new ones today dear spirits she whispered what is to happen to us drefan lifted her chin we will persevere kahlan nodded drefan if so many of the staff are coming down sick and so many have died already what good is this infernal smoke doing im sick of breathing it the smoke is doing no good for the plague kahlan blinked up at him then why must we keep doing it drefan smiled sadly the people think it helps keep the plague from being worse it makes them feel better that were doing something and that there is hope if we stop then they will think there is no hope is there is there any hope i dont know he whispered have you heard last nights report yet he nodded in the last week the number of dead has continued to rise last night it was up to over six hundred kahlan looked away despondently i wish we could do something shota had told her that a way would come the spirit had told her that a way would come she couldnt bear the thought of losing richard but she also couldnt bear the thought of all the people who were dying well drefan said im going to make my rounds through the city kahlan clasped his forearm he flinched it was a reaction that she as a confessor was used to she took her hand back i know you can do nothing to stop it but thank you for all your aid anyway just your words help those living to have hope a healers best aid words most of the time its all we can do to help most people think being a healer means healing people that actually happens rarely i learned a long time ago that being a healer means living with pain and suffering hows richard have you seen him this morning hes in his office he looked fine i made him get some sleep good he needed rest drefans blue eyes searched hers he did what he had to with that man who tried to kill you but i know that despite how resolute he appeared it was a terribly hard thing for him to do killing a man even one who richly deserves it is not something that comes easily to richard i know kahlan said i know that condemning a man to death weighs heavily on him i myself have had to order the deaths of people in a time of peace you have the luxury of order but in war you must act hesitation is death and have you told that to richard kahlan smiled of course i have he knows he did what he had to and that those of us close to him understand in his place i would have done the same and i told him so someday i hope to have a woman of half your strength drefan smiled to say nothing of your beauty well i must be off kahlan watched him walk away his trousers were still too tight she blushed at the thought and turned back to her work nadine was in the sick room tending to people in two rows of beds the infirmary held twenty beds and they were all full with more people on blankets on the floor there were others sick in other rooms thanks nadine said when kahlan set down the clean things she had brought nadine was putting herbs in pots making teas other women who tended the sick were changing sheets cleaning and wrapping open sores or serving tea to the patients nadine plucked a cloth from the basket dipped it in a basin of water wrung it out and laid it across the forehead of a moaning woman nadine patted the womans shoulder there you go dear how does that feel the woman managed only a weak smile and nod kahlan did the same for several more people dabbing a cool damp cloth to their sweaty faces offering soft words of comfort you could be a healer nadine said as she paused beside kahlan you have a kind touch thats the only thing i know to do i couldnt heal anyone nadine leaned close and do you think i am kahlan glanced around the room i see what you mean but at least you have devoted your life to helping people my life is devoted to duty to fighting what do you mean in the end i am a warrior my duty is to hurt people in order to save others it is left to people like you to heal those remaining when people like me are finished fighting nadine stood close to her sometimes i wish i was a warrior and could fight to end the suffering so that there wouldnt be so many wounded for the healers to tend to kahlan finally had to leave the room she couldnt stand the stink and the smoke was making her sick nadine felt the same and went with her they both slid their backs down the wall and sat on the floor i feel helpless nadine said back home if someone had a headache id give him something and hed get to feeling better if a woman was pregnant id help settle her stomach or id help deliver the baby when it was time it seemed i was always helping people this is different all i do is comfort people who are going to die and wonder the whole time if it will be me on the bed tomorrow i dont know what to do for any of them i feel totally useless i wish id come here to help these people instead of watching them die i know kahlan whispered it must have been a lot more satisfying to help a woman deliver a baby nadine stared off in thought sometimes a woman would tell me that it seemed like it would never happen that it seemed unreal shed wait knowing it would happen but never really believing it dreading the things shed heard about how hard it would be dreading the pain sometimes they think things will change like theyll wake up one day and not be pregnant or something then the baby would come suddenly shell be in a panic the time has come shell be terrified that its really happening at last sometimes theyll scream just from that fear the fear of the pain thats when i can help them im there with them i reassure them that it will be all right for the first time for some of them they finally believe its happening i guess its only natural to dread such a profound change in their lives until its over until the day is upon them some of them are miserable with dread together in the silence of the hall they sat resting listening to the moans from the sick room nadine you still think you will end up marrying richard dont you nadine glanced over scratching her freckled nose but she didnt answer i didnt ask that toto start in on you or anything i just meant well like you said you might end up on one of those beds in there i was just thinking it could be me too i could get the plague or something nadine watched her you wont dont say that you wont get it kahlan ran her thumbnail along a joint in the floorboards but i could i was just thinking that if i did or something well what about richard hed be alone what are you saying kahlan looked into nadines soft brown eyes if for some reason you ended up being the one with him instead of me youd be good to him wouldnt you youd always be good to him nadine swallowed of course i would im serious nadine theres so much happening i want to know that you wouldnt ever hurt him id never hurt richard you hurt him before nadine turned away and scratched her shoulder that was different i was trying to win him i would have done anything to get him to be with me i already explained it to you i know kahlan picked at a little stone stuck in the crack between the floorboards but if something happened and it turned out that you were the one the one to marry him i want to know that youd never do anything like that to him again id like to hear it from you that you would never do anything to hurt richard anything nadine met kahlans eyes for a moment before glancing away if i ever ended up with richard i would make him the happiest man in the world id take the best care of him that any woman ever took of any man i would love him better thanwell id do my very best to make him happy kahlan felt the familiar pain gnaw at her insides she endured it do you swear that thats the truth yes kahlan looked away and wiped at her eyes thanks nadine thats what i wanted to know why are you asking me such a thing kahlan cleared her throat as i said im worried that i might get the plague too if anything happens i could bear it better if i knew that there was someone who would take care of richard near as i can figure richard pretty much takes care of himself do you know that that man can cook better than me kahlan laughed nadine laughed with her isnt that the truth kahlan said i guess where richard is concerned a woman can only hope to go along with him for the ride lord rahl richard turned to see general kerson calling out for him he let go of kahlans hand cara glided to a stop behind kahlan yes what is it general the general came to a halt waving a letter a dusty tiredlooking soldier followed behind along with the generals usual guard a message from general reibisch with his army to the south the general lifted a thumb grissom here just rode in richard glanced to the young soldier still panting to get his breath he smelled like a horse richard thought he would much rather smell like a horse and be out riding than sitting in a little room day after day translating the mad account of a trial and execution he guessed that if his labors were doing him any good he might feel differently he broke the seal and opened the letter when he finished reading it he handed the letter to kahlan take a look while kahlan read the letter richard turned to the messenger how is our army to the south doing fine when i left them lord rahl grissom said the sisters of the light caught up with us as they said you told them to do theyre all together with our men were awaiting orders the letter had said much the same thing when kahlan had finished reading richard took the letter and handed it to general kerson the general idly scratched his graying hair as he read the letter he looked up when he had finished what do you think lord rahl makes sense to me i dont think we should bring all those men back up north right now as general reibisch says they would be in a position to know about it if the order moves very far into the new world what do you think richard asked as he passed the letter back to cara the general hiked up his trousers i agree with reibisch id want to do the same if i were him hes already down there why not put him to good use as he says it would be best to know what the order is up to and if the enemy does come up north to attack us he will be in a position to bite their ass he winced sorry mother confessor kahlan smiled my father was a warrior general before he was king it brings back memories she didnt say if they were good memories i also agree about the strategic advantage of having an army in that position cara handed the letter back to richard hes right about one other thing too if he abandons his position and the order went to the northeast they would be able to sweep into dhara unopposed we wouldnt even know about it that part of dhara is sparsely populated the order could drive north and we would never know it until they cut west back into the midlands unless they pushed straight for the peoples palace the general said that would be a fatal mistakeattacking the heart of dhara cara said commander general trimack of the first file of the palace guard would show the enemy why no army has ever attacked the palace and had so much as a single soldier live to recount the tale of their bloody defeat the cavalry would cut them to pieces out on the azrith plains shes right the general said if the enemy goes there the vultures will feasttrimack will see to that if they did go northeast up into dhara it would be to flank us best to have reibisch guarding the gate richard had another reason to want general reibischs army to stay south lord rahl the messenger asked may i ask a question of course what is it grissom fussed with the hilt of his short sword whats going on in the city i mean i saw men hauling carts with dead people and i saw others going through the streets calling for people to bring out their dead richard took a deep breath thats the other reason we want general reibisch to stay down south the plague is loose in the midlands last night seven hundred fifty people died the spirits preserve us grissom wiped his palms on his hips i was afraid it might be something like that i want you to take my reply back to general reibisch having been here i dont want you to carry the plague to him too when you get back you are to pass my message along verbally dont approach any of his men or any people for that matter any closer than you must in order to be heard when you get to their sentries tell them to pass the message on to the general tell him that i find his reasoning to be sound all of the command here agrees with him tell him to carry on with his plans and to keep us informed now that youve been here you cant return to those men youll have to come back here when youve delivered the message i want you to take a goodsized patrol with you to make sure you get our instructions through then all of you come back here grissom saluted with a fist to his heart it shall be as you command lord rahl i wish i could let you return to your men soldier but were trying to keep the plague from getting to the army we have the soldiers here spread out around the city so they dont come down sick you can tell them that too general kerson scratched his face ah lord rahl i have to talk to you about that i just found out myself richard frowned at the generals sudden wincing expression what is it ah well the plague has gotten to our men richard felt his heart in his throat which group the general wiped a hand across his mouth all of them lord rahl seems that the prostitutes have been visiting the camps the women thought it would be safer than plying their trade in the city what with those murders i dont know anything about how sickness spreads but drefan told me that that might have been the way it happened richard squeezed his temples between his thumb and second finger he wanted to give up he wanted to simply sit down on the floor and give up i should never have had tristan bashkar put to death i should have let him kill all those women in the end it would have saved countless lives if id have known this id have killed them all myself he felt kahlans hand touch his back in sympathy dear spirits he whispered he could think of nothing else to say dear spirits what are we doing to ourselves those women have just unwittingly struck a blow for jagang do you want them executed lord rahl general kerson asked no richard said in a quiet voice the deed is done it would serve no purpose now they didnt do it intentionally to cause harm they were just trying to keep themselves safe richard recalled the words of one of the temple team before he was put to death can no longer countenance what we do with our gift we are not the creator nor are we the keeper even a vexatious prostitute has the right to live her life grissom get a patrol together and as soon as youve had some food and rest get my message back to general reibisch grissom saluted again yes lord rahl ill get some food and supplies and be on my way within the hour richard nodded the messenger took his leave lord rahl the general said if theres nothing else id better see to my duties yes general there is one more thing cut the sick soldiers out of the camps put them in a separate camp lets see if we can limit the extent of the outbreak who knows maybe we can even contain it and i dont want any prostitutes in the camps none maybe we can keep the distemper lighter that way have all the women warned to stay away under penalty of death post archers with the sentries if they continue to approach after being challenged have the archers cut them down the general heaved a sigh i understand lord rahl ill also separate out the men who have been with those women and have them tend to the sick soldiers good idea richard put his arm around kahlans waist as he watched the general and his guard hurry to their tasks why didnt i think of that before i might have kept the plague from the soldiers if only id thought of it kahlan didnt have an answer lord rahl cara said im going up to the sliph to relieve berdine ill go with you i want to see if berdine has learned anything from the journal besides i need to get out of here for a while you want to go too he asked kahlan her arm tightened around him id like that berdine was bent over the journal reading the sliph looked richards way before berdine did do you wish to travel master you will be pleased no richard said when the echo of the eerie voice had died out thank you sliph but not now berdine leaned back and yawned as she stretched her arms glad to see you cara i cant stay awake any longer you look like you could use some sleep richard gestured to the open journal on the table before her anything new berdine glanced to the sliph as she stood she picked up the journal and turned it around offering it to him she leaned closer and lowered her voice you remember telling me about what that man said before he was put to death what he said about even a vexatious woman having a right to her life richard knew what berdine was talking about yes you mean wizard ricker thats the one well kolo mentioned it briefly she tapped a place in the journal read here richard studied the sentence a moment until he had it translated in his head rickers vexatious prostitute is watching me as i sit here pondering what damage the team has done i heard today that we have lost lothain ricker has had his revenge do you know who lothain is berdine asked he was the head prosecutor at the temple of the winds trial he was the one who went to undo the damage done by the team richard looked up the sliph was watching him he stepped closer it had never occurred to him before why hadnt he thought of it before sliph yes master you wish to travel come you will be pleased richard stepped closer no i dont wish to travel but i would like to talk to you do you remember the time long ago when there was a great war going on long i am long enough to travel tell me where you wish to go you will be pleased no i dont mean traveling do you remember any names names names do you remember the name ricker the silver face watched without expression i never betray my clients sliph you were a person once werent you a person like me the sliph smiled no richard laid a hand on kahlans shoulder a person like this the silver smile widened yes i was a whore like her kahlan cleared her throat i think richard meant to ask if you were a woman sliph yes i was a woman too what was your name richard asked name the sliph frowned as if puzzled i am the sliph who made you into the sliph some of my clients why why did they make you into the sliph because i never reveal my clients sliph could you explain that better some of the wizards here in this place were my clients the most powerful of them i was a very exclusive whore and very expensive many of the wizards contended for power others tried to use me to displace some of those who were my clients some wished to use me for their pleasure but not the kind of pleasure i offered i never reveal my clients you mean they would have been pleased if you told them the names of the wizards who visited you and maybe a little more about those visits yes my clients feared these others would use me for this pleasure and so they made me the sliph richard turned away he raked his fingers back through his hair even as they fought the enemy they fought among themselves when he finally gathered his wits he turned back to the beautiful silver face sliph those men are all dead now there is no one alive who knows these men there are no wizards anymore to vie for power could you tell me a little more they made me and told me that i would be unable to speak their names as long as they lived they said that their power would prevent it if it is true that their spirits have passed from this world then it will no longer matter and i will be able to speak their names it was this man lothain who was one of your clients wasnt it and this other wizard ricker thought he was a hypocrite lothain the quicksilver face softened as she seemed to test the name wizard ricker came to me and said that this man lothain was the head prosecutor and that he was a vile beast who would turn on me he wanted my help to depose lothain i refused to name my clients richard spoke into the silence and rickers words proved true lothain turned on you and made you into the sliph so that you couldnt speak out against him yes i told lothain that i did not reveal my clients i told him that he had no need to fear me speaking he said that it didnt matter that i was only a whore and the world would never miss me he twisted my arm and hurt me he used me for his pleasure without my permission when he finished he laughed and then i saw a flash of light in my mind ricker came to me after and told me that he would put an end to lothain and wizards like him he wept at the edge of my well and said he was sorry for what they did to me he told me that he would put a stop to the way magic destroyed people were you sad berdine asked was it sad to be made into the sliph they took sadness from me when they made me did they take happiness too kahlan whispered they left me with duty even in this they had made a mistake they left some of who the sliph had been so that they could use her the part they left would submit to anyone with the price required magic they had been tripped up by her nature they used her but had to guard her because she would offer herself to anyoneeven the enemywho had the required price sliph richard said im so sorry that we wizards did this to you they had no right im so sorry the sliph smiled wizard ricker told me that if any master said those words to me i should tell them these words from him ward left in ward right out guard your heart from stone what does that mean he did not explain the words to me richard felt sick were they going to die because of a threethousandyearold fight for power perhaps jagang was right perhaps magic had no place in the world any longer richard turned back to the others berdine you need to get some sleep raina has to be up early to relieve cara she needs to get to bed too set a guard for kahlans rooms and then both of you get some rest ive had enough of this day too richard was in a dead sleep when he awakened to a hand pushing at him he sat up and rubbed at his eyes trying to gather his senses in a panic what what is it his voice sounded to him like gravel being poured from a bucket lord rahl came a tearful voice are you awake richard squinted up at the figure holding a lamp at first he couldnt make out who it was berdine he had never seen her in anything but her leather uniform before she was standing in his room in a white nightdress her hair was down he had never seen berdine without her hair in the single braid it was a disorienting sight richard swung his legs over the edge of the bed and pulled his pants on in a rush berdine what is it whats wrong she wiped at the tears on her face lord rahl please come she let out a sob raina is sick chapter verna shut the door as silently as she could after warren dragged the flailing woman back into the darkness his hand was clamped just as tightly over her mouth as his web was clamped around her gift verna wouldnt have been able to control the womans magic as well as could warren the gift of a wizard was stronger than a sorceressseven vernasgift verna lit a small flame above her upturned palm the womans eyes widened and then filled with tears yes janet its me verna if you promise not to cry out and betray us i will have warren release you janet nodded earnestly verna gripped her dacra in her other fist held out of sight just in case she was wrong she gave a nod to warren signaling him to release the young woman when she was free janet flung her arms around vernas neck she rejoiced with a soft sob warren held up his palm letting a small flame dance above it so they could see the tiny room was made of huge blocks of dark stone as was the rest of the stronghold milky water seeped through some of the joints leaving trails of crusty stains down the walls oh verna janet whispered you have no idea what a joy it is to see your face verna embraced the trembling woman as she wept softly while clutching at vernas cloak verna still had the dacra in her fist behind janets back verna eased her away to smile at the tearstained face she wiped away some of the tears and smoothed back janets dark locks janet kissed her ring fingeran ancient gesture beseeching the creators protection even though she had been reasonably sure janet was loyal to the light verna was relieved to see such confirmation a sister of the dark was sworn to the keeper of the underworld and would never kiss her ring finger it was an act that represented a sisters symbolic betrothal to the creator it was the one thing that a sister of the dark could not do a sister of the dark could not hide her loyalty to her true master the keeper by kissing her ring finger for kissing that finger would invoke her dark masters wrath verna slipped the dacra back up her sleeve as janet glanced back at warren they exchanged smiles both verna and warren took in janets bizarre garb she was barefoot the baggy garment cinched at the waist with a white cord covered her from ankles to neck to wrists but was so sheer that the woman might as well have been naked between a thumb and finger verna tugged out some of the diaphanous material what in the name of creation are you doing wearing this janet glanced down at herself jagang makes all his slaves dress like this after a while you dont even notice anymore i see verna could see that warren was doing his best to avert his eyes verna what are you doing here janet asked in a demure voice verna grinned and pinched janets cheek i came to get you out of here silly i came to rescue you were friendsdid you think id leave you here janet blinked in astonishment the prelate let you come after me verna lifted her hand showing the woman the sunburstpatterned ring of the prelate i am the prelate janets jaw fell open she dropped to the floor and began kissing the hem of vernas dress verna gripped janets shoulder and urged her to her feet stop that theres no time for that butbut how what happened how can this be what has happened verna those webs wont hold for long warren cautioned in a thin whisper weve already overstayed our welcome janet listen to me we can talk later after we get you out of here the things we had to do to get in here only give us a brief time to get back out its dangerous for us to be here i should say so janet said prelate you must verna were friends its still verna verna how in creation did you ever get into jagangs stronghold you must get out at once if you are found verna frowned and touched the ring through janets lower lip whats this janet paled it marks me as one of jagangs slaves she started shivering verna save yourself get out of here you must get out she whispered urgently i agree warren whispered through gritted teeth lets go verna pushed her cloak back over her shoulders out of the way i know now that weve got you we can go dear creator you have no idea how much id like to go with you but if i didyou cant imagine what jagang would do to me oh dear creator you cant imagine her eyes flooded with tears at the very thought verna embraced her for a moment janet listen to me im your friend you know i wouldnt he to you she waited until the other nodded there is a way to keep the dream walker from your mind janet clutched vernas dress at the shoulders verna dont torment me with hope that i know is false you have no idea how much id like to believe you but i know its true listen to me janet im the prelate now dont you think jagang would take me if he could why do you think he hasnt taken the others he cant thats why janet was shivering again tears running down her cheeks warren put a hand to her back what verna says is true sister janet jagang cant get into our minds come with us and you will be safe hurry how janet whispered verna leaned close you remember richard of course trouble and wonder in one person verna smiled at the truth of that he has the gift thats why i went after him but there is more to it he is born with both sides of it more than that though he is a rahl three thousand years ago in the great war richards ancestor created a magic to block the dream walkers of that time from his peoples minds that magic was passed down to his descendants who have the gift janets fists tightened on vernas dress how how does it work verna smiled its so simple that its hard to believe the most powerful magic is sometimes like that all that is necessary is to be sworn to him in your heart and his magic protects you from the dream walker as long as richard is alive and in this world jagang will never again be able to enter your mind i swear allegiance to richard and im free of jagang verna nodded at the womans stunned face its true what do i have to do verna held up a finger to forestall warrens objections she went to her knees pulling janet down with her say the words with me and mean them in your heart richard is a war wizard and leads us in our fight against jagang we believe in him in his heart with all our hearts say the words with me and believe and you will be free janet nodded as she clasped her hands prayerfully tears coursed down her cheeks verna whispered the devotion pausing so janet could repeat the words after her master rahl guide us master rahl teach us master rahl protect us in your light we thrive in your mercy we are sheltered in your wisdom we are humbled we live only to serve our lives are yours janets whispered words echoed vernas until she was finished verna kissed janets cheek you are free my friend now hurry lets get out of here janet snatched vernas sleeve what about the others verna hesitated janet i would like nothing better than to rescue the rest of our sisters too but i cant not now we will try to get them later if we try now jagang will have us i came to get you because you are my friend and i love you the five of us all swore to always protect each other phoebe is with us already there is only you left as much as i want to rescue the rest of our sisters it must be left until later i promise you i wont forget them or leave them but we cant do it all now all at once janets head lowered and she stared at the floor jagang killed christabel i saw him do it her screams still haunt my nightmares her screams and jagang verna felt as if she had been punched in the gut christabel had been her best friend she didnt want to know the details christabel had turned to the keeper thats why i have to get you out of here janet my fear for you and for what jagang has done to you haunts my nightmares janets head came up what about amelia she was one of us five we cant leave her verna gave janet a level look amelia is a sister of the dark was janet said no longer what verna whispered warren leaned over once youre sworn to the keeper you cant change your mind you cant trust what she says sister janet now lets get out of here shes sworn to the keeper janet shook her head no longer jagang sent her on some sort of mission involving magic and in order to accomplish her task she was forced to betray the keeper impossible verna said true janet insisted shes back she has resworn her oath to the creator ive talked to her she sits and weeps kissing her ring finger half the night praying to the creator verna leaned closer looking into janets eyes janet listen to me have you seen her kiss her ring finger have you seen it with your own eyes are you absolutely sure she wasnt kissing another finger ive sat with her trying to comfort her ive watched her janet kissed her own finger with a whispered supplication that if she wasnt telling the truth she would be struck dead just like that she kisses her finger just like that yes she kisses her finger and cries and prays that the creator will kill her for the horror of what she has done what has she done i dont know when i ask she practically goes crazy with screaming and weeping jagang wont let her kill herself he has control of her mind as he does with the rest of us he wouldnt let any of us kill ourselves we must continue to serve him verna we cant leave amelia here we have to take her with us i wont leave her here im the only comfort she has in this world the things jagang does to her verna turned away her stomach roiled at the thought of leaving amelia if indeed she had abandoned the keeper the five of them had been best friends for close to one hundred fifty years since they were young novices the life of a sister of the light was a difficult one they had sworn oaths always to protect one another verna she is one of us a sister of the light again she is one of us five please verna id rather stay with her than leave her here alone verna glanced back to janets haunted eyes verna we must call him excellency janet said in a shuddering whisper if we displease him for any reason at all we have to serve a week in the tents warren spoke vernas name with rising inflection verna waved him to silence the tents what are you saying janets eyes flooded with tears again he gives us to his soldiers for a week we have gold rings so they wont kill us because those with gold rings belong to jagang but they can do whatever else they want they pass us from tent to tent for a week even the old sisters are sent to the tents jagang calls it a lesson in discipline that all must learn janet fell to her knees convulsing in sobs as she covered her mouth with both hands verna sank down beside her and hugged her you dont know what jagangs men do to us janet cried you dont know verna i understand verna whispered hush now its all right now well get you away from here janet shook her head against vernas shoulder i wont leave amelia here im all she has im a sister of the light the creator would never forgive me if i abandoned her if i leave her id be leaving my duty to the creator shes my friend she came back to the light she came back to the creator jagang sent her to the tents again if im not here when she comes back shell go crazy no one else will tend to her the sisters of the dark wont go near her and the sisters of the light wont forgive her im her only friend im the only one who forgave her and accepted her back to the light shell be a bloody mess when she gets back you dont know what jagangs men are like except for broken bones jagang wont allow us to use the gift to heal one another when we come back from the tents he says its part of the lesson that our souls may belong to the creator when we die but in this life jagang owns our bodies we can have our broken bones knitted by the gift when we come back but until then we have to suffer the agony of that along with everything else if im not here no one else will heal that much for her or comfort her janet was nearly hysterical i wont leave without amelia verna felt dizzy and sick to her stomach her heart pounded in terror bile rose into her throat vernas voice broke how do you endure it janet held her fists to her heart we are sisters of the light we must endure for the creator verna shared a long look with warrens troubled eyes do you know where we can find her maybe we could go find her and take her with us janet shook her head were passed among the tents she could be anywhere the army is spread out for miles and miles in every direction not long ago more captured women were sent back here the screams are everywhere so you cant simply follow the sounds of screams besides if we went out among the tents we wouldnt last five minutes before we were dragged into one of them how long verna asked how long until amelia is back five days but she wont be able to walk for at least a day after that maybe two verna held a tight grip on her rage theres nothing saying i cant use my gift to cure her once shes back janet looked up thats true five days then tomorrow night is the full moon the fourth day after the full moon are you able to leave this place in order to meet us i dont think we can get back in here again not very far i cant even imagine how you could have gotten in here verna showed the woman a tight smile im not prelate for nothing warren helped too well come back four nights after the full moon verna theres one other thing if jagang cant enter my dreams he will know something is wrong verna pressed her hands to her face but youve already given the oath you cant take it back or it would mean nothing you have already given your heart to richard then ill have to be careful can you do that can you get away with it janet touched her fingers to her lips what choice do i have ill have to verna held out her dacra here at least you can protect yourself janet pushed it away as if it were poison if i was caught with that thing id be sent out to the tents for a year well at least you can use your gift now that jagang cant enter your mind to prevent it it wont do any good here jagang has total control over all those with the gift who are heresisters and wizards it would be spitting into a storm to try to use my gift against them i know thats why we cant try to take the others right now wed never make it the sisters of the dark would fight us and with their use of subtractive magic they would cut us to pieces verna pressed her lips together janet are you sure about this if i dont help a sister in dire need then what good is my oath as a sister of the light one has come back to us from the keeper perhaps she can teach us how to bring the others back verna had never thought of that warren was making impatient eye signals she could see the muscles in his jaw flexing janet saw too she gripped verna by the shoulders and kissed her cheeks she turned and hugged warren please verna get out of here before its too late ill be able to endure five days i know how to bow and scrape for jagang hes been busy maybe i can stay out of his sight for that long all right where we came down the coast to grafan harbor and i dont know the lay of the land the coast then you would have passed the watch house near the docks yes i saw the place but it had guards in it janet leaned close as you said theres nothing stopping you from using your gift the guard changes around sundown wait until you see the guard change and then silence them that will give you a safe place to wait until nearly dawn sometime in the night i will be there with amelia the watch house then fourth night after the full moon janet gave her a quick hug five nights and were free hurry get out of here warren snatched vernas arm and pulled her through the door chapter soon after he awoke just before dawn richard stood outside his bedroom reading the morning report for the first time the number of dead in one night had climbed over one thousand a thousand tragedies in one night ulic standing not far away with his massive arms folded asked the number a rare event ulic asking a question richard couldnt speak he handed the report to his bodyguard ulic sighed heavily when he read the number the city was in shambles trade had been disrupted to the point that food was getting scarce firewood used for both heat and cooking was hard to come by services of every kind were difficult to secure either because people were afraid to bring their wares into the city they had abandoned their homes and fled the city or they were dead only the cures in the streets were in abundance richard paused beside a long tapestry of a city market scene as he was headed for his office his shadow glided to a silent halt behind him the thought of going back to translating the book made him nauseous he was finding nothing new anyway he was mired in a long report on an inquiry into the dealings wizard ricker had had with a people called the andolians it was boring and made little sense to him richard couldnt face the book again this early in the day besides he was worried sick about raina in the last week she had only gotten worse nothing could be done for her any more than anything could be done for the thousand people who had died the night before shota had told kahlan that the temple of the winds would send another message would send a way to get in the spirit had told her the same thing why hadnt it come would they all be dead before the winds sent word richard glanced out an east window and saw the first rays of the morning sun coming from between two mountains with the gathering clouds he had already seen coming in from the west he knew that they wouldnt be seeing the full moon that night he headed for kahlans room he had to see her face see something that could lift his spirits ulic took up station beside egan at the corner of the hall egan had been with kahlans guard the night before richard was greeted by nancy just coming out the door is kahlan up nancy pulled the door closed behind herself she glanced up the hall to see ulic and egan they were too far away to hear yes lord rahl she is just a little slow this morning she isnt feeling well richard gripped the womans arm he thought that kahlan had looked out of sorts for the last few days but she had steadfastly dismissed his concerns richard could feel the blood draining from his face whats wrong is she sick she doesnt no no nancy insisted suddenly realizing that she had frightened the wits out of him nothing like that then whats wrong richard pressed the woman patted her lower belly and leaned close she let her voice drop to little more than a whisper its just her cycle of the moon thats all itll be over in a couple more days i wouldnt say anything mind you but with the plague i dont want you to worry yourself to death just dont tell her i told you or shell bite off my head richard sighed as he smiled with relief he squeezed nancys hand in appreciation of course not thank you nancy you dont know how much that eases my mind i couldnt endure it if she nancy touched his arm as she gave him a warm smile i know thats the only reason i said anything after nancy had trundled off down the hall richard knocked on the door kahlan had been just about to open it and was surprised to find him standing there she smiled up at him i was wrong about what you are more handsome than i remembered richard grinned she had lifted his spirits he gave her a quick kiss when she rose on her toes and puckered her lips richard gathered up her hand im on my way to check on raina want to come with me she nodded the mirth ghosting away from her face berdine met them not far from their room her eyes were red and leaden she wore red leather richard didnt ask why lord rahl please raina is asking for you richard enclosed her shoulders with one arm we were on our way there come on richard didnt ask how berdine was it was obvious she was sick with worry berdine some people have recovered from the plague no one is stronger than raina she is mordsith she will be one of the ones who recovers berdine nodded woodenly raina was lying on her bed she was wearing her red leather standing in the doorway richard leaned toward berdine and whispered why is she dressed he left the obvious question of why she was wearing her red leather unasked berdine clutched his arm she asked me to dress her in the red leather of a mordsithberdine stifled a wailfor the final battle richard sank to his knees beside the bed rainas halfopen eyes rolled toward him sweat ran from her face her lower lip quivered raina gripped richards arm lord rahl please take me out to see reggie reggie the chipmunks please take me out to feed reggie hes the one missing the end of his little tail his heart breaking he smiled for her it would be my honor he scooped her up in his arms she had lost a lot of weight she hardly weighed anything raina wrapped a weak arm around his neck as she cuddled her head to his shoulder while he carried her through the halls berdine walked beside them holding rainas other hand kahlan walked at his other side ulic and egan marched behind soldiers along the way silently stepped clear eyes to the ground giving a salute of fist to heart as richard and the procession passed the salute was for raina outside richard sat on the stone court in the light of the dawning sun holding raina in his lap berdine sat on her heels by her head kahlan sat on his other side ulic and egan hands clasped behind their backs stood not far to the rear richard saw a tear or two wend its way down each of their stony faces over there richard said to kahlan pointing with his chin give me that box kahlan turned and saw what he meant he kept seeds in a box under a stone bench she wiggled off the lid and held out the box richard scooped out a handful of seeds and tossed some on the ground before them he trickled the rest into rainas bony hand it wasnt long before two chipmunks tails twitching scampered across the lawn richard had fed them enough so they knew that the appearance of people might mean food they stuffed seeds in their cheeks as best they could between sudden chattering bouts of trying to chase each other away raina watched her eyes only half opened her agiel dangled from the chain on the wrist of the hand that berdine held the two chipmunks their cheeks full scurried for their burrows to store their booty raina opened her arm out and rested her hand on the paving stone she uncurled her fingers each shallow breath rattled berdine tenderly stroked rainas forehead another chipmunk appeared from under a bush he came partway toward them froze stiff while he checked for threat and then dashed the rest of the way he was missing the end of his tail reggie raina breathed raina smiled as reggie climbed into her open hand he sat there pressing his little feet against her fingers as he popped seeds into his mouth with his tongue he paused sitting up in her hand to rearrange the seeds stuffed in his cheeks satisfied he dropped back down putting his little feet to rainas fingers again raina let out a soft giggle berdine kissed her forehead i love you raina she whispered i love you berdine richard felt rainas muscles go slack as she died in his arms while reggie sat eating seeds from her hand chapter kahlan stood behind richard as he sat in his chair in his office her arms circled around his neck her cheek laid against the top of his head as she wept richard rolled rainas agiel in his fingers berdine said that raina had wanted him to have it berdine had asked for permission to go up to the keep to tell cara she also asked if she could take her turn at watch over the sliph as cara had been up there for the last three days richard told her that she could do whatever she wished for as long as she wished and that if she wanted him to take her watch or to come sit with her he would she had said that she wanted to be alone for a while why hasnt the temple sent its message kahlan smoothed his hair i dont know what are we going to do he asked it wasnt a question for which he expected an answer i just dont know what to do kahlan rubbed her palms up and down the sides of his shoulders do you think you might find an answer in the trial record for all i know it could be the very last line i translate that gives me any information i can use he slowly shook his head long before i can translate every line well all be dead richard hooked rainas agiel on the chain along with the amulet at his chest the red color of the agiel matched the ruby silence hung in the air for a time before he said jagang is going to win kahlan turned his head toward her dont say that please dont say that he forced a smile youre right well beat him a knock came to the door ulic stuck his head in when richard called to ask who it was lord rahl general kerson wanted to know if he could talk to you for a minute kahlan patted richards shoulder im going to go tell drefan and nadine about raina richard walked to the door with her general kerson was waiting outside with his usual fistful of reports ill catch up with you in a few minutes richard said as kahlan left richard to hear the generals reports egan fell in with her it felt odd to be guarded by egan alone without a mordsith one of them had always seemed to be around mother confessor egan said some people just arrived at the palace and wanted to see you and lord rahl i told them that everyone was busy i didnt want to burden lord rahl petitioners hall must be packed with people who want to see us what with all the trouble they arent in petitioners hall the guards stopped them as they went into one of the reception rooms they arent exactly arrogant like some of the representatives ive seen but they are insistent in an odd sort of way kahlan frowned up at the huge blond dharan did they say who they were did you find out that much at least they said they were andolians kahlan jerked to a halt seizing egans massive arm andolians and the guards let them in they let andolians in the palace egans brow drew down i didnt hear how they got in only that they were here is this a problem mother confessor the mans hand was already on his sword no its not that its just that dear spirits how do you explain the andolians she searched for the right words they arent exactlyhuman what do you mean there are creatures of magic that live in the midlands there are people with magic who live in the midlands it is sometimes difficult to know where to place the line separating them some of these people with magic are part creaturelike the andolians magic egan asked with obvious distaste are they dangerous kahlan heaved a sigh as she changed her mind about where she was going and instead started out for the reception hall not exactly at least not usually not if you know how to treat them no one knows a great deal about the andolians we leave them alone most people of the midlands have a strong dislike for them the andolians steal things not for the wealth of the object but simply because the andolians are fascinated by things shiny things mostly a piece of glass a gold piece or a buttonits all the same to them people dont like them because the andolians look much like you and i and so people think they should behave like people but they arent people exactly they usually show up in places out of simple curiosity we dont allow them in the palace because they cause such a disruption its best to simply keep them out with the magic they have if you try to discipline them they can turn nasty very nasty perhaps i should have the soldiers get rid of them no that could get ugly dealing with them requires a very special kind of protocol fortunately i know the protocol ill get rid of them how the andolians like to carry messages they like that more than anything more than shiny objects even they love to carry messages for people i guess it makes them feel more connected to their human side to be involved in human affairs some people in the midlands use them for that purpose andolians will carry a message more faithfully than any courier they will do it for a shiny button they would even do it for no compensation they live to convey messages all i have to do is give them a message to carry and they will be off to deliver it thats the easiest way to get rid of an andolian will it get rid of all of them egan asked as he scratched his head all of them dear spirits dont tell me that there are more than a couple seven six women who all look alike and one man kahlan lost a stride i dont believe it that would be the legate rishi and his six wives all sisters the six sisters were all born of the same litter the andolians believed that only a litter of six females were worthy to be the legates wives kahlans head spun as she tried to concentrate through the depression over rainas death over all the deaths she had to think of a place to send the andolians and a message for them to carry maybe something about the plague she could send them somewhere with a warning about the plague maybe down into the wilds most of the people of the wilds tolerated the andolians better than most other people in the midlands a throng of guards bristling with weapons filled the halls all around the reception room two guards with pikes opened the tall mahoganypaneled doors as kahlan and egan approached the reception hall where waited the andolians was one of the smaller ones without windows sculptures of every sort from rulers busts to a farmer and oxen most done in pale marble rested on square granite blocks placed back against the dark walls behind each sculpture ornamental drapery of a rich maroon was swagged back to halfcolumns of dark violet marble set against the walls between each sculpture it lent each piece the air of being displayed on a stage with curtains opening for them four separate clusters of ornate lamps with cutglass chimneys hung on silver chains because of the dark decor the dozens of lamps were unable to bring anything brighter than a somber atmosphere to the room three heavy dark tables sat on the black marble floor the andolians stood before one of these tables the six sisters were tall and slender and kahlan couldnt tell one from another their hair was dyed a bright orange with the berries of a basset bush that grew in the andolians homeland their homeland wasnt close they had made a long journey to get to aydindril their big round black eyes watched kahlan approach their orange hair woven into hundreds of small braids made the women look as if they wore wigs of orange yarn woven into the yarnlike hair were small shiny thingsbuttons pieces of metal gold and silver coins shards of glass chips of obsidianany scrap that they found shiny enough for their taste all six were dressed in simple but elegant white robes of a lustrous satiny material despite what kahlan knew about the andolianssuch as the way a simple storm could send them puling for protection under a bush or a hole in the ground they had a noble air kahlan guessed that made sense they were after all the wives of the legate the leader of the andolians the legate himself was shorter than his wives and much older other than his round black eyes he looked to be nothing more than a distinguished official a bit on the stocky side a bald pate shone above his fringe of white hair some kind of grease had been rubbed on it so as to make it glossy he wore robes similar lo his wives but of gold material trimmed with rows of shiny objects sewn on each finger had at least one ring from a distance all the shiny objects made him look opulent closer up he looked more like a crazy beggar who had dug through a midden heap to pluck out worthless items discarded by normal people legate rishis eyes were redrimmed and leadenlooking he wore a doltish grin and swayed on his feet kahlan saw him infrequently but she didnt remember him this way the six sisters formed into a line before him they straightened putting their shoulders back with pride we share the moon one of the six said we share the moon kahlan said in their traditional greeting among females her waning cramps reminded her that the greeting had more than one meaning the rest spoke the greeting in turn the way those big black eyes blinked as they watched her gave kahlan shivers when they had finished with the official greeting the six split into two groups of three and backed to either side of their husband the legate lifted a hand as if a king greeting a crowd he grinned moronically kahlan frowned at his odd behavior although she wasnt at all sure that for an andolian it was odd we share the sun he said in a slur we share the sun kahlan answered but he ignored her as his attention was diverted by something behind her kahlan turned and saw richard striding across the room a glower heating his expression whats this about the moon richard asked as he came up beside kahlan she took his hand richard she said in a tone of warning this is legate rishi and his wives they are andolians i have just given them their traditional greeting thats all his expression slackened oh i see when they said something about the mooni thought the blood suddenly drained from richards face andolians he whispered to himself wizard ricker was doing something with the andolians he seemed lost in a confusion of thought we share the sun legate rishi said through his grin the females share the moon a female and a male share the sun but not the moon richard rubbed his brow he looked engrossed in recollection or confusion kahlan squeezed his hand hoping he would get the message to let her handle this she turned back to the legate legate rishi i would like you to our husband has been drinking things that make him happy one of the wives said as if it were a fascinating bit of news he has been trading some of his prizes for this drink her expression turned perplexed it makes him slow too or we would have been here sooner thank you for telling me this kahlan said one had always to thank an andolian for any information they offered about themselves information about themselves so given was considered a gift kahlan turned her attention once more to the legate legate rishi i would like you to carry an important message for me sorry the legate said we can carry no message for you kahlan was dumbfounded she had never heard of an andolian refusing to carry a message but why not one of the six leaned toward kahlan because we already carry a message of great importance you do her big black eyes blinked yes the greatest of all honors husband carries a message from the moon you what richard whispered as his head came up the moon sends a message from the winds the legate said in a drunken slur kahlan felt as if the world had frozen we would have been here sooner but husband had to stop many times to have the drink of happiness kahlan felt her whole body tingle with icy dread been here sooner richard repeated while all those people died youve been drinking his voice boomed like thunder raina died because youve been out getting drunk richard exploded in a blur of movement his fist striking legate rishi so hard that the man tumbled back over the table people are dying and youre out getting drunk richard roared as he vaulted over the table richard no kahlan shrieked he has magic kahlan saw a blur of red racing in from the side cara came at a dead run and dived over the table knocking richard sprawling across the floor legate rishi rose up in a rage blood frothed at his mouth strings of it whipped from his chin wavering flares of light and undulating flutters of darkness radiated up his arms gathering at his chest as he rose up he was gathering his magic preparing to unleash it against richard richard went for his sword cara shoved richard again and rebounded back at the legate backhanding him across his bloody mouth the legate whirled redirecting his rage at her catquick cara spun past him striking him again turning his attention away from richard as he followed her his magic already gathered he unleashed it at her the air thumped and at the same time seemed to oscillate the legate went down with a grunt of pain cara was on him before he hit the ground she pressed her agiel to his throat you are mine now she sneered as he gagged in agony your magic is mine now cara kahlan yelled dont kill him the six sisters were squatted down in a shivering clump bugging one another in terror kahlan put a hand to the frightened sisters reassuring them that they wouldnt be harmed cara dont hurt him kahlan said he carries a message from the temple of the winds caras head came up she had a disturbing look in her eyes i know it came to him with magic his magic is mine now the message he carries is embedded within his magic richard let his sword drop back into its scabbard you mean you know the message cara nodded her blue eyes filling with tears i know it with him i share his magic his knowledge of the message ulic egan richard said clear the soldiers out shut the doors keep everyone out as ulic and egan were ushering the soldiers out richard seized the legate by the robes at his throat and lifted him he heaved him into a chair richard lowered over the suddenly meeklooking panting andolian leader his chest heaving richard gripped the amulet and rainas agiel in a fist the muscles in his jaw flexed as he pointed at the legates face lets have the message and you had better tell it true thousands of people have already died while you delayed your arrival to get drunk the message from the winds is for two people richard looked up the words had come not only from the legate but also from cara she had spoken the words along with him cara do you know the message too just as he does cara looked as surprised as richard i it came to me as it came to him i knew only that he carried a message he didnt know it until he spoke it i knew it when he did who is the message for kahlan knew for wizard richard rahl and for mother confessor kahlan amnell once again both had spoken the words what is the message richard asked kahlan knew she went to richards side taking his hand in hers holding it for dear life the room was empty of everyone except richard kahlan cara legate rishi and the six sisters cowering under a table the lamps around the room dimmed as if their wicks had been turned down it cast them all in an eerie wavering light the legate his face gone blank looked to have gone into a trance he rose from the chair blood still dripping from his chin his arm lifted pointing at richard only he spoke this time the winds summon you wizard richard rahl magic has been stolen from the winds and used in this world to cause harm you must wed in order to enter the temple of the winds your wife is to be one named nadine brighton unable to speak richard brought kahlans hand to his heart holding it there in both of his hands caras arm lifted pointing at kahlan only she spoke this time in a frigid heartless voice the winds summon you mother confessor kahlan amnell magic has been stolen from the winds and used in this world to cause harm you must wed in order to help wizard richard rahl enter the temple of the winds you husband is to be one named drefan rahl richard dropped to his knees kahlan sank down beside him she thought she should feel something she felt only numbness it seemed a dream she had thought it would never come now that it was happening it seemed too fast as if she were tumbling over a cliff grasping for a handhold but finding nothing to stop her fall as she plunged into icy blackness it was over everything was over her life her dreams her future her joy was over it only remained to act it out until the end richards ashen face looked up from caras feet cara please im begging you dont do this to us his voice broke dear spirits please dont do this to us cara caras cold blue eyes stared back i do not do this to you i only bear the message from the winds you must both agree to this if you wish to enter the temple of the winds why must kahlan marry the winds require a virgin bride richards eyes darted to kahlan he looked back to cara she isnt a virgin yes she is cara said no shes not kahlan put her forehead against the side of richards face as she gripped his muscular neck hugging herself to him yes richard i am she whispered in this world i am shota told me that that was all that mattered to the spirits in this world in our world the world of life i am a virgin we were together in another world it doesnt apply here thats crazy he whispered in a hoarse voice thats just crazy it fulfills the requirements of the winds cara said this is the only chance you will be offered the legate said if you do not take it then the obligation of the winds to remedy the damage will be ended please cara richard whispered please dont do this there has to be another way this is the only way cara in her red leather lowered above them it is up to you whether you will repair the damage you must agree if you fail to answer the call it will not come again and the magic released will run free the winds wish to know your answer the legate said you must both agree to this of your free will it must be a true marriage in all aspects it must be for life you must both be of honest intent in your marriages and faithful to the ones you wed he speaks the truth of the winds what is your answer cara asked in a voice like ice kahlan looked through the watery blur into richards eyes she could see him dying behind those eyes it is our duty only we can save those people but i will say no if you wish it richard how many more rainas must die in my arms i couldnt ask you to have me at the cost of another life kahlan swallowed the wail is there anything do you know of anything we could do to stop the plague richard shook his head im sorry i have failed you i havent found a way around this you havent failed me richard i couldnt bear to think we were the cause of more death like rainas today she threw her arms around his neck i love you so much richard richards big hand held her head to him we are agreed then we must do this richard brought her to her feet with him there was so much she wanted to say to him no words came when she looked into richards eyes she knew words werent needed they turned to cara and the legate i agree i will marry nadine i agree i will marry drefan kahlan fell into richards arms as she lost control of her tears she sobbed in agony richard embraced her nearly squeezing the life out of her cara and the legate were suddenly there pulling them apart you are each promised to another cara said you may not do this now you must each be loyal to your mates kahlan looked past the legate into richards eyes each of them knowing that they had embraced for the last time in that moment her world ended chapter kahlan and richard sat apart with the legate and cara between them kahlan heard the doors open it was nadine and drefan after ulic had let them in he closed the doors richard raked his hair back as he rose kahlan didnt want to test her legs yet it had all slipped through her fingers everything was lost to duty nadine eyed everyone in the room the legate his six wives cara kahlan and finally richard as he walked haltingly to her richard stared at the floor you both know that the plague was started with magic i told you both how it was stolen from the temple of the winds the temple has sent its requirements if i am to be allowed to enter and stop the plague the temple requires that both kahlan and i wed the temple has named who it is it requires we wed im sorry that both of you have been tangled in this i dont know the reason the temple will not explain why it must be so only that this is our only chance to halt the plague i cant force either of you to be part of this i can only ask richard cleared his throat trying to steady his voice he lifted nadines hand he couldnt look her in the eye nadine will you marry me nadines gaze immediately went to kahlan kahlan wore her confessors face as her mother taught her duty as her mother had taught her nadine glanced to the others and then back to the top of richards head do you love me richard richard finally looked up into her eyes no im sorry nadine but no i dont love you she was unruffled by the answer kahlan was sure that she had expected it ill marry you richard ill make you happy youll see youll come to love me in time no nadine richard whispered i wont we will be husband and wife if you agree to this and i will be faithful to you but my heart will always belong to kahlan im sorry to say such a harsh thing to you when im asking you to marry me but i wont deceive you nadine thought a moment well many marriages are arranged and they turn out well in the end she smiled at him to kahlan it looked a sympathetic smile the spirits have arranged this one that means something i will marry you richard richard glanced back at kahlan it was her turn she saw in those dead gray eyes a glimmer of something rage kahlan knew that his insides were being torn apart the same as were hers she found herself before drefan before she realized it the first time she tried her voice wouldnt come out it simply wouldnt she tried again drefan will you be my husband his blue darken rahl eyes appraised her without emotion for some reason she recalled his hand between caras legs and she almost vomited as nadine said i could do worse than a marriage arranged by the spirits i dont suppose theres any chance you will ever come to love me kahlans jaw trembled as she stared at the floor her voice wouldnt work she shook her head well no matter we may still have some good times ill do it i will marry you kahlan she was glad that she had never told richard about what drefan had done to cara if she had richard might have lost control when drefan said he would marry kahlan and pulled free his sword cara and the legate stepped forward it is agreed then they said as one the winds are pleased to have the consent of all involved when richard asked in a hoarse voice when will we when do we and when can i get into the temple of the winds people are dying i have to help the winds put a stop to it tonight cara and the legate said as one we will leave immediately for mount kymermosst you will be wed tonight as soon as we arrive there kahlan didnt ask how they would get to a place that wasnt there anymore it didnt really matter to her the only thing that really mattered to her was that they would be wed that very night im sorry about raina nadine said to richard how is berdine doing not well shes up at the keep richard turned to cara can we stop up there on our way i must tell her what has happened she will have to stay to guard the sliph until i return i have to tell her and id like to give her something to help her feel better nadine said it is permitted cara said in that awful icy voice berdine looked terrorstricken when richard told her she threw her arms around him and wept with twin misery the sliph watched from her well frowning with curiosity nadine mixed things from pouches in her big bag giving berdine instructions on when to take them promising that it would help her get through her grief richard tried to tell berdine everything he could think of that she might need to know kahlan could almost feel time tingling against her flesh as it flew past as she plunged and plunged into the black depths we must go cara said cutting off the stalling we must ride hard to arrive before the full moon rises how will i find the temple of the winds richard asked you do not find the temple of the winds cara said the temple of the winds will find you if the requirements are met nadine lifted her bag before richard can i leave this here then its heavy to carry if were coming back here anyway of course richard said his voice a dead monotone kahlan was made to walk behind richard and beside drefan as they returned to the horses nadine touched richards back as she walked beside him she was doing a fair job of restraining her joy over her triumph yet it was a touch meant to send a message he belonged to her now at the bottom of the keep road as they turned away from the city kahlan could hear the men with the deadcarts calling out for people to bring out their dead soon that would be ended as the suffering and death of the plague was ended only in that did she find any solace the children their parents would live if only it had come in time for raina berdine hadnt said that but kahlan knew that that thought was screaming in her head richard had ordered all their guards to remain when ulic and egan had seen the look on his face they hadnt argued only richard and nadine kahlan and drefan cara the legate and his six wives rode out for mount kymerrmosst kahlan didnt know how any of it was going to work getting into the temple of the winds nor did richard she didnt have the slightest curiosity about it the only thing she could think about was richard marrying nadine kahlan was sure that richard could think of nothing but her marrying drefan as they rode drefan told stories trying to keep everyone entertained trying to lift their spirits kahlan didnt hear much of it she watched richards back her only need was to be looking when he glanced back at her as he did from time to time she couldnt bear not to look at him yet meeting his eyes was like a hot knife searing into her heart she took no joy in the mountainous country they rode into the greening grass unfurling ferns budding trees the day was warm compared to what the weather had been for spring so far but the sky brooded with dark clouds before the day was out she expected they would encounter a storm the andolians cringed every time their eyes turned up kahlan pulled her cloak tighter around herself she thought about her blue wedding dress back in her room that she had planned to wear when she married richard she felt herself getting angry at him he had seduced her into thinking she could have love could have happiness seduced her into forgetting she had only duty seduced her into loving him when she realized she was angry at him the tears came again running down her face in a silent torrent this wasnt happening just to her it was happening to him too they shared this torment she thought about the first time she saw him it seemed so long ago that she had been running from darken rahls assassins and richard had helped her she thought about all the things they had done together all the times she stood watch while he slept and she gazed at him imagining being just a normal woman who could fall in love instead of a confessor who had to keep her feelings secret and live a loveless life of duty richard had found a way though found a way that she a confessor could have love and now it was in ashes why would the spirits do this to them the answer came when she remembered her talk with shota and with the spirit there were not only good spirits but evil spirits too those evil spirits had a hand in this they were the ones who wanted this who demanded it as the price of the path the spirits who demanded that price were worse than evil late in the morning they stopped to rest the horses and eat nadine and drefan talked with their mouths full the legate sat back as his wives fed him he had a hard time what with his cut lip they rubbed their legs against his giggling as he took food from their fingers they ate between offering him bites cara ate in silence kahlan didnt notice what any of them had to eat she and richard didnt eat they both sat on the sunny rocks like deadwood silent sullen staring at nothing when the others had finished with their meal richard watched as they all mounted up again even though none of the others noticed it kahlan could see the smoldering rage in his eyes the spirits had chosen drefan to wound him they could have done nothing worse hows the arm nadine asked drefan as they all started out again drefan held it up and flexed his fingers in demonstration nearly good as new kahlan ignored their conversation all morning they had chattered in her silent world it was barely noticed what is wrong with your arm master drefan one of the six sisters asked oh some miscreant didnt like the way i try to purge the world of sickness big black eyes blinked at him what did he do to you drefan straightened haughtily in his saddle cut me with his knife tried to kill me the filthy scum why did he not succeed drefan dismissed the incident with an arrogant wave once i showed him some steel he ran for his life i sewed his wound nadine told the amazed sisters and a deep one it was too drefan cast a glance at nadine that seemed to make her shrink in her saddle i told you nadine its nothing i dont want sympathy a lot of people are in much greater need than he relented when he saw the sheepish look on her face but you did a good job as fine as any of my healers would have done you did a fine job and i appreciate it nadine smiled as they rode on drefan pulled up the broad hood of his flaxen cloak dear spirits she thought that is to be my husband for the rest of my life this is to be my partner in life until she could die and be with richard again sweet death could not come soon enough clarissa wiped her sweaty palms together as she peered through the keyhole and listened to nathan speaking with the sisters in the other room im sure you can understand lord rahl sister jodelle said this is for your own safety too nathan chuckled how good of the emperor to consider my wellbeing if as you say richard rahl will be eliminated tonight then you have nothing to be concerned about we will bring it afterwards surely this would be satisfactory nathan shot them a hot glare i told you jagangs plan has worked richard rahl will be eradicated tonight you will learn not to question me after tonight i pray clarissa had to strain to see nathan through the keyhole as he turned away from the two sisters while he considered he turned back to them and he has agreed to everything else everything sister willamina assured him he looks forward to having you as his plenipotentiary in dhara and is most agreeable to your offer of aid with the books of prophecy he has collected over the years nathan grunted where are they i dont know that im amenable to traveling all over the old world just to have a look at worthless volumes i have business in dharan after all as the new lord rahl i will need to consolidate my authority his excellency has anticipated that this would be inconvenient for you and so has suggested that he will have his wizards pull out things of interest and have them sent to you for your analysis clarissa knew what the sister was talking about before they had arrived nathan had told her that he probably wouldnt be allowed to have a look at the prophecies jagang possessed much less be told where they all were jagang would want nathan to see only selected volumes that had been screened by others first nathan finally turned his full attention to the two sisters in due time in due time once we have worked together and brought the new world to task and have come to fully trust one anothers word then i will happily accept visits by jagangs lapdogs but until then im sure our emperor understands that i am leery of allowing those with the gift to know exactly where i am that is why i will be leaving at once sister jodelle sighed as i said he would be happy to have it brought to you but you can understand that he would have cause for concern to have a wizard of your power whose mind is a mystery to him approach too closely while he is eager for this arrangement he is a man who takes precautions as am i nathan said that is why i cant allow the book to be brought to me having you meet me here again today is the last risk i intend to take in the meantime i want that book until i have it i have no way of knowing if its safe for me to go to dhara his excellency understands and has no disagreement with your request his objective will soon be complete and he therefore has no further need of the book besides a world without people to work for him would be of little value the book only works for sister amelia since she was the one who went to the temple of the winds lo recover it he has offered to let you have either the book or sister amelia if you wish we will send her to you so jagang will know where i am i dont think so sister ill take the book that too is agreeable with his excellency we can send it or have someone meet you to deliver it to you he objects only to you yourself coming to get it for safety reasons as ive already explained nathan rubbed his jaw as he thought what if i sent someone back with you a representative someone with my interests in mind someone loyal to me so i had no need to fear that jagang would delve into their mind and find where i was to be someone without the gift he would have no need to tear them without the gift sister jodelle thought a moment and we could test them without your shields around them to insure that they in fact did not have the gift of course i want this relationship with jagang to work for both of us i wouldnt jeopardize it by trying to deceive him i want to build trust not destroy it nathan hesitated clearing his throat but you understand though that this person is valued to me if anything were to happen to her i would view it in the harshest light both sisters smiled her of course sister willamina said why nathansister jodelle rocked on her heels as she smiledyou really have been enjoying your freedom i mean it nathan said in a level tone anything happens to her and the entire agreement is ended im sending her as a show of my faith in jagang in our agreement im taking the first step of trust so that the emperor will see that i am sincere we understand nathan sister jodelle said more serious now no harm will come to her when she leaves with the book i want her escorted to safety beyond jagangs troops and then left to be on her way if she is followed i will know it if she is followed i will view it in the most unfavorable lightas a sign of hostility toward me and an attempt on my life sister jodelle nodded understood and very reasonable she comes with us gets the book and returns safely to you without being followed and we are all happy good nathan said decisively as if closing the deal after tonight jagang will be rid of richard rahl when i have the book safely in hand then i will have the southern army surrender to jagangs expeditionary force as my part of the bargain sister jodelle bowed we have an agreement lord rahl his excellency wishes to welcome you to the empire as his second nathan turned toward the door clarissa was kneeling behind clarissa jumped up and rushed to the far window she drew back the drapes with a hand and pretended to be gazing out when she heard the door open clarissa nathan called she turned to see him standing in the doorway holding the doorknob beyond him she could see the two sisters watching yes nathan you wish something yes clarissa i would like you to go on a small journey for mea bit of business i need you to go with my friends out here clarissa guided her full skirts around the writing table and followed him out into the other room nathan introduced her to the two sisters the two women wore knowing smug smiles they glanced to her cleavage and then at each other clarissa had that feeling of being judged as a whore again clarissa you will leave at once with these ladies when you reach your destination they will give you a book you will then return with it you remember where i told you we would be off to tomorrow yes nathan you will meet me there after you have the book no one no one at all is to know where it is you

patience at the sudden hitch in their plans i have a carriage ill have it brought around and clarissa can take that there is that satisfactory to all sister jodelle shrugged horse carriage it makes no difference to us as long as we can test her for the gift first test her all you want i will order the carriage while you test her and then clarissa can pack a few things agreed good thats settled then nathan turned to clarissa putting his back to the two sisters it wont be long my dear and well be together again he adjusted the locket hanging from a fine gold chain straightening it for her he looked into her eyes i will be waiting for you ive told these friends of mine that if anything happens to you i will be more than unhappy clarissa stared into his wonderful eyes thank you nathan i will bring the book as you ask nathan kissed her cheek thank you my dear thats good of you safe journey then chapter even with the gathering dark brooding clouds an eerie calm hung over the summit of mount kymermosst the andolians cast uneasy glances skyward as kahlan watched richard dismount his golden cloak hung limp in the unnaturally still air drefan offered her his hand to help her down kahlan pretended not to see it in the fading light the ruins were only ghostly shapes the bones of some long extinct monster waiting to come back to life and swallow her up though this was the night of the full moon the leaden clouds would totally obscure it when the last of the daylight soon left it would be black as death atop the forsaken peak nadine stood close to richard as he stared off toward the edge of the cliff drefan stood nearby not wanting to look too forward to the woman who would shortly be his wife but not wanting to ignore her either like nadine he didnt seem to view this as the end of his happiness after the horses were secured the legate and cara ushered the brides and bridegrooms to a crumbling circular garden structure made up of curved stone benches on one side and broken columns on the other the top piece connecting the columns was mostly missing joining only four of the ten stone columns in the distance in the fading light kahlan could still see the knife edge of the cliff and the black swath of mountains beyond somewhere out there was the temple of the winds kahlan was directed to sit on a curved stone bench beside drefan and richard two benches away was told to sit beside nadine kahlan glanced over and sawrichard looking back but then drefan leaned forward and blocked her view of richard she turned her attention to the legate and cara standing before them the six sisters stood behind their husband we are gathered here the legate and cara said as one to wed richard rahl and nadine brighton and to wed kahlan amnell and drefan rahl this is the most solemn of rites it binds in the most earnest of vows and commits these mates for life this marriage is sanctioned and witnessed by the spirits themselves kahlan stared at the weeds sprouting from the cracks in the disintegrating stone floor as she only partly listened to the words about loyalty fidelity and obligation it was so warm and muggy that she could hardly breathe her white mother confessors dress was sticking to her back sweat trickled down between her breasts kahlans head came up when drefan started lifting her with a hand under her arm what what is it it is time he said come and then she was standing before the legate and cara with drefan beside her and three of the legates wives at her other side as her attendants she looked past drefan to see richard standing beside nadine with the other three andolians serving as her attendants nadine wore a smile if anyone has any objections to the wedding of these people they must speak now for once it is done it cannot be undone i have an objection richard said what is it the legate asked the winds said that this had to be of our own free will it is not we are being coerced into this we are being told that people will die if we dont do this i dont do this of my own free will i do this only to save lives do you wish to save the lives of the people who will die if the magic stolen from the temple of the winds is not stopped the legate asked of course i do this wedding is part of that attempt if you do not go through with it then they will die you wish to save them this qualifies as your free will as far as the spirits involved are concerned if you wish to withdraw your agreement to this then it must be now before the vows afterwards you may not change your mind muggy silence hung in the air she was plummeting helpless into the inky depths it was all happening too fast too fast for her to get a breath i wish to speak with richard if i am to do this before i do this kahlan said alone the legate and cara stared at her a moment then hurry they said as one there is not much time the moon rises they both walked far enough away from the circle that kahlan could be reasonably sure they couldnt be heard she stood close facing him she wanted richard to save them from this he had to save them he had to do something now or it would be too late richard were out of time is there anything can you think of anything at all to stop this any way we can still save those people and not have to do this richard stood close to her and yet a world away im sorry i dont have any other solution forgive me he whispered i have failed you she shook her head no you didnt dont ever think that richard i dont the spirits have made it impossible for us to win they wish this and have put us in a double bind but at least if we go through with this jagang will not win that is more important how many lovers like us will be able to have a life now have happiness now have children now because of the sacrifice we make this night richard smiled that smile that melted her heart thats one reason i love you so much your passion even if i never see you again ive known true happiness with you true love how many ever experience even this small taste kahlan swallowed richard if we do this we have to be true to our vows dont we we cant still be together sometimes can we the way his jaw trembled and his eyes filled with tears was more than answer enough just before they fell into each others arms cara was there between them it is time what are your wishes i have a lot of them richard said with sudden venom which do you want to hear the winds wish to know if you will do this or not we will do it richard growled but the spirits had better know that i will have revenge the winds are simply doing the only thing they can do to stop the death caused by what was stolen from them cara said with sudden compassion but still with that haunting quality that told kahlan that it wasnt cara speaking but the winds they do not do this out of animosity a wise man once told me that dead is dead no matter the how richard said he defiantly took kahlans hand and walked with her back to the circle of stone where they each took their places beside their chosen kahlan wore her confessors face as she stood beside drefan she felt pain for richard he had not grown up being taught how to subjugate his emotions his longings his desiresfor duty she had had a lifetime to prepare for this final torment he had had a lifetime to prepare for the opposite expecting he would have happiness kahlan had only briefly felt the warmth of that flame with deliberate care she ignored the words spoken to nadine and then to drefan words of loyalty and devotion to their mate kahlan instead focused her mind on richard hoping to pass to him some strength hoping that he could get through this so that they could save those stricken and stop the plague richard still had to get into the temple of the winds he needed strength soon the ceremony would be over and they would head back to aydindril perhaps they would have to wait until richard went into the temple and did what he had to do and then they would return to aydindril in any event it wouldnt be long and she would be going home home to the place she had grown up to a life of duty to which she had been bred yes or no the legate said kahlan looked up what he glanced up at the threatening clouds and then took a hurried breath do you swear to honor this man to obey him as the master of your home to care for his needs when he is well and when he is ill and to be his loyal wife in this life as long as you both live kahlan glanced up at drefan she wondered what he had sworn to i swear to whatever it is that is required of me to stop the plague yes or no kahlan let out an angry sigh is this what is required of me to stop the magic stolen from the winds from killing people it is in her mind she swore the oath but to richard not drefan she would swear words aloud to drefan but her heart would always be richards kahlans fists tightened then yes i swear to do what is required to stop the plague i swear not one stitch more nor for one breath longer than that required of me then in full view of the spirits and by the power of the spirits you are now pronounced husband and wife kahlan doubled over in sudden pain it felt as if her insides had been torn apart she tried to pull a breath it wouldnt come she saw swirling color before her wide eyes drefan put his arm around her waist what is it kahlan whats wrong her legs buckled but he held her up it is the spirits came the legate and caras voice together they have bound her power she is to live this marriage as any woman wed to a man her power would have interfered you cant do that richard screamed shell be defenseless you cant take her power her power was not taken but walled away so she cannot use it for the term of her vows to her husband drefan rahl it is done the two said together you will now swear to the vows or you will lose your chance to help the winds kahlan stared at the ground feeling a swirl of emptiness feeling the void between her mind and her power as she listened to similar words spoken before richard she couldnt hear his answer but he must have said what was required because the legate pronounced him and nadine husband and wife they had not only taken her love but her confessors power as the price of the path the emptiness threatened to smother her the profound and sudden sense of loss clouded her mind with blackness darker than the falling night drefan took her arm here youd better sit down even in this light as a healer i can see that you are not well kahlan let him guide her back to a bench and help her to sit your wife will be fine the legate said he looked up at the boiling sky richard rahl drefan rahl come with me where are we going richard wanted to know we are to prepare you to consummate the marriage kahlans head came up even in the darkness she could see that richard was near to exploding in rage his hand was on his sword drefan rubbed kahlans back in sympathy you will be all right everything will be all right dont worry i will take care of you as i promised thank you drefan she managed through the anguish drefan left her and strode to richard drefan gripped richards arm and bent close speaking to him in a whisper kahlan could see richard rake his hands back through his hair and nod occasionally whatever drefan was saying was cooling richard after drefan and richard parted the legate and cara looked back to nadine and kahlan you two will wait here kahlan huddled on the stone bench as richard and drefan were led off in the darkness toward the cliff toward the two buildings one to either side of the road that ended abruptly at the edge it was becoming so dark that kahlan could hardly make out nadines face as she sat down beside her on the stone bench the six sisters had gone back to the horses sucking their fingers as they watched the sky im sorry about your magic i mean i didnt know they would do that to you i guess youll be like any other woman now i guess kahlan nadine said i wont lie to you and tell you that im sorry that im the one who married richard but i will tell you that ill do my best to make him happy nadine you just dont understand do you you can be as kind as pudding to him or you can be as mean as nettles and it wont make any difference with the pain hes in if you do your worst it would be a bee sting after a beheading nadine giggled uncomfortably well i know a poultice for a bee sting richard will see i will you have already promised me that you would be kind to him nadine i appreciate that you will be kind to him but at the moment im not in the mood to hear the details of just how kind you are going to be sure i understand nadine picked at the stone on the bench not the way i had my wedding pictured in my head me neither maybe i can make the rest of it the way i pictured her tone had turned cold and vindictive youve made me to feel a fool for wanting richard for thinking i might have him youve taken the pleasure out of my wedding day but you wont take the pleasure out of the rest of it im sorry nadine if you think that i have now that i have him i intend to show him how a woman can really please a man hell see hell see that i can be just as good a woman for him as you you think i cant but i can nadine leaned close ill have richards eyes spinning in his head before this night is out then well see who the better woman is and how much he misses you when youre lying there with richards brother listen close and youll hear my screams of pleasure the screams of pleasure richard gives me not you me nadine stormed away to stand with her arms folded in a huff kahlan put her face in her hands the spirits werent content to destroy her they had to twist the knife cara and the legate returned it is time they said as one kahlan rose woodenly to stand waiting to be told what to do next the legate turned to cara this storm is going to break soon the legate turned to peer up at the blackness my wives and i must be off this mountain he gripped caras arm the winds speak to you the same as they speak to me can you take them yes it is nearly done i can finish it cara said the winds will pass the message through me as well as through you without further word he scurried off into the darkness caras strong fingers gripped under kahlans arm come with me she said in that icy voice of the winds kahlan dug in her heels cara please i cant you can and you will or the chance will pass and the plague will rage on kahlan pulled back no you dont understand i cant im having my moon flow it isnt finished yet i cant do this not now caras sinister glare drew close it will not prevent you from consummating your marriage you will do this or all hope of stopping the plague is lost it is not finished yet you must do your part in thisindulge in this it must be now tonight or would you rather the dying continue unabated with nadine on one side of her and kahlan on the other cara led them down the road through the darkness toward the edge of the cliff standing in the black night at the edge of the cliff kahlan felt numb and lost she didnt know how long cara was gone with nadine taking her to richard in the crumbling building to the right she felt caras hand under her arm again this way came the icy voice kahlan let the woman lead her to the ruins on the left kahlan could hardly see a thing cara led by the winds had no trouble negotiating the halls and rooms in the wreck of a building they came to a doorway kahlan could just make out drefans sword standing up against the wall outside her fingers rested on its leatherbound hilt inside she could just discern the rectangles where windows once stood beyond was the edge of the cliff and the emptiness where the temple of the winds had once been this is your wife cara said with that icy horrid voice as she spoke into the room here is your husband she said to kahlan this marriage must be consummated it is now your duty to do so the winds have requirements you may ask no more questions do not speak the winds have reasons and it is not for you to know them only to obey if you wish to end the death as the test narrows it becomes more intense you must now lie as husband and wife if either of you utters so much as one word the test will end and entry into the temple of the winds will be denied there can be no appeal the stolen magic will rage on as will the death caused by it only after you have fulfilled the requirements of the consummation will the winds come after the winds comeand you will have no doubt that it has happenedyou may then speak to one another not before cara turned kahlan around and helped her out of her dress and the rest of her things it wasnt hard for kahlan not to speak she had nothing to say kahlan felt the black night air on her naked flesh she glanced down at drefans sword thinking briefly that when it was over she could always use it on herself if not if he denied her access to it there was always the cliff cara gripped kahlan by the wrist and led her forward forcefully cara made her kneel down and then lean forward until kahlan felt the edge of the pallet your husband awaits you here go to him kahlan heard caras footsteps fade into the distance then she was alone with drefan chapter as kahlan felt her way her hand brushed drefans hairy leg she moved off to the side to lie down beside him there was a blanket over straw or something softer than bare wood anyway at least it didnt hurt her back as would have the hard ground she lay on the pallet staring up into the blackness with wide eyes she couldnt see anything other than the vague indication of the windows before them she made an effort to slow her breathing although she could do nothing to slow her panicked pulse this wasnt the worst thing she told herself not the worst thing in the world not at all this wasnt rape exactly after a time she felt drefans hand settle on her belly kahlan shoved it away as she stifled a cry she shouldnt have done that she told herself what was a hand compared to the plague how many people in agony with the plague would gladly have traded places with her not the worst thing at all a gentle hand drefans hand found hers trying to give it a squeeze of reassurance she yanked her hand away as if a snake had touched her she didnt want his reassurance she had not vowed to hold his hand she had not vowed to accept his reassurance she had committed to being his wife not to holding his hand she would let him do to her what she must let him do to her but she didnt have to hold his hand kahlan frantically tried to reason with herself richard had to get into the temple of the winds the temple of the winds demanded this as the price of the path the spirit of chandalens grandfather had warned her that she must not shirk her duty she remembered his words all too well have not been shown the price but i forewarn you that i do know that there is no way for you to circumvent or avoid it it must be as it will he revealed to you or all will be lost i ask that when the winds show you the path you take it lest what i have shown you comes to be kahlan remembered the scenes of mass death the spirit had shown her if she failed to do as the winds asked what she had been shown would come to pass she had to let drefan do this stalling would not make it any easier this couldnt be easy for drefan couldnt be easy at all what with the way she shoved away his attempts at tenderness that made her angry all over again she didnt want his tenderness what did she want did she want him to be rough of course she had to let him touch her how could he do this if he didnt touch her richard had to get into the temple of the winds she had to let drefan do this kahlan reached over and took drefans wrist she put his hand back where he had tried to put it before on her belly she let go of his hand it stayed there what was he waiting for she wanted to scream at him to get it over with to do it and be done to take what was his brothers by heart if not by vow she lay there with drefans hand on her listening to the dead silence of the night she realized that she was listening for sounds coming from nadine and richard she shut her eyes drefans hand moved to her breast fists at her sides she forced herself to remain still she had to let him she tried to think of other things she silently recited rote language lessons of her youth trying to ignore his hand but she couldnt he was being gentle but that was no consolation even his touch was a violation how gently he did it made no difference didnt make it right that he was now her husband made no difference to her she knew in her heart it was wrong and that made it a violation in her mind she screamed at herself she was being worse than childish she was the mother confessor and had faced much worse than this much worse than a man for whom she had no feelings being this close this intimate but she was no longer the mother confessor the temple of the winds the spirits had taken that too from her kahlan gasped in a breath and held it tight as drefans hand roamed down her belly and finally settled between her legs she remembered drefan doing that to cara now he did it to her she hated him she was married to a man she hated cara had felt it the same as kahlan could feel it now cara hadnt been so childish about it cara wouldnt be this foolish kahlan let drefans hand do what it would this was to save lives she had to save all those innocent people from the plague sent by jagang her people couldnt be saved without her it was her duty drefan suddenly rose up the dark shape of him hovered over her his knee pushed gently between her thighs urging her to open her legs it would be over soon she told herself as he put his other knee between her legs too the hulking shape of him lowered over her he was big as big as richard she feared he was going crush her but he didnt he held himself up on his elbows so he wouldnt hurt her he was being tender and she was only making it harder for him he had to do this and she had to let him kahlan grimaced she wasnt ready she held her breath it was too late not to be ready drefan was there she bit her lower lip as she winced she felt as helpless as she had ever felt in her entire life she was married to drefan not richard and drefan not richard was having her everything was lost her eyes squeezed shut kahlan pressed her fists to her shoulders as he moved in her tears trickled from the corners of her eyes her nose stuffed up as she wept silently and she had to open her mouth to breathe she wanted to wail in anguish but she instead had to remind herself to breathe she couldnt seem to stop holding her breath it took longer than she had hoped but not as long as she feared finished at last drefan rolled off her onto his back he had accomplished his task but he seemed not to have relished it she was somehow relieved that he hadnt enjoyed it he lay there recovering his breath as she finally let hers out it was over she told herself that it hadnt been so bad it was nothing really she hardly felt anything she had foolishly balked and here it was over already it wasnt so bad as she had feared it was nothing really but it was she did feel something she felt defiled drefan reached out his fingers tenderly sympathetically brushing a tear from her cheek she shoved his hand away she didnt want his sympathy she didnt want him touching her she hadnt agreed to him touching her just to consummating the marriage his touch wasnt part of it she remembered being with richard she remembered her hot need of him she remembered the wild passion she remembered her screams of sheer pleasure why was this so different because she didnt love drefan that was why in fact she was beginning to realize that she loathed him there was something about him that she didnt like and it was more than just that memory of his hand on cara there was something deceptive about him something devious she hadnt consciously realized it before but she could see guile in his blue eyes kahlan wondered why she would think that he had just consummated their marriage and he had been as gentle as he possibly could be while still doing it he could easily have done anything he wanted her power was locked away she couldnt stop him yet he had tried to be sympathetic understanding still it seemed a wonder to her that it could be so different from when she had been with richard she would give anything almost to have that pleasure again she longed for that fulfillment that satisfaction the sating of lust drefans breathing evened out after a time kahlan lay there in the darkness beside him beside her new husband waiting why hadnt the temple of the winds come she had done her part maybe richard hadnt kahlan wondered if he could after all she had only to lie there richard had to be aroused how could he be aroused over there knowing that his brother was over here having his way with the woman richard loved kahlan had seen the look in richards eyes the look of wild jealousy at the mere mention of what shota saidthat kahlan would marry another kahlan had never seen such a look in his eyes before and at the time there hadnt really been a reason for it now there was no nadine would see to it that richard did what he needed to do if there was one thing kahlan had confidence in it was nadines desire to consummate that marriage nadine was a beautiful woman she was more than enthusiastic how could richard not be aroused he knew he had to do it he would have no reason to try to resist her urging maybe richard was thinking of it as revenge against his brother michael for taking nadine perhaps that was how he would get through it kahlan knew that nadine was having the time of her life this was nadines dream this was kahlans nightmare the dark sky she could just perceive out the windows seemed to boil as it had all day and all night the air remained dead still and sticky the storm wouldnt break it threatened but it would not come kahlan laid her wrist over her forehead as she rested waiting her legs hurt and she realized that it was because she was pressing her knees together she let her legs relax drefan had done his duty he was finished it was over she could relax kahlan shut her eyes when she heard nadines distant laughter drifting through the night air the woman was as good as her word did richard have to make her laugh couldnt he just do his duty no richard would not make nadine laugh nadine laughed for kahlans benefit the night dragged on endlessly where was the temple of the winds drefan made no attempt to touch her again and she was thankful for that he lay there on his back waiting with her each hour that passed brought no change from time to time kahlan drifted off to sleep nadines throaty laughter brought her awake with a jolt kahlan wanted to slap richard how long was he going to make this go on he could have had nadine three times by now maybe he had maybe when the temple of the winds didnt come he kept trying nadine would like that kahlan felt her cheeks burning drefan was silent as he lay beside her the winds had said that they couldnt talk she guessed that nadines laughter didnt count she used no words her laughter carried message enough kahlan sighed sooner or later the winds would come they had all done as required had she though what was it cara had said you must do your part in thisindulge in this drefan had indulged he had been satisfied nadine certainly was indulging richard must have kahlan hadnt she hadnt indulged she dismissed the idea it had to be something else maybe the winds were just waiting for nadine to finally have enough that would fit the way the temple of the winds had done everything else twisting the pain for richard and kahlan making them suffer as the night dragged on and recollecting caras words about indulging kahlan thought again about the time she had been with richard in that place between worlds she had felt the kind of pleasure that other woman feltthe indulgence not only in love but in lust kahlan had been so frustrated lately waiting to be with richard waiting for that closeness again waiting to be married to him so they could be together as husband and wife waiting for that satisfaction again it was so near she had been so close so ready and then it all fell apart leaving her hopes dashed and needs unfulfilled now for the first time she was free of her confessors power free to take pleasure from a man not for love but for the sheer indulgence of pleasure she was free to enjoy what other women enjoyed here she was lying next to her husband and not an unattractive man at all and she was feeling frustration for the need of richard was she to live the rest of her life being denied a simple pleasure of life that she was now free to indulge but she didnt love drefan without love the passion was empty still it was passion and if not ideal at least she could have that much satisfaction the spirits had taken everything else from her they had taken richard the only thing she really wanted out of life would she let them take simple pleasure too what else had she now this was her husband she was condemned to live the rest of her life with him must it be without at least some small release of pentup need wasnt she entitled to at least that much after all she had sacrificed they had taken everything else from her her only love in life her confessors power you must do your part in thisindulge in this what if that was why the winds hadnt come what if it was because she hadnt indulged drefan rolled over on his stomach and sighed he was frustrated by the wait too or maybe he was tending to his auras she thought about drefans tight trousers and the way she caught herself looking drefan was a handsome man he was built like richard drefan was her husband her anger at the spirits for taking everything from her was what finally made something inside her snap this was all she had she was entitled to this much to release when her hand touched drefans back he jumped kahlan smoothed her hand across the muscles of his back and he settled she let herself feel his muscles as she used to feel richards muscles feel his shape she took a deep breath and she let herself go kahlans hand moved down drefans back she gritted her teeth as she gripped his buttocks they were as tight as they looked in his trousers she was lucky she guessed the spirits could have insisted that she marry a repulsive man instead they had insisted that she marry drefan and he was far from repulsive he wasnt as handsome as richard no one was as handsome to her as richard but women were always fawning over drefan now he was her husband he had pledged to be loyal to her she had pledged to be loyal to him this was the only pleasure she was to be allowed this was all the spirits had left her at least she could have this muchhave what she was entitled to kahlan seized drefans hip and rolled him over toward her she hooked her leg over his and let her hand roam over his chest drefan didnt react maybe he was surprised by her change of behavior maybe he was confused she would have to unconfuse him she gently pinched one of his nipples then let her hand slide across his flat stomach and down kahlan found that drefan was in no condition to do her any good if she wanted to have her pleasure she would have to change that she kissed his chest she trailed wet kisses down his stomach his breathing seemed slow kahlan felt frustrated anger that he wasnt taking the hint she was tired of being frustrated while everyone else wasnt she decided that if she wanted to have satisfaction it was up to her to see to it that she got what she wanted no one would give it to hershe would have to take it kahlan let her tongue her kisses glide the rest of the way down drefans taut belly when she took him in her mouth she tasted her own blood she forced herself to ignore the taste as she urged him to react at first she thought he wasnt going to but when she lost herself in the erotic nature of what she was doing he finally did he came back as strong as before by the time drefan was fully ready kahlan was panting with need once she had decided to have her pleasure she became insistent drefan was her husband now it was his duty to fulfill her needs too not just his own kahlans head was spinning with the want of release that it was drefan no longer mattered in her mind she imagined it was richard at that thought she moaned with longing and climbed atop him straddling his hips this time she was ready to accept him this time she wanted him she shut it out of her mind that this was drefan and imagined it was richard since she couldnt see drefans blue eyes it wasnt hard to envision it was richard instead she remembered the things she did with richard and did those things she relived that experience in her imagination her mouth gaped she gasped for air sweat ran down her body as she moved atop him writhing forcefully against him drefan was panting now too she needed to have release from all the frustration that had built up for so longall the times she had kissed richard and wanted to do more all the times he had touched her and she had wanted him to do more now he was kahlan leaned forward to kiss him drefan turned his face away she scooped her arm under his head and held him to her chest instead his face felt hot against her breasts the roughness of his unshaved face excited her as she slid her sweaty flesh against him it made her pant all the more she was just about to scream at him to put his hands on her when she remembered that she wasnt allowed to utter so much as a word she seized his wrist and put first one hand where she wanted it and then the other to hold her bottom while she movedso she could imagine it was richard holding her again needing her she wanted to feel him gripping her in his big hands while she moved for the first time since she had last been with richard she felt wild pleasure wild lust a wild desperate need that it was with drefan no longer mattered to her she wanted only release it came with stunning ridged shivers her sharp moan shook her shoulders her legs stiffened to stone her toes clawed she slammed herself down on him as the wanton fulfillment of lust inundated her she gave herself over to it completely and with helpless unbridled abandon let it run free she gasped sharply again the cry following in the echoing wake of the first it seemed that it lasted an eternity as if it was almost too much to endure with a final convulsion it subsided at last it was over for one twisting moment she had been free there was no plague no people dying no responsibility no duty no marriage to drefan no nadine for that one moment she had been free of it all and she had been immersed in gratification for that one moment her heart and her lust had been with richard again kahlan collapsed to the side of drefan panting getting her wind back pushing her wet hair back off her face it occurred to her that he hadnt reached any satisfaction this second time she didnt care she had at the moment that was all that mattered sweet release for a wonderful moment she had been free of everything and had been with her love if only in her imagination kahlan realized that she was weeping with the joy of it she lay on her side turned away from drefan as she recovered she wiped the tears of pleasure from her face in the absence of need she unexpectedly began to feel ashamed dear spirits what had she just done she had enjoyed herself that was all she had needed the release then why did she suddenly feel so dirty distant thunder rumbled toward them a hint of embedded lightning flickered in the sky kahlan looked up out the windows another flash closer ripped through the insides of the roiling clouds briefly lighting the mountaintop from the other building kahlan heard a long scream from nadine kahlan blocked it from her mind as much as nadines scream rankled kahlan it at least didnt leave her as frustrated as it had before three more screams came from nadine short piercing urgent kahlan pressed her hands to her ears nadine had made her point couldnt she just let it be now the wind came up abruptly as if a great huge door had opened the blast of air hit like an avalanche the building shuddered the entire mountain quaked kahlan propped herself up on her elbows peering out the windows distant lightning flickered through the turbulent clouds thunder rumbled reverberating through the mountains each strike came a little closer the temple of the winds was comingthere was no doubt in her mind that took her thoughts back to richard because it was coming for him she felt sudden shame how could she so easily lose track of her heart how could she find such pleasure from another man what was she thinking she had never felt so dirty in her whole life as she suddenly did now with richard she had felt wonderful afterward now she was feeling worse by the moment if richard ever found out he would never understand richard would never know there was no way for him to find out unless drefan told him her heart pounded she thought about the guile she thought she had seen in drefans eyes no he wouldnt tell richard but what if he did with a sudden close strike of lightning kahlan sat up straight she saw something out the windowa structure as the winds had said there was no doubt she could talk now she spun back to drefan she had to secure his silence in this before they left this place if richard ever found out the wind lashed at the mountaintop the thunder boomed in the darkness she reached out and clutched his arm drefan listen to me you must promise you can never tell what just happened what i just did with you her hand tightened her fingernails dug into his arm ill do whatever you tell me to do for the rest of my life but you must promise me that you will never tellribbons of lightning lit the roomrichard thunder crashed jarring the ground lightning snaked along the bottoms of the clouds lighting the room with a harsh glare in the flickering flashes gray eyes were fixed on her i think richard already knows kahlan screamed chapter kahlan froze thoughts crashed through her mind in a confusion of thundering terror her scream came again ripping through the night loud enough to be heard over the sound of the thunder she couldnt make herself blink she couldnt tear her eyes from richards face she couldnt understand couldnt make sense of it the world felt as if it had turned upside down everything tumbled around in her mind making it impossible to think as the lightning lit the room again she knew only one thing this was richard not drefan no look she had ever seen on richards face was as terrifying to kahlan as the one she saw now there was nothing in his eyes not rage not lethal commitment not determination not a deadly calm countenance not jealousy not even empty disinterest there was no soul in those gray eyes no heart kahlan covered her mouth with both trembling hands she backed away until her back smacked into the stone wall he had known from the first instant she had come into the room richard could tell it was her coming into a room he had known it was her the whole timefrom the first instant cara had led her in here he knew he had tried to squeeze her hand to reassure her to let her know she had pushed his hand away he had been as gentle as he could he had tried to brush her tears away after she had pushed his hand away she hadnt let him show her that it was him kahlan collapsed to the floor with a wail of horror no dear spirits no richard didnt rush to her didnt speak words of comfort didnt yell instead he went to where his clothes were lying near the door and began getting dressed kahlan scurried to her things nearby she raced to pull on her underthings suddenly feeling the humiliation of her nakedness its reminder of what she had just done she scooped up her dress she paused tears streaming down her face she reached around the outside of the doorway and brought the sword and scabbard up before her face it had a leather handle just as she remembered seeing not a wirewound hilt it wasnt the sword of truth richards sword it was drefans sword kahlan gripped richard by his wrist as he picked up his pants how this is drefans sword not yours its drefans sword richard took it from her and leaned it against the wall they took your power you have no way to defend yourself drefan will be the one near you now not me i gave him the sword of truth so that he could protect you his eyes finally met hers i guess this one finds the truth just as well as the other richard stuffed his leg into his pants kahlan snatched his arm again richard dont you see it was you it was you in here with me not drefan the spirits mark a distinctionbetween intent and deed it wasnt him it was you all along he pulled his arm away the spirits might mark a distinction but he didnt to richard the intent was the same as the deed richard you dont understand it wasnt what you think he shot her a glare of such power that it staggered her back a step he waited as she stood frozen unable to find any words to explain he went back to dressing kahlan pulled on her white confessors dress outside the lightning was coming closer during some of the closer strikes she could see an immense structure rising up at the edge of the cliff the temple of the winds when the flash extinguished the temple vanished again and she could see the distant mountains beyond lit by the lightning farther away richard she wept as he pulled on a boot please talk to me say something ask me to explain tell me there can be no explanation veil at me call me a whore tell me you hate me hit me do something dont ignore me he turned and picked up his black sleeveless undershirt as he pulled it on over his head she scooped up his black shirt and held it to her breast hoping to halt his dressing richard please i love you his gaze again rose to hers she thought he was going to say something but instead he turned away and retrieved his belt with the leather packs on it he snapped on his wristbands kahlan held his shirt to her chest and shook as she watched him hook his belt together she didnt know what to do he picked up drefans sword and buckled it on richard please talk to me say something this is the doing of the spirits dont you remember what i told you that grandfathers spirit told me the winds have decided that you are the path of the price they did this to us he shot her a look again the intensity in his eyes extinguished he saw that she wasnt going to surrender his shirt so he threw his golden cloak around his shoulders as he turned toward the door kahlan seized his arm with both her hands and turned him back to her richard i love you youve got to believe me ill explain this in here to you later but for now you have to believe me i love you no other my heart is yours alone dear spirits please believe me richard gripped her jaw in his hand and wiped a thumb across her lips he held his thumb up for her to see in the pandemonium of lightning for the one in white his true beloved will betray him in her blood his words ripped her heart kahlan covered her scream with his shirt as he swept out the door the one thing she had sworn she would never do she had done she had betrayed him it could have been no worse betrayal it was a betrayal that had destroyed his heart crying hysterically kahlan raced after him out into the wild night she had to do something to mend that heart she couldnt let him endure the pain she had caused him she loved him more than life itself and she had done the worst thing possible lo him outside the wind howled across the mountain she could see his black shape his bare arms in the flashes of lightning as he headed for the road as he reached the edge of the cliff at the end of the road kahlan threw herself on him dragging him to a halt the sky was a savage show of violent discharges thunder thumped in her bones lightning ripped across the sky followed by deafening booms beyond the edge when the most powerful of those bolts struck the temple of the winds was there but only during those fierce strikes between those strikes there was nothing but empty space richard what are you going to do im going to stop the plague when will you be back ill wait here when will you be back he stared into her eyes a long moment as the storm raged around them there is nothing here for me kahlan clutched at him richard you have to come back come back ill be here waiting i love you dear spirits i need you richard you have to come back to me you have a husband you have given him an oath and everything else richard dont leave me alone kahlan wailed on the edge of hysteria if you dont come back ill never forgive you richard turned to the edge of the cliff richard you have a wife you have to come back thunder shuddered the mountain he looked back over his shoulder nadine is dead i am no longer bound by my oath to her you have a husband and an oath there is nothing here for me brutal cords of lightning slammed into the road beyond the edge of the cliff bringing the temple of the winds into full view golden cloak billowing out behind richard leaped into the lightning richard im here im here for you we can find a way please come back to me when the frenetic flash cut off the temple was gone another flash came and the soaring towers were back for a second weaker this time and then gone again kahlan dropped to the ground clutching richards black shirt to herself she had destroyed him from the side kahlan saw a streak of red it was cara racing for the edge of the cliff she leaped just as another flash erupted lighting the temple of the winds into the world of life she landed on the road in the sky and when the flash was gone so was the temple of the winds richard and cara devastated kahlan stared silently at the rampaging storm seeing from time to time the towering phantom temple in another world it never looked solid enough again or she would have jumped across she should have she couldnt understand why she hadnt why had she just stood here because richard didnt want her she had betrayed him how could he do this to her he said he would always love her he said they would be together in the next world he made her promises he swore his eternal love so had she and she had betrayed him from somewhere out in the storm kahlan heard the distant sound of laughter the malevolent chuckle made her skin crawl drefan strolled up beside her he was alone wheres nadine kahlan asked drefan cleared his throat when the lightning came and she saw it was me and not richard she screamed she went crazy she leaped over the edge of the mountain kahlan stared up at him richard knew he told her nadine was dead richard was a wizard she had seen that too in his eyes at the end before he jumped across she saw magic in his eyes wheres richard kahlan stared out at the empty air at the black wall of night gone on the road to the temple of the winds in the eerie silence richard drew his sword its alien feel surprised him for an instant until he recalled whose sword it was he was no longer the seeker of truth he had had all the truth he could stand it wasnt night here nor day yet there was light it wasnt like sunlightmore like an overcast day with no hint of exactly where the sun was but he knew that there was no sun here this was not the world of life this was a part of the underworldan isolated remote obscure niche in the world of the dead it was as if the wizards had found an outoftheway hole in which to hide the temple of the winds it had been similarly hidden when in the world of life the dark walls of the immense temple of the winds rose up before him the twin towers soaring up into trailers of mist the entire side of mount kymermosst was herethe whole part that was missing in the world of life richard knew where he was going he knew more than he had ever known before knowledge was flooding into his mind he was a war wizard the temple of the winds had opened a floodgate into his mind it was feeding him all he needed to know and more he felt as if he were sentient for the first time recompense for the price demanded lord rahl a breathless cara ran up beside him agiel in hand she took up a defensive position her agiel would be useless here for that matter it would be useless back in the world of life now richard turned to the winds and started out again it wasnt far not far at all he knew the way in cara go home you dont belong here lord rahl what happened i go home she scowled at him as she pushed past to clear his way of any danger she had no concept of the dangers here i am mordsith i am here to protect the lord rahl i am no longer the lord rahl richard whispered she gazed up at the huge black stone pillars beside the entrance ahead beside them on walls of inky stone banded with coppercolored caps frozen in ravenblack granite stood the skrin guardians of the boundary between worlds frozen only to caras eyes not to his cara lifted a hand bidding him to stay back as she peered down the passageway to the distant entry checking for danger there were bones at their feet lord rahl what is this place you cant go in here cara why not richard turned and looked back toward the way he had comeat everything he was leaving behind at nothing because this is the hall of the betrayed richard glanced up at the twin skrin guardians that had left the bones of two wizards here on this walkway at their feet richard remembered well the message the sliph had passed on from wizard ricker ward left in richard now knew what that meant he lifted his left arm fist out toward the skrin perched on the stone wall at the right ward left told him which arm to use and which skrin to ward the wrong arm would have denied him entry into this place in the world of the dead one of rickers traps for the enemy his wristband heated the leather pad protected his flesh from the power he focused in that band a green glow enveloped his fist the skrin to the right to which he directed his birthright of authority glowed in sympathy with his fist immobilized for now to allow richard to enter richard glanced up at the guardian of ravenblack granite to his left richard called out its name a guttural sound to which it answered black stone cracked and crumbled as the skrin turned to its master awaiting instruction richard made the sound of its name again he lifted his hand to cara this one does not belong here ward her back to the world of life do not harm her after return to your post the skrin sprang from the stone wall enveloping cara lord rahl when will you be home richard gazed into her blue eyes i am home light flared and silent thunder shook the soundless world as the skrin vanished on its journey with cara back to the world of life richard turned to the winds the four winds and the seer watched from their place up on the wall richard scanned the solid gold runes running up each side of the wall beside the entrance to the hall reading the messages and warnings placed there by wizards past in a world without wind richards cloak billowed out behind a telltale in a place with eddies of power and currents of force as he strode onward into the hall of the betrayed kahlan threw up an arm before her face as lightning suddenly cracked before her the road into the temple of the winds lit for an instant in the distance kahlan could see richards back as he strode resolutely into a passageway cara tumbled lo the ground on the road at the edge of the cliff at kahlans feet with the boom of thunder the temple and richard were gone cara rolled to her feet with wild fury she seized kahlan by the shoulders what have you done kahlan hurt too much to speak she stared at the ground mother confessor what have you done i fixed it for you what did you do to him kahlans head came up you what i swore an oath we are sisters of the agiel i swore an oath to you that if anything ever happened if anything went wrong i would see to it that it was you and not nadine who was with richard kahlans mouth fell open cara what did you do what you wanted i spoke the words of the winds as they came to me but when i took you and nadine to the buildings i switched you both i took nadine to drefan and i took you to lord rahl i wanted you to be with the man you truly loved i took you to richard didnt you trust in me didnt you have faith in me kahlan fell into caras arms oh cara im sorry i should have believed in you dear spirits i should have trusted you lord rahl said he was going into the hall of the betrayed i asked when he would be coming home he said he was home he isnt coming back what have you done the hall of the betrayed kahlan crumpled to the ground i have fulfilled the prophecy i have helped richard get into the temple of the winds i have helped him stop the plague in so doing i have destroyed him in so doing i have destroyed myself you have done more than that cara whispered what do you mean cara lifted her agiel in her fist my agiel it has lost its power the power of a mordsith works only in the presence of the bond to our lord rahl it exists to protect the lord rahl without a lord rahl there is no bond i have lost my power i am lord rahl now drefan said as he strode up behind kahlan cara sneered at him you are no lord rahl you do not have the gift drefan met her glare im all the lord rahl you have now someone has to hold the dharan empire together kahlan clutched richards black shirt to her stomach i am the mother confessor i will hold the alliance together you my dear have lost your power too you are no longer a confessor much less the mother confessor he reached down and gripped kahlan under her arm his powerful fingers tightened painfully as he lifted her you are my wife now and you will do as i tell you to do you have sworn an oath to obey me cara reached out to force him to let go of kahlan drefan backhanded her across the mouth knocking her to the ground and you cara are a toothless snake now if you wish to stick around then you will have to obey me if not i have no use for you for now only we know that your agiel doesnt work keep it that way you will protect me as any lord rahl cara gave him a venomous look as she wiped the blood from her mouth you are not the lord rahl no he lifted the sword of truth richards sword and let it drop back into its scabbard well i am the seeker now you are not the seeker either kahlan growled richard is the seeker richard there is no richard anymore i am now lord rahl and the seeker drefan pulled kahlan against him his darken rahl eyes burning into her and you are my wife at least you will be once we consummate the marriage but this is neither the time nor place we have to get back there is work to be done never if you ever touch me ill cut your throat you have sworn an oath before the spirits you will do as you have sworn drefan smiled youre a whore youll enjoy it i want you to enjoy it to be pleased i really do how dare you call me that i am no whore especially yours his smile widened really then how did you betray richard why would he walk away without even looking back my guess would be that you enjoyed it when you thought it was me id say richard saw you for the whore you are when it really is me you will find pleasure in it then too ill like that chapter verna gently shoved warren wake up someone is coming warren knuckled his eyes im awake verna glanced back at the other windows to make sure that the dead guards were still propped up to make it appear they were on watch a light from a lamp on the table was just enough to show those outside the guards at the windows but it would provide enough light to see her and warren too so they stayed away from the windows how do you feel she asked better i think im all right now he had been unconscious earlier the headaches caused by the gift were coming closer and closer together verna didnt know what to do for him she didnt know how long it would be before his gift killed him the only thing she could think to do was to stick to her plan warren had said that prophecy had told him that his only chance was to be with her out the window in the darkness she could see two shadowed figures approaching up the road in the distance on the hills campfires by the thousands made the countryside look like a lakes reflection of the starry sky verna shuddered to think of the hundreds of thousands of brutes in those tents the sooner they left this place the better she was thankful they werent going up into jagangs stronghold again they wouldnt be able to pull off that kind of magic twice the spells warren had used would not trick the guards again thankfully once was enough this time her friends janet and amelia were coming out to meet her and warren if that was in fact janet and amelia she saw approaching it had to be this was the fourth night after the full moon this was where they were to meet janet had said that amelia would be back from the tents by now verna feared to think of what kind of shape amelia would be in she would probably need to be healed verna hoped that it wouldnt take long it was close to dawn she and warren had taken turns at short naps they had a lot of traveling to do to get back to general reibisch and his army and they needed to be rested for the journey verna wanted to be as far away from this place as she could get in case an alert rose from the stronghold verna hoped that janet had already told amelia about the bond to richard so that she wouldnt have to waste time with that too as soon as amelia was sworn to richard the bond would protect her too from the dream walker then they could escape verna dearly wanted to rescue the rest of the sisters but she knew that presumption was a road to ruin on her twentyyear journey away from the cloistered life of the palace of the prophets verna had learned that out in the world a sister had to do her work with care if there was to be any hope of success rescuing the rest of the sisters would be worse than tricky and it would do them no good if verna got herself caught while trying to rescue them all at once best be aware of your limitations and take it one step at a time she would get the rest of the sisters safely away from the dream walker in due time right now it was most important to get her two friends out get information from them that would help her to rescue the rest and get warren some help without warren their cause would be jeopardized warren was a prophet just beginning to come into his talentif that talent didnt kill him before they could get him the help he needed one step at a time she reminded herself use care use your head and you have the best chance of success a knock came at the door verna cracked it open and peeked out as warren called out like a guard for them to announce themselves two of his excellencys slaves sister janet and sister amelia verna pulled open the door reached out snatching the cloak of one yanked her in and then the other verna flattened them both against the wall so they couldnt be seen from the windows thank the creator verna said with a sigh i thought you two would never get here both women stood with wide eyes trembling like frightened rabbits sister amelias face was bruised cut and swollen warren moved close to verna she took his hand as she looked from one white face to the other her heart ached for amelias obvious pain but there was something more in her eyes terror whats wrong she whispered you lied to us janet said in a pained whisper what are you talking about the bond the bond to protect us from his excellency i told amelia about it she swore the oath to richard as you told it to me verna frowned and leaned closer what in creation are you saying i told you it will keep jagang from entering your mind janet slowly shook her head no verna it wont not from my mind not from amelias not from warrens not from yours verna laid a comforting hand on janets arm trying to calm the frightened woman yes it will janet you must only believe and you will be protected janet slowly shook her head again before i swore the oath to richard jagang was in my mind he knew my thoughts he knew what you told me he knew it all verna covered her mouth in horror she hadnt considered that possibility but you swore the oath that protects you now again janet slowly shook her head it did for the first day but four days ago on the night of the full moon his excellency returned to my mind i didnt know it i told amelia about the oath she swore us had i we thought we were safe we thought that when you came back we would escape with you you will verna assured her we all will escape right now none of us is going to escape verna jagang has you he has warren he told us that he slipped into the cracks of your minds while you slept the first night after the full moon tears filled janets eyes im sorry verna you should never have come here to rescue me it is to cost you both your freedom verna smiled through her rising panic janet that just isnt possible the bond protects us it would janet said in a suddenly gruff suddenly sinister voice were richard rahl still alive but richard rahl departed the world of the living four nights ago on the night of the full moon janet laughed a hearty belly laugh even as tears ran down her face verna couldnt draw a breath richard is dead warren slapped his hands to the sides of his head as he let out a cry of anguish no no verna clutched at him as he sank toward the floor warren what is it his excellency his excellency has tasks for me tasks warren whats wrong whats happening his excellency has a new prophet warren cried out please stop the pain i will serve i will serve as i am commanded verna crouched over him warren it felt as if a whitehot steel rod slammed through her skull verna cried out as she clamped her hands to her head nothing in her entire life of one hundred fiftysix years had prepared her for the fount of pain erupting in her mind the room went black she felt the floor smack her face her arms and legs twitched with the agony baleful laughter danced through the hot torture like flames through a ruin verna prayed to the creator that she would black out her prayer went unanswered above her she heard a voice janets voice im so sorry verna you should never have come here to try to rescue us you will serve his excellency now as his slaves the blond one cara followed him into the reception room she stayed three paces behind as he had ordered she always wore her red leather now as he had ordered he liked the way the red leather made them look like they were sheathed in blood one of them was always there with him a bloodred reminder of the slick sticky debauchery to come her blue eyes turned away when he glanced back over his shoulder he knew that she stayed only to be near kahlan that was fine by him that she stayed was all that mattered she was harmless now but it looked better if the lord rahl had an escort of guards like hera proper accoutrement of his rank and he was the lord rahl now as the whispers from the ethers had promised him only he had the intellect to perceive the voices the wisdom to hear them the acumen to heed them it had brought him triumph attention to detail had brought him his rewards his extraordinary insight had brought him to the place of power he had always deserved his gift was his genius and it would serve him better than mere magic he was a man above others and for good reason he was superior to others a man of rare understanding instinct and rare ethics unadulterated by the twisted excuses women put to their vulgar pleasures his own virtue intoxicated him kahlan glanced up when she saw him striding into the room her face showed a blankness an expression she wore almost constantly she only thought it showed nothing to him it revealed a panoply of emotion immersed in the details of her bewitching face he could discern the rich flux of emotions she tried to hide he saw the way she looked at him he had caught her glances at his body in the past he knew she wanted him she hungered for him she wanted pleasure from him that she tried to deny it only excited him all the more that she covered her hunger for him with harsh words only proved it to him that she pretended revulsion only showed him the extraordinary depths of her need when she finally gave in to her lust it would be all the more glorious for the wait for the abstinence for the yearning for the delayed fulfillment then at long last he would give her what she wanted then he would hear her screams the general with kahlan bowed good morninglord rahl whats this he asked he didnt like it when the soldiers brought things to kahlan without seeing to informing the lord rahl first its just the morning reports drefan kahlan said in that flat tone of hers then why wasnt i informed reports should come to the lord rahl first general kerson stole a glance at kahlan he bowed again as you wish lord rahl i just thought i do the thinking you do the soldiering the general cleared his throat of course lord rahl so what do the morning reports have to say the general glanced to kahlan again drefan saw the slight nod as if the general needed permission from the lord rahls wife to report drefan let it pass as he always did he enjoyed her games the way she thought he missed things it amused him well lord rahl the plague is nearly over describe nearly over if you would please as a healer vagueness hardly does me any good in the last week the deaths from the plague have dropped to only three confirmed cases lust night nearly everyone who was sick when lordhe caught himself when richard left has recovered whatever richard did my brother died thats what he did i am the healer i am the one responsible for the plague ending kahlan lost the calm look her expression twisted to tightly controlled rage he wondered how her face would twist were it pain were it terror he would know in the end richard went to the temple of the winds he sacrificed himself to save everyone richard not you drefan richard drefan dismissed her tirade with a casual flip of his hand nonsense what did richard know of healing i am the healer it is lord rahl who has saved his people from the plague drefan raised a finger to the general and you had better see to it that that everyone knows it kahlan gave her slight nod to the general again yes lord rahl the general said i will personally see to it that everyone knows that it was lord rahl himself who stopped the plague kahlans face showed the slightest hint of a smile at the generals ambiguous response drefan let it go he had more important business than her disrespect for her husband and what else have you to report general well lord rahl it seems that some of our units are missing missing how can troops be missing i want them found we must have the army together to defend against the imperial order i wont have the dharan empire fall to the imperial order because my officers fail to maintain discipline yes lord rahl i have already sent scouts to find the troops who have wandered off from their stations its the bond drefan kahlan said the dharans arent bonded to you the army is breaking up wandering off aimlessly because they have lost the bond lost their leader they dont know what to do they are without a lord rahl he struck her the sharp sound reverberated through the room stand up he waited until she regained her feet ill not have insolence from my wife do you understand kahlan pressed her fingers to her nose trying to halt the flow of blood the crimson tide flooded over her fingers and lips and down her chin the sight of it nearly drove a gasp from him the sight of the mother confessor with blood on her made his hands shake he longed for the slicing for the sight of blood everywhere on her for her screams for her terror but he could wait until she begged for it as had nadine he had enjoyed nadines perverted hunger he had relished her surprise her terror her agony before he cast her over the side of the mountain still alive so she could think about her vile nature all the way down it had sated himfor now he could wait until the mother confessors true corruption finally surfaced once again as it had the first night richard must have been horrified to discover how much she really wanted his brother that the woman he had loved was as impure as any whore poor innocent stupid richard he never even looked back over his shoulder as he walked away drefan could wait she would need time to recover from the shock of causing richards death drefan could wait it wouldnt take her long as badly as she wanted him he swept kahlan up in his arms forgive me my wife i didnt mean to hurt you forgive me please i was only worried for our safety from the order distraught that these worthless soldiers wont follow orders and in so doing endanger us all kahlan wrenched herself out of his arms i understand she lied so poorly from the corner of his eye he could see the coiled form in red leather if she moved to strike he would slice her down if she didnt he still had use for her kahlan twitched a finger in caution to cara cara reluctantly relaxed kahlan thought she was so clever thought he didnt see the way she gave orders to people for now it didnt matter general kerson drefan said i want those derelict troops found we must have discipline in the army or we are lost to the order when they are found i want the officers executed what you want me to execute my own men because they have lost the bond i want you to execute them for treason when the rest of the men learn that we wont tolerate such negligence to duty they will think twice about joining with our enemy our enemy lord rahl of course if they dont do their duty as dharans to serve and protect the dharan empire to say nothing of their lord rahl then they are aiding the enemy that makes them traitors it endangers the life of my wife of everyone he glided his fingers over the raised gold letters on the hilt of the sword of truthhis sword he wielded it by right now do you have anything else to report the general and kahlan surreptitiously shared a look no lord rahl good that will be all then dismissed he turned to kahlan and held out his arm come my dear we will have breakfast together chapter in a daze richard stepped down off the wizards throne at the head of the hall of the winds his footsteps echoed into the distance it was his rightful place the wizards throne he was the only war wizard the only wizard with both additive and subtractive magic the inside of the temple of the winds was beyond colossal it was almost beyond comprehension there was no sound in this soundless place unless he put one there or willed it into being the arched ceiling enclosing the lofty heights overhead could have contained eagles and they hardly would have been aware that they were captive inside a structure mountain hawks were there any could soar and dive under that aerial arch and feel at home to the sides massive columns supported walls that ascended into the remote curve of the ribbed ceiling in those side walls enormous windows let in more of the omnipresent diffused light at least he could see the side walls the far distant end of the hall simply faded out of sight into a haze nearly everything was the color of a pale afternoon mist the floors the columns the walls the ceiling they almost seemed made of the filmy light richard was a flea in a vast canyon even so the place was not limitless as it was outside the walls before he would have been stunned and awed by this place now he was neither he was simply numb here time had no meaning other than that which he brought with him time had no place to anchor in eternity he could have been here a century rather than a mere couple of weeks and only he would note the difference and then only if he so chose life had little meaning here a concept as distant as the other end of eternity he brought that too to this place yet the temple of the winds had perception and sheltered him in its wizardcrafted stone embrace to the sides as he strode the hall there were alcoves under each arch beyond each pair of columns in each alcove resided the things of magic stored here for safekeepingsent here from the world of life for the safekeeping of the world of life richard understood them and could use them he understood how dangerous these things were and why some had wanted them locked away for all time the knowledge of the winds was his now with that knowledge he had halted the plague he didnt have the book that was used to start the plague but it wasnt necessary to have the book to render it impotent the book was stolen from this place and so was still yoked to the winds it was a simple matter of switching the fluxes of power emanating from the winds which enabled the magic of the book to function in the world of life in fact it was so simple that he was ashamed that he hadnt realized the way to do it before thousands of people had died because he had been so ignorant had he known then what he knew now he could have merely cast a web spun with both sides of his power and the book would have been useless to jagang all those people deadand it had been so simple at least he was able to use his healing powers to halt the sickness among most who were afflicted before he had interrupted the currents of magic at least the plague was ended it had only cost him everything what price for all those lives what price the spirits had set what price indeed it had cost nadine her life he felt profound sorrow for her he would have eliminated jagang and the threat from the old world too but he couldnt do so from this place that was the world of life and he could only affect those things taken from this place to the world of life and the damage they caused he had touched the core of power in this place though there would be no more entry through betrayers hall jagang would not twice accomplish the same feat richard paused he drew his sword drefans sword he held it out in his palms staring at it watching the light catch it this wasnt his swordthe sword of truth he let his will flow from the core of his soul carrying his birthright of power with it his gift came as easily as a sigh where before he had struggled to bring forth the most insignificant shred of his power force flowed outward through his arms and into the object he held his mind guided its elements balancing each to the desired sequence and result until the sword in his hands transmuted into the twin of the one he knew so well he held the twin to the sword of truth although without its attendant impressions of those past souls who had used his real sword in every other way though it was the same it held the same power the same magic wizards had died in the attempt to make the sword of truth until some were finally successful once they had succeeded that knowledge was borne to this place and it was therefore richards for the taking as was all the knowledge here he seized the hilt and held the blade aloft richard let the power the magic the rage of the sword inundate him storm through him just to feel something even wrath was something he had no need of a sword though the wrath winked out to be replaced again by the emptiness he tossed the sword high into the air and held it there where it rotated slowly on a bed of force with a pulse of power he shattered the sword he had made into a cloud of metal lie dust and with another thought evacuated the dust out of existence he stood empty again empty and alone a presence caused him to turn it was another spirit they came from time to time to see him to speak with him to urge him to return to his world before it was too late before he lost the thread back to the world of life this form this spirit rooted him to the floor in rigid shock it looked like kahlan the soft glowing apparition hovered before him radiating with a glow the same color as everything else in this place only with more intensity more definition it looked like kahlan for the first time in weeks his heart pounded kahlan have you died are you a spirit now no the spirit said i am kahlan mother richards muscles went slack again he turned away and continued on through the hall what do you want the spirit followed as they sometimes did interested in him a curiosity perhaps in their world i have brought you something the spirit said richard turned what she held out a rose the green of the stem and the red of the petals were stunning in this colorless world a ripple of pleasure to his eyes the fragrance filled his lungs with its pleasant aroma he had almost forgotten the pleasure of such a thing what am i to do with this the spirit held it out urging him to take it he had no fear of the spirits who came to see him even those who hated him could not harm him he knew how to protect himself richard took the rose thank you he slid the stem behind his belt he turned and continued on the spirit of kahlans mother followed he didnt like looking into her face though she was a spirit and her features were indistinct in that glow they had she still looked too much like kahlan richard may i talk with you his footsteps echoed through the vast hall if you wish i wish to tell you about my daughter kahlan richard stopped and turned back to the spirit why because she is part of me she was of my flesh just as you are of your mothers flesh kahlan is my connection to the world of life the place i once was where you must return richard started out once more i am home i have no intention of returning to that bitter world if you wish me to carry a message to your daughter im sorry i cant leave me he lifted his hand to banish her from the hall but she raised her hands pleading for him to stay his power i do not wish you to carry a message kahlan knows i love her i wish to talk to you why because of what i did to kahlan did to her what did you do to her i instilled in her a sense of duty confessors dont have love kahlan they have duty that was what i told her to my shame i never explained what i meant by that i fear i left her no room for life more than any confessor i knew kahlan wanted to live life to relish it duty denied her much of that that is what makes her such a good protector of her people she wants them to have a chance at their joy because she sees so clearly what she was denied she is left to take small pleasures as she can is there a point to this dont you enjoy life richard richard walked on i understand about duty i have been born to duty i am now done with it i am done with everything you too misunderstand what i meant about duty to the right person the person who is truly born to it duty is a form of love through which all is possible duty is not always a denial of things but an expansion of them to others duty is not always a chore but is best carried out with love will you not return to her richard she needs you kahlan has a husband now i have no place in her life you have a place in her heart kahlan said she would never forgive me richard have you never said something you didnt mean in desperation have you never wished you could take back the words i cant return to her she is married to another she has given an oath and she has i wont go back even if she is married to another even if you cannot be with her even if it breaks your heart to know you cant have her dont you love her enough to mend her heart to put her heart at peace is it all you and none of it her in this love you have richard glared at the spirit she has found happiness in my absence she doesnt need anything from me do you find enjoyment in the rose richard richard walked on yes its very nice thank you will you consider going back then richard wheeled to the spirit of kahlans mother thank you for the rose here are a thousand in repayment so you may not say i owe you anything in return richard cast out his hand and the air filled with roses rose petals flew and swirled in a red blizzard im sorry i could not make you understand richard i can see that i only bring you pain i will leave you when she vanished the floor was bespattered with red petals looking like nothing so much as a pool of blood richard sank to the floor feeling too sick to stand soon he would be one of them a spirit and he would not have to endure this limbo where he twisted between worlds he had food when he wanted it he had sleep when he wanted it but he couldnt maintain life here indefinitely this was not the world of life soon enough he would be one of them and finished with this emptiness that was his life kahlan had once filled that emptiness she had once been everything to him he had trusted her he had thought his heart had been safe in her care he had imagined more than was true how could he have been such a fool was it all such illusion richards head came up he peered across the hall he went through a mental inventory of the items stored here the gazing font it was there across the hall he knew how to use it he rose and crossed the hall going between two of the columns to find the stone gazing font it had two basins in two tiers the lower one waisthigh and the upper just above his head each basin was a long rectangle carved into the glittering charcoalgray stone were ornate symbols of instruction and power the lower basin was brimful of a silver liquid appearing similar to the sliph but very different he knew richard lifted the silver ewer from the shelf below and dipped it in the lower basin he emptied the ewer into the upper basin he continued until the upper basin was loaded with its charge of the gazing liquid richard leaned across the lower basin to place his hands on the proper symbols spread wide to each side he read the ancient words before him as he leaned in hands pressed to the gazing keyways when the words were said he focused his mind on the person he wished to gaze upon as he did this he let slip a small cord of power to release the liquid in the upper font across the entire knifeedge front of the upper basin the silver liquid spilled out in a thin silvery sheet before his face in that waterfall of gazing liquid richard saw the person he called in his mind kahlan his chest tightened at seeing her he almost gasped almost called out her name in anguish she was in her white confessors dress the familiar contours of her face made him ache with longing she was near her rooms her bedroom in the confessors palace it was night there richard could feel his heart hammering against his ribs as he watched her glide to a halt at the door drefan slipped up behind her he put his hands on her shoulders giving them a squeeze as he leaned close putting his mouth by her ear kahlan my wife my love are you ready to go into bed ive had a hard day i so look forward to a night of your lustful passion richard released the font he lifted his fists as he staggered back the gazing font exploded apart heavy pieces of rock driven ahead of huge gouts of flame and smoke shards of stone whistled through the hall disappearing into the distance massive chunks of stone wailed as they rose up into the air lifted on a raging inferno until they lost their upward momentum and dropped back down to shatter into fragments and dust the gazing liquid flooded the floor in each droplet and pool richard could see kahlans face he turned his back and stalked away a furnace of flame blasted the floor evaporating each droplet yet he could still perceive her face in the tiniest mist of it filling the air he cast up his fists every droplet every infinitesimal bit of mist winked into nothingness behind him in the center of the hall in a daze richard slumped to the floor staring out at nothing a malicious chuckle drifted through the winds richard knew who it was his father was back to torment him again whats the matter my son darken rahl said in his derisive hiss arent you happy with my choice of a husband for your true love my own son my own flesh and blood drefan wed to the mother confessor i think it a good choice myself hes a good boy she seemed pleased but then you already know that dont you you should be pleased that she is pleased so very pleased darken rahls laughter cavorted through the hall richard didnt bother to banish the luminous form standing over him what did it matter so what do you say my wife shall we have a night of wild passion like you showed my brother when you thought it me kahlan used all her strength to ram her elbow into drefans sternum she had caught him off guard he hadnt expected that he doubled over in pain unable to get his breath i told you drefan if you touch me ill cut your throat before he could recover to laugh at her anger or to taunt her with his threats of force she slipped into her room slammed the door and threw the bolt she stood trembling in the near darkness she had felt something for a moment it had felt as if richard was there with her she had almost called out his name screamed she loved him she clutched her abdomen in agony when would she ever stop thinking about him richard was never coming back kahlan crossed the thick carpets in her sitting room and went back into the bedroom she dropped into a defensive crouch when someone stepped out in front of her sorry berdine whispered i didnt mean to frighten you kahlan sighed as she unclenched her fists and rose to her feet berdine she threw her arms around the woman oh berdine im glad to see you how are you doing berdine hugged kahlan with a desperate need for comfort its been a few weeks but it seems as if raina died only yesterday im so angry with her for leaving me and then when i get angry at her i cry because i miss her so if she would only have held on for a few more days she would be alive now just a couple of days i know i know kahlan whispered she parted from berdine keeping her voice low what are you doing here i thought you went up to the keep to relieve cara i did but i had to come down to talk to you you mean the sliph is unguarded berdine nodded berdine we cant leave her alone we would never know if someone slipped into aydindrilsomeone with dangerous magic that was what berdine shushed her i know this is important too besides what difference does it really make cara and i have lost our power we couldnt stop someone with magic now if they did come through the sliph i have to talk to you mother confessor and i can never do it in the day because drefan is always showing up dont let him catch you calling him anything other than lord rahl or he he isnt lord rahl he isnt mother confessor i know but hes all the lord rahl we have berdine looked kahlan in the eye cara and i have been talking we decided we should kill him we need you to help us we cant do that kahlan gripped berdines shoulder we cant sure we can well hide out on the balcony you get him out of his clothes so that hes away from those knives of his and while you distract his attention well burst in and end it berdine we cant well all right if youre skittish about that plan we can easily think of another the point is we have to kill him no the point is we cant kill him berdine scowled do you want to be married to that pig sooner or later hes going to insist on his rights as your husband berdine listen to me even if he does that i will have to endure it i can endure rape if it means saving lives we cant kill drefan hes the only lord rahl we have until we can figure out what to do he is the only thing holding the army together right now theyre confused by his aggressive command dharans are used to being told what to do by lord rahl drefan is acting as if he is the lord rahl and for the moment the army is scratching their heads wondering if theyre sure he isnt but he isnt berdine insisted but at the moment thats all that is holding the whole thing together if it falls apart then the imperial order will be able to roll right over the midlands drefan is right about that much of it but you are the mother confessor general kerson is loyal to you even without the bond he sticks around because of you most of the officers do the same because of you not drefan you could hold things together as well as drefan maybe it would work and maybe not i may not like drefan but he has done nothing to earn assassination as much as i dont like his ways hes doing his best to keep us all together with him and me we may be able to keep everyone together in this berdine tilled her head closer it wont last and you know it kahlan wiped a hand across her face berdine drefan is my husband i have sworn an oath to him an oath is it then why havent you let him in your bed kahlan opened her mouth but couldnt find the words its because of lord rahl isnt it you still think hes coming back dont you you want him to come back kahlan put her fingertips to her lips she turned away if richard was going to come back hed have done so by now maybe its the plague maybe he isnt finished ridding the magic of the plague maybe when hes finished he will return kahlan hugged her arms to herself she knew that wasnt it mother confessor you do want him to return dont you im married to drefan i have a husband that isnt what i asked you you do want him to return you must want him to come back kahlan shook her head he said he would always love me he said his heart would always be mine he promised kahlan swallowed the anguish he walked away i may havehurt him but if he really loved me he wouldnt do this to me hed have given me a chance but you still want him back no i dont want ever to go through this kind of pain again i dont want ever to leave myself open to this much hurt i was wrong ever to let myself fall in love with him in the first place kahlan shook her head again i dont want him to come back i dont believe you youre just upset as i get because raina died but if she came back id forgive her for dying and take her back in a heartbeat not richard ill not trust my heart to him again regardless of what i did that doesnt make it right for him to hurt me as he did he just walked away from me and after hed made promises of always loving me no matter what he failed me in that test i never thought he would hurt me like that i thought my heart was safe with him no matter what but it wasnt berdine turned her around and gripped her shoulders mother confessor you dont mean that you dont trust works both ways if you really loved him then you must trust in him no matter what just as you expected him to always trust in you tears trickled down kahlans cheeks i cant berdine it hurts too much ill not put myself through it again it doesnt matter anyway its been weeks the plague is long over richard is never coming back look i dont know exactly what happened up on the mountain but you just ask yourself this if the situation were reversed if you were in his place how would you feel dont you think i do that every moment of every day i know how id feel id feel betrayed id never forgive me if i were him id hate me just as i know he does no berdine soothed that isnt true he doesnt hate you lord rahl may be confused or hurt but he could never hate you he does he hates me for what i did thats the other reason i can never take him back hurt him too much how could i ever look him in the eye again i couldnt i could never ask him to trust me again berdine circled an arm around kahlans neck and drew her to a shoulder dont close your heart kahlan please dont do that you are a sister of the agiel as your sister i beg you not to do that it makes no difference kahlan whispered i cant be with him anyway no matter what i might think or wish or hope i must forget him the spirits have forced me into marrying drefan i have given my oath to drefan and to the spirits in trade to save lives i must respect the oath ive given richard too must respect my oath chapter wake him the voice in her head commanded verna cried out it felt as though she was covered with wasps and they were all stinging her at once she frantically swiped at her arms her shoulders her legs her face she screamed in panic swatting swatting wake him came the voice in her head again his excellencys voice verna snatched the cloth from the bucket she turned warrens head he was sprawled forward on the table unconscious she dabbed the wet cloth on his cheeks his forehead with trembling fingers she smoothed back his hair he hadnt been out long so she had a better chance to bring him around warren warren please wake up warren he moaned in delirium she pressed the wet cloth to his lips she rubbed his back with her other hand as she kissed his cheek it broke her heart to see him so afflicted with the pain not only of the dream walker but of the gift out of control she pressed her fingers to the back of his neck and let a warm flow of han seep into him hoping it would give him strength hoping it would bring him around warren she cried please wake up please for me wake up or his excellency will be angry please warren tears streamed down her face she didnt care she needed only to wake warren or his excellency would make them both suffer she had never known that resistance could be so futile she had never known that she could so easily be made to betray everything in which she believed she couldnt even protect those she loved by killing herself she had tried oh how she had tried he wouldnt allow it he wanted them alive so that they could serve him he wished to use their talents she now knew that it had to be true richard had to be dead the bond to him was broken and they were defenseless against the dream walker he intruded into her mind at will with frightening ease jagang bent her to his wishes it was as if she were no longer in control of the simplest of actions if jagang willed it her arm lifted and she could do nothing but watch he controlled her use of her han too without the bond she was powerless warren let out another groggy groan he moved of his own accord at last only verna seemed able to wake him when he passed out from the gift that was the only reason jagang hadnt sent her to the tents only his hearts connection to her was enough to stir warren she knew that it was harmful to wake him when the gift wanted him unconsciousit did that as a way to stretch his endurance until he could get proper helpbut she had no choice she was using their love to wake him and in so doing was bringing him closer to death but jagang didnt care as long as warren did as ordered sorry warren mumbled i i couldnt i know verna comforted i know wake up now warren his excellency wants us to keep working we have to keep working i cant i cant verna my head please warren verna couldnt control the tears the pain of a thousand wasps stinging her everywhere at once made it impossible to hold still she flinched constantly warren you know what hell do to us please warren you must go back to the books ill carry them down just tell me which ones you need ill get them for you he nodded as he pushed himself up he was becoming more alert verna slid the lamp near him and turned up the wick she pushed close the volume he had been reading when he had passed out and tapped the page here warren here this is where you were his excellency wants to know what this means warren pressed his fists to the sides of his head i dont know please excellency i dont know i cant make the visions of prophecy come at will im not a prophet yet i am only beginning warren cried out squirming in his chair ill try ill try please let me try warren panted as his agony subsided he bent over the book licking his lips fingers shook as he set them to the book following along the line of words the line of prophecy patronizing past he muttered as he read to himself patronizing past carries forward the same disfavor twisted to new use for a new master dear creator i dont know what it means please let the vision come clarissa peered out into the darkness as the coach rocked to a stop dust hung in the air their ghostlike escort a stone fortress rose up just outside the coachs window it was dark and she couldnt see the whole thing but what she could see made her heart pound out of control she waited twisting her fingers together until the soldier opened the door clarissa he whispered this is the place clarissa took his hand as she stepped out into the inky night thank you walsh the other one of nathans soldier friends a man named bollesdun waited up in the drivers seat keeping tight the reins hurry now walsh told her nathan said he doesnt want you in there for more than a few minutes if anything happens the two of us arent going to be able to fight much of a battle to get you out she knew the truth of that they had ridden past so many tents that it left her stunned by their numbers the hoard who had overrun renwold had been nothing compared to the numbers of men here clarissa pulled up the hood on her cloak dont you worry i know better than to dally nathan told me what to do she clutched her cloak together in her fist she had promised nathan he had done so much for her he had saved her life she would do this for him she would do this so others wouldnt die as terrified as she was she would do anything for nathan there was no better man in the whole world no kinder man no more compassionate no braver walsh walked beside her as they passed under an iron portcullis and then into an entryway under a barreled roof two brutish guards wearing hide mantles and hung with grislylooking weapons stood beside a hissing torch clarissa kept her cloak tightly drawn and her hood pulled forward she hung her head so that the guards couldnt see her face in the shadow she let walsh do the talking as she had been instructed walsh flicked his hand toward her the representative of his excellencys plenipotentiary lord rahl he said in a gruff voice as if unhappy that this assignment had fallen to him the bearded guard grunted so ive been told he lifted a thumb toward the door go on in someone is supposed to be waiting for you walsh adjusted his weapons belt good i have to drive this one back tonight can you believe it wont even let us wait until morning that lord rahl is as demanding as they come the guard grunted as if he well understood the annoyance of night duty oh walsh added as if in afterthought lord rahl also wanted to know if his representative could pay the lord rahls respects to his excellency the guard shrugged sorry jagang took out of here this morning he took most everyone with him just left a few behind to mind things clarissas heart sank with disappointment nathan had been hoping that jagang would be here but he had said that even though he hoped it jagang would likely be smarter than that jagang wasnt one to trust his life to the unknown abilities of a wizard as powerful as nathan walsh took clarissas arm and pushed her on ahead as he gave the guard a goodnatured slap on the shoulder thanks yea just go on in down the hall theres one of the women waiting there for you last i saw her she was pacing by the second set of torches walsh and bollesdun were imperial order soldiers and they had had no trouble with any of the other soldiers either clarissa dreaded to think what would have happened to her without those two the times their coach had been stopped by troops to query its mission walsh and bollesdun also had little trouble ushering her through checkpoints clarissa remembered all too well what happened to the women in renwold she still had nightmares about what she had seen happening to manda perlin when the orders troops captured renwold and right there on the floor beside her murdered husband rupert their footsteps echoed as they hurried down the stone corridor it was a dark dank and depressing place it looked to clarissa to have no comforts other than a few wooden benches this was a place for soldiers not a place for families to live as the guard had said the woman was waiting near the second set of torches yes the woman asked what is it as clarissa came to a stop before the woman she could see in the torchlight that her face was badly battered she had horridlooking cuts and bruises one side of her lower lip was swollen to twice normal size even walsh moved back a little when he got a good look at her i am to meet sister amelia his excellencys plenipotentiary sent me the woman slumped with relief good i am sister amelia i have the book i hope never to see it again his excellencys plenipotentiary also told me that i am to pay his respects to an acquaintance of his sister verna is she here well i dont know if i should if im not allowed to see her his excellency will be most unhappy when his plenipotentiary reports how his request was so rudely treated by a slave as a slave myself serving his excellency i can tell you that i will not be the one to take the blame clarissa felt foolish saying such words but as nathan had told her they seemed to work magic sister amelias eyes fixed on the gold ring through clarissas lip her hesitation vanished of course please follow me that is where the book is kept anyway with walsh close at her side and his hand near the hilt of his short sword clarissa followed sister amelia deeper into the gloomy fortress they went down a long hall and then took a turn clarissa was paying careful attention as they went so that if they had to get out fast she wouldnt take a wrong route and be caught in here sister amelia stopped before a door glancing to clarissa for just an instant before she lifted the lever and led them in a woman and a man were in the room he sitting at a simple plank table reading a book laid open on the table and she looking over his shoulder the woman glanced up she was a little older than clarissa and attractive with curly brown hair she looked to clarissa to be a woman of authority crushed by humiliation she looked in agony whether it was physical or emotional clarissa didnt know sister amelia held out a hand this is verna verna straightened she had a gold ring in her lip the same as sister amelia the same as clarissa the man his curly blond hair in disarray didnt look up he seemed frantically absorbed in his book pleased to meet you clarissa said verna turned back to the man and the book he was studying clarissa pushed back her hood as she turned to sister amelia the book sister amelia bowed of course its right here she scurried to a shelf the room wasnt large one of the stone block walls had a crudely built shelf holding books there were perhaps no more than a hundred nathan had been hoping there would be a great many more as nathan had expected though jagang wouldnt keep many of his prizes together in one place sister amelia pulled a volume from a shelf and placed it on the table she looked to be uncomfortable even touching it this is it the cover was as nathan had described it to her a strange black that seemed to absorb the light from the room clarissa flipped open the cover what are you doing sister amelia cried out as she stepped closer clarissa looked up i was instructed how to make sure it is the right book please leave it to me sister amelia stepped back wringing her hands together of course but i can tell you only too well that its the right book its the one his excellency agreed to clarissa carefully turned over the first page as sister amelia nervously licked her lips verna watched from the corner of her eye clarissa reached inside her cloak and pulled out the little leather pouch of powder nathan had given her she sprinkled it over the open page words began to appear assigned to the winds by wizard picker it was the book she had come for nathan hadnt known the name of the wizard but he had told her it would say assigned to the winds and then a name she flipped the cover closed sister amelia would you leave us for a moment please the woman bowed and quickly scurried out of the room verna frowned as she straightened again whats this about may i see your ring please my ring verna finally sighed and held out her hand showing clarissa the ring on her third finger it had the sunburst pattern as nathan had described why do you want to see for the first time verna noticed clarissas guard her eyes went wide she jostled warrens shoulder while she spoke walsh warrens head came up walsh smiled how you doing prelate warren not very well clarissa stepped closer the man warren was looking very puzzled i was sent by lord rahl to get this book clarissa gave verna and warren both a meaningful look i am bonded to lord rahl richard is dead verna said in a flat whisper i know but i was sent by lord rahl nathan rahl the master of dhara he wanted me to pass along his regards vernas mouth fell open warrens chair skidded across the floor as he rushed to his feet do you understand clarissa carefully asked if you do then you had better be quick about it but nathan we couldnt well clarissa said i must be getting back to lord rahl hes waiting for me i have a coach and i must be leaving at once vernas eyes turned up to walsh he gave her a nod verna fell to her knees she snatched warrens violet robes and yanked him down beside her do it warren she folded her hands together as she bowed her head her words spilled out master rahl guide us master rahl teach us master rahl protect us in your light we thrive in your mercy we are sheltered in your wisdom we are humbled we live only to serve our lives are yours warren spoke the words too just a little in her wake verna knelt frozen for a moment her hands still folded together prayerfully she suddenly let out a cry of joy she laughed like a madwoman thank the creator my prayers have been answered im free hes gone i can feel that hes gone from my mind clarissa sighed in relief nathan had warned her that if verna failed to do as they had hoped she would have to die here verna and warren hugged as they wept with joy clarissa seized them both and urged them up we have to get out of here but lord rahl wants me to do something else first i need to look for some books books warren asked what books mountains twin sellerons seventh task the book of inversion and duplex and twelve words left for reason warren turned to the book on the table twelve words thats this one here i think i saw a couple of the others clarissa went to the shelves help me look nathan wants to know if they are here he needs to know they all scanned the titles on the spines and had to pull out several that werent marked so as to check their titles they found all but the book of inversion and duplex clarissa brushed the dust from her hands that will have to do nathan said that they might not all be here with only one missing thats better than we could have hoped what does nathan want with these books warren asked he doesnt want jagang to have them he says that theyre dangerous for jagang to have they all could be dangerous verna said let me worry about that clarissa said as she slipped the book from the table back into an empty slot nathan just needed to know which were here now we can leave verna clutched clarissas sleeve i have two friends here we have to get them out with us you said you have a coach we can all go who walsh asked janet and amelia walsh let out a knowing grunt as clarissa glanced to the door but nathan said look if they give their oath to to lord rahl also they can escape verna touched the ring in clarissas lip you dont know what they do to the women here did you see amelias face i know what they do clarissa whispered remembering the scenes in renwold will they take the oath of course wouldnt you if it would get you away from here clarissa swallowed id do anything hurry then walsh said theres room in the coach but we have to hurry verna nodded and then slipped out the door while verna went to get the other two clarissa unhooked the clasp on the fine gold chain around her neck warren watched with a frown as clarissa pulled a book from a lower shelf and then set it on the table clarissa placed the locket on the shelf in the empty slot carefully she laid open the locket with a finger she gently pushed it all the way back against the wall she wiggled her fingers at warren he handed back the book she had removed clarissa slid it back into its place what did you do warren asked what nathan wanted me to do verna burst back into the room holding the hands of two beaming women one was the one with the battered face sister amelia theyve given the oath verna said in a breathless voice they are bonded to lord rahl lets get out of here about time walsh said he had a little smile on his face for verna it was obvious to clarissa that they knew each other walsh took a hold of clarissas arm and the two of them led out the rest to retrace their route back through the fortress the dark dripping stone smelled of rot they saw only a few guards inside the stronghold most people having left along with jagang gone to his huge tents nathan said that jagang traveled with a large contingent of people and that he had big round tents with all the comforts of a palace of the people left behind there seemed to be a scattering of officers and guards and a few of the women who were slaves to jagang and his army as they came around a corner one of those slaves was coming the other way carrying two steaming kettles of what smelled like lamb stew she was dressed the same as the other women clarissa had seen except verna the clothes they wore like janet and amelia were not clothes as far as clarissa was concerned the women might as well have been naked for all the good those transparent garments did when the woman looked up and saw them coming especially walsh she immediately stepped to the side of the hall out of their way clarissa jerked to a halt staring at the woman whose gaze fixed on the floor manda clarissa whispered manda perlin is that you manda looked up yes mistress manda its me clarissa from renwold im clarissa the young woman looked up the length of clarissa at her expensive gown at her jewelry at her hair all done in ringlets mandas gaze met clarissas and her eyes widened clarissa is it really you yes i dont hardly recognize you you look so different you look so the spark went out of her expression were you captured back home too then i see the ring no i wasnt captured mandas eyes filled with tears oh good im so glad they didnt get you there it was clarissa hugged the young woman manda had never spoken this many words to her in all the years clarissa had known her and the words she had spoken hadnt been decent clarissa had always hated manda for the cruel words the cruel smirks the condescending glances now clarissa felt sorrow for her manda we have to go would you like to come away with us verna snatched clarissas arm we cant do that clarissa glared at verna i came here to rescue you i let you take your friends with us i want to take my friend out of here too verna sighed and let go of clarissas arm of course friend manda whined as her face twisted with untold sorrow yes clarissa said i could get you out of here too you would do that for me after all the times i sobbing manda threw her arms around clarissa oh yes oh clarissa please oh clarissa please let me go with you clarissa gripped the womans wrists and pushed her away then listen carefully i give you only one chance my master has magic to protect your mind from the dream walker you must swear an oath to him you must be loyal to him manda fell to her knees clutching at clarissas dress yes i swear then say these words and you must mean them with all your heart clarissa spoke the devotion pausing to let manda repeat the words when she finished verna and clarissa helped the sobbing woman to her feet clarissa had always been so intimidated by manda always so afraid of her scorn how many times had clarissa crossed the street her head bowed low as she tried to avoid mandas attention hurry now walsh said nathan told us to get out of here fast at the entrance walsh had to make up a story about his excellencys plenipotentiary wanting some women the guard eyed the nearly naked women smiled knowingly and slapped walsh on the back they all piled into the coach as walsh climbed up into the drivers seat with bollesdun as the coach lurched and then started out clarissa pushed janet and manda to the floor in the center so she could lift the leathercovered seat she pulled out a long cloak she only had one extra they had expected to rescue verna and warren since verna had a cloak clarissa gave the extra cloak to manda and retrieved blankets for janet and amelia all three women were immensely grateful to be able to cover themselves at last clarissa sat at the end of the seat holding the strange black book nathan had sent her for with amelia at the other end and manda in the center clutching at clarissa for comfort manda kept weeping on clarissas shoulder and thanking her profusely clarissa put an arm around manda and told her that she had expressed her gratitude enough times it did feel good though to have the beautiful manda perlin looking up to clarissa for a change rather than looking down on her all because of nathan how he had changed her lifechanged everything they had to stop three times while soldiers checked the coach once the soldiers made them all get out and line up for a look the blankets and cloak had to remain in the coach as janet amelia and manda climbed out for inspection walsh explained in very crude terms what he was doing with these slaves how he was taking them for the pleasure of his excellencys plenipotentiary the soldiers were satisfied by walshs explanation and allowed them to continue on their way they turned north at the harbor and headed up the coast road clarissa sighed in relief as she saw the last of the fires and tents finally fade into the distance behind them it wasnt until they crested a hill nearly an hours ride out after leaving the last of the soldiers that the flash lit the sky behind clarissa heard a cheer from up on the drivers seat walsh leaned down gripping a rail with one arm and stuck his face nearly upside down partly into the window good job clarissa you did it clarissa grinned he swung back up and he and bollesdun booted into the night air it was then that the sudden boom reached them making manda jump with fright verna sitting in the center opposite produced a flame above her upturned palm and leaned toward clarissa job what is it that you have done clarissa patted the inky black book in her lap nathan sent me for this book and he wanted the ones left behind destroyed he said that they were dangerous what with you and especially warren telling jagang the meaning of the prophecies in them nathan didnt want jagang to be able to use the information i see verna said lucky for us that we agreed to swear loyalty to lord rahl and go with you clarissa nodded nathan said i was to offer you the chance but in either case i was to open that locket and leave it hidden there he said that jagang having both warren and the prophecies together could ruin everything if you told jagang anything important verna pressed her lips together as she let out a breath she shared a look with warren i cant believe that after all this time im finally going to get to meet the prophet himself warren said not long ago i had given up hope and now i will be meeting nathan verna harrumphed out of the rain and into the lake i cant believe ive sworn loyalty to that crazy old man clarissa leaned forward nathan is dashing he isnt old verna barked a laugh you have no idea child and he isnt crazy either nathan is the kindest most wonderful most generous man ive ever met verna glanced down at clarissas cleavage and back up to her eyes she had that look that clarissa was used to seeing yes verna murmured im sure he is my dear you could have no better man to swear loyalty to clarissa said besides being thoughtful and kind nathan is a powerful wizard i saw him turn another wizard to a pile of dust vernas brow creased another wizard clarissa nodded named vincent vincent and another wizard and two sisters jodelle and willamina came to see nathan they tried to hurt him nathan turned vincent into a pile of ash vernas eyebrows rose after that clarissa said they were very polite to nathan and jagang agreed to give the bookshe tapped the book in her lapto nathan jagang said nathan could have either the book or sister amelia now nathan will have both nathan has great plans nathan will rule the world one day verna and warren shared a sidelong glance she looked at amelia what is this book amelia i stole it from the temple of the winds amelia said in a hoarse voice im the only one who can use it i started a plague thousands have already died because of what i did it was how jagang eliminated richard rahl thank the creator that we still have nathan rahl to protect us with the bond to him dear creator verna whispered what have we agreed to with our oath to the likes of nathan chapter richard rose from the wizards chair when he recognized the spirit gliding toward him he couldnt call a specific spirit and he didnt always know the ones who came but he knew this one with this one he had a deep connection the person this spirit once was he had loathed he had feared only once he understood her and only after he had forgiven her for what she had done to him was he able to gain his release this one he had killed and in so doing he freed her from her torment this spirit was the one who had later brought kahlan and richard together in that place between worlds richard the spirit said as she seemed to smile denna i see you wear an agiel it is not mine richard slowly shook his head it is that of yet another mordsith who died because of me raina i knew her in the world of life and i know her here since she passed into the spirit world after the violation of the winds she may not come to you here she is not one of those who holds sway over the forces involved as they pertain to you and the winds know that her spirit is at peace you gave her peace in life and so she asked me to come to you richard rolled the red agiel in his fingers i gave your agiel to kahlan as i promised you one time only she is able to give me more pain than you only you richard are able to give yourself more pain than i could give you have it your way i care not to argue it is good to see you denna you may disagree after i am finished with you richard smiled at her nature showing through even in her spirit form you cannot harm me here denna you think not i may not be able to harm your body but i can still hurt you she nodded to herself oh yes richard i can hurt you and how is that denna lifted an arm i can make you rememberremember and make it real again you and i have a past richard spread his hands and to what purpose denna spread her luminous arms that is for you to decide richard with a flash of light in his mind the temple of the winds was gone fading from his consciousness and he was in a place he remembered the castle in tamarang he was there again he could taste the terror denna had captured him she had tortured him for days he was delirious and weak every step was painful as he followed denna through the grand dining hall his wrists were cut and swollen from the manacles she used to shackle him up to a beam when denna stopped and spoke to people richard kept his eyes to her braid as he silently waited behind her denna controlled his life his destiny he was allowed only that which she granted he hadnt eaten since she had captured him he longed to eat something anything all around the jumble of talking and laughter from the queens guests droned in his head denna too was a guest of the queen richard at the end of a chain running from his mistress to a collar around his neck was dennas prisoner she hadnt let him eat during those days of torture and he needed food as she sat at the dining table denna snapped her fingers pointing at the floor behind her chair richard sank to the floor relieved to be allowed that small comfort he could rest he wasnt hanging from the shackles he wasnt being made to stand all night he wasnt being tortured all of the guests were eating the varied aromas tormented him he ached with hunger everyone else was eating but he had to sit on the floor behind denna watching what others enjoyedwhat he was denied richard thought about the times he had been with kahlan at camp eating rabbit cooked over the fire or porridge sweetened with berries he licked his lips thinking about the succulent hot tender meat brown and crunchy on the outside from the fire he had so enjoyed those meals with her the food and the company were the best now he was denied that life and was yoked to another after everyone else had been eating for a while a server brought a bowl of gruel denna had him hand it down to richard he held it in trembling hands almost any time before he would have cast it aside in disgust but now it was all he had he was made to put it on the floor and to eat it like a dog while laughter from the guests filled his ears he didnt care he was being allowed to eat at last gruel was all he was allowed but at that moment in his state of tormented need it was wonderfulit was freedom from the ache of hunger freedom from the misery of seeing others eat while he starved fulfillment of a simple but long denied need he slurped at it relishing it gulping it down he could not escape his imprisonment in his new life over which he had no say and so he decided that if gruel was all he would be allowed then he would have to accept that fact and sate his hunger with what he was given the light flashed in his head color bled from his sight vanishing almost painfully and he saw again the muted mists of the temple of the winds around him richard was on his hands and knees on the floor panting in terror the glowing white spirit of denna lowered over him denna was right she could hurt him still this pain though she had given him out of love richard staggered to his feet how could he have thought he was ignorant before and that the knowledge of the temple of the winds had brought him new sight he had had sight all along but had failed to see knowledge without heart was empty wizard ricker had left with the sliph a message for him but he had ignored it ward left in ward right out guard your heart from stone he had failed to guard his heart from stone and it had almost cost him everything thank you denna for that gift of pain it has taught you something richard that i have to go home back to my world thank you richard for living up to what i expect of you richard smiled were you not a spirit id kiss you denna smiled a sad smile the thought is the gift richard richard shared a gaze with her for a moment a gaze between worlds denna please tell raina that we all love her raina knows this feelings of the heart cross the boundary richard nodded then you know how much we love you too that is why i came to vouch for you in your quest to the winds richard held his arm out would you escort me to the passageway i would find peace in your company before i leave this empty place the worst is yet ahead of me denna glided along at his side as he headed for the passageway out striding the hall of the winds for the last time they didnt speak words were too paltry to touch what was in his heart near the great doors the spirit of darken rahl waited going somewhere my son the sound of his words echoed painfully through the hall richard glared at the spirit of his father back to my world there is nothing for you there kahlan your true love is married to another man she has sworn an oath to him before the spirits you could never understand why im going back kahlan is married to my son drefan you cannot have her now that is not why im going back then why leave this place the world of life will be empty for you now richard stalked past the spirit of his father he didnt have to explain his reasons to the one who had caused so much grief denna glided along beside richard at the doors darken rahl appeared again blocking the way you may not leave you cant stop me oh yes my son i can you must let him pass denna said only if he agrees to the terms richard turned to denna whats he talking about the spirits set the requirements for your path into our world because it was your unique path here darken rahl was called upon and given commensurate sway over your price for coming here your sacrifice to come here darken rahl set the more onerous of the sacrifices such as drefan marrying kahlan if one who participated in your coming so chooses this spirit also has the right to set requirements if you are to leave i will simply banish him richard said i know how to do that now i can banish him from the winds and then leave it is not that simple denna said you traveled from the world of life through the underworld to this place within the world of souls you must return through the underworld the spirits can set a price it must however be one that is fair in view of the forces and worlds involved and it must be a price within your ability to satisfy richard ran his fingers back through his hair and i must pay if he names a price within the edicts then you must if you are to return to your world smiling that vile smile of his darken rahl glided closer i only have two small insignificant requirements meet them and you may return to your brother drefan and his wife richard glared name them but if you set the price too high and i choose not to pay it and remain here instead then i swear i will devote my eternity to making your soul twist in torment and you know i can do itthe winds have taught me how then i guess you will have to decide just how important this is to you my son i think you will pay it richard didnt want to tell him how important it was or the price would climb name the price and i will decide if i will pay it i was willing to stay here i may yet decide to do so darken rahl came closer close enough that the pain of his spirit coruscation was almost enough to make richard back away he willed himself to hold his ground without a shield of magic oh the price is going to be high indeed but i think you will pay it i know you richard i know your foolish heart even this price you will pay for her darken rahl did indeed know richards heart darken rahl after all was the one who had almost destroyed it name the price or be gone first the knowledge of the temple of the winds was not yours before you came to this place you will return as you camewithout the knowledge you acquired here back in your world you will be as you were before you left it richard had expected as much agreed oh very good my son how eager how earnest you are will you agree to the second requirement so readily his smile seemed as if it would strip flesh from bone i wonder his voice went on in a lethal hiss when darken rahl named the second requirement richards knees nearly buckled can he do that richard could manage no more than a whisper can he demand that denna stared back with somber spirit eyes yes richard turned away from the two spirits head bent he pressed his hand over his eyes it is that important to me he whispered i agree to the price i knew you would darken rahls malevolent laugh echoed the length of the temple of the winds i knew that even this you would pay for her richard gathered his senses he slowly turned lifting his hand toward the evil spirit and with this price you have shown me your barren spirit in that dear father you have made a mistake for i can now use that emptiness against you the laughter died out you have agreed to the price i have set within my right and power you can do nothing but banish me from the winds and that will not negate the price the world of souls will enforce it now that it is named and accepted so they will richard said but you will taste my revenge for all you have done including the price you have demanded when you could have stopped with the first as fair richard freed a pristine flow of subtractive magic uncontaminated by so much as a scintilla of the additive it was the force of the void unleashed total oblivion of light engulfed the spirit of darken rahl a wail came from that deep forever as darken rahl was plunged into the unmitigated shadow of the keeper of the underworld where not the slightest trace of light from the creator shone it was the pain of denial of that light that was the true torture of the keepers dark eternity when he was gone richard turned once more to the passageway back to the world of life i am sorry richard came dennas tender voice none but he would have demanded this of you i know richard whispered as he called the lightning to take him back dear spirit i know chapter drefan hooked his hand under her arm and pulled her shoulder against him at the white ruffles of his shirt hung two red agiel isnt it about time you ended this pretense my wife isnt it about time you gave in to your desires and admitted your hunger for me kahlan glared into his blue darken rahl eyes are you really mad drefan or do you just pretend it i agreed to wed you to save lives not because i wanted it when will you ever admit it to yourself i do not love you nor will i ever love when have i ever mentioned love i speak of passion you are delusional if you think i will ever you already have you want it again it cut her to the heart that he had so easily deduced what had happened with richard he pointed it out constantly he taunted her for it it was her eternal punishment for what she had done a stain she couldnt annul distant thunder rumbled through the mountains as the spring storm that had come so suddenly moved on away from the city the wild lightning had reminded kahlan of richard she had stood at the window watching the violent flashes remembering never you are my wife you have sworn an oath yes drefan i have sworn an oath and i am your wife i will live by my words but the spirits are satisfied with what i have given they demand no more or the plague would not be gone she pulled her arm away if you want me then you will have to rape me for that is what it will be i will not go to your bed willingly nor easily his smile was maddening i can wait until you finally give in to your lust i want you to enjoy it i long for you finally to admit it to ask for it he stalked away but turned back when she called his name what are you doing with cara and berdines agiel touching an agiel was painful only if it was one that had been used against you in the pastif you had been the prisoner of a mordsith agiel were weapons only in the hands of the mordsith to whom they belonged but without the bond to a true lord rahl they no longer functioned for drefan they were nothing more than obscene decoration he lifted the red rods away from his chest to have a look at them well i thought that since i am the lord rahl now i should wear these as a symbol of my authority after all richard wore one you wear one the agiel we wear are not symbols of authority they are symbols of our respect for the women to whom they belonged he shrugged as he let them drop back down the army seems quite intimidated to see me wearing them that will do good night my dear sleep well his sly smile returned call out if you have need of anything muttering a curse under her breath kahlan shouldered open the door to her rooms she was exhausted and wanted only to fall into bed but she knew that her racing mind would deny her sleep berdine was waiting for her is he gone to bed she asked referring to drefan yes kahlan said as i am about to do no you cant you have to come with me kahlan frowned at the serious look on berdines face where do you want me to go we have to go up to the keep whats wrong is it the sliph has someone tried to come through the sliph berdine waved dismissively as she stepped closer no no its not the sliph then what is it i just want you to come up there with me thats all i want some company kahlan stroked her hand down the womans shoulder berdine i know how lonely you are but its late i have a headache and im tired all afternoon and evening ive been in meetings with drefan general kerson and a number of officers drefan wants to move the troops back to dharafor us all to go to dhara he wants to abandon the midlands to the order and concentrate on defending dhara ive been arguing myself blue i need to go to bed and get some rest so i can get up in the morning and try again to convince them of the folly of drefans plan the general isnt so sure that drefan isnt right i am sleep later you are coming up to the keep with me kahlan gazed into the mordsiths eyes and that was what they were mordsith eyes this was not berdine speaking it was mistress berdine as cold and demanding as any mordsith came not until you tell me why kahlan said in a level tone berdine seized kahlans arm you are going up to the keep with me you can either go sitting in the saddle or lying over ityour choicebut you are going and you are going now kahlan had never seen such a look of determination in berdines eyes it was frightening that was the only word for it frightening all right if its that important to you lets go i just want to know why instead of answering berdine tightened her grip on kahlans arm and forced her to the door berdine cracked the door checking then opened it enough to stick her head out for a look its clear she whispered come on berdine youre scaring me whats going on without answering berdine shoved her through the door they took the service stairs and avoided the passageways that were heavily patrolled berdine must have spoken with the guards they did encounter because when the two of them approached the guards turned the other way looking off as if they had seen no one two horses waited both army horses big bay geldings berdine tossed a soldiers cloak at kahlan here put this on to cover that white dress of yours so people wont recognize you or drefan will hear about it why dont you want drefan to know where were going berdine seized kahlans ankle and stuffed her foot into the stirrup the stirrup was big and loose made for a mans boot berdine smacked kahlans bottom get it up there kahlan abandoned her resistance berdine obviously wasnt going to tell her what the urgency was about the ride to the wizards keep was silent as was the march through the empty halls passageway and rooms before they turned down the last stone corridor to the sliph they encountered cara standing guard outside a door cara like berdine was unreadable in her stern demeanor as she watched berdine and kahlan hurry toward her at the door berdine seized the lever with one hand and kahlans arm with the other the look in berdines eye was unequivocal sobriety dont you dare disappoint me mother confessor or you will find out exactly why mordsith are so feared cara and i will be with the sliph without looking back cara started out toward the sliph while berdine without further word opened the door and roughly shoved kahlan into the room kahlan stumbled catching her balance as she glanced back to see berdine pull shut the door kahlan turned and found herself looking into richards eyes her heart seemed to stop along with her breathing a half dozen candles in an iron stand reflected little points of light in his gray eyes he seemed bigger than life every detail was as she remembered only his sword was missing from that of her mental image of him ambivalence kept her breath locked in her lungs finally she found words the plague is ended i know the room felt so small the stone so dark the air so heavy she labored to breathe to slow her suddenly racing heart his forehead was beaded with sweat even though it was cool in the depths of the keep a drop rolled down over his cheekbone leaving a wet trail then what are you doing here there can be no point to it i have a husband we have nothing to say to each other not after not here like this alone his gaze left hers at hearing the cool tone of her voice she had hoped it would force him to say it dear spirits let him say he forgives me he said instead i asked cara and berdine to bring you here so i could talk to you i came back because i must speak with you will you grant me that much kahlan didnt know what to do with her hands of course richard he nodded his thanks he looked in pain he looked in anguish his eyes had the dull gloss of distress she wanted nothing so much as for him to say that he forgave her only that would mend her broken heart those were the only words that would mean anything to her she wanted him to say it but he just stood there while his gaze focused beyond the cold stone of the walls she decided that if he was going to say it to forgive her then the only way was to force him into it so have you come to forgive me richard his words came softly but with great resolve no i did not come to forgive you i cant forgive you kahlan she turned away she finally found something to do with her hands she pressed her fists against her stomach i see kahlan he said from behind her i cant forgive you because it would be wrong of me to come here to forgive you would you have me forgive your humanity shall i forgive you slaking your thirst shall i forgive your eating when you hunger shall i forgive you for the feel of warm sunlight on your face kahlan wiped at her cheeks and then turned to him what are you talking about the stem of a rose was stuck behind his belt richard lifted the rose and held it out to her your mother gave this to me my mother richard nodded she asked if i found enjoyment in it and when i told her that i did she asked if i would then return to you it took a long time for me to understand what she meant and what did she mean what she meant is that we have the capacity to enjoy such things is it wrong for you to find pleasure at the sight of a rose in its fragrance if i am not the one who gave it to you how can i forgive you that richard this is far different from finding pleasure in the fragrance of a rose he sank to one knee he put a fist to his abdomen kahlan i was once connected to a woman by my flesh as you were connected to your mother that is the only connection of flesh we have in this life his fist moved to his chest it is here that we connect ever after that we can be connected only in our hearts you did not give him your heart that was mine and mine alone the winds the spirits took their price from you they left you with little and you chose to take what was left and to live you chose to be human you chose to live life as best you could with what you had left of yourself you fought for life you simply took pleasure to which you were entitled i do not own you you are not my slave there is nothing for me to forgive you did not betray me in your heart it would be presumption of the worst order if i came with an offer of forgiveness when you never betrayed me with your heart kahlan could feel herself trembling as she drew a breath you hurt me richard i thought my heart was safe with you always no matter what and you walked away from me you promised it was you wouldnt even let me try to explain i know he whispered his other knee touched the floor as he bent at her feet his head bowed that is why i have returned i have come to beg your forgiveness i am the one who was wrong i am the one who caused the true pain i am the one who betrayed our hearts not you it is the worst sin i could commit and i alone am guilty of it i am without defense there can be no excuse im so sorry for what ive done to you kahlan i cannot undo the wrong i have done i have wounded your heart and for that i throw myself before you and beg your forgiveness i do not deserve it and so cannot ask it i can only beg it the way he knelt at her feet she lowered over him will you forgive me richard there is no room in my heart to hold anything for you but love even though we cannot be together though i am free of my oath you are sworn to another and i must respect that but i cannot help that i can love no other but you if your heart wishes it then i forgive you please kahlan all i can have in this life if you will grant it is your forgiveness mere moments before she had had doubts been uncertain as to her true feelings about him now absolute conviction avalanched through her kahlan sank down to the floor before him she put her hands to his shoulders and urged him to look up at her i forgive you richard with all my heart i love you and i forgive you he smiled a sad smile thank you she could feel the miracle other heart mending of joy flooding into the emptiness like life itself returning at the ceremony when i was being married to drefan i said the words aloud that they demanded but in my mind in my heart i was saying the oath of marriage to you richard wiped a tear from her chin i did the same she squeezed his arms richard what are we going to do now there is nothing to do now you are sworn to drefan she touched her fingers to his face but what about you what about you and me his smile left he shook his head it doesnt matter i have what i needed what i came for you have returned my heart but how can we go on like this not only that but we have to do something and fast drefan wants to withdraw the troops back to dhara and make a stand against the order there anger flashed in richards eyes no you cant let him do that kahlan if you let jagang divide the new world he will take it one piece at a time with dhara the last to fall you cant let drefan do that promise me you wont i dont need to promise you are lord rahl you can stop it now i am the mother confessor well do it together you must do it kahlan i cant help you but why not youve returned everything will work out well think of somethingfind a way you are the seeker you always find a way im dying ice flashed through her what what do you mean youre dying richard you cant die not now not after no richard no its all right now youre back everything is going to be all right she saw it then the pain in his eyes and realized when he slumped to a hip that he was unable to stand in order for me to return the spirits demanded a price he coughed wincing in pain she clutched at him what are you talking about what price when i was there at the temple of the winds i gained all the knowledge there i understood my power i could use it i used it to stop the plague i somehow interrupted the flow of power from the winds that made the book of magic work in this world you mean that you no longer know how to do it you mean the plague will come back he lifted a hand to allay her fear no the plague will not return but as the price of returning to this world i was not allowed to keep the knowledge of the winds i had to come back as i was before but you mean that you are simply mortal like before no they demanded more they demanded that if i was to return i had to take the magic of the stolen book into myself to keep it from the rest of the world of life what kahlan breathed wideeyed you dont mean i have the plague she gripped his shoulder with one hand and felt his forehead with the other he was burning with fever richard why didnt you tell me before he smiled through the pain forgiveness was all i needed all i wanted but i had to know it was true and not granted out of pity richard you cant die not now dear spirits you cant die the dear spirits had nothing to do with this it was darken rahl who chose drefan to be your husband as the price of the path into the winds and darken rahl who demanded this as the price of my return your return dont tell me that you only came back to die oh richard why would you do such a foolish thing if i had stayed at the temple of the winds i would eventually have died but without your forgiveness i chose instead to return and hope that a part of you still loved me enough to forgive me so i could die with that much at least with your love back i couldnt go on knowing what i had done to you knowing how i had hurt your heart and you dont think this hurts my heart richard there has to be something we can do what can we do please you must have known richard fell onto his side holding his stomach im sorry kahlan there is nothing i am absorbing the magic from the book that was stolen when i die the magic will die with me kahlan crouched over him clutching at him as the tears overwhelmed her richard please dont do this please dont die im sorry kahlan i cant stop it i gladly paid the price my heart is at peace now he reached up and touched the agiel hanging from the chain at her throat there was never a moments hesitation once i understood denna helped me to understand kahlan hugged him as he rolled onto his back richard there must be something you would have known what to do before they took the knowledge from you try to remember please richard try to remember his eyelids drooped i need to rest im sorry i used all my strength i need to rest a bit kahlan gripped his hand in both others as she wept it was all too overwhelming to endure to have him back only to lose him was too crushing to endure she opened his limp hand to press it to her cheek and saw something in his palm she pulled back his fingers and through the tears she saw writing in the palm of his hand it said find book destroy it to live kahlan sprawled over his unconscious form and grabbed his other hand it too had writing in it pinch of white sorcerers sand on third page one grain of black sorcerers sand tossed on there were three other words but in her minds state of chaotic disorder she couldnt think of how pronounce them he knew he was going to forget and before he did he wrote a message to himself he had even forgotten that he had written it the book she had to have the book and then she was running screaming as she went cara berdine help me cara berdine both women dashed out of the sliphs room out onto the walkway beside the inky pool when they heard kahlan screaming their names as she raced into the tower room kahlan grasped at their leather as she tried to explain they each seized one of kahlans arms and pressed her up against the wall slow down berdine said we cant understand you cara said get your breath stop crying and get your breath richard she tried to point but they held her arms richard has the plague i need the book berdine leaned in close lord rahl has the plague kahlan nodded frantically i have to get the book the book that was stolen from the temple of the winds i have to get it or he will die kahlan tore her arms away from them please help me richard has the plague what do you need us to do cara asked im going to the old world protect him the old world berdine gasped do you know where the book is did he tell you where to find it did he give you any hint kahlan shook her head there wasnt time she had to hurry she had to go i dont know where it is but its the only chance he has he took on the magic of the plague in order to return to this world in order to beg my forgiveness he wanted to tell me he was sorry for hurting me if we dont destroy the book hell diejust so he could say he was sorry hell die i have to go but mother confessor berdine said the old world is a big place if richard has the plague how can you hope to find the book in time that was what she meant how could she hope to find the book in time before richard died kahlan gripped a fistful of red leather i have to try protect richard dont let drefan know that richard is back i dont know what drefan would do dont tell him cara was shaking her head dont worry about that we wont tell drefan well take care of richard while youre gone well hide him here in the keep but hurry if you cant find it please come back before kahlan rushed into the room with the sliph she raced to the sliphs well the sliph smiled at seeing her do you wish travel i need to travel now to where do you wish to travel the old world where in the old world there are a number of places i know there we can go to any you wish i will take you you will be pleased kahlan pressed her hands to her head growling in frustration as the sliph started naming places kahlan had never heard of the place you came to with richard with your master when he went to get me the first time i traveled with you i know the place of which you speak kahlan hiked up her white dress and clambered up onto the wall of the well that place take me there hurry your masters life is at stake protect richard kahlan called out to cara and berdine what should we tell drefan when he wants to know where you are berdine asked i dont know youll have to think of something we will care for richard until you return cara said may the good spirits be with you tell him i love him if tell him i love him she called out as the sliphs silver arm swept kahlan from the top of the wall her voice was still echoing off the stone walls when kahlan was plunged into the quicksilver froth she gasped in the sliph praying to the good spirits that they would help her find the book with frantic effort she swam into what in the past had been the silver rapture now there was only dark terror chapter ann leaned toward him this is your fault you know zedd sitting on the floor in the center of the room with her glanced over you broke her prized mirror that was an accident ann insisted you are the one who ruined their shrine i was simply trying to get it clean how was i to know that it would catch fire they shouldnt have put all those dried flowers around it you were the one who spilled that berry wine on her best dress ann turned her nose up the pitcher was too full youre the one who filled it besides you broke his prized knife handle he wont ever be able to find a buried wassen root like that one again he was understandably upset zedd harrumphed what do i know about sharpening knives im a wizard not a blacksmith that would explain the incident with the elders horse they cant blame that on me i didnt leave the gate open at least im pretty sure i didnt leave it open anyway there is bound to be another horse that fast he can buy he can afford it what i want to know is how you managed to turn his number three wifes hair that color green ann folded her arms well it was an accident i thought those herbs would make her hair smell good i wanted to surprise her but the elders prized rabbit skin headdressthat was no accident that was plain laziness you should have checked it sooner instead of leaving it to dry unattended over the fire that headdress was a work of art what with those thousands of beads he wont easily replace such a nice headdress zedd shrugged well we never told them that we were any good at domestic tasks we never told them that at all quite right we didnt its not our fault if we didnt work out we could have told them if theyd asked we certainly could have ann cleared her throat into the silence what do you think they are going to do with us both of them were sitting back to back bound together with a coarse rope while the meeting across the room dragged on they still wore the wristbands that kept them from using their magic zedd glanced across the room where a heated discussion was being conducted the bareheaded elder his number one wife several influential members of the si doak community who had claimed rights to use the services of the captives and the si doak shaman were all complaining to one another about troubles they had had zedd couldnt understand all of the words but he could understand enough to follow the deliberations theyve decided they want to cut their losses and rid themselves of their domestic slaves zedd whispered to ann whats happening ann asked when the chattering finally came to an end what have they decided are they going to set us free the eyes across the room all turned to the captives zedd made a warning sound to ann i think maybe we should have been a little more attentive to our chores zedd whispered over his shoulder i think were in a great deal of trouble why what are they going to do ann mocked return us to the nangtong and demand their blankets back zedd shook his head as the si doak rose up the shamans necklaces jangled together the elder thumped his staff wish they would they want to get back all their costs and something toward the damages they are going to take us on a journey they have just decided that they can get the best price for us by selling us to cannibals anns head swung around cannibals thats what they said cannibals zedd you were able to take the collar off your neck cant you get these confounded bracelets off our wrists i think that now would be the time im afraid we may end up in a cook pot with them still on us zedd watched an angry elder and a seething shaman stalking toward them well its been fun ann but im afraid the fun is over verna put an arm around warrens waist trying to help him as he stumbled along as she followed behind clarissa who was following behind walsh and bollesdun janet hurried to the other side of warren and lifted his arm draping it over her shoulder are you sure verna whispered to walsh here nathan wanted us to meet him in the hagen woods yes walsh said over his shoulder that was the name he told me too clarissa added verna let out an annoyed breath it was just like nathan to make them go into the hagen woods even if richard had cleared the mriswith from this place she still didnt like it verna always suspected nathan of being dangerously unbalanced and that he would want her to meet him here only confirmed it trailers of moss hung down like gauzy rags of the dead roots tripped their feet as they moved through the darkness unpleasant odors wafted in on the warm humid air verna had never been this deep into the hagen woods beforeand for good reason how are you doing warren she whispered fine he mumbled in a groggy voice it wont be long warren it wont be long now just a little farther and then it will be over nathan will help you nathan he mumbled under his breath must warn him they came upon a massive stone block that was obviously worked by man it was square it was nearly covered with snaking tendrils and gnarled roots more stones like white bones in the moonlight jutted up from the thick vegetation she saw the low jagged remains of a wall and columns looking like the ribs of a monster light shone through the undergrowth the way it flickered it appeared to be the light of a campfire walsh and bollesdun held aside the branches for the rest of them the fire was set in a circle of rocks placed on the stone floor of old ruins beyond the fire verna could see the round wall of a large well or something like a well she had never known that this place was hidden in the hagen woods but as infrequently as anyone went into the hagen woods that wasnt surprising nathan dressed like a rich nobleman rose to greet them he was tall and intimidating especially without a radahan around his neck when he saw them all he grinned that confident rahl grin walsh and bollesdun laughed aloud and received goodnatured slaps on the back clarissa ducked under an arm throwing hers around nathans midsection he grunted when she squeezed with all her might and ardor when she proudly held out the book he took it from her he gave her a private smile laden with meaning clarissas eyes sparkled vernas eyes rolled verna nathan called out when he saw her glad you could make it how good to see you lord rahl you shouldnt scowl like that verna youll get wrinkles he scanned the others janet so you have joined us too his brow tightened a bit and amelia he looked to the other woman standing off to the side and who have we here clarissa held out an arm wiggling her fingers urging manda forward from underneath mandas fists tightened the cloak at her throat she timidly stepped forward nathan this is a friend of mine manda from renwold manda put a knee to the ground as she bowed deeply lord rahl my life is yours renwold nathans brow twitched again as he glanced briefly at clarissa yes well glad you escaped from jagang manda i owe it all to clarissa manda said as she came to her feet she is the bravest woman ive ever seen clarissa giggled as she pressed herself to nathan nonsense im so thankful that the good spirits put you where they did or id never have even known you were there nathan turned his attention back toward verna who have we here the young warren i presume verna did her best to smooth her own brow nathan lord rahl his grin cracked through the scowl but we are old friends verna i am still nathan to you and all my old friends verna dipped her head as she bit the inside of her cheek nathan she began again youre right this is warren can you help him hes just coming into prophecy just starting to have them i took his collar off a while back and there is nothing to protect him from the gift hes having the headaches nathan hes in a bad way ill follow you anywhere if you will help him help him please nathan im begging you nothing to it verna id be delighted to help the boy nathan gestured bring him over here by the fire warren mumbled trying to introduce himself but he was nearly unconscious verna and janet helped him down where nathan pointed and balanced him upright nathan hiked up his trousers at his knees and lowered himself to the stone floor of the missing building sitting crosslegged he set the book beside him his brow drew down in that rahl frown as he studied warrens face he waved his hand at verna and janet ordering them away with a web nathan held warren upright he inched forward until their knees touched warren nathan called in that deep commanding voice of his warrens eyes opened hold up your hands fingers extended both warren and nathan held up their hands they pressed their fingers together their eyes fixed on each other let your han flow into my fingertips nathan said in gentle prompting open the seventh gateway close the others you know of what i speak yes thats a good lad do it then it will make it easier if i have your help a warm mellow glow enveloped both men the night air hummed with the power from that light it was neither flame nor heat verna didnt know what nathan was doing she was somewhat astounded that nathan did nathan had always been something of a enigma at the palace of the prophets he had seemed an old man to her even when verna was a young girl he had always been regarded as at the least unbalanced even by the most magnanimous of the sisters there were those at the palace who didnt believe that nathan had more than the slightest hint of the gift in anything but prophecy others suspected but were never sure that he was capable of much more than he ever showed them there were others who were so terrified of him that they feared going to the rooms where he was confined even though he had a radahan around his neck verna had always considered nathan trouble on two feet now she watched as this troublesome old lecher of a wizard did his best to save the life of the man verna loved at times the light glowed more strongly in one man than the other before passing away and then coming back as if it had forgotten something and then returned for it walsh and bollesdun loafed near the round stone wall behind nathan but the rest of the party watched transfixed verna had no more idea what nathan was doing than did manda what unnerved verna the most was when both men their knees touching their fingers pressed together floated a few inches off the ground she was relieved when they at last settled back down nathan clapped his hands together once there he announced that should do it verna couldnt see how that could have possibly been enough to set the gift right in warren warren though wore a wide grin nathan that wasmarvelous the headache is completely gone i feel so clearheadedso alive nathan picked up the inky book and stood i enjoyed it too my boy took that gaggle of sisters near to three hundred years to do for me what i have just done for you but then they were a misguided lot he glanced vernas way sorry prelate no slight intended none taken verna rushed to warrens side thank you nathan i was so worried for him you have no idea what a relief this is warrens face was losing the joyous look nathan now that you have done this for me i can see more clearly that we have inadvertently given jagang insight into prophecy that nathan cried out clarissa cried out verna froze she could feel something sharp pressed to her back amelia had a dacra stabbed in the back of nathans thigh manda had a knife at clarissas throat janet was holding a weapon at vernas back warren stiffened when janet held a warning finger to him and then to the two soldiers dont you move a muscle nathan amelia said or i let flow my han and you are instantly dead warren is right janet said he did in fact give his excellency some very valuable information amelia janet verna cried out what are you doing amelia turned a wicked smile on verna his excellencys bidding of course but you swore the oath we swore the oath in word only not in our hearts but you can be free of him you dont need to serve jagang had you told us true the first time maybe but once we tried and failed to hold the bond when richard died his excellency punished us well not take the chance again dont do this verna pleaded were friends i came to save you dont do this please swear the bond and you will be free oh darlin im afraid she cant do that it was not amelias voice alone but more it was the voice verna had heard in her own head jagang she felt herself suddenly trembling just at hearing his tone and inflection in amelias voice now my loyal and faithful plenipotentiary hand over the book sister amelia and i have more use of it nathan held it out to the side with her other hand the one not on the dacra in his leg amelia snatched back the book well nathan said are you going to kill me or not oh yes i intend to kill you amelia said in jagangs voice you betrayed our bargain lord rahl besides i dont like having subordinates who wont allow me into their minds before you die i thought id let you watch how a real slave obeys orders i thought youd like to watch me cut your little darlin clarissas throat breathe kahlan expelled the sliph from her lungs and with frantic need sucked in the alien air night crashed in around her she refused to spare the time to fear the sudden vision the sudden sound to give it time to settle into place in her mind and instead seized the stone wall to hoist herself out a frightening sightto match the words she had already heardgreeted her with her vision enhanced by the sliph she took in the whole scene at once in one slamming jolt the instant she saw him kahlan knew this was nathan he looked like a rahl and richard had told her about nathantall older with long white hair to his shoulders a woman had stabbed a dacra into his leg and was holding it there kahlan had heard her name ameliathe one who had started the plague kahlan saw verna with a woman at her back a young man stood frozen kahlan saw a beautiful young woman holding another woman by a fistful of hair done in ringlets it could only be clarissa the womans other fist held a knife at the terrified clarissas throat as kahlan had emerged from the sliph she was conscious of the last part of the conversation that had just taken place and knew well the voice coming from the woman holding the dacra in nathans leg kahlan knew well the word darlin she remembered hearing that voice from the wizard marlin who had come to assassinate richard it was jagangs voice the image of the amulet richard wore came unbidden into kahlans mind it means only one thing and everything cut once committed to fight cut everything else is secondary cut her training at the hands of her warrior father had been much the same kill or be killed never yield never wait attack richard was near deathnear his last breath she had no time to spare no time to consider she was committed cut in one fluid movement she erupted from the sliph dived out of the well yanked a short sword free of the scabbard on the soldier standing right there ducked her head tumbled forward and came up with the sword already whipping down in the span of a heartbeat before anyone had time to flinch kahlan was there she had to stop amelia before she released her magic into the dacra in nathans leg or he would be dead like lightning her sword descended severing sister amelias arm at the crook of her elbow and then everything moved in a painfully slow dance kahlan could see the expression on every face the woman kahlan had just cut sister amelia was falling back with a cry already kahlans sword was whirling to reverse her handhold as she followed her quarry down verna was spinning a dacra in her own hand toward a surprised woman behind her the young man was diving toward the woman with the knife nathans hands were coming up toward clarissa his scream cut through the night clarissa was reaching toward nathan the young woman holding her by the hair snarled with a vicious sneer and savagely cut through clarissas throat kahlan saw the spray of blood for only an instant before the night exploded with lightning from both nathan and the young man her left hand now joined with her right kahlan slammed her sword down through sister amelias heart pinning her to the ground before the second soldier had his sword clear of his scabbard vernas dacra expeditiously dispatched the woman behind her at the same time as the young woman with the knife took two bolts of lightning shattering her in a red horror as clarissas body still collapsed toward the ground the violence was over before comprehension could catch up with it in a daze nathan staggered toward clarissas body kahlan rushed past him and knelt beside clarissa the sight that greeted her brought a gasp kahlan sprang up and put her hands against nathan stopping him its too late nathan shes with the spirits now dont look please dont look i saw in her eyes the love she had for you please dont look at her like this remember her the way she was nathan nodded she had a good heart she saved so many people she had a good heart nathan lifted his arms he held his palms out toward clarissas body intense light flared forth flooding the dead woman with a brilliant blaze so radiant that the body couldnt be seen at its center from the light of this fire and into the light safe journey to the spirit world nathan whispered when the light was gone only ash remained nathan slumped the vultures can have the rest of them verna tucked her dacra back up her sleeve one soldier retrieved his sword from amelias body as the other sheathed his the young man looked in shock nathan im so sorry i gave jagang the meaning of prophecy that helped him i didnt want to but he made me im so sorry nathans doleful azure eyes turned toward the young man i understand warren you didnt do it out of malice the dream walker was in your mind and you had no choice you are free of him now nathan yanked the dacra from his leg he turned to verna you brought traitors to me verna you brought assassins to me but i realize you had not intended it sometimes prophecy overwhelms our attempts to outwit it and catches us unaware sometimes we think we are more clever than we are and that we can stay the hand of fate if we wish it hard enough verna straightened her cloak on her shoulders i thought i was saving them from jagang i never had any idea that they would give the oath to you without committing their hearts i understand nathan whispered i dont know what goes through that head of yours nathan lord rahl indeed verna glanced to where clarissas body had been and where now there was only white ash and i see that you havent changed your ways nathan once again youve gotten another of your little whores killed the impact of nathans fist lifted verna clear off the ground her jawbone shattered with a loud crack strings of blood sailed out into the night air warren cried out as verna landed flat on her back she didnt move warren crouched at vernas side looked up with frantic eyes nathan dear creator why would you do this youve broken her jaw why would you try to kill her nathan flexed his fist if i was trying to kill her she would be dead if you want her to live then i would suggest you heal her ive heard that you are talented at healing and with what i have done for you tonight you should be able to accomplish it in short order put some sense in her head while youre at it warren bent over verna pressing his hands to the unconscious womans face kahlan said nothing she had seen love in nathans eyes when he had looked at clarissa she had just seen rage too nathan bent and retrieved the inky black book lying on the ground beside sister amelias body he straightened and turned those rahl eyes on kahlan he held out the book you could be none other than kahlan i have been expecting you prophecy you know im glad i was not late you dont have much time give this to lord rahl i hope he knows how to destroy it he knew when he was at the temple of the winds but he said he had to give up his knowledge to leave but he wrote a message in the palms of his hands it says pinch of white sorcerers sand on third page one grain of black sorcerers sand tossed on and then there were three words but i dont know what they mean nathan laid a big hand on her shoulder the words are the three chimes reechani sentrosi vasi i dont have time to teach you about the three chimes but know that they must be spoken after the white and before the black thats what is important reechani sentrosi vasi kahlan repeated trying to commit the words to memory she said them over again in her head richard does have both white and black sorcerers sand does he not kahlan nodded yes he told me about it he has both nathan shook his head as if considering some private thought both he muttered nathan squeezed her shoulder i know from prophecy some of what he has been through stand by him love is too precious a gift to lose kahlan smiled i understand may the good spirits bring it to your heart nathan i cant thank you enough for helping richard for helping me her voice broke didnt know what i was going to do i only knew i had to come here nathan hugged her she thought more for his own need than hers you did the right thing maybe the good spirits guided you get back to him now or we will lose our lord rahl kahlan nodded the killing is over the killing is just about to begin nathan turned and held both fists skyward an awesome flare of light ignited at his fists and shot into the night sky kahlan watched as it streaked northwest so bright that the stars vanished in the glare kahlan saw verna sitting up with warrens help he was wiping the blood away from her newly healed jaw what have you done kahlan asked nathan he looked down at her a long moment and then a sly smile spread on his lips i have just given jagang a nasty surprise i have just given general reibisch the signal to attack attack attack who jagangs expeditionary force they destroyed renwold they are up to other trouble in the new world too but are unaware of who shadows them it will be a short battle the prophecy says that the dharans will fight as fiercely as they have ever fought and will before this night is over destroy the enemy in the traditional dharan fashion without mercy verna was coming to her feet kahlan had never seen verna looking so meek nathan i beg your forgiveness im not interested kahlan laid a hand on nathans arm and whispered up at him nathan please for your own sake listen to her nathan gazed into kahlans eyes a moment before he turned his glare on verna im listening nathan ive known you a long time my whole life ive seen things before that perhaps i didnt understand i thought you were doing this to seize power for yourself please forgive me for lashing out at you for my own guilt at my friends turning against meagainst us i sometimes jump to judgment i can see that i have mistaken what was truly going on with you and clarissa she adored you and i thoughti beg you to forgive me nathan nathan let out a grunt knowing you verna that must have been the hardest thing you have ever had to say forgiveness granted thank you nathan she sighed nathan bent and kissed kahlans cheek may the good spirits be with you mother confessor tell richard i give him back his title maybe i will see him again someday with his hands on her waist he boosted kahlan up onto the sliphs wall thank you nathan i can see why richard liked you clarissa too i think she saw the real nathan nathan smiled but then turned serious when you get back you must offer richards brother what he truly wants if you are to save richard you wish to travel the sliph asked kahlans stomach roiled yes back to aydindril is richard truly alive verna asked yes kahlan said with revived panic hes sick but he will be fine once i get this book back to him and its destroyed walsh bollesdun nathan gestured as he started away my coach awaits lets be off but nathan warren said i want to learn about prophecy i would like to study with you a true prophet is born warren not made where are you going verna called after him you cant leave youre a prophet you cant be left to run i mean we must know where you will be in case we need you without looking back nathan pointed your sisters are that way prelate to the northwest go to them and save yourself the trouble of trying to follow me you wont succeed your sisters are safe from the dream walker i had them transfer their bond to me while richard went to the world of the dead if richard lives you all can transfer it back to him goodbye verna warren kahlan pressed a fist to her stomach if he lives if hurry she said to the sliph hurry a silver arm swept her from the wall and down into the quicksilver froth chapter he smiled at the way she struggled he liked the way she had fought him he enjoyed teaching her how useless it was to fight a person of his superior strength superior intellect he watched in fascination as blood ran from her mouth and nose the gash on her jaw oozed you are only succeeding at making your wrists bleed he taunted you cant break the ropes but keep at it if you wish she spat at him he smacked her again he dug his thumb across the cut on her jaw spellbound by the pattern of blood flooding down the side of her neck he knew her auras hed felt them before he knew just which ones to touch to cripple her it hadnt taken long to overpower her not long at all her teeth gritted as she growled with effort straining against the ropes she was strong but she was not strong enough without her power and her weapon she was a mere woman no mere woman was a match for him not in any way when his fingers began unbuttoning the row of buttons along the side of her ribs she tugged violently at the ropes holding her wrists and ankles he liked that he like to watch her struggle to watch her bleed he punched her face again he was intrigued that she didnt cry out that she didnt beg for mercy that she didnt scream she would oh how she would scream his punch had stunned her for the moment her eyes rolled as she fought to remain conscious he threw back the front of her outfit exposing her breasts and the upper half of her torso he hooked his fingers under the tight waist of her red leather pants and with a quick pull yanked them down enough for what he was going to do to her her entire belly was exposed he felt it tight hard there were scars on her they riveted him he tried to imagine what had caused such scars as jagged and white as they were it would have been bloody ive been raped before she sneered more times than i can remember i can tell you from experience that youre not very good at it you havent even gotten my pants down enough you stupid pig get on with it if you even can im waiting oh cara im not going to rape you that would be wrong i have never raped a woman i only have women who want it she laughed at him laughed you are one twisted bastard he resisted his urge to smash her face he wanted her awake for this alive for this but he shook with rage bastard his fist tightened because of women like you he hammered a fist down on her breast her eyes squeezed shut and her teeth clenched as she winced in pain trying to curl up in a ball but unable to stretched out in the ropes as she was he took a settling breath regaining his control he wouldnt let her divert him with her filthy mouth now im going to give you one last chance where is richard the soldiers are going wild with talk of richard being back of the bond being back where are you whores hiding him the voices from the ether had told him too that richard was back the voices had told him that if he wished to assume his rightful place he must eliminate richard and where is my loving wife where has she gone to the voices told him that she was in the sliph but the sliph wouldnt tell him where she had gone cara spat at him again i am mordsith you are too stupid to even imagine what has been done to me before you couldnt fill the boots of the meekest trainer of mordsith your puny torture will pry nothing from me oh cara you have never encountered one of my talents do what you want with me drefan but lord rahlthe real lord rahlis going to cut you up into little pieces and just how would he be able to do that he lifted the hilt of the sword of truth clear of its scabbard so she could see the gold lettering that spelled out the word truth im the one who is going to be doing the cutting into little pieces little tiny richard pieces where is he when she spat at him again he couldnt resist fisting her across her cut and swollen lip the blood gushed anew he turned and retrieved one of the items he had brought an iron pot he put it on her belly upside down im too big to cook in that pot you stupid pig you will have to cut me up do i have to explain everything to you he liked the way she tried to antagonize him to make him lose his temper she wanted him to kill her he would but she would talk first cook you oh no cara you have the wrong idea the wrong idea entirely you think me some maniacal murderer no murderer i am the hand of justice i am the hand of mercy come to bring eternal virtue to those who have none this pot isnt to cook you its to cook the rats he was watching he saw the way her blue eyes flicked toward him he had been waiting for just that reaction rats i hope you arent stupid enough to think that i am afraid of rats just because im a woman im no woman like you have ever seen before i used to keep rats as pets really you lie so poorly my dear loving passionate wife explained to me how afraid you are of rats she didnt answer she was afraid of showing her fear but he could see it in her eyes i have a sack of rats here nice fat rats just get on with this rape im growing bored i told you i dont rape women they want it from me they ask for it they beg for it he tugged down his ruffled cuffs no cara i have something else in mind for you i want you to tell me where i can find my loving brother she turned her face away never get on with the torture before i fall asleep and miss it you see as i told you women always ask me for it he pressed the iron pot to her belly and wound a chain around her middle to hold down the pot he forced a finger under the rim checking to make sure that it was tight enough he then loosened the rough knot in the chain so he could get the rats under the pot cara showed no reaction when he shoved the first under the pot holding the second by the scruff of its neck he held it before her face letting her see it squirm and squeak see cara as i promised you rats big rats sweat beaded on her forehead i kind of like it it feels fuzzy against my stomach i may fall asleep he stuffed the second and then a third under the pot there was room for no more he took the slack from the chain and tightened the knot of links fuzzy he mocked i think they will keep you wide awake cara wide awake and eager to talk eager to betray richard whores have no honor you will betray him berdine is going to be here soon she will skin you alive he lifted an eyebrow you relieved berdine i saw you after she left i took you down she wont be back for quite a while but when she does come back she will get the same as you with tongs he retrieved a big glowing coal from the pan over the mass of candles he plunked the redhot coal down inside the rim of the footed bottom of the iron pot you see cara the coals are going to heat this iron potget it very hot he looked at her eyes the rats arent going to like that they are going to want out her breathing quickened sweat rolled down her face where were her brave words now she was silent now and how do you suppose the rats are going to get out cara once they start to get hot once the iron pot starts burning them singeing their tender noses just cut my throat and kill me you bastard when the rats get hot enough under there theyll panic theyll be frantic to get out guess how theyll get out cara she had no haughty answer to fill the silence he pulled his knife and with the handle tapped the iron pot how are you doing in there my little rat friends cara flinched he smiled when her eyes turned to him watching him he could see fear in those eyes real fear he plunked down a half dozen more glowing coals on the iron pot where is richard she had nothing to say he piled on more coals into a nice round hump that was all the pots bottom would hold he bent over and looked into her eyes her skin was as white as chalk sweat glistened on her face on her breasts where are you whores hiding richard you are crazy drefan i dont like this but if this is how i am to die then i will die but i will never betray lord rahl i am lord rahl when i get rid of my brother there will be no one to challenge my rule i am the son of darken rahl and the rightful master of dhara she turned her face away he saw her swallow her feet were trembling her smooth breathing was interrupted now and again caught up short he chuckled ill ask again when the rats start gnawing their way through you to get away from their hot iron prison when their sharp little claws start digging into your belly when the rats start tunneling into your guts trying to get out caras whole body jerked it jerked again her eyes widened as she stared up at the ceiling trying to keep the moan from escaping her throat he glanced back and saw a drop of blood run from under the rim of the bowl down her side well looks like they already want out ready to talk yet she spat at him and then gasped sharply her wide blue eyes fixed on the ceiling she was trembling all over now her whole body stiffed every muscle strained she started to pant tears filled the corners of her eyes to run down the side of her face she was feeling every little thing the rats didevery frantic bite every desperate digging ripping of their claws cara let out a short little cry sharp shrill clipped it was rapture he knew it was only the beginning even if she talked he had no intention of stopping this he longed to hear screams real from the gut screams cara obliged him and let out her first because of his singular perception another detail caught his attention his vigilance had again rewarded him smiling he turned to the sliphs well breathe kahlan expelled the sliph but she knew something was wrong even before she sucked a breath of air a piercing scream echoed around the stone room kahlan thought the shriek would make her ears bleed as she erupted from the sliph before she could brace herself to react big strong hands reached down and seized her she struggled to get her bearings to make sense of what was happening as the sudden light and sound whirled in around her the hands tore the book from her grasp an arm clamped around her neck its big fist gripping her arm she felt rope being wound around her wrist a nightmare came to life in her vision as she was dragged from the well kicking and twisting and trying to get away she went limp when a fist in her gut drove the wind from her lungs her knees smacked the stone floor her arms felt as if they were being wrenched from her shoulder sockets as they were twisted behind her back she fought to reach her confessors poweronly to remember when she couldnt touch it that the spirits had walled it from her so she could be married to drefan she was defenseless it was drefan attacking her cara was there on the floor her wrists bound above her head the rope fastened to a pin in the wall her ankles likewise secured with rope were stretched toward the opposite wall she had an iron pot chained over her middle the smell of hot coals and burning flesh assailed kahlans nostrils gagging her drefan pressed his knee to her arm as he knotted rope around her wrists kahlan tried to bite his leg he backhanded her across the face so hard that her vision narrowed to a tiny spot she fought to keep that vision to stay conscious she knew that she was lost if she passed out her arms bound behind her unable to break her fall she smacked into the stone floor facefirst drefan pounced on her back sitting on her holding her down as he bound her legs together kahlan struggled to pull a breath against the weight of him blood gushed from her nose the rope around her wrists was so tight that already her fingers were tingling cara screamed it was the loudest scream kahlan had ever heard it sent icy needles stabbing into her head it made her face hurt blood was running from under the rim of the iron pot cara shook and thrashed she stiffened and screamed again drefan lifted kahlans head by her hair wheres richard richard richard is dead kahlan grunted at a punch in her kidney she couldnt get her breath drefan turned his attention to cara ready to talk yet where did you hide richard caras only answer was another shuddering scream when it ended she panted in pain why did you tell him cara wept why did you tell him about the rats dear spirits why did you tell him about the rats terror locked kahlans breath in her lungs blood vivid red against white skin ran in rivulets from under the pots rim and down caras side smoke curled up from the hot coals atop it and then kahlan saw the bloody claw wriggling from under the rim of the pot on caras stomach kahlan suddenly understood it took all her force of will to keep from vomiting cara cried hysterically thrashing at the bloody ropes holding her kahlan furiously squirmed forward going for the chain to try to undo it with her teethto try to get the iron pot off cara drefan lifted kahlan by her hair your turn will come wife he heaved her back kahlan smacked into the wall and slid down onto something hard and sharp the pain brought stinging tears to her eyes it was nadines bag full of all those horn containers she lurched and wrenched herself until she was able to slip to the side off the bag and get her breath back drefan turned his darken rahl eyes on her if you tell me where richard is ill let cara go dont tell him cara screamed dont tell him i couldnt if i wanted to kahlan called out to cara i dont know where you hid him drefan picked up the book kahlan had brought whats this kahlans gaze locked on the sinister black book she had to have that book or richard would die well no matter you wont be needing it anymore no kahlan screamed when she saw what drefan was going to do with the book please he looked back at her as he held the book out over the sliphs well tell me where richard is he smiled lifting an eyebrow no he dropped the book down the well kahlans heart sank with the book the sliph who liked to watch the people in the room was nowhere to be seen now she probably had been frightened away by the screams drefan let cara go please you have me do what you want to with me but please let her go drefan smiled as wicked a smile as kahlan had ever seen it was a twin to darken rahls smile oh dont you worry i intend to do what i want with you when it is time he turned back to cara how are the rats doing cara ready to talk yet cara cursed him through clenched teeth drefan reached into a sack and brought out a rat holding it by the scruff of its neck he shook it in her face as she tried to turn away he lowered it against her squeaking and twisting its claws scratched and dug as it tried to get away from drefans grip leaving red streaks along caras cheeks chin and lips please cara wailed please get them away wheres richard dear spirits help me please help me please help me she mumbled over and over wheres richard caras body jerked violently mama she shrieked help me mama get them off mamaaaaa cara was alone in a cage with rats in the grip of terror and pain she was a helpless child again begging for the comfort and protection of her mother wailing for her mother kahlan gasped in tears this was her fault she had told drefan that cara was afraid of rats cara forgive me i didnt know cara thrashed at her ropes a little girl frantically begging for her mother to get the rats away kahlan strained to pull a hand free if she could only get a hand free of the ropes but they were so tight she tugged and pulled her fingers tingled the coarse rope cut into her wrists kahlan pressed her wrists against nadines bag searching for something sharp to cut the ropes the bag was cloth the handle smooth wood the bag kahlan bent to the side her fingers feeling for the button that held the bag closed she found it she struggled to undo the button but her fingers were numb and at the angle that her arms were twisted she couldnt make her fingers work properly she dug at the button with her thumbnail trying to hook it to the side trying to rip it off it was sewn on with heavy thread to stand up to the rigors of use and weight at last the button popped through its hole kahlan scooped at the contents in the bag trying to sling them out where she could see them every shrill wail from cara made kahlan flinch every time cara cried for her mother to save her from the rats kahlan had to hold back a sob of her own when she glanced up she saw drefan wiping a rat across caras face he had broken the back of another and draped it across her throat kahlan gritted her teeth and fingered the horn containers out of the bag cara was her sister of the agiel kahlan had to do something caras only hope was kahlan she twisted her neck trying to see the markings on the horns she couldnt find the one she wanted she used her fingers groping at the symbols scratched into the horn she felt one that she thought was the right one and her hopes soared only to be dashed when she felt that there were three circles she flicked each horn out of the way when she determined that it was not the one she needed she rooted in the bag and found another her fingers blindly felt the scratches they went in a circle she slipped her fingers along the horn and found another circle she felt a heavily scratched straight line between them kahlan held the horn in her fingertips and twisted trying to see if she was right cara screamed and kahlan dropped the horn she scooted to the side so she could see it on the floor it had two circles scratched into the patina of the horn a horizontal line ran through both circles it was the right one canin pepper nadine had warned her about taking off the wooden stopper warned her about getting it in your face your eyes it would immobilize a person for a time nadine had said make them helpless for a time kahlan worked the horn back into her fingers she wiggled the wooden stopper trying to loosen it it was cut to fit tightly to keep the dangerous substance from leaking out kahlans fingers were so numb they had no strength she gritted her teeth as she tried to work the stopper loose she didnt want it off yet but she had to know she could get it off with her hands behind her back she couldnt throw it she frantically tried to think of what she was going to do she had to do something if she didnt cara would soon be dead and then drefan would start in on his loving wife cara wailed in agony please mama get the rats away from cari please mama please help me please help me the pleading cries of hopeless terror ripped at kahlans heart she could wait no longer she would just have to figure out what to do when the time came she had to act drefan his head twisted around are you ready to tell me where richard is kahlan remembered something nathan had told her you must offer richards brother what he truly wants if you are to save richard maybe it would save cara richard what would i want with richard you know that its you i want he smiled a knowing satisfied smile soon my dear in a little while you can wait he turned back to cara no drefan i cant wait i need you now i want you now i cant resist any longer i cant pretend any longer i need you i said just like your mother he froze at her words i need you like your whore of a mother needed your father his expression darkened like a provoked bull he turned toward her his piercing eyes riveted on her what do you mean you know exactly what i mean i need to be taken like your father took your mother i want you to take me like that only you can satisfy me do it do it now please he rose up huge and imposing his muscles rippled and knotted his brow drew down in that grim rahl glare i knew it he breathed i knew it i knew you would finally give in to your filthy perversion he hesitated looking back at cara yes youre right youre always right drefan youre smarter than me you were right all along i cant fool you any longer give me what i want give me what i need please drefan im begging you i need you the look on his face was frightening it was madness if she could have shrunk back into the stone she would have drefan slipped free the knife at his belt as his tongue wet his lips he started toward her she had had no idea just how effective her words had been in sudden panic kahlan wiggled the wooden stopper drefans whole face the whole way he carried his body changed he was a seething monster coming at her his eyes narrowed with bestial loathing savage hatred hatred for her kahlan swallowed back the sudden terror welling up in her throat dear spirits what had she just done she scuffed her feet against the stone floor trying to back away she was already against the wall how was she going to get the powder in his face dear spirits what do i do kahlan wiggled the stopper with all her might it popped off drefan went to a knee beside her tell me how much you want me to please you yes i want you now give me the pleasure only you can give me he brought the knife up as he leaned toward her kahlan heaved herself toward him twisting rolling to the side as hard as she could flinging the horn full of powder at his face as she rolled onto hers she couldnt see facedown on the stone she didnt know if she had missed if the oily powder had come out if she had the horn turned the right way if he was close enough she held her breath bracing for the thrust of his knife imagining it coming knowing it was coming she could almost feel the sharp edge slicing her she struggled against the panic of not knowing just where he was going to cut her drefan staggered back she turned her face and saw him fall on his back writhing gasping for breath kahlan flipped herself over and started scooting toward cara she tried to move around drefan but she didnt have much room to maneuver his groping hand caught her ankles she kicked trying to pull away from his grip his fingers tightened around her ankles his powerful arm dragged her toward him he gasped for air his other hand flailing about trying to feel what was around him he was blind kahlan saw yellow powder on his cheek and neck she hadnt gotten it in his eyes as she had hoped she hadnt gotten it directly in his mouth or nose just the side of his face most had missed she didnt know how long that would stop him but she didnt think for long dear spirits let it be enough the horn was on the other side of him she couldnt get to it with all her strength when he tugged on her leg she used his pull to add momentum and kicked as hard as she could at his face she caught his ear tearing it partly away from his head he bellowed and released her ankle desperately kahlan pushed with her feet to get away from his grasping fingers she made it out of his reach she bumped into cara kahlan sat up and scooted back toward the woman hold on cara please hold on im here im going to get them off you i swear ill get them off you please mama cara wailed it hurts so much it hurts it hurts kahlan pulled her feet under herself so she could raise up enough she craned her neck looking over her shoulder trying to see what she was doing she seized the chain it burned her fingers making her recoil she made herself grab the chain again she tugged on the iron knot shaking twisting pulling through burning fingers she felt a link slip and the chain loosen she stole a quick glance drefan was still struggling to breathe but he had straightened his legs he put his arms at his sides what was he doing kahlan felt a link pull past resistance she wiggled the chain to loosen the knot to give it more room to come undone another link slipped free the chain loosened further she tugged at it refusing to let go even though the hot iron was burning her fingers drefans breathing was evening out he was laying perfectly still what was he doing kahlan cried out with joy when the chain rattled off the side of the pot with her back to cara kahlan hooked her fingers under the rim of the scalding pot and heaved it up and back flipping it off cara bloody rats tumbled to the floor squirming and wriggling trying to get their feet as they scurried away kahlan was near tears with joy i got them off cara i got them off you caras head lolled from side to side her eyes rolled she mumbled incoherently when she looked over her shoulder and saw caras stomach kahlan had to look away or be sick she scooted up toward caras hands with frenzied effort kahlan dug at the knot of rope but the knots were pulled impossibly tight from caras thrashing kahlan couldnt budge them she wasnt going to be able to untie them she would have to cut them drefans knife lay on the floor near him he was lying there perfectly still she had to hurry she had to get the knife and cut caras ropes she had to cut her own before he recovered kahlan dug in her heels and scooted toward the knife she turned around feeling for it with her fingers drefan rose up and seized her holding her around the middle he lifted her as if she weighed nothing he brought the knife around in front of her face nasty stuff powdered canin pepper lucky for me i know how to use my auras to overcome it now my whore of a wife its time you paid the price for your perversion chapter richard staggered toward the sliphs room from a room not far away where cara and berdine had put him he had heard the screams he had no idea how long he had been insensate no idea how long it had been since they had taken him there but the screams had brought him awake someone needed help and the last scream he knewkahlan his head pounded in violent pain he hurt everywhere he hadnt thought he would be able to stand but he did he hadnt thought he would be able walk but he did he had to he was barefooted and without a shirt he had on only his pants he knew that the lower keep was cool but he was covered in a sheen of sweat hardly able to breathe through the heat he felt he used all his willpower to force himself to move he straightened put a hand to the side of the door into the sliphs room and walked in drefan looked up he had his arm around kahlans middle he had a knife in his other hand to the side cara was lying on the floor tied in ropes her middle was ripped open she was still alive but shivering in agony richard couldnt make sense of it what in the name of all thats good is going on drefan richard he sneered just the man im looking for well now im here let kahlan go oh i will dear brother soon it is you i need why drefans eyebrows lifted so that i can be reinstated as lord rahl its my rightful place the voices told me my father told me i am to be lord rahl i was born to it the plague was a far distant drone in richards mind and body yet this all seemed a dream too drop the knife drefan and give up its over let kahlan go drefan laughed he threw his head back and roared with laughter when it died out drefans eyes narrowed with frightening resolve she wants me she begs for it you know the truth of that my dear brother you saw what she is she is a whore she is just like all the others just like nadine just like my mother she must die like all the rest richard looked into kahlans eyes what was going on dear spirits how was he going to get her away from drefan youre wrong drefan your mother loved you she took you to a place where you would be safe from darken rahl she loved you please let kahlan go im begging you she is mine my wife i will do with her what i will drefan slammed the knife into kahlans lower back richard flinched at hearing it hit bone kahlan grunted with the impact her eyes going wide in shock drefan released her she dropped to her knees and crumpled to her side richard tried with all his might to make sense of this he couldnt decide if this was real or a dream he had been having so many dreams so many nightmares this seemed like all the rest but different he didnt even know if he was alive anymore the whole room swam before him drefan drew the sword of truth the ring of steel that richard knew so well echoed around the stone room a chime that seemed to awaken him into a nightmare richard could see the rage from the sword the magic take drefans eyes im all right richard kahlan panted as she stared up at him you dont have a weapon get out of here get away i love you please for me run the rage in drefans eyes was nothing to match the rage thundering into richards heart drop the sword drefan now or i will kill you drefan swept the sword around how with your bare hands richard vividly remembered what zedd had told him when first giving him the sword of truth the sword was only a tool the seeker was the weapon a true seeker didnt need the sword richard started forward and with hate in my heart i will enjoy killing you at last richard even if you dont have a weapon i am the weapon richard was running the distance between them shrank at an alarming rate kahlan screamed for him to get away he hardly heard her richard was committed drefan lifted the sword overhead pulling a breath in preparation to cleave richard that was the opening richard knew that a thrust was faster than a cut he was in the iron grip of deadly determination richard was lost in the dance with death drefan bellowed in rage as the sword started down richard dropped to his left knee through the opening using his forward momentum and a twist of his torso to add force to his strike fingers straight and stiff he drove his arm ahead with all his might before the sword could touch him richard struck like lightning driving his hand through drefans soft middle in the blink of an eye he had seized drefans spinal column and yanked it back out ripping it apart drefan pitched backward crashing against the sliphs well slumping down in a spreading crimson flood richard bent to kahlan cupping her face with his left hand he didnt want to touch her with drefans blood she was panting in pain from the corner of his eye richard could see drefans arm move i cant feel my legs richard i cant feel my legs dear spirits what did he do to me her voice quivered with panic i cant make them move richard was already lost in need he had forgotten how to use his power as the price of returning from the temple of the winds but he had used it before he had healed before he was a wizard he ignored his dizzy head his sick stomach he couldnt allow that to stop him from nathan richard had learned that his power was called through need if the need was great enough or through anger if the anger was great enough he had never had more need than he had at that moment nor more anger richard oh richard i love you i want you to know if we if we hush he said in a gentle voice her face was cut and bloody it made him ache to see her pain her panic i will heal you lie still and i will make you whole again oh richard i had the book i lost it oh richard im so sorry i had it i had it but its gone with a sinking feeling he grasped what she was saying lie was going to die there was nothing to be done now he was lost richard please heal cara no i dont think i have enough strength to heal both of you to heal he had to take the pain from the one injured killing drefan had taken nearly all the strength he had i must heal you kahlan shook her head please richard if you love me do as i ask heal cara its my faultwhat he did to her my fault a tear ran down her cheek i lost the book i cant save you heal cara she stifled a cry we will be together soon for all time then he understood they were both to die they would be together in the spirit world she didnt want to live without him richard kissed her brow hold on dont give up please kahlan i love you dont give up richard turned to cara he already felt so sick that the sight didnt affect him the way it normally would have her suffering though bent him with pain for her he laid his hands across caras bloody torn middle cara im here hold on for me hold on so i can help you she didnt seem to hear his words as she mumbled her head lolling from side to side richard closed his eyes and opened his heart his need his soul he released himself into the current of empathy he wanted nothing but to make cara whole again she had given her all for them he didnt know if he had strength enough but he gave all of himself over to it he descended into the swirl of her agony he felt everything she felt suffered with her he gritted his teeth held his breath and pulled her pain into himself onward ever onward without sparing anything to protect himself he shook with the suffering and his mind wailed with it he absorbed it into himself and then asked for more he asked for all of it he demanded it the world was liquid twisting coursing pain he was swept away in a molten river of it its fiery heat consumed his being time lost all meaning there was only the pain when he felt it all gathered into himself he let flow his empathy his power healing strength healing heart he didnt know how to direct it he just let it flow into her it felt as if his whole self drained away into her need she was baked barren earth soaking in lifegiving rain when at last he opened his eyes and lifted his head his arms were lying across the smooth skin of her midriff she was whole again though she seemed still unaware of it she was whole richard turned kahlan was lying on her side her breath coming in short sharp pants her face was ashen and covered with sweat and blood her eyes half closed richard she whispered when he bent to her free my hands i want to be hugging you when when she died that was what she was going to say richard snatched up a knife lying nearby and sliced through the ropes the anger was back but only as a distant glow now he could hardly see the room anymore hardly hear her hardly see her her wrists finally free she threw an arm over his neck and drew him to her richard struggled to keep from falling on her richard richard richard she whispered i love you richard went to embrace her and saw the pool of blood spreading under her his rage ignited anew his need ignited anew he took her up in his arms begging the spirits to spare her please give me the strength to heal this loved one he whispered in choking tears i have done everything required of me i have sacrificed everything please losing this loved one should not be part of it im dying give me the time help me it was all he wanted all he needed as he held her to him he wanted her to live to be well to be whole holding her in his arms he once again released himself into the torrent he pulled the pain onward heedless of it welcoming it drawing it with all his might at the same time he let flow his love his warmth his compassion kahlan gasped richard could see that his arms were glowing as if a spirit were sharing his body with him perhaps he was already a spirit but he didnt care he cared only that he would heal her and cared not at what cost he would pay any price kahlan gasped with the feel of it the feel of the power surging into her her legs began to tingle it was the first time she had felt anything in them since drefan had stabbed her richard seemed to glow around her as he hugged her in his arms held her in his warm loving embrace the rapture of the sliph by comparison was torture this was beyond anything she had ever felt in her life she could feel his warm healing magic coursing through every fiber of her it was like being born anew life and vitality welled up in her tears of bliss flooded from her eyes as she hung in richards arms his magic completely overwhelming her when at last he parted from her she moved without pain her legs moved she felt whole she was healed richard wiped the blood from her lips as he gazed into her eyes kneeling on the floor together kahlan kissed him tasting their salty tears she parted gripping his arms looking into his eyes seeing him as if in a new light she had just shared something with him that was beyond words beyond comprehension kahlan stood holding out her hand to help him up richard lifted his hand toward hers and then he toppled over onto his face richard she dropped down rolling him over onto his back he was hardly breathing richard please richard dont leave me please dont leave me she clutched at his shoulders he was burning with fever his eyes were closed he struggled for each shallow breath oh richard im so sorry i lost the book please richard i love you dont die and leave me alone here came a voice that echoed around the room kahlans head came up the voice seemed unreal she couldnt understand it then realization hit her kahlan spun around and saw the quicksilver face of the sliph looking down at her a liquid silver arm held out the black book master needs this the sliph said take it kahlan snatched the book thank you thank you sliph kahlan dropped down to get the sorcerers sand that richard carried in the leather packs but he wasnt wearing his big overbelt she rushed to cara still tied in the ropes caras head rolled from side to side as she mumbled as if she didnt know that richard had healed her she was still lost in a prison of her own private terror zedd had told kahlan that the gift couldnt heal maladies of the mind cara cara where were you keeping richard where are his things cara didnt respond kahlan snatched the knife off the floor and sliced through the ropes cara just lay there kahlan pressed her hands to caras face making the woman look at her cara its all right now the rats are gone theyre gone youre safe richard healed you youre all right rats cara mumbled get them off me please please kahlan hugged her cara theyre gone im your sister of the agiel i need you please cara come back to me please cara only mumbled cara kahlan wept richard will die if you dont help me there are thousands of rooms in the keep i need to know where you kept him please cara richard helped you now he needs your helpor he will die theres no time richard needs you caras eyes focused as if she were coming awake richard kahlan wiped the tears from her face yes richard hurry cara i need the belt richard wears i need it or he will die cara brought her hands down rubbing her wrists now smooth where they had been cut before she felt her stomach even the old scars were gone i am healed she whispered lord rahl healed me yes cara please richard is dying i have the book but i need the things he keeps in his belt cara abruptly sat up pulling the red leather across her chest she buttoned two of the buttons to hold it closed his belt yes you stay with lord rahl i will get it hurry cara stood swaying for a moment as she steadied herself and then she dashed from the room kahlan hugged the inky black book to herself she bent over richard he was hardly breathing she knew that any one of those breaths could be his last he had given them cara and kahlan the rest of his strength dear spirits help him give him just a little more time please he has suffered so much please just give him a little time until i can destroy this vile book kahlan bent over him and kissed his lips hold on richard hold on for me please if you can hear me we have the book i know how to destroy it please just hold on kahlan knelt down on a clear spot closer to the door and laid open the book to the third page so she would be ready when cara returned she gazed into a vision of a wasteland there was sand blown into dunes stretching into the distance of the phantasm emanating from the book kahlan stared into that barren place and saw runes on the sandlines drawn in geometric patterns her sight was drawn into the pattern of lines that swirled and twisted around there in the runes was light it flared forth every color shining out toward her calling to her mother confessor cara yelled shaking kahlans shoulders didnt you hear me i have lord rahls belt kahlan blinked shaking her head trying to clear her mind she snatched the belt and undid the bone holder on the flap of the pack where richard kept the sorcerers sand inside she found the leather pouch of white sand with cara standing behind her touching her shoulder kahlan cast a pinch of the white sand into the book the color boiled and twisted tumbled and turned kahlan pulled her eyes away and stabbed her hand back into the pack pulling out the other leather pouch the one with the black sorcerers sand with two fingers she carefully pulled the top open inside she could see the inky black sand troubled kahlan paused there was something else something tickling at the back of her mind the words nathan said to say the words the three chimes before using the black sand three words what were they she couldnt remember them her mind raced after them but they kept going around dark corners and when she turned they were gone again her thoughts mired in staggering fright she ached in desperate thought but the words wouldnt come to her richard had them written in the palm of his hand kahlan turned to go to read them from his palm and froze drefan leaning up against the well of the sliph where he had fallen somehow still hanging to a thread of life was holding up the sword richard was lying right there on the floor within reach drefan was going to kill him no kahlan screamed but the sword was already sweeping down faint maniacal laughter drifted on the air kahlan threw her fist up calling the blue lightning to protect richard it didnt come she was blocked from her power cara was already diving toward drefan but she was too far away she wasnt going to make it the sword was halfway there a silver arm swept down and seized drefans arm holding it tight kahlan held her breath another liquid silver arm enveloped drefans head breathe the sliph cooed a voice promising the sating of bestial lust a voice promising rapture wish you to please me breathe drefans chest rose as he inhaled the sliph he went still holding the sliph in his lungs the sliph freed him and he slumped to the side his breath left him releasing the sliph he had inhaled it drained from his mouth and nose not silver but red kahlan felt something inside her part a profound unraveling and all at once she joined with her power a sweet reclaiming that brought a gasp of euphoric inner union drefan was dead as long as they both live those were the words her oath was ended the winds had returned her power kahlan was brought out of her daze when she heard richard gasp for a breath with renewed panic she scrambled across the floor and scooped up his right hand where richard had written the message she pried open his fingers the words were gone the act of stopping drefan and his blood had scoured away the writing kahlan screamed in frustrated rage she scrambled back to the open book she couldnt remember the words her mind ached with frustration she couldnt make the words come what was she going to do maybe if she just threw in the grain of black sand anyway no she knew better than to disregard what a wizard like nathan said to do she squeezed her head between the heels of her hands as if trying to press the words out cara knelt down grasping her by her shoulders mother confessor whats wrong you must hurry lord rahl is hardly breathing hurry tears ran down her face i cant remember the words oh cara i cant remember them nathan told me but i cant remember them kahlan clambered back across the floor to richard she smoothed a hand down his face richard please wake up i need to know the words please richard what are the words the three words he struggled to draw a breath gasping with the effort he wasnt going to wake he wasnt going to live kahlan rushed back to the book she snatched up the leather pouch of black sand she would have to do it without the words maybe it would work it would work it had to work she couldnt make her hands move she knew better it wouldnt work unless she said the words she knew it wouldnt she had grown up around wizards and magic she knew better than to disregard what nathan had told her without the words it wouldnt work she fell forward with a wail beating her fists against the stone floor i cant remember the words i cant cara put an arm around kahlan making her sit up holding her in a gentle embrace calm down take a breath good let it go take another now picture in your mind this man nathan picture him telling you the words and how happy you were that you could save richards life kahlan tried she tried so hard she wanted to scream i cant remember them she wept richards going to die because i cant remember three stupid words i cant remember the three chimes the three chimes cara asked you mean reechani sentrosi vasi those three chimes kahlan stared in disbelief thats them the three chimes reechani sentrosi vasi reechani sentrosi vasi i remember thank you cara i remember kahlan pulled out a grain of black sorcerers sand between her thumb and finger reechani sentrosi vasi she said again for good measure she tossed the grain of black sand into the book she and cara both held their breath a hum slowly built in the room the air seemed to dance and vibrate light of every color flared forth twisting and tumbling pulsing and throbbing it grew with the hum until kahlan had to turn her eyes away rays of light swept across the stone walls cara put a hand up before her face kahlan did the same so bright was the light that just turning away was not enough and then darkness began gathering like the inky black of a night stone or of the books cover itself pulling the light and color back into the book it drew all the light from the room until all fell into darkness in that depth of sightless obscurity there came such terrible moans that kahlan was thankful she couldnt see their source the wails of souls filled the room scattering about in a blind mad frenzy swirling through the air lost frantic wild the sound of distant laughter that kahlan knew all too well died into a wail that stretched into eternity when the light of the candles returned the book was gone only a stain of ash to show where it had been kahlan and cara rushed to richard he opened his eyes he still didnt look well but he looked more alert his breathing was stronger and even what happened he asked i can breathe my head isnt pounding the mother confessor saved you cara announced as i have told you so often women are stronger than men cara kahlan whispered how did you know the three chimes cara shrugged the legate rishi knew the words with the message from the winds when you said the three chimes they just came to me through his magic as the other messages from the winds came to me kahlan pressed her forehead to caras shoulder in relief in wordless gratitude with equally silent empathy cara stroked kahlans back richard blinked and scrunched his eyes as if clearing his head when he sat up kahlan leaned to hug him but cara held her back please mother confessor may i be first i fear that once you start i may never again get a chance kahlan grinned youre right about that take all you want as cara threw her arms around richard and squeezed for all she was worth whispering private heartfelt words in his ear kahlan stood and faced the sliph i cant thank you enough sliph you saved richard you are a friend and i will honor you as long as i live the silver face warped into a satisfied smile she looked down at drefans body he had no magic but he was using his talent to stop the flow of blood so that he might live long enough to kill master it is death to breathe me if you have no magic i am pleased i could take him on a journey a journey to the world of the dead richard stood on wobbly legs and slipped an arm around kahlans waist sliph you have my gratitude too i dont know what it is i could ever do for you but if it is within my power its yours for the asking the sliph smiled thank you master i would be pleased to have you travel with me you will be pleased even though he was unsteady on his feet richards eyes had the sparkle back yes we would like to travel i need to rest for a time first to finish recovering and get my strength back and then we will travel i promise you kahlan took up caras hand are you all right i mean are you really all right everything cara nodded with a haunted look in her eyes i still have the ghosts of the past with me but i am all right thank you sister for helping me it is not often that a mordsith can depend on anyone else for help but with richard as lord rahl and you as mother confessor all things seem possible cara glanced to richard when you healed the mother confessor you seemed to glow as if a spirit was with you i believe the good spirits helped me i do indeed i recognized the spirit it was raina richard nodded it felt like raina when i was in the spirit world denna told me that raina was at peace and knows that we love her i think we should tell this to berdine cara said richard slipped his other arm around caras waist and started them all toward the door i think we should too chapter several days later when richard was almost fully recovered tristan bashkars uncle king jorin bashkar the king of jara rode into aydindril at the head of his company of kings lancers on the point of each of the hundred lances was a head kahlan watched from a window as the lances under the watchful eye of dharan soldiers were deployed in an arrowstraight double row along the entrance to the confessors palace flags of state flew from poles held by the first opposing pair of jarian soldiers jorin bashkar with his star guide javas kedar behind him waited until the lancers were lined up perfectly their armor gleaming in the sun before he strode regally between the row of heads toward the entrance as she peered out the window kahlan touched caras arm go get richard have him meet me in the council chambers cara was out the door and on her way before kahlan could turn to be on her way too kahlan amnell mother confessor sitting in the first chair under the figures of magda searus the first mother confessor and her wizard merritt painted across the expanse of the dome above the council chambers waited for her wizard her heart lifted when she saw him sweep into the room golden cloak billowing out behind dressed in the goldtrimmed black outfit of a war wizard the gold and ruby amulet on his chest gleaming in the streamers of sunlight through which he strode his silver wristbands burnished and bright the sword of truth at his hip caught the light sending out a starburst of sunlight to glitter across the polished marble good morning my queen he called out his voice echoing around the huge room how do you fare this your last day of freedom kahlan rarely laughed in the council chambers it had always seemed improper she laughed now the lilting sound echoing around the cavernous room bringing a smile to the guards i fare well lord rahl she said as he ascended the dais cara and berdine followed in his shadow along with ulic and egan taking up places to either side whats going on he asked more seriously i heard that some king just rode in with a hundred heads on pikes the king of jara remember you sent him tristans head demanding his surrender oh that king richard slid down into a chair beside her whose heads arc they i guess were about to find out the guards pulled open the double doors light stabbed in through the doorway silhouetting the two figures as they approached once before the dais the king spread his violet cape trimmed in spotted white fox and went to one knee in a deep bow behind him the star guide went to both knees in his bow rise my children kahlan said in formal response to the bow mother confessor king jorin said how good to see you again his trim figure his graying hair meticulously cut so that it swept back as if he were facing the wind his elegant scabbard and sword his ribbons his sash his red and blue and goldembroidered coat and his jeweled pins made him look one of the most grand of kings kahlan had always thought and you king jorin kahlan lifted an introductory hand this is lord rahl master of the dharan empire and my husband to be the king lifted an eyebrow as i have heard it told my congratulations richard leaned forward i sent you a message what is your reply kahlan thought that she had a lot of work to do teaching richard proper diplomatic decorum the king let out a belly laugh it will be a pleasure being part of an empire led by a man who doesnt gibber jabber me to death he lifted a thumb indicating the star guide behind him like some people and does that mean that you surrender richard pressed it does indeed lord rahl mother confessor a large delegation from the imperial order came to sandilar and invited us to join the imperial order we had been waiting for a sign as requested by javas kedar here tristan thought to take matters into his own hands and try to strike a favorable deal with the order when the plague came we thought it showed the power of the order and we feared that i must admit but when you swept the plague from the land that was sign enough for me javas here will no doubt soon find the appropriate sign in the sky to confirm my decision if not there are other star guides a redfaced javas kedar bowed as i told you your highness as your star guide i will be able to confirm your decision without difficulty the king scowled over his shoulder good and the heads richard asked the delegation from the imperial order i brought you their heads to show you my sincerity i wanted you to see that this is a choice i make with conviction i thought it a fitting answer to the likes of people who would cast a plague into the land to kill indiscriminately it shows their true nature putting the lie to all the things they say richard bowed his head to the king thank you king jorin who ordered the beheading of my nephew tristan i did richard said as i stood on a balcony watching with the mother confessor at my side tristan entered the mother confessors bedroom and stabbed a nightdress stuffed with tow that we had placed there he thought he was killing her the king shrugged justice befits all no matter his station i bear no grudge tristan did not serve our people well either i look forward to the day we can be rid of the threat from the order as do we richard said with your help we are that much closer to that day as the king went to see to the signing of papers and to discuss logistics with the dharan command richard and kahlan rose to leave but were interrupted by a guard what is it kahlan asked there are three men asking to see lord rahl three men who are they they did not give their names mother confessor but they said they were raugmoss richard sat back down send them in under the desk kahlan reached over and curled her fingers around his hand giving him a reassuring squeeze as three figures in flaxen cloaks with broad hoods pulled up onto their heads and with their hands folded before them glided up to the dais i am lord rahl richard said yes the one in front said we feel the bond he lifted a hand out to his side this is brother kerloff and this is brother houck he pushed his hood back to reveal a heavily creased face and a head of thinning gray hair i am marsden taboor richard warily eyed the three men welcome to aydindril i hear you wanted to see me what is it i can do for you we are searching for drefan rahl marsden taboor said richard rubbed his thumb along the edge of the desk as he watched the three men im sorry but your high priest is dead the two in back shared a look marsden taboors expression darkened high priest i am the high priest of the raugmoss and have been since before drefan was born richard frowned drefan told us he was the high priest marsden taboor stroked his temple as he searched for words lord rahl im afraid that your brother was given to delusion if he told you that he was the high priest of the raugmoss then he was deceiving you for reasons i fear to imagine he was left with us by his mother when he was a young boy we raised him knowing what his father would do should he come to discover a son without the gift drefan could bedangerous once we realized this we kept him confined within our community to prevent him from hurting anyone he was talented at healing and we always hoped that he would come to be at peace with himself we hoped that through healing he could find a way to prove his worth in his own right a while back he vanished several of our healers were found dead they had been killed in a most unpleasant fashion torture we have been searching for drefan since we have been lo several places where he had been and found women who had been murdered in a similar way drefan had an unsavory attitude toward women his father too was not inclined to be kind toward women though he escaped his father in body i think he failed to escape him in spirit i pray he has not caused harm to anyone here richard was silent for a time before he spoke we had a plague a terrible plague thousands died without regard for himself drefan upholding the noble ideals of the raugmoss worked to help those stricken he shared his knowledge and in that way may have prevented yet more from dying my brother in his own way helped stop the plague and in so doing he died marsden taboor folded his hands before him again as he studied richards eyes is this the way you wish it remembered he was my brother partly because of his being here i learned the power of forgiveness kahlan squeezed richards hand under the table thank you for seeing me lord rahl marsden taboor bowed in your light we thrive thank you richard whispered the three healers started away but marsden taboor turned back i knew your father you do not take after him drefan did not many will mourn the passing of your father or your brother i can see in your eyes lord rahl a healer a true healer besides a warrior a wizard as a healer must be in balance or he is lost dhara is well served at long last call on us if you have need ulic let out a sigh when the doors closed lord rahl there are other representatives also wishing to see you if you are well enough cara added someone always wants to see us richard stood and held out his hand to kahlan general kerson can see them dont we have something more important to do are you sure you are well enough kahlan asked ive never felt better you havent had a change of mind have you kahlan smiled as she took his hand and stood never if lord rahl is fully recovered what are we waiting for my things are ready about time berdine muttered as they waited for richard to return kahlan put a reassuring hand on caras back she wouldnt lie to us cara if the sliph says you can travel you can travel the sliph had tested cara berdine ulic and egan all of them thinking that as guards they should go along to protect richard and kahlan only cara had passed the sliphs test richard guessed that it was because cara had linked with the andolian leader legate rishi and he must have an element of both sides of the magic cara didnt like anything to do with magic and the sliph was definitely magic enough to give her pause kahlan leaned close and whispered in caras ear you have passed bigger tests than this in this room i am a sister of the agiel i will hold your hand the whole way cara eyed kahlan and then the sliph you have to do it cara berdine pleaded you will be the only mordsith at the wedding of our lord rahl and mother confessor caras brow twitched as she leaned toward berdine lord rahl healed you one time berdine nodded since then have you felt a special bond with him berdine smiled yes that is why i want you to go ill be all right i know raina would want you to go too she gave ulic a backhanded slap on his stomach besides someone has to stay here and keep ulic and egan in line ulic and egan together rolled their eyes cara put a hand on kahlans arm as she leaned close and whispered since lord rahl healed you have you felt have you felt it too kahlan smiled i felt it before he healed me it is called love cara truly caring about someone else not only because you are bonded to them but because you share something in your heart when he healed you you felt his love for you but i knew before that kahlan shrugged maybe it was just a more vivid way of feeling it cara lifted her agiel rolling it in her fingers maybe he is a brother of the agiel kahlan smiled with all weve been through together i guess we are all as close as family richard strode into the room im ready shall we travel richard couldnt take the sword of truth into the sliph its magic was incompatible with life being sustained while traveling he had gone up to leave his sword in the first wizards enclave where it would be safe where no one but he could get to it except zedd of course but zedd was no longer living at least kahlan didnt think he was alive richard refused to doubt that he was richard rubbed his hands together so cara are you going or not i would really like you to be there it would mean a lot to us cara smiled i must go you are incapable of protecting yourself without a mordsith you would be helpless richard turned to the silver face watching them sliph i know that i put you to sleep before but you didnt stay asleep why you did not put me into the deep sleep from which only one such as yourself can call me you put meat rest others can call me if i am only at rest but we cant allow those others to use you cant you refuse cant you just not go to them if they call we cant have you taking jagangs wizards and such all over creation to cause trouble the sliph regarded him with a thoughtful expression those who made me the sliph made me this way i must travel with those who ask if they have the price of power required she moved to the edge of her well closer to him but if i was asleep only you have the power to call me master and then the others could not use me but i tried to put you to sleep before and it didnt work the sliphs smile returned you did not have the silver required before silver the sliph reached out and touched his wristbands silver you mean when i crossed my wrists to put you to sleep before it didnt work because i didnt have these and now if i put you to sleep it will work yes master richard thought a moment does ithurt or anything when you are put into this sleep no it is rapture for me when i sleep because i am with the rest of my soul richards eyes widened when you sleep you go to the world of souls yes master i am not to tell anyone how it is that they can put me into the sleep but you are the only master and since you wished to know you will not be angry that i tell you richard sighed with relief thank you sliph you have given us a way to prevent the wrong people from using you im glad to know that you will be pleased to go into your sleep richard hugged berdine take care of everything until we get back i am to be in charge then berdine asked richard frowned suspiciously all three of you are in charge are you sure you heard that mistress berdine ulic asked i dont want you to later say that you heard no such orders berdine made a face at him as richard helped kahlan up onto the well i heard all three of us are to take care of things kahlan adjusted the bone knife on her arm and the pack on her back she took caras hand as she climbed up sliph richard said with a big grin we wish to travel chapter breathe kahlan let go the silken rapture and drew in a breath and the world as they sat up on the edge of the sliphs stone wall kahlan smacked cara on the back breathe cara come on let it go let out the sliph and breathe cara finally bent forward and released the sliph from her lungs reluctantly pulling a breath kahlan remembered how hard it was the first time not only to breathe the sliph but to then breathe the air again cara had held on tightly to richard and kahlans hands the whole time they traveled cara looked up with a silly grin that waswonderful richard gave them both a hand down kahlan adjusted the bone knife on her arm and the small pack on her back it felt good to be in her traveling clothes again cara thought that kahlan looked odd in pants this is where you wished to travel the sliph said the jocopo treasure richard looked around the cave having to duck down because the ceiling was so low i dont see any treasure its in the next room kahlan told him someone must be expecting us they left a torch burning are you ready to sleep richard asked the sliph yes master i look forward to being with my soul the thought of what the sliph was what the wizards had made her into gave kahlan shivers will it make youunhappy when i need to wake you again no master i am always ready to please richard nodded thank you for your help we all are in your debt have a good sleep the sliph smiled at him as richard crossed his wrists closing his eyes calling the magic the shiny silver face reflecting the dancing torchlight softened melting back into the pool of quicksilver richards fists began to glow the silver wristbands he wore brightened to such intensity that kahlan could see the other side of them through his flesh and bone and the way they touched they formed into endless twin loops the symbol for infinity the pool of sparkling silver took on the glow as the sliph sank down into her well slowly at first and then with gathering speed until she vanished into the far darkness below richard took the reed torch and the three of them moved out through a wide low passageway following the twisting turning route through dark brown rock until they came at last to an expansive room kahlan gestured around the room the jocopo treasure richard held the torch up torchlight reflected back in thousands of golden sparkles from the room filled with gold in nearly every form from nuggets and crude ingots to golden statues well it isnt hard to see why its called the jocopo treasure richard said he pointed toward the shelves looks like something is missing kahlan saw what he meant when i was here before those shelves were packed full of rolled vellum scrolls she sniffed the air something else is missing too this room was filled with foul air before its gone now she remembered how it made her gag and cough and her head spin having to breathe the stench on the floor of the cave was a smoldering heap of ash kahlan swiped the toe of her boot across the ash i wonder what happened here the flame of the torch whipped and fluttered as they followed the twisting tunnel up and out into a golden dawn thin bands of violet clouds drifted across the sunrise luminous gold more stunning than the jocopo treasure edged the clouds verdant grasslands spread out before them smelling clean and fresh it looks like the azrith plains in spring cara said before the high heat of summer bakes it barren broad swaths of wildflowers at their feet led in the general direction of the mud people kahlan took richards hand it was a beautiful morning for a walk through the spring grasslands of the wilds it was a beautiful day to be married long before they reached the mud peoples village they could hear the sound of drums drifting out onto the plains laughter and song filled the morning air sounds like the mud people are having a banquet richard said what do you think thats about his voice sounded uneasy she felt the same banquets were usually held to call the spirit ancestors in preparation for a gathering chandalen met them not far from the village he was wearing the coyote hide of an elder his hair was slicked down with sticky mud he was barechested and had on his ceremonial dress of buckskin pants and his finest knife and he carried his best spear grimfaced chandalen strode forward and slapped kahlan strength to confessor kahlan richard caught cara by the wrist easy he whispered we told you about this its the way they greet people kahlan returned the slap a show of respect for a persons strength strength to chandalen and the mud people it is good to be home she fingered the coyote hide you are an elder now he nodded elder breginderin died of the fever i was named elder kahlan smiled a wise choice them picking you chandalen stood before richard appraising him a moment the two men had once been foes chandalen finally slapped richard harder than he had kahlan strength to richard with the temper it is good to see you again too i am happy that you are to marry the mother confessor so that she will not pick chandalen richard returned the slap in kind strength to chandalen you have my gratitude for protecting kahlan on your journey together he lifted a hand this is our friend and protector cara chandalen was a protector of his people and the term had special meaning to him he lifted his chin as he looked into her eyes he slapped her harder than he had slapped either richard or kahlan strength to protector cara it was fortunate that cara wasnt wearing her armored gloves as hard as she punched him she would have broken his jaw chandalen grinned when he straightened his neck strength to chandalen she said to him and then to richard i like this custom cara reached out and ran a finger over a few of chandalens scars very nice this one here is excellent the pain must have been exquisite chandalen frowned at kahlan and spoke in his language what does that last word mean it means that it must have been intense pain kahlan told him she had taught chandalen her language and he did very well but he still had some to learn chandalen grinned with pride yes it was very painful i wept for my mother cara lifted an eyebrow to kahlan i like him chandalen looked cara up and down taking in the red leather and the shape of her you have fine breasts her agiel flicked up into her fist kahlan put a restraining hand on caras arm the mud people have different customs she whispered to them it means that you look like a healthy strong woman able to bear children and raise them to be healthy to them this is a strictly proper compliment she leaned closer lowering her voice so that chandalen couldnt hear just dont tell him that you would like to see him with the mud washed out of his hair or you will be inviting him to give you those children cara took in all this considering kahlans words with care finally she turned and bending over a little lifted her red leather to expose a nasty scar this one was very painful like the one you have chandalen grunted with knowing appreciation i had more on my front but lord rahl made them disappear it is a shame some were quite remarkable richard and kahlan followed behind chandalen and cara as he showed her his weapons and they discussed the worst place to be wounded she was impressed with his knowledge chandalen kahlan asked whats going on why has a banquet been called he looked over his shoulder as if she were deranged it is a wedding banquet for your wedding kahlan and richard shared a look but how did you know we were coming to be married chandalen shrugged the bird man told me as they entered the village they were surrounded by a hood of people children swept in around them touching the wandering mud people as they called richard and kahlan people they knew came to give them gentle slaps in greeting savidlin was there clapping richard on the back and his wife weselan was hugging and kissing them both their son siddin threw his arms around kahlans leg jabbering up at them in his language it felt so good to ruffle his hair again richard and cara didnt understand any of it only chandalen spoke their language we have come to he married kahlan told weselan i brought the beautiful dress you made for me i hope you remember that i asked you to stand with me weselan beamed i remember kahlan saw a man with long silver hair dressed in buckskin pants and tunic approaching she leaned toward cara this is their leader the bird man greeted them with the gentle slaps customary in the village proper he embraced kahlan in a fatherly hug the fever is over our ancestors spirit must have been a help to you kahlan nodded i am glad you are home it will he good to wed you and richard with the temper everything is prepared what did he say richard asked everything is prepared for our wedding richard scowled it makes me nervous when people know things that we havent told them richard with the temper is upset he is not happy with our preparations no its not that kahlan said everything is wonderful its just that we dont understand how you could know we would be here to he married were purled we didnt know ourselves until just a couple of days ago the bird man pointed to one of the open pole structures shaded under a grass roof that man over there told us really richard said after kahlan translated his scowl growing well i think its about time we go see this man who seems to know more about us than we do as they turned away kahlan caught the bird man scratching a cheek to screen a smile they had to work at making their way through the throng the entire village was out in the open area celebrating musicians and dancers entranced children and adults alike people paused to talk to richard and kahlan as they passed young people especially young girls who were always painfully shy in the past now boldly offered congratulations it was as festive an event as kahlan had ever seen at various open pole structures where food was being prepared people beguiled by the different aromas crowded around to sample the fare a contingent of young women carried bowls and platters and passed around food kahlan saw special women at one of the cook fires preparing a singular offering served only at gatherings no one congregated to sample it this dish was presented only by those women according to strict protocol and by invitation only cara didnt like how close people crowded in around her charges but she did her best to remain tolerant while at the same time watchful and prepared to react she wasnt gripping her agiel but kahlan knew that it was never more than a flick away young women were carrying platters of the more traditional food to and from the pole building where the bird man had pointed them richard holding kahlan by the hand pushed his way through the crowd around the platform they finally made it to the head of the crowd at the platform richard and kahlan froze in shock zedd richard whispered reposing in his splendid violet and black robes the regal effect somewhat diminished by the way his wavy white hair stuck out in its typical disarray was richards grandfather the rawboned old wizard glanced up from the platform as young women offered him platters of food to sample a squat woman in a dark dress and cloak sat crosslegged beside him zedd richard bounded onto the platform zedd smiled and waved oh there you are my boy youre alive i knew you were alive well of course im that was all he got out before richard scooped him up squeezing so hard that zedd lost his wind with a whoosh zedds fists beat on richards shoulders richard he squeaked bags richard youre going to crush me leave go richard set him down only to have kahlan rush to embrace him richard kept saying you were alive but i didnt believe him the woman rose up good to see you richard ann youre alive too she smiled no thanks to your fool grandfather her knowing eyes turned to kahlan and this could be none other than the mother confessor herself richard hugged her before the introductions zedd took a bite of a rice cake while he watched richard brought cara forward she spoke before he had a chance i am lord rahls bodyguard richard looked to her eyes this is cara and she is more than a guard she is our friend cara this is my grandfather zedd and annalina aldurren prelate of the sisters of the light retired prelate ann said pleased to meet a friend of richard richard turned back to zedd i cant believe youre here this is the best surprise we could possibly have but whats this about you knowing we were coming to get married zedd spoke with his mouth full read it read all about it read it where in the jocopo treasure kahlan leaned in theres writing on all that gold zedd waved the rice cake no no not the goldthe jocopo treasure the prophecies all those scrolls they were the jocopo treasure we burned them to keep them out of the hands of the imperial order i read a few before i destroyed them thats where i read the prophecy about you two being married ann figured out the day shes quite knowledgeable about prophecy well it wasnt a difficult prophecy ann said none of them were that was why they were so dangerous if jagang had captured them he nearly did so you two came to destroy the prophecies richard asked yes zedd threw up his hands with a huff oh but a terrible time of it weve had though yes just terrible ann confirmed zedd shook a sticklike finger at richard while youve been larking about in aydindril weve had real trouble trouble what sort of trouble awful trouble ann said yes zedd agreed we were captured and held in the most horrid of condi tions it was awful simply awful we barely got away with our lives who captured you the nangtong kahlan cleared her throat the nangtong why would the nangtong capture you zedd tugged his robes straight they were going to sacrifice us human sacrifices we almost were we were in mortal danger the entire time kahlan squinted skeptically the nangtong are daring to engage in their forbidden rites something about red moons zedd offered they feared the worst and were only trying to protect themselves kahlan cocked her head nonetheless i will have to pay them a visit and see to this you could have been killed richard said piffle a wizard and a sorceress are smarter than a wandering band of nangtong arent we ann ann blinked well well yes as ann says it was more complicated than that zedd turned away from her but it was just awful i can assure you and then we were sold into slavery richards brow lifted slavery indeed to the si doak we were forced to labor as slaves but the si doak didnt like us for some reason something about ann being unsatisfactory and they decided to sell us to cannibals richards jaw dropped cannibals zedd grinned fortunately the cannibals turned out to be the mud people chandalen was the one they approached he knew me of course from when we were together before so he played along and bought us to get us away from our bondage to the si doak and why couldnt you get away from the si doak kahlan asked youre a wizard ann is a sorceress zedd pointed at his bare wrists they put magic wristbands on us we were helpless he looked up quite helpless it was terrible we were helpless slaves under the lash that sounds dreadful richard said then how did you get the bands off zedd threw his arms up we couldnt richard pressed one hand to his forehead and held the other up well theyre off now zedd scratched his chin well now they are the bands are held on with magic iwewere smart enough to know better than to try to use magic that would have bound them on even harder we just had to wait without using magic until they lost their power once we were away from the si doak and were burning the scrolls they came undone and fell off so that was your plan all along of course it was ann nodded trust in the creator to reveal his plan zedd shook a finger up at richard magic is dangerous richard as you will learn someday the hardest part of being a wizard is knowing when not to use magic this was one of those times we had to find the jocopo treasure with all the currents of trouble about i knew our best chance would be to do it without magic he folded his arms and it worked too thus proving my point chandalen stepped forward many soldiers came toward us he pointed off toward the southeast a large scouting party of men came to get these things that zedd burned while he and ann were burning them my men and i fought off the enemy a great battle was fought to the west against the main force of the enemy this army of the order was destroyed i went and spoke with a man called reibisch and he said that one named nathan had sent him to destroy our enemy richard shook his head this is all very confusing zedd flicked a hand ah well youll learn someday richard this wizard business is very complicated someday when you decide to do something with your gift other than sit around with your intended while im out risking my neck then you will see by the way what have you been up to while all the important work has been going on what have i been up to kahlan smiled as she put a hand on his shoulder while richard tried to think how to begin ah well im the lord rahl now and all zedd grunted and flopped down on the wooden platform lord rahl indeed he scooped up a roasted pepper the paperwork must be grueling richard scratched his head while ann sat down zedd can you answer something for me why are the books in the first wizards private enclave stacked up in wobbly columns its a telltale of sorts i remember how theyre stacked so that if anyone has touched them ill know it zedds hazel eyes opened wide what bags richard what were you doing in there thats a dangerous place and how did you get in there zedd pointed at richards chest that amulet its from in there how did you get in there bags richard wheres the sword of truth i entrusted the sword to you you werent foolish enough to give it to someone uh well i couldnt travel in the sliph with it so i had to leave it in the first wizards enclave so no one could get at it sliph whats a sliph richard youre the seeker you have to have your swordits your weapon you cant just leave it lying about places when you gave it to me you told me that the sword was just a tool and that it is the seeker that is the true weapon so i did but i didnt think you were listening zedd peered up at him you didnt mess with the books i hope you dont know enough to be allowed to read any of them just one tagenricht ost fuer mosst verlaschendreck nich greschlechten thats high dharan zedd dismissed the matter with a wave no one knows high dharan anymore at least you cant get into trouble with a book you cant read zedd shook his finger and you still havent said how you got in there it wasnt all that hard to get in the mirth melted from richards face it was a lot easier than it was getting into the temple of the winds both zedd and ann shot to their feet the temple of the winds they said as one temple of the winds inquisition and trialthats what the book was ive kind of had to learn high dharan richard put his arm around kahlans shoulders jagang sent sister amelia there she entered through something called betrayers hall she betrayed the keeper to get in she came back with magic and started a plague it killed thousands of people she started it among childrenat jagangs instruction we watched helpless while children and friends died there was no other way i had to go there to stop the plague or it would have been a firestorm that would have consumed nearly everyone one of the women who prepared the special meat approached carrying a tray of neatly arranged dried strips she offered the tray to chandalen first he was an elder now chandalen tore off a bite as he looked up at richard richard knew what the meat was he took a big piece kahlan had always refused to eat this dish in the past this time when offered she took a piece chandalen watched her pull off a bite zedd took a piece and then the tray was offered to ann kahlan was going to say something but zedd shot her a silencing glance they ate in silence a moment before richard asked who is it the commander of the men of the order who came here and attacked us to get the jocopo treasure that zedd burned anns eyes came up you mean we fight a battle for our existence richard said if we lose we all die and the man who started a plague among children will rule those still alive all magic will be eliminated those left will be his slaves the mud people do this so that they might know the hearts of their enemy and save their families richard glared at her eat it so that you too may know the enemy better it was not richard but lord rahl who had spoken ann watched his eyes for a moment and then started chewing they all ate the strip of their enemys flesh to know him better sister amelia ann finally whispered if she has been to the temple of the winds she will be beyond dangerous shes dead kahlan said haunted by the memory of it all when anns questioning eyes looked at her kahlan added yes i am sure i put a sword through her heart she had a dacra in nathans leg she was going to kill him nathan ann said we must soon be off to find him where was this where is he zedd scowled over at ann we it was in tanimura in the old world just after richard came back from the temple of the winds nathan helped me save richards life by telling me the three chimes zedd and anns eyes widened they looked as if they had stopped breathing they finally glanced to each other the three chimes ann said in a cautious voice you mean he just mentioned the three chimes he didnt actually tell them to you he didnt speak them to you kahlan nodded reechan zedd and ann threw their hands up no they yelled together didnt nathan tell you that no one without the gift may speak the three chimes aloud anns face had gone red didnt that crazy old man tell you that kahlan scowled back nathan is not a crazy old man he helped me save richards life without the three chimes richard would have died when he came back from the temple of the winds i owe nathan a great debt we all do i owe him a collar around his neck ann muttered before he causes who knows what catastrophe zedd we must find him and soon she lowered her voice to a private whisper and we must do something about this business zedds eyes turned to kahlan you said them silently when you did this you said the three chimes silently you didnt actually say them aloud tell me that you didnt say them aloud i had to cara remembered them and said them then i said them aloud a couple of times zedd winced more than once zedd ann murmured what are we going to do about this why richard asked whats the problem nothing you need be concerned about just dont say them aloud again any of you zedd ann whispered under her breath if she has freed zedd lifted a hand out to the side touching her silencing her what was i supposed to do kahlan asked defensively richard had absorbed the magic from the book sister amelia brought back from the winds he had the plague he was a breath or two away from death he would have died within minutes at the most would you have had me let him die instead of course not dear one you did the right thing zedd lifted an eyebrow to ann as he leaned close we will discuss this later ann folded her hands of course you did the only thing you could we are all grateful kahlan you did well zedd was looking more serious by the moment bags richard the temple of the winds is in the underworld how did you get in richard looked out over the celebration we need to tell you both the story some of it anyway but this is the day kahlan and i are to be married richard smiled kahlan thought it looked forced its a hard story to tell id rather tell you about it on another day i cant just now zedd stroked a thumb down his smooth jaw of course richard i understand and you are quite right another day but the temple of the winds he lifted a finger unable to resist asking a question richard what did you have to leave at the temple of the winds in order to return richard shared a long look with his grandfather knowledge and what did you take away with you understanding zedd encircled a protective arm around both richard and kahlan good for you richard good for you good for both of you you two have earned this day lets put this other business aside for now and let us celebrate the joy of your marriage chapter they enjoyed the company of friends and loved ones the whole day talking and laughing celebrating together with the mud people kahlan did her best to try to ignore the way her lowcut blue wedding dress displayed her breasts it was hard with the way people kept coming up to her and telling her that she had fine breasts richard wanted to know what they were saying all the time she thought it best to lie she told him that they were saying that her dress was beautiful as the sun turned the sky golden it was at last time kahlan gripped richards hand as if it were the only thing holding her on the ground richard had trouble keeping his eyes off her in her blue wedding dress every time he looked at her a helpless smile took him kahlans heart swelled with joy seeing how much he liked the dress weselan had made for her she had for so long dreamed of wearing it dreamed of this moment she had hoped so often with all her heart that this day would come she had feared so often that it never would so many times something had happened delaying this moment now it was happening richard mimicked the mud peoples words not realizing that he was saying how fine he thought her breasts looked he thought he was telling her how beautiful her dress looked everyone grinned with satisfaction when he spoke the words in their language happy that he agreed with them kahlan could feel her face turning red richard looked magnificent in his black and gold war wizards uniform every time kahlan looked at him a smile took her she was marrying richard at last her knees trembled under the blue dress cara standing behind gave her a reassuring touch weselan at kahlans side beamed with pride savidlin stood to the far side of richard beaming just as much zedd and ann stood behind zedd was eating something kahlan silently prayed to the good spirits that this time nothing would go wrong and that it would at last happen she couldnt help worrying that it would be taken from her yet again the bird man straightened before them clasping his hands behind him the entire mud people village spread out before the wedding party to hear the vows when all had fallen silent the bird man began and kahlans fear began to melt away to be replaced with joyous anticipation as the bird man spoke chandalen at his side said the words in the language richard and some of the others could understand these two people have not been born mud people hut they have proven themselves to he one of us in their strength and in their hearts they have bound themselves to us and us to them they have been our friends and our protectors that they would wish lo be wedded as mud people proves their hearts as members of our people these two have chosen not only to be wedded before those of this world but before the next and in so doing have called the spirits of our ancestors to be with us on this day to smile on this joining we welcome our ancestors into our hearts to share our joy richards hand tightened around hers and she realized that he was sharing her thoughts it was real at last and it was as they both had always dreamedexcept it was better than she could ever have imagined both of you are mud people and are bound not only by your words before your people but by your own hearts these are simple words but in simple things there is great power he met richards eyes richard will you have this woman as your wife and will you love and honor her in all ways for all time i will he said in a clear voice that rang out over the gathering the bird man looked into kahlans eyes and she had the most profound sense that he was speaking not only as a representative of his people but for the spirits too she could almost hear their voices echoing in his kahlan will you have this man as your husband and will you love and honor him in all ways for all time i will she said a clear chime matching richards then before your people and before the spirits you are now wedded for all time all the gathered people were dead silent until richard took her in his arms and kissed her and then they went wild kahlan hardly heard them it seemed a dream a dream she had dreamed so often that it had finally come to life to be in richards arms to have him to be his wife and he her husband for all time and then everyone was bugging them zedd and ann the bird man and the elders weselan and the other wives cara with tears in her eyes hugged kahlan thank you both for wearing an agiel at your wedding hally raina and denna are all watching because of that thank you for honoring the sacrifice of mordsith with a thumb kahlan wiped the tear from caras cheek thank you for braving the magic of the sliph to be with us my sister everyone in the village crowded in to greet the new couple kahlan thought they might be crushed people brought food and flowers and sincere simple offerings of every sort the celebration resumed around the wedding platform kahlan tried to talk to everyone and to thank everyone as did richard until as richard was asking some of chandalens hunters about the battle that they had witnessed his golden cloak billowed out there was no wind richard straightened his raptor gaze swept out over the heads of the people gathered before the wedding platform he instinctively reached for his sword it wasnt there the crowd in the back fell silent zedd and ann both stepped up beside richard and kahlan cara had her agiel in her fist as she pushed between them to get in front richard gently pushed her behind the entire village fell silent the people parting for two approaching figures some people grabbed their children and moved farther back as worried whispers rippled through the crowd as the two solitary figures one tall and one short came closer kahlan saw that it was shota and her companion samuel the witch woman looking as stunning as ever strode up onto the platform her ageless almond eyes staying on kahlan the whole time shota took up kahlans hand she kissed kahlans cheek i have come to congratulate you mother confessor on your accomplishment and on your marriage throwing caution to the winds kahlan hugged the witch woman thank you for coming shota shota smiled staring into richards eyes as she ran a lacquered nail along his jaw hard fought richard hard fought and well earned kahlan turned to the silent gathering she knew that the mud people feared the witch woman so much that they wouldnt even speak her name kahlan could understand she had felt nearly the same way herself shota has come to offer her best wishes to us on our wedding day she has helped us in our struggle she is a friend and i hope you will welcome her to this celebration for she deserves to be here and i wish her lo be here kahlan turned to shota i told them that smiling shota held up a hand i know what you told them mother confessor the bird man stepped forward welcome to our home shota thank you bird man you have my word that we will bring no harm this day shota glanced to zedd a truce for a day zedd smiled a sly smile a truce samuels long arm reached up grabbing for the bird mans carved bone whistle he wore around his neck mine gimme shota thunked him on the head samuel behave yourself the bird man smiled he pulled the thong and whistle over his head and held it out to samuel a gift for a friend to the mud people samuel gently took the whistle a grin split his face showing his wickedly sharp teeth thank you bird man shota said samuel blew the silent whistle he seemed able to hear the sound and was pleased by it people began chuckling and talking again kahlan was relieved that vultures didnt appear in response to the silent whistle fortunately samuel didnt know how to call specific birds samuel grinned at his gift and hung it around his neck he took up shotas hand again shotas arresting gaze took in richard and kahlan in that moment there was no one else there the three of them were as good as alone in that gaze do not think either of you that just because i congratulate you i will forget my promise to you kahlan swallowed shota shotas eyes were both beautiful and frightening as she held up a silencing finger you both have earned this joyous wedding i am happy for you both i will honor your vows and protect you in any way i can out of respect for all you have done for me as long as you remember what i have warned you about i will not allow a male child of this union to live do not doubt my word in this richards gaze was heating shota ill not be threatened again the finger rose silencing richard this time i do not make a threat i deliver you a promise i do not do it out of animosity for either of you but out of concern for everyone else in the world there is a long struggle ahead of us all i will not allow any chance at victory to be clouded by what you two would bring upon the world jagang is worry enough for some reason kahlans voice wouldnt work richard didnt seem to have words either kahlan believed shota she wasnt doing this out of malice shota lifted kahlans hand and placed something in it this is my gift to you both i do this out of love for you both and for everyone else she smiled a strange smile an odd thing for a witch woman to say no shota kahlan said i dont know that i believe what you tell us about a son but i know that it is not said in hate good wear the gift always and all will be well mark my words wellnever take this off when you are together and you will always be happy disregard my request and suffer the consequences of my vow she looked into richards eyes better you battle the keeper himself than me kahlan opened her hand and saw a delicate necklace a small dark stone hung from the gold chain why what is this shota put a finger under kahlans chin as she stared into her eyes as long as you wear it you will bear no children richards voice strangely seemed gentle but what if we again shotas raised finger silenced him you love each other have joy in that love and in each other you have struggled hard to be together celebrate your union and your love you have each other now as you always wanted dont throw it away richard and kahlan both nodded somehow kahlan didnt feel any anger she felt nothing other than relief that shota wasnt going to do anything to harm their marriage it had a dreamlike quality like a formal settlement over an obscure remote tract of ground claimed by two lands like agreements in the council chambers over which she had so often presided there seemed no emotion to it a simple settlement shota turned to go shota richard said she turned back wont you stay youve come a long way yes kahlan said we really would like it if you stayed shota smiled a witch woman smile as she watched kahlan fasten the chain around her neck that you would ask is pleasure enough but it is a long journey and we must be on our way kahlan ran down the steps and scooped up a pile of tava bread she wrapped it in a square of cloth from the table she met shota at the bottom of the steps take this for your journey as our thanks for coming and for the gift shota kissed kahlans cheek and then took the bundle samuel didnt try to grab it he seemed content richard was suddenly there beside kahlan shota smiled a small smile and kissed his cheek too she had a strange wistful look thank you both of you and then she was gone simply gone zedd and ann were still up on the platform along with cara and the rest of the people zedd turned to richard and kahlan what happened to shota we make a truce and then she just leaves without a word kahlans brow tightened she spoke to us zedd glanced about when she was gone before she had a chance to say anything i had intended to speak with her too ann said kahlan looked up at richard he looked back at zedd she said some nice things to us maybe she just didnt want you to hear her saying nice things zedd grunted a laugh no doubt kahlan touched the dark stone on the necklace she put an arm around richards waist and pulled him close what do you think she whispered richard stared out in the direction shota had gone for now shes right were together thats what we wanted i think that for now we should be happy that our dream has at last come true and we can be together im so tired of trouble and there is still jagang to worry about id just like to be with you for now and love you kahlan put her head against him i think youre right for now lets not complicate matters we can worry about this another time he grinned at her right kahlan forgot all about shota and the future and grinned back thinking about the now right the celebration went on until well after nightfall kahlan knew it would likely go on all night she whispered to richard that she would be happy not to have to remain for the whole thing richard kissed her cheek and then asked the bird man if they could be excused they wanted to go to the spirit house the spirit house had special meaning to both of them the bird man smiled it has been a long day sleep well richard and kahlan said their thanks to everyone and then in the quiet of the spirit house in the soft glow of the low fire that always burned there they were at long last alone as they stared into each others eyes words were too small berdine stood tall and straight as she watched the double doors burst open like a gout of flame they stormed into the confessors palacea dozen mordsith in red leather soldiers scrambled across the slick marble falling back out of the way while at the same time trying not to look hurried they quickly established new guard positions at a safe distance the twelve women paid them no attention the existence of dharan soldiers hardly registered on the mind of a mordsithunless they gave her trouble the group came to a halt silence once again settled in the entrance hall berdine how good to see you berdine let a small smile touch her lips welcome rikka but what are you doing here lord rahl left you at the peoples palace awaiting his return rikkas eyes swept the area before her steady gaze settled on berdine we heard that he is here now and we decided that we should be closer so that we could protect him we left the others at the palace should he return unexpectedly we will return with him when he goes home berdine shrugged he sort of considers this home now whatever he wishes we are here now where is he so that we may announce ourselves and protect him he has gone to be married some distance to the south rikkas brows drew together why are you not with him he ordered me to stay here and see to things in his absence cara is with him cara good cara will not let anything happen to him rikka considered a moment her dark frown returning lord rahl is getting married berdine nodded he is in love the other women glanced at one another as rikka put her fists on her hips in love a lord rahl in love somehow i cant picture it she huffed hes up to something well never mind we will figure it out what of the others hally was killed awhile back in battle protecting lord rahl a noble death what of raina berdine swallowed and forced her voice to stay level raina died a short time ago killed by the enemy rikka searched berdines eyes im sorry berdine berdine nodded lord rahl wept for her as he did for hally silence echoed around the entryway as all the other mordsith stared at berdine in disbelief this man is going to be trouble rikka muttered berdine smiled i think he would say a similar thing of you kahlan growled at the insistent knock it appeared that ignoring it would not make it go away she kissed richard and wrapped a blanket around herself dont move lord rahl ill get rid of them barefoot she crossed the dim windowless room she squinted at the sudden light when she opened the door zedd what is it he was eating a piece of tava bread he had a platter of it in his other hand he offered her the tray i thought you might be hungry yes thank you very thoughtful he took a bite of tava bread as his gaze roamed over her hair he pointed at it with the rolledup tava bread you will never get those tangles out dear one thank you for your fashion advice she started to close the door he put his hand against it the elders are becoming concerned they would like to know when they can have their spirit house back tell them that when im done with it ill let them know cara scowling her best mordsith scowl stepped lip behind him i will see that he does not bother you again mother confessor thank you cara kahlan shut the door in his smiling face she hurried across the floor back to richard she set the platter aside laid down and enfolded richard in her blanket a pesky inlaw she explained i heard tava bread and tangled hair now where were we he kissed her and she remembered he was showing her some magic
