barnaby in exile barnaby sits in his cage waiting for sally to come into the lab she will give him the puzzle the same one he worked on yesterday but today he will not disappoint her he has been thinking about the puzzle all night thinking is fun today he will do it right and she will laugh and tell him how smart he is he will lay on his back and she will tickle his stomach and say oh what a bright young fellow you are barnaby then barnaby will make a funny face and turn a somersault barnaby is me it gets lonely after sally leaves bud comes when it is black and cleans my cage but he never talks sometimes he forgets and leaves the light on then i try to talk to roger and his family but they are just rabbits and cannot make the signs i dont think they are very smart anyway every night when bud comes in i sit up and smile at him i always make the sign for hello but he doesnt answer sometimes i think bud isnt any smarter than roger he just pats me on the head sometimes he leaves the pictures on after he leaves my favorite pictures are fred and barney everything is so bright and fast many times i ask sally to bring dino to the lab so that i can play with him but she never does i like barney because he is not as big or loud as fred and i am not big or loud either also my name is barnaby and that is like barney sometimes when it is black and i am all alone i imagine that i am barney and that i dont sleep in a cage at all this day it was white out and sally even had white on her when she came to the lab but it all turned to water today we had a new toy it looks like the thing on doctors desk with lots of little things that look like flat grapes sally told me that she would show me something and then i should touch the grape that had the same picture on it she showed me a shoe and a ball and an egg and a star and a square i did the egg and the ball wrong but tomorrow i will do them right i think more every day like sally says i am a very bright young fellow we have spent many days with the new toy and now i can speak to sally with it just by touching the right grapes she will come into the lab and say how are you this morning barnaby and i will touch the grapes that say barnaby is fine or barnaby is hungry what i really want to say is barnaby is lonely but there is no grape for lonely today i touch the grapes that say barnaby wants out out of your cage she asks out there i sign out in the white you would not like it i do not like the black when i am alone i sign i will like the white it is very cold she says and you are not used to it the white is very pretty i say barnaby wants out the last time i let you out you hurt roger she reminds me i just wanted to touch him i say you do not know your own strength she says roger is just a rabbit and you hurt him i will be gentle this time i say i thought you didnt like roger she says i dont like roger i say i like touching she reaches into the cage and tickles my belly and scratches my back and i feel better but then she stops it is time for your lesson she says if i do it right can you bring me something to touch i ask what kind of thing she says i think for a moment another barnaby i say she looks sad and doesnt answer one day sally brings me a book filled with pictures i smell it and taste it finally i figure out that she wants me to look at it there are all kinds of animals in it i see one that looks like roger but it is brown and roger is white and there is a kitten like i see through the window and a dog like doctor sometimes brings to the lab but there is no dino then i see a picture of a boy his hair is shorter than sallys and not as gray as doctors or as yellow as buds but he is smiling and i know he must have many things to touch when sally comes back the next morning i have lots of questions about the pictures but before i can ask her she asks me what is this she says holding up a picture roger i say no she says roger is a name what is this animal called i try to remember rabbit i say at last very good barnaby she says and what is this kitten i say we got through the whole book where is barnaby i ask barnaby is an ape she says there is no picture of an ape in the book i wonder if there are any other barnabys in the world and if they are lonely too later i ask do i have a father and a mother of course you do says sally everything has a father and a mother where are they i ask your father is dead says sally your mother is in a zoo far away from here barnaby wants to see his mother i say im afraid not barnaby why she wouldnt know you she has forgotten you just as you have forgotten her if i could see her i would say im barnaby and then she would know me sally shakes her head she wouldnt understand you are very special she is not she cant sign and she cant use a computer does she have any other barnabys i ask i dont know says sally i suppose so how does she speak to them she doesnt i think about this for a long time finally i say but she touches them yes she touches them says sally they must be very happy i say today i will find out more about being barnaby good morning says sally when she comes into the lab how are you today barnaby what is a zoo i ask a zoo is a place where animals live says sally can i see a zoo through the window no it is very far away i think about my next question for a long time are barnabys animals yes are sallys animals in a way yes does sallys mother live in a zoo sally laughs no she says does she live in a cage no says sally i think for awhile sallys mother is dead i say no she is alive i get very upset because i do not know how to ask why sallys mother is different from barnabys mother and the harder i try the worse i do it and sally cannot understand me finally i start hitting the floor with my fist roger and his family all jump and doctor opens the door sally gives me a little toy that squeeks when i hit it and very soon i forget to be mad and start playing with the toy sally says something to doctor and he smiles and leaves do you want to ask anything else before we begin our lesson asks sally why i ask why what why is barnaby an ape and sally a man because that is the way god made us she says i start getting very excited because i think i am very close to learning more about barnabys who is god i ask she tries to answer but i do not understand again when it gets black and i am all alone except for roger and his family and bud has already cleaned my cage i sit and think about god thinking can be very interesting if he made sally and he made me why didnt he make me as smart as sally why can she talk and do things with her hands that i cant do it is very confusing i decide that i must meet god and ask him why he does these things and why he forgot that even barnabys like to be touched as soon as sally comes into the lab i ask her where does god live in heaven is heaven far away yes farther than a zoo i ask much farther does god ever come to the lab she laughs no why i have many questions to ask him perhaps i can answer some of them she says why am i alone because you are very special says sally if i was not special would i be with other barnabys yes i have never hurt god i say why has god made me special the next morning i ask her to tell me about the other barnabys barnaby is just a name explains sally there are other apes but i dont know if any of them are named barnaby what is a name a name is what makes you different from everything else if my name was fred or dino could i be like everyone else i ask no she says you are special you are barnaby the bonobo you are very famous what is famous many people know who you are what are people i ask men and women are there more than you and doctor and bud yes then it is time for my lessons but i do them very badly because i am still thinking about a world that has more people in it than sally and doctor and bud i am so busy wondering who lets them out of their cages when the dark goes away that i forget all about god and dont think about him any more for many days i hear sally talking to doctor but i do not understand what they are saying doctor keeps repeating that we dont have any more fun and sally keeps saying that barnaby is special and then they both say a lot of things i cant understand when they are through and doctor leaves i ask sally why we cant have fun any more fun she repeats what do you mean doctor says there will be no more fun she stares at me for a long time you understood what he said why cant we have any fun i repeat fund she says the word was fund it means something different then barnaby and sally can still have fun i ask of course we can i lay on my back and sign to her tickle me she reaches into the cage and tickles me but i see water in her eyes human people make water in their eyes when they are unhappy i pretend to bite her hand and then race around my cage like i did when i was a baby but this time it doesnt make her laugh i hear voices coming from behind the door it is sally and doctor again well we cant put him in a zoo says doctor if he starts signing to the spectators theyd have a million people demanding his freedom by the end of the month and then what would happen what would become of him can you picture the poor bastard in a circus we cant destroy him just because hes too bright says sally who will take him you says doctor hes only eight now what happens when he becomes sexually mature when he is a surly adult male its not that far away he could rip you apart in seconds he wont not barnaby will your landlord let you keep him are you willing to sacrifice the next twenty years of your life caring for him we might get renewed funding as early as this fall says sally be realistic says doctor itll be years if ever this program is being duplicated at half a dozen labs around the country and some of them are much farther along barnabys not the only ape that has learned to use articles and adjectives you know theres a yearold gorilla and three other bonobo chimps that are well into their teens theres no reason to believe that anyone will restore our funding but hes different says sally he asks abstract questions i know i know once he asked you who god was but i studied the tape and you mentioned god first if you mention michael jordan and he asks who that is it doesnt mean that hes developed an abiding interest in basketball can i at least talk to the committee show them videotapes of him they know what a chimpanzee looks like says doctor but they dont know what one thinks like says sally perhaps this will help to convince them its not a matter of convincing them says doctor the funds have dried up every program is hurting these days please all right says doctor ill set up a meeting but it wont do any good i hear it all but i do not understand any of it before it got white today i dreamed of a place filled with barnabys and i am sitting in a corner my eyes shut trying to remember it before it all drifts away we keep doing the lessons each day but i can tell that sally is unhappy and i wonder what i have done to upset her this morning sally opens my cage door and just hugs me for a long time i have to talk to you barnaby she says and i see her eyes are making water again i touch the grapes that say barnaby likes to talk this is important she says tomorrow you will leave the lab will i go outside i ask you will go very far away to a zoo farther suddenly i remember god will i go to heaven i ask she smiles even as her eyes make more water not quite that far she says you are going to a place where there are no labs and no cages you will be free barnaby are there other barnabys there yes she says there are other barnabys there doctor was wrong i say there will be more fun for sally and barnaby i cannot go with you she says why i have to stay here this is my home if you are good maybe god will let you out of your cage i say she makes a funny sound and hugs me again they put me in a smaller cage one with no light in it for two days i smell bad things most of my water spills and there are loud noises that hurt my ears sometimes people talk and once a man who is not bud or doctor gives me food and more water he does it through a little hole in the top of the cage i touch his hand to show him that i am not angry he screams and pulls his hand away i keep signing barnaby is lonely but it is dark and there is no one to see i do not like my new world on the third morning they move my crate and then they move it again finally they lift it up and carry it and when they set it down i can smell many things i have never smelled before they open the door and i step out onto the grass the sun is very bright and i squint and look at people who are not sally or doctor or bud youre home boy says one of them i look around the world is a much bigger place than the lab and i am frightened go on fella says another sniff around get used to the place i sniff around i do not get used to the place i spend many days in the world i get to know all the trees and bushes and the big fence around it they feed me fruits and leaves and bark i am not used to them and for a while i am sick but then i get better i hear many noises from beyond the world screams and growls and shrieks i smell many strange animals but i do not hear or smell any barnabys then one day the people put me back in my crate and i am alone for a long time and then they open the crate and i am no longer in the world but in a place with so many trees that i almost cannot see the sky okay fella says a person off into the forest with you now he makes a motion with his hands but it is a sign i do not recognize i sign back barnaby is afraid the person pets me on the head it is the first time anyone has touched me since i left the lab have a good life he says and make lots of little barnabys then he climbs into his cage and it rolls away from me i try to follow it but it is much too fast and soon i can no longer see it i look back at the forest and hear strange sounds and a breeze brings me the sweet smell of fruit there is no one around to see me but i sign barnaby is free anyway barnaby is free barnaby is lonely barnaby is frightened i learn to find water and to climb trees i see little barnabys with tails that chatter at me but they cannot sign and i see big kittens with spots and they make terrible noises and i hide from them i wish i could hide in my cage where i was always safe today when the black goes away i wake up and go to the water and i find another barnaby hello i sign i am a barnaby too the other barnaby growls at me do you live in a lab i ask where is your cage the other barnaby runs at me and starts biting me i shriek and roll on the ground what have i done i ask the other barnaby runs at me again and i screech and climb to the top of a tree he sits at the bottom and stares at me all day until the black returns it gets very cold and then wet and i shiver all night and wish sally was here in the morning the barnaby is gone and i climb down to the ground i smell where he has been and i follow his scent because i do not know what else to do finally i come to a place with more barnabys than i ever imagined there could be then i remember that sally taught me counting and i count there are twentythree of them one of them sees me and screams and before i can make any signs all of them charge at me and i run away they chase me for a long time but finally they stop and i am alone again i am alone for many days i do not go back to the barnabys because they would hurt me if they could i do not know what i have done to make them mad so i do not know how to stop doing it i have learned to smell the big kittens when they are still far away and to climb the trees so they cannot catch me and i have learned to hide from the dogs that laugh like sally does when i make somersaults but i am so lonely and i miss talking and i am already forgetting some of the signs sally taught me last night i dreamed about fred and wilma and barney and dino and when i woke up my own eyes were making water i hear sounds in the morning not sounds like the big kittens or the dogs make but strange clumsy sounds i go to see what is making them in a little clearing i see four people two men and two women and they have brought little brown cages the cages are not as nice as my old cage because you cannot see in or out of them one of the men has made a fire and they are sitting on chairs around it i want to approach them but i have learned my lesson with the barnabys and so i wait until one of the men sees me when he doesnt yell or chase me i sign to him i am barnaby what has it got in its hands asks one of the women nothing says a man barnaby wants to be friends i sign a woman puts something up in front of her face and suddenly there is a big pop it is so bright that i cant see i rub my eyes and walk forward dont let him get too close says the other man no telling what kind of diseases hes carrying will you play with barnaby i ask the first man picks up a rock and throws it at me shoo he yells go away he throws another rock and i run back into the forest when it is black out and they sit around the fire i sneak as close as i can get and lay down and listen to the sounds of their voices and pretend i am back in the lab in the morning they throw rocks at me until i go away and then one day after they throw the rocks at me and i go for water i come back and find that they are gone they were not very good friends but they were the only ones i had what will i do now finally after many days i find a single barnaby and it is a female she has terrible scars on her from other barnabys and when she sees me she bares her teeth and growls i sit still and hope that she will not go away after a long time she comes closer to me i am afraid to move because i do not want to frighten her or make her mad i ignore her and stare off into the trees finally she reaches out and picks an insect off my shoulder and puts it into her mouth and soon she is sitting beside me eating the flowers and leaves that have fallen to the ground finally when i am sure she will not run away i sign to her i am barnaby she grabs at my hands as if i was playing with a fruit or an insect then shows her teeth when she sees that i am not holding anything she is really not any smarter than roger but at least she does not run away from me i will call her sally sally is afraid of the other barnabys so we live at the edge of the forest where they hardly ever come she touches me and that is very nice but i find that i miss talking and thinking even more every day i try to teach her to sign but she cannot learn we have three baby barnabys one after each rainy season but they are no smarter than sally and besides i have forgotten most of the signs more and more people come to the forest in their brown cages my family is afraid of them but i love talking and listening and thinking more than anything i always visit their camps at night and listen to their voices in the darkness and try to understand the words i pretend i am back in the lab though it is harder and harder to remember what the lab is like each time there are new people i show myself and say i am barnaby but none of them ever answers when one finally does i will know that he is god there were many things i wanted to ask him once but i cannot remember most of them i will tell him to be nice to sally and the other two people at the lab i forget their names because what has happened to me is not their fault i will not ask him why he hated me so much that he made me special or why people and barnabys always chase me away i will just say please talk to barnaby and then i will ask if we can do a lesson once when i was a very bright fellow there were many things i wanted to discuss with him but now that i have left the world that will be enough
