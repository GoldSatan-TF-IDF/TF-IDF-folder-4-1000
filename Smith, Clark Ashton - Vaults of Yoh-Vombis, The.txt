the vaults of yohvombis clark ashton smith if the doctors are correct in their prognostication i have only a few martian hours of life remaining to me in those hours i shall endeavor to relate as a warning to others who might follow in our footsteps the singular and frightful happenings that terminated our research among the ruins of yohvombis if my story will only serve to prevent future explorations the telling will not have been in vain there were eight of us professional archaeologists with more or less terrene and interplanetary experience who set forth with native guides from ignarh the commercial metropolis of mars to inspect that ancient aeondeserted city allan octave our official leader held his primacy by knowing more about martian archaeology than any other terrestrial on the planet and others of the party such as william harper and jonas halgren had been associated with him in many of his previous researches i rodney severn was more of a newcomer having spent but a few months on mars and the greater part of my own ultraterrene delvings had been confined to venus the nude spongychested aihais had spoken deterringly of vast deserts filled with everswirling sandstorms through which we must pass to reach yohvombis and in spite of our munificent offers of payment it had been difficult to secure guides for the journey therefore we were surprised as well as pleased when we came to the ruins after seven hours of plodding across the flat treeless orangeyellow desolation to the southwest of ignarh we beheld our destination for the first time in the setting of the small remote sun for a little we thought that the domeless threeangled towers and brokendown monoliths were those of some unlegended city other than the one we sought but the disposition of the ruins which lay in a sort of arc for almost the entire extent of a low gneissic leaguelong elevation of bare eroded stone together with the type of architecture soon convinced us that we had found our goal no other ancient city on mars had been laid out in that manner and the strange manyterraced buttresses like the stairways of forgotten anakim were peculiar to the prehistoric race that built yohvombis i have seen the hoary skyconfronting walls of machu picchu amid the desolate andes and the frozen giantbuilded battlements of uogam on the glacial tundras of the nightward hemisphere of venus but these were as things of yesteryear compared to the walls upon which we gazed the whole region was far from the lifegiving canals beyond whose environs even the more noxious flora and fauna are seldom found and we had seen no living thing since our departure from ignarh but here in this place of petrified sterility of eternal bareness and solitude it seemed that life could never have been i think we all received the same impression as we stood staring in silence while the pale samieslike sunset fell on the dark and megalithic ruins i remember gasping a little in an air that seemed to have been touched by the irrespirable chill of death and i heard the same sharp laborious intake of breath from others of our party that place is deader than an egyptian morgue observed harper certainly it is far more ancient octave assented according to the most reliable legends the yorhis who built yohvombis were wiped out by the present ruling race at least forty thousand years ago theres a story isnt there said harper that the last remnant of the yorhis was destroyed by some unknown agency something too horrible and outr–π to be mentioned even in a myth of course ive heard that legend agreed octave maybe well find evidence among the ruins to prove or disprove it the yorhis may have been cleaned out by some terrible epidemic such as the yashta pestilence which was a kind of green mould that ate all the bones of the body together with the teeth and nails but we neednt be afraid of getting it if there are any mummies in yohvombis the bacteria will all be as dead as their victims after so many cycles of planetary desiccation the sun had gone down with uncanny swiftness as if it had disappeared through some sort of prestidigitation rather than the normal process of setting we felt the instant chill of the bluegreen twilight and the ether above us was like a huge transparent dome of sunless ice shot with a million bleak sparklings that were the stars we donned the coats and helmets of martian fur which must always be worn at night and going on to westward of the walls we established our camp in their lee so that we might be sheltered a little from the jaar that cruel desert wind that always blows from the east before dawn then lighting the alcohol lamps that had been brought along for cooking purposes we huddled around them while the evening meal was prepared and eaten afterwards for comfort rather than because of weariness we retired early to our sleepingbags and the two aihais our guides wrapped themselves in the cerementlike folds of bassacloth which are all the protection their leathery skins appear to require even in subzero temperatures even in my thick doublelined bag i still felt the rigor of the night air and i am sure it was this rather than anything else which kept me awake for a long while and rendered my eventual slumber somewhat restless and broken at any rate i was not troubled by even the least presentiment of alarm or danger and i should have laughed at the idea that anything of peril could lurk in yohvombis amid whose undreamable and stupefying antiquities the very phantoms of its dead must long since have faded into nothingness i must have drowsed again and again with starts of semiwakefulness at last in one of these i knew vaguely that the small twin moons had risen and were making huge and farflung shadows with the domeless towers shadows that almost touched the glimmering shrouded forms of my companions the whole scene was locked in a petrific stillness and none of the sleepers stirred then as my lids were about to close i received an impression of movement in the frozen gloom and it seemed to me that a portion of the foremost shadow had detached itself and was crawling toward octave who lay nearer to the ruins than we others even through my heavy lethargy i was disturbed by a warning of something unnatural and perhaps ominous i started to sit up and even as i moved the shadowy object whatever it was drew back and became merged once more in the greater shadow its vanishment startled me into full wakefulness and yet i could not be sure that i had actually seen the thing in that brief final glimpse it had seemed like a roughly circular piece of cloth or leather dark and crumpled and twelve or fourteen inches in diameter that ran along the ground with the doubling movement of an inchworm causing it to fold and unfold in a startling manner as it went i did not go to sleep again for nearly an hour and if it had not been for the extreme cold i should doubtless have gotten up to investigate and make sure whether i had really beheld an object of such bizarre nature or had merely dreamt it but more and more i began to convince myself that the thing was too unlikely and fantastical to have been anything but the figment of a dream and at last i nodded off into light slumber the chill demoniac sighing of the jaar across the jagged walls awoke me and i saw that the faint moonlight had received the hueless accession of early dawn we all arose and prepared our breakfast with fingers that grew numb in spite of the spiritlamps my queer visual experience during the night had taken on more than ever a phantasmagoric unreality and i gave it no more than a passing thought and did not speak of it to the others we were all eager to begin our explorations and shortly after sunrise we started on a preliminary tour of examination strangely as it seemed the two martians refused to accompany us stolid and taciturn they gave no explicit reason but evidently nothing would induce them to enter yohvombis whether or not they were afraid of the ruins we were unable to determine their enigmatic faces with the small oblique eyes and huge flaring nostrils betrayed neither fear nor any other emotion intelligible to man in reply to our questions they merely said that no aihai had set foot among the ruins for ages apparently there was some mysterious taboo in connection with the place for equipment in that preliminary tour we took along only our electric torches and a crowbar our other tools and some cartridges of high explosives we left at our camp to be used later if necessary after we had surveyed the ground one or two of us owned automatics but these were also left behind for it seemed absurd to imagine that any form of life would be encountered among the ruins octave was visibly excited as we began our inspection and maintained a running fire of exclamatory comment the rest of us were subdued and silent it was impossible to shake off the somber awe and wonder that fell upon us from those megalithic stones we went on for some distance among the triangular terraced buildings following the zigzag streets that conformed to this peculiar architecture most of the towers were more or less dilapidated and everywhere we saw the deep erosion wrought by cycles of blowing wind and sand which in many cases had worn into roundness the sharp angles of the mighty walls we entered some of the towers but found utter emptiness within whatever they had contained in the way of furnishings must long ago have crumbled into dust and the dust had been blown away by the searching desert gales at length we came to the wall of a vast terrace hewn from the plateau itself on this terrace the central buildings were grouped like a sort of acropolis a flight of timeeaten steps designed for longer limbs than those of men or even the gangling modern martians afforded access to the hewn summit pausing we decided to defer our investigation of the higher buildings which being more exposed than the others were doubly ruinous and dilapidated and in all likelihood would offer little for our trouble octave had begun to voice his disappointment over our failure to find anything in the nature of artifacts that would throw light on the history of yohvombis then a little to the right of the stairway we perceived an entrance in the main wall halfchoked with ancient d–πbris behind the heap of detritus we found the beginning of a downward flight of steps darkness poured from the opening musty with primordial stagnancies of decay and we could see nothing below the first steps which gave the appearance of being suspended over a black gulf throwing his torchbeam into the abyss octave began to descend the stairs his eager voice called us to follow at the bottom of the high awkward steps we found ourselves in a long and roomy vault like a subterranean hallway its floor was deep with siftings of immemorial dust the air was singularly heavy as if the lees of an ancient atmosphere less tenuous than that of mars today had settled down and remained in that stagnant darkness it was harder to breathe than the outer air it was filled with unknown effluvia and the light dust arose before us at every step diffusing a faintness of bygone corruption like the dust of powdered mummies at the end of the vault before a strait and lofty doorway our torches revealed an immense shallow urn or pan supported on short cubeshaped legs and wrought from a dull blackishgreen material in its bottom we perceived a deposit of dark and cinderlike fragments which gave off a slight but disagreeable pungence like the phantom of some more powerful odor octave bending over the rim began to cough and sneeze as he inhaled it that stuff whatever it was must have been a pretty powerful fumigant he observed the people of yohvombis may have used it to disinfect the vaults the doorway beyond the shallow urn admitted us to a larger chamber whose floor was comparatively free of dust we found that the dark stone beneath our feet was marked off in multiform geometric patterns traced with ochreous ore amid which as in egyptian cartouches hieroglyphics and highly formalized drawings were enclosed we could make little from most of them but the figures in many were doubtless designed to represent the yorhis themselves like the aihais they were tall and angular with great bellowslike chests the ears and nostrils as far as we could judge were not so huge and flaring as those of the modern martians all of these yorhis were depicted as being nude but in one of the cartouches done in a far hastier style than the others we perceived two figures whose high conical craniums were wrapped in what seemed to be a sort of turban which they were about to remove or adjust the artist seemed to have laid a peculiar emphasis on the odd gesture with which the sinuous fourjointed fingers were plucking at these headdresses and the whole posture was unexplainably contorted from the second vault passages ramified in all directions leading to a veritable warren of catacombs here enormous potbellied urns of the same material as the fumigatingpan but taller than a mans head and fitted with angularhandled stoppers were ranged in solemn rows along the walls leaving scant room for two of us to walk abreast when we succeeded in removing one of the huge stoppers we saw that the jar was filled to the rim with ashes and charred fragments of bone doubtless the yorhis had stored the cremated remains of whole families in single urns even octave became silent as we went on and a sort of meditative awe seemed to replace his former excitement we others i think were utterly weighed down to a man by the solid gloom of a conceptdefying antiquity into which it seemed that we were going further and further at every step the shadows fluttered before us like the monstrous and misshapen wings of phantom bats there was nothing anywhere but the atomlike dust of ages and the jars that held the ashes of a longextinct people but clinging to the high roof in one of the further vaults i saw a dark and corrugated patch of circular form like a withered fungus it was impossible to reach the thing and we went on after peering at it with many futile conjectures oddly enough i failed to remember at that moment the crumpled shadowy object i had seen or dreamt of the night before i have no idea how far we had gone when we came to the last vault but it seemed that we had been wandering for ages in that forgotten underworld the air was growing fouler and more irrespirable with a thick sodden quality as if from a sediment of material rottenness and we had about decided to turn back then without warning at the end of a long urnlined catacomb we found ourselves confronted by a blank wall here we came upon one of the strangest and most mystifying of our discoveries a mummified and incredibly desiccated figure standing erect against the wall it was more than seven feet in height of a brown bituminous color and was wholly nude except for a sort of black cowl that covered the upper head and drooped down at the side in wrinkled folds from the size and general contour it was plainly one of the ancient yorhis perhaps the sole member of this race whose body had remained intact we all felt an inexpressible thrill at the sheer age of this shrivelled thing which in the dry air of the vault had endured through all the historic and geologic vicissitudes of the planet to provide a visible link with lost cycles then as we peered closer with our torches we saw why the mummy had maintained an upright position at ankles knees waist shoulders and neck it was shackled to the wall by heavy metal bands so deeply eaten and embrowned with a sort of rust that we had failed to distinguish them at first sight in the shadow the strange cowl on the head when closelier studied continued to baffle us it was covered with a fine mouldlike pile unclean and dusty as ancient cobwebs something about it i knew not what was abhorrent and revolting by jove this is a real find ejaculated octave as he thrust his torch into the mummified face where shadows moved like living things in the pitdeep hollows of the eyes and the huge triple nostrils and wide ears that flared upward beneath the cowl still lifting the torch he put out his free hand and touched the body very lightly tentative as the touch had been the lower part of the barrellike torso the legs the hands and forearms all seemed to dissolve into powder leaving the head and upper body and arms still hanging in their metal fetters the progress of decay had been queerly unequal for the remnant portions gave no sign of disintegration octave cried out in dismay and then began to cough and sneeze as the cloud of brown powder floating with an airy lightness enveloped him we others all stepped back to avoid the powder then above the spreading cloud i saw an unbelievable thing the black cowl on the mummys head began to curl and twitch upward at the corners it writhed with a verminous motion it fell from the withered cranium seeming to enfold and unfold convulsively in midair as it fell then it dropped on the bare head of octave who in his disconcertment at the crumbling of the mummy had remained standing close to the wall at that instant in a start of profound terror i remembered the thing that had inched itself from the shadows of yohvombis in the light of the twin moons and had drawn back like a figment of slumber at my first waking movement cleaving closely as a tightened cloth the thing enfolded octaves hair and brow and eyes and he shrieked wildly with incoherent pleas for help and tore with frantic fingers at the cowl but failed to loosen it then his cries began to mount in a mad crescendo of agony as if beneath some instrument of infernal torture and he danced and capered blindly about the vault eluding us with strange celerity as we all sprang forward in an effort to reach him and release him from his weird encumbrance the whole happening was mysterious as a nightmare but the thing that had fallen on his head was plainly some unclassified form of martian life which contrary to all the known laws of science had survived in those primordial catacombs we must rescue him from those clutches if we could we tried to close in on the frenzied figure of our chief which in the far from roomy space between the last urns and the wall should have been an easy matter but darting away in a manner doubly incomprehensible because of his blindfolded condition he circled about us and ran past to disappear among the urns toward the outer labyrinth of intersecting catacombs my god what has happened to him cried harper the man acts as if he were possessed there was obviously no time for a discussion of the enigma and we all followed octave as speedily as our astonishment would permit we had lost sight of him in the darkness and when we came to the first division of the vaults we were doubtful as to which passage he had taken till we heard a shrill scream several times repeated in a catacomb on the extreme left there was a weird unearthly quality in those screams which may have been due to the longstagnant air or the peculiar acoustics of the ramifying caverns but somehow i could not imagine them as issuing from human lips at least not from those of a living man they seemed to contain a soulless mechanical agony as if they had been wrung from a devildriven corpse thrusting our torches before us into the lurching fleeing shadows we raced along between rows of mighty urns the screaming had died away in sepulchral silence but far off we heard the light and muffled thud of running feet we followed in headlong pursuit but gasping painfully in the vitiated miasmal air we were soon compelled to slacken our pace without coming in sight of octave very faintly and further away than ever like the tombswallowed steps of a phantom we heard his vanishing footfalls then they ceased and we heard nothing except our own convulsive breathing and the blood that throbbed in our templeveins like steadily beaten drums of alarm we went on dividing our party into three contingents when we came to a triple branching of the caverns harper and halgren and i took the middle passage and after we had gone on for an endless interval without finding any trace of octave and had threaded our way through recesses piled to the roof with colossal urns that must have held the ashes of a hundred generations we came out in the huge chamber with the geometric floordesigns here very shortly we were joined by the other who had likewise failed to locate our missing leader it would be useless to detail our renewed and hourlong search of the myriad vaults many of which we had not hitherto explored all were empty as far as any sign of life was concerned i remember passing once more through the vault in which i had seen the dark rounded patch on the ceiling and noting with a shudder that the patch was gone it was a miracle that we did not lose ourselves in that underworld maze but at last we came back again to the final catacomb in which we had found the shackled mummy we heard a measured and recurrent clangor as we neared the place a most alarming and mystifying sound under the circumstances it was like the hammering of ghouls on some forgotten mausoleum when we drew nearer the beams of our torches revealed a sight that was no less unexplainable than unexpected a human figure with its back toward us and the head concealed by a swollen black object that had the size and form of a sofa cushion was standing near the remains of the mummy and was striking at the wall with a pointed metal bar how long octave had been there and where he had found the bar we could not know but the blank wall had crumbled away beneath his furious blows leaving on the floor a pile of cementlike fragments and a small narrow door of the same ambiguous material as the cinerary urns and the fumigatingpan had been laid bare amazed uncertain inexpressibly bewildered we were all incapable of action or volition at that moment the whole business was too fantastic and too horrifying and it was plain that octave had been overcome by some sort of madness i for one felt the violent upsurge of sudden nausea when i had identified the loathsomely bloated thing that clung to octaves head and drooped in obscene tumescence on his neck i did not dare to surmise the causation of its bloating before any of us could recover our faculties octave flung aside the metal bar and began to fumble for something in the wall it must have been a hidden spring though how he could have known its location or existence is beyond all legitimate conjecture with a dull hideous grating the uncovered door swung inward thick and ponderous as a mausolean slab leaving an aperture from which the nether midnight seemed to well like a flood of aeonburied foulness somehow at that instant our electric torches flickered and grew dim and we all breathed a suffocating fetor like a draught from inner worlds of immemorial putrescence octave had turned toward us now and he stood in an idle posture before the open door like one who has finished some ordained task i was the first of our party to throw off the paralyzing spell and pulling out a claspknife the only semblance of a weapon which i carried i ran over to him he moved back but not quickly enough to evade me when i stabbed with the fourinch blade at the black turgescent mass that enveloped his whole upper head and hung down upon his eyes what the thing was i should prefer not to imagine if it were possible to imagine it was formless as a great slug with neither head nor tail nor apparent organs an unclean puffy leathery thing covered with that fine mouldlike fur of which i have spoken the knife tore into it as if through rotten parchment making a long gash and the horror appeared to collapse like a broken bladder out of it there gushed a sickening torrent of human blood mingled with dark filiated masses that may have been halfdissolved hair and floating gelatinous lumps like molten bone and shreds of a curdy white substance at the same time octave began to stagger and went down at full length on the floor disturbed by his fall the mummydust arose about him in a curling cloud beneath which he lay mortally still conquering my revulsion and choking with the dust i bent over him and tore the flaccid oozing horror from his head it came with unexpected ease as if i had removed a limp rag but i wish to god that i had let it remain beneath there was no longer a human cranium for all had been eaten away even to the eyebrows and the halfdevoured brain was laid bare as i lifted the cowllike object i dropped the unnamable thing from fingers that had grown suddenly nerveless and it turned over as it fell revealing on the nether side many rows of pinkish suckers arranged in circles about a pallid disk that was covered with nervelike filaments suggesting a sort of plexus my companions had pressed forward behind me but for an appreciable interval no one spoke how long do you suppose he has been dead it was halgren who whispered the awful question which we had all been asking ourselves apparently no one felt able or willing to answer it and we could only stare in horrible timeless fascination at octave at length i made an effort to avert my gaze and turning at random i saw the remnants of the shackled mummy and noted for the first time with mechanical unreal horror the halfeaten condition of the withered head from this my gaze was diverted to the newly opened door at one side without perceiving for a moment what had drawn my attention then startled i beheld beneath my torch far down beyond the door as if in some nether pit a seething multitudinous wormlike movement of crawling shadows they seemed to boil up in the darkness and then over the broad threshold of the vault there poured the verminous vanguard of a countless army things that were kindred to the monstrous diabolic leech i had torn from octaves eaten head some were thin and flat like writhing doubling disks of cloth or leather and others were more or less poddy and crawled with gutted slowness what they had found to feed on in the sealed eternal midnight i do not know and i pray that i never shall know i sprang back and away from them electrified with terror sick with loathing and the black army inched itself unendingly with nightmare swiftness from the unsealed abyss like the nauseous vomit of horrorsated hells as it poured toward us burying octaves body from sight in a writhing wave i saw a stir of life from the seemingly dead thing i had cast aside and saw the loathly struggle which it made to right itself and join the others but neither i nor my companions could endure to look longer we turned and ran between the mighty rows of urns with the slithering mass of demon leeches close upon us and scattered in blind panic when we came to the first division of the vaults heedless of each other or of anything but the urgency of flight we plunged into the ramifying passages at random behind me i heard someone stumble and go down with a curse that mounted to an insane shrieking but i knew that if i halted and went back it would only be to invite the same baleful doom that had overtaken the hindmost of our party still clutching the electric torch and my open claspknife i ran along a minor passage which i seemed to remember would conduct with more or less directness upon the large outer vault with the painted floor here i found myself alone the others had kept to the main catacombs and i heard far off a muffled babel of mad cries as if several of them had been seized by their pursuers it seemed that i must have been mistaken about the direction of the passage for it turned and twisted in an unfamiliar manner with many intersections and i soon found that i was lost in the black labyrinth where the dust had lain unstirred by living feet for inestimable generations the cinerary warren had grown still once more and i heard my own frenzied panting loud and stertorous as that of a titan in the dead silence suddenly as i went on my torch disclosed a human figure coming toward me in the gloom before i could master my startlement the figure had passed me with long machinelike strides as if returning to the inner vaults i think it was harper since the height and build were about right for him but i am not altogether sure for the eyes and upper head were muffled by a dark inflated cowl and the pale lips were locked as if a silence of tetanic torture or death whoever he was he had dropped his torch and he was running blindfolded in utter darkness beneath the impulsion of that unearthly vampirism to seek the very fountainhead of the unloosed horror i knew that he was beyond human help and i did not even dream of trying to stop him trembling violently i resumed my flight and was passed by two more of our party stalking by with mechanical swiftness and sureness and cowled with those satanic leeches the others must have returned by way of the main passages for i did not meet them and i was never to see them again the remainder of my flight is a blur of pandemonian terror once more after thinking that i was near the outer cavern i found myself astray and fled through a ranged eternity of monstrous urns in vaults that must have extended for an unknown distance beyond our explorations it seemed that i had gone on for years and my lungs were choking with the aeondead air and my legs were ready to crumble beneath me when i saw faroff a tiny point of blessed daylight i ran toward it with all the terrors of the alien darkness crowding behind me and accursed shadows flittering before and saw that the vault ended in a low ruinous entrance littered by rubble on which there fell an arc of thin sunshine it was another entrance than the one by which we had penetrated this lethal underworld i was within a dozen feet of the opening when without sound or other intimation something dropped upon my head from the roof above blinding me instantly and closing upon me like a tautened net my brow and scalp at the same time were shot through with a million needlelike pangs a manifold evergrowing agony that seemed to pierce the very bone and converge from all sides upon my inmost brain the terror and suffering of that moment were worse than aught which the hells of earthly madness or delirium could ever contain i felt the foul vampiric clutch of an atrocious death and of more than death i believe that i dropped the torch but the fingers of my right hand had still retained the open knife instinctively since i was hardly capable of conscious volition i raised the knife and slashed blindly again and again many times at the thing that had fastened its deadly folds upon me the blade must have gone through and through the clinging monstrosity to gash my own flesh in a score of places but i did not feel the pain of those wounds in the millionthrobbing torment that possessed me at last i saw light and saw that a black strip loosened from above my eyes and dripping with my own blood was hanging down my cheek it writhed a little even as it hung and i ripped it away and ripped the other remnants of the thing tatter by oozing bloody tatter from off my brow and head then i staggered toward the entrance and the wan light turned to a far receding dancing flame before me as i lurched and fell outside the cavern a flame that fled like the last star of creation above the yawning sliding chaos and oblivion into which i descended i am told that my unconsciousness was of brief duration i came to myself with the cryptic faces of the two martian guides bending over me my head was full of lancinating pains and halfremembered terrors closed upon my mind like the shadows of mustering harpies i rolled over and looked back toward the cavernmouth from which the martians after finding me had seemingly dragged me for some little distance the mouth was under the terraced angle of an outer building and within sight of our camp i stared at the black opening with hideous fascination and descried a shadowy stirring in the gloom the writhing verminous movement of things that pressed forward from the darkness but did not emerge into the light doubtless they could not endure the sun those creatures of ultramundane night and cyclesealed corruption it was then that the ultimate horror the beginning madness came upon me amid my crawling revulsion my nauseaprompted desire to flee from that seething cavernmouth there rose an abhorrently conflicting impulse to return to thread my backward way through all the catacombs as the others had done to go down where never men save they the inconceivably doomed and accursed had ever gone to seek beneath that damnable compulsion a nether world that human thought can never picture there was a black light a soundless calling in the vaults of my brain the implanted summons of the thing like a permeating and sorcerous poison it lured me to the subterranean door that was walled up by the dying people of yohvombis to immure those hellish and immortal leeches those dark parasites that engraft their own abominable life on the halfeaten brains of the dead it called me to the depths beyond where dwell the noisome necromantic ones of whom the leeches with all their powers of vampirism and diabolism are but the merest minions it was only the two aihais who prevented me from going back i struggled i fought them insanely as they strove to retard me with their spongy arms but i must have been pretty thoroughly exhausted from all the superhuman adventures of the day and i went down once more after a little into fathomless nothingness from which i floated out at long intervals to realize that i was being carried across the desert toward ignarh well that is all my story i have tried to tell it fully and coherently at a cost that would be unimaginable to the sane to tell it before the madness falls upon me again as it will very soon as it is doing now yes i have told my story and you have written it all out havent you now i must go back to yohvombis back across the desert and down through all the catacombs to the vaster vaults beneath something is in my brain that commands me and will direct me i tell you i must go postscript as an interne in the terrestrial hospital at ignarh i had charge of the singular case of rodney severn the one surviving member of the octave expedition to yohvombis and took down the above story from his dictation severn had been brought to the hospital by the martian guides of the expedition he was suffering from a horribly lacerated and inflamed condition of the scalp and brow and was wildly delirious part of the time and had to be held down in his bed during recurrent seizures of a mania whose violence was doubly inexplicable in view of his extreme debility the lacerations as will have been learned from the story were mainly selfinflicted they were mingled with numerous small round wounds easily distinguished from the knifeslashes and arranged in regular circles through which an unknown poison had been injected into severns scalp the causation of these wounds was difficult to explain unless one were to believe that severns story was true and was no mere figment of his illness speaking for myself in the light of what afterwards occurred i feel that i have no other recourse than to believe it there are strange things on the red planet and i can only second the wish that was expressed by the doomed archaeologist in regard to future explorations the night after he had finished telling me his story while another doctor than myself was supposedly on duty severn managed to escape from the hospital doubtless in one of the strange seizures at which i have hinted a most astonishing thing for he had seemed weaker than ever after the long strain of his terrible narrative and his demise had been hourly expected more astonishing still his bare footsteps were found in the desert going toward yohvombis till they vanished in the path of a light sandstorm but no trace of severn himself has yet been discovered
