the cash boy preface the cash boy by horatio alger jr as the name implies is a story about a boy and for boys through some conspiracy the hero of the story when a baby was taken from his relatives and given into the care of a kind woman not knowing his name she gave him her husbands name frank fowler she had one little daughter grace and showing no partiality in the treatment of her children frank never suspected that she was not his sister however at the death of mrs fowler all this was related to frank the children were left alone in the world it seemed as though they would have to go to the poorhouse but frank could not become reconciled to that a kind neighbor agreed to care for grace so frank decided to start out in the world to make his way he had many disappointments and hardships but through his kindness to an old man his own relatives and right name were revealed to him chapter i a revelation a group of boys was assembled in an open field to the west of the public schoolhouse in the town of crawford most of them held hats in their hands while two stationed sixty feet distant from each other were having catch tom pinkerton son of deacon pinkerton had just returned from brooklyn and while there had witnessed a match game between two professional clubs on his return he proposed that the boys of crawford should establish a club to be known as the excelsior club of crawford to play among themselves and on suitable occasions to challenge clubs belonging to other villages this proposal was received with instant approval i move that tom pinkerton address the meeting said one boy second the motion said another as there was no chairman james briggs was appointed to that position and put the motion which was unanimously carried tom pinkerton in his own estimation a personage of considerable importance came forward in a consequential manner and commenced as follows mr chairman and boys you all know what has brought us together we want to start a club for playing baseball like the big clubs they have in brooklyn and new york how shall we do it asked henry scott we must first appoint a captain of the club who will have power to assign the members to their different positions of course you will want one that understands about these matters he means himself whispered henry scott to his next neighbor and here he was right is that all asked sam pomeroy no as there will be some expenses there must be a treasurer to receive and take care of the funds and we shall need a secretary to keep the records of the club and write and answer challenges boys said the chairman you have heard tom pinkertons remarks those who are in favor of organizing a club on this plan will please signify it in the usual way all the boys raised their hands and it was declared a vote you will bring in your votes for captain said the chairman tom pinkerton drew a little apart with a conscious look as he supposed of course that no one but himself would be thought of as leader slips of paper were passed around and the boys began to prepare their ballots they were brought to the chairman in a hat and he forthwith took them out and began to count them boys he announced amid a universal stillness there is one vote for sam pomeroy one for eugene morton and the rest are for frank fowler who is elected there was a clapping of hands in which tom pinkerton did not join frank fowler who is to be our hero came forward a little and spoke modestly as follows boys i thank you for electing me captain of the club i am afraid i am not very well qualified for the place but i will do as well as i can the speaker was a boy of fourteen he was of medium height for his age strong and sturdy in build and with a frank prepossessing countenance and an open cordial manner which made him a general favorite it was not however to his popularity that he owed his election but to the fact that both at bat and in the field he excelled all the boys and therefore was the best suited to take the lead the boys now proceeded to make choice of a treasurer and secretary for the first position tom pinkerton received a majority of the votes though not popular it was felt that some office was due him for secretary ike stanton who excelled in penmanship was elected and thus all the offices were filled the boys now crowded around frank fowler with petitions for such places as they desired i hope you will give me a little time before i decide about positions boys frank said i want to consider a little all right take till next week said one and another and let us have a scrub game this afternoon the boys were in the middle of the sixth inning when some one called out to frank fowler frank your sister is running across the field i think she wants you frank dropped his bat and hastened to meet his sister whats the matter gracie he asked in alarm oh frank she exclaimed bursting into tears mothers been bleeding at the lungs and she looks so white im afraid shes very sick boys said frank turning to his companions i must go home at once you can get some one to take my place my mother is very sick when frank reached the little brown cottage which he called home he found his mother in an exhausted state reclining on the bed how do you feel mother asked our hero anxiously quite weak frank she answered in a low voice i have had a severe attack let me go for the doctor mother i dont think it will be necessary frank the attack is over and i need no medicines only time to bring back my strength but three days passed and mrs fowlers nervous prostration continued she had attacks previously from which she rallied sooner and her present weakness induced serious misgivings as to whether she would ever recover frank thought that her eyes followed him with more than ordinary anxiety and after convincing himself that this was the case he drew near his mothers bedside and inquired mother isnt there something you want me to do nothing i believe frank i thought you looked at me as if you wanted to say something there is something i must say to you before i die before you die mother echoed frank in a startled voice yes frank i am beginning to think that this is my last sickness but mother you have been so before and got up again there must always be a last time frank and my strength is too far reduced to rally again i fear i cant bear the thought of losing you mother said frank deeply moved you will miss me then frank said mrs fowler shall i not grace and i will be alone in the world alone in the world repeated the sick woman sorrowfully with little help to hope for from man for i shall leave you nothing poor children that isnt what i think of said frank hastily i can support myself but grace she is a delicate girl said the mother anxiously she cannot make her way as you can she wont need to said frank promptly i shall take care of her but you are very young even to support yourself you are only fourteen i know it mother but i am strong and i am not afraid there are a hundred ways of making a living but do you realize that you will have to start with absolutely nothing deacon pinkerton holds a mortgage on this house for all it will bring in the market and i owe him arrears of interest besides i didnt know that mother but it doesnt frighten me and you will take care of grace i promise it mother suppose grace were not your sister said the sick woman anxiously scanning the face of the boy what makes you suppose such a thing as that mother of course she is my sister but suppose she were not persisted mrs fowler you would not recall your promise no surely not for i love her but why do you talk so mother and a suspicion crossed franks mind that his mothers intellect might be wandering it is time to tell you all frank sit down by the bedside and i will gather my strength to tell you what must be told grace is not your sister frank not my sister mother he exclaimed you are not in earnest i am quite in earnest frank then whose child is she she is my child then she must be my sister are you not my mother no frank i am not your mother chapter ii mrs fowlers story not my mother he exclaimed who then is my mother i cannot tell you frank i never knew you will forgive me for concealing this from you for so long no matter who was my real mother since i have you you have been a mother to me and i shall always think of you as such you make me happy frank when you say that and you will look upon grace as a sister also will you not always said the boy emphatically mother will you tell all you know about me i dont know what to think now that i am not your son i cannot rest till i learn who i am i can understand your feelings frank but i must defer the explanation till tomorrow i have fatigued myself with talking but tomorrow you shall know all that i can tell you forgive me for not thinking of your being tired mother and he bent over and pressed his lips upon the cheek of the sick woman but dont talk any more wait till tomorrow in the afternoon frank had a call from sam pomeroy the club is to play tomorrow afternoon against a picked nine frank he said will you be there i cant sam he answered my mother is very sick and it is my duty to stay at home with her we shall miss you that is all of us but one tom pinkerton said yesterday that you ought to resign as you cant attend to your duties he wouldnt object to filling your place i fancy he is welcome to the place as soon as the club feels like electing him said frank tell the boys i am sorry i cant be on hand they had better get you to fill my place ill mention it but i dont think theyll see it in that light theyre all jealous of my superior playing said sam humorously well goodbye frank i hope your motherll be better soon thank you sam answered frank soberly i hope so too but she is very sick the next day mrs fowler again called frank to the bedside grace is gone out on an errand she said and i can find no better time for telling you what i know about you and the circumstances which led to my assuming the charge of you are you strong enough mother yes frank thirteen years ago my husband and myself occupied a small tenement in that part of brooklyn know as gowanus not far from greenwood cemetery my husband was a carpenter and though his wages were small he was generally employed we had been married three years but had no children of our own our expenses were small and we got on comfortably and should have continued to do so but that mr fowler met with an accident which partially disabled him he fell from a high scaffold and broke his arm this was set and he was soon able to work again but he must also have met with some internal injury for his full strength never returned half a days work tired him more than a whole days work formerly had done of course our income was very much diminished and we were obliged to economize very closely this preyed upon my husbands mind and seeing his anxiety i set about considering how i could help him and earn my share of the expenses one day in looking over the advertising columns of a new york paper i saw the following advertisement for adoption a healthy male infant the parents are able to pay liberally for the childs maintenance but circumstances compel them to delegate the care to another address for interview a m i had no sooner read this advertisement than i felt that it was just what i wanted a liberal compensation was promised and under our present circumstances would be welcome as it was urgently needed i mentioned the matter to my husband and he was finally induced to give his consent accordingly i replied to the advertisement three days passed in which i heard nothing from it but as we were sitting at the supper table at six oclock one afternoon there came a knock at our front door i opened it and saw before me a tall stranger a man of about thirtyfive of dark complexion and dark whiskers he was well dressed and evidently a gentleman in station is this mrs fowler he asked yes sir i answered in some surprise then may i beg permission to enter your house for a few minutes i have something to say to you still wondering i led the way into the sittingroom where your father where mr fowler call him my father i know no other said frank where your father was seated you have answered an advertisement said the stranger yes sir i replied i am a m was his next announcement of course i have received many letters but on the whole i was led to consider yours most favorably i have made inquiries about you in the neighborhood and the answers have been satisfactory you have no children of your own no sir all the better you would be able to give more attention to this child is it yours sir i asked yees he answered with hesitation circumstances he continued circumstances which i need not state compel me to separate from it five hundred dollars a year will be paid for its maintenance five hundred dollars i heard this with joy for it was considerably more than my husband was able to earn since his accident it would make us comfortable at once and your father might work when he pleased without feeling any anxiety about our coming to want will that sum be satisfactory asked the stranger it is very liberal i answered i intended it to be so he said since there is no difficulty on this score i am inclined to trust you with the care of the child but i must make two conditions what are they sir in the first place you must not try to find out the friends of the child they do not desire to be known another thing you must move from brooklyn move from brooklyn i repeated yes he answered firmly i do not think it necessary to give you a reason for this condition enough that it is imperative if you decline our negotiations are at an end i looked at my husband he seemed as much surprised as i was perhaps you will wish to consult together suggested our visitor if so i can give you twenty minutes i will remain in this room while you go out and talk it over we acted on this hint and went into the kitchen we decided that though we should prefer to live in brooklyn it would be worth our while to make the sacrifice for the sake of the addition to our income we came in at the end of ten minutes and announced our decision our visitor seemed to be very much pleased where would you wish us to move asked your father i do not care to designate any particular place i should prefer some small country town from fifty to a hundred miles distant i suppose you will be able to move soon yes sir we will make it a point to do so how soon will the child be placed in our hands shall we send for it no no he said hastily i cannot tell you exactly when but it will be brought here probably in the course of a day or two i myself shall bring it and if at that time you wish to say anything additional you can do so he went away leaving us surprised and somewhat excited at the change that was to take place in our lives the next evening the sound of wheels was heard and a hack stopped at our gate the same gentleman descended hurriedly with a child in his arms you were the child frank and entered the house this is the child he said placing it in my arms and here is the first quarterly installment of your pay three months hence you will receive the same sum from my agent in new york here is his address and he placed a card in my hands have you anything to ask suppose i wish to communicate with you respecting the child suppose he is sick then write to a m care of giles warner no nassau street by the way it will be necessary for you to send him your postoffice address after your removal in order that he may send you your quarterly dues with this he left us entered the hack and drove off i have never seen him since chapter iii left alone frank listened to this revelation with wonder for the first time in his life he asked himself who am i how came i by my name mother he asked i must tell you after the sudden departure of the gentleman who brought you we happened to think that we had not asked your name we accordingly wrote to the address which had been given us making the inquiry in return we received a slip of paper containing these words the name is immaterial give him any name you please a m you gave me the name of frank it was mr fowlers name we should have given it to you had you been our own boy as the choice was left to us we selected that it suits me as well as any other how soon did you leave brooklyn mother in a week we had made all arrangements and removed to this place it is a small place but it furnished as much work as my husband felt able to do with the help of the allowance for your support we not only got on comfortably but saved up a hundred and fifty dollars annually which we deposited in a savings bank but after five years the money stopped coming it was the year the year of the great panic and among others who failed was giles warners agent from whom we received our payments mr fowler went to new york to inquire about it but only learned that mr warner weighed down by his troubles had committed suicide leaving no clew to the name of the man who left you with us how long ago was that mother seven years ago nearly eight and you continued to keep me though the payments stopped certainly you were as dear to us as our own child for we now had a child of our own grace we should as soon have thought of casting off her as you but you must have been poor mother we were economical and we got along till your father died three years ago since then it has been hard work you have had a hard time mother no harder on your account you have been a great comfort to me frank i am only anxious for the future i fear you and grace will suffer after i am gone dont fear mother i am young and strong i am not afraid to face the world with gods help what are you thinking of frank asked mrs fowler noticing the boys fixed look mother he said earnestly i mean to seek for that man you have told me of i want to find out who i am do you think he was my father he said he was but i do not believe it he spoke with hesitation and said this to deceive us probably i am glad you think so i would not like to think him my father from what you have told me of him i am sure i would not like him he must be nearly fifty now dark complexion with dark hair and whiskers i am afraid that description will not help you any there are many men who look like that i should know him by his expression but i cannot describe that to you here mrs fowler was seized with a very severe fit of coughing and frank begged her to say no more two days later and mrs fowler was no better she was rapidly failing and no hope was entertained that she would rally she herself felt that death was near at hand and told frank so but he found it hard to believe on the second of the two days as he was returning from the village store with an orange for his mother he was overtaken by sam pomeroy is your mother very sick frank he asked yes sam im afraid she wont live is it so bad as that i do believe he added with a sudden change of tone tom pinkerton is the meanest boy i ever knew he is trying to get your place as captain of the baseball club he says that if your mother doesnt live you will have to go to the poorhouse for you wont have any money and that it will be a disgrace for the club to have a captain from the poorhouse did he say that asked frank indignantly yes when he tells you that you may say that i shall never go to the poorhouse he says his father is going to put you and your sister there all the deacon pinkertons in the world can never make me go to the poorhouse said frank resolutely bully for you frank i knew you had spunk frank hurried home as he entered the little house a neighbors wife who had been watching with his mother came to meet him frank she said gravely you must prepare yourself for sad news while you were out your mother had another hemorrhage and and is she dead asked the boy his face very pale she is dead chapter iv the town autocrat the widder fowler is dead remarked deacon pinkerton at the supper table she died this afternoon i suppose she wont leave anything said mrs pinkerton no i hold a mortgage on her furniture and that is all she has what will become of the children as i observed day before yesterday they will be constrained to find a refuge in the poorhouse what do you think sam pomeroy told me father i am not able to conjecture what samuel would be likely to observe my son he observed that frank fowler said he wouldnt go to the poorhouse ahem coughed the deacon the boy will not be consulted thats what i say father said tom who desired to obtain his fathers cooperation youll make him go to the poorhouse wont you i shall undoubtedly exercise my authority if it should be necessary my son he told sam pomeroy that all the deacon pinkertons in the world couldnt make him go to the poorhouse i will constrain him said the deacon i would if i were you father said tom elated at the effect of his words just teach him a lesson really deacon you mustnt be too hard upon the poor boy said his betterhearted wife hes got trouble enough on him i will only constrain him for his good jane in the poorhouse he will be well provided for meanwhile another conversation respecting our hero and his fortunes was held at sam pomeroys home it was not as handsome as the deacons for mr pomeroy was a poor man but it was a happy one nevertheless and mr pomeroy limited as were his means was far more liberal than the deacon i pity frank fowler said sam who was warmhearted and sympathetic and a strong friend of frank i dont know what he will do i suppose his mother left nothing i understood said mr pomeroy that deacon pinkerton holds a mortgage on her furniture the deacon wants to send frank and his sister to the poorhouse that would be a pity i should think so but frank positively says he wont go i am afraid there isnt anything else for him to be sure he may get a chance to work in a shop or on a farm but grace cant support herself father i want to ask you a favor what is it sam wont you invite frank and his sister to come and stay here a week just as your mother says i say yes the poor children will be quite welcome if we were rich enough they might stay with us all the time when frank comes here i will talk over his affairs with him said mr pomeroy perhaps we can think of some plan for him i wish you could father in the meantime you can invite him and grace to come and stay with us a week or a fortnight shall we say a fortnight wife with all my heart all right father thank you sam delivered the invitation in a way that showed how strongly his own feelings were enlisted in favor of its acceptance frank grasped his hand thank you sam you are a true friend he said i hadnt begun to think of what we were to do grace and i youll come wont you you are sure that it wont trouble your mother sam she is anxious to have you come then ill come i havent formed any plans yet but i must as soon as soon as mother is buried i think i can earn my living somehow one thing i am determined about i wont go to the poorhouse the funeral was over frank and grace walked back to the little house now their home no longer they were to pack up a little bundle of clothes and go over to mr pomeroys in time for supper when frank had made up his bundle urged by some impulse he opened a drawer in his mothers bureau his mind was full of the story she had told him and he thought it just possible that he might find something to throw additional light upon his past history while exploring the contents of the drawer he came to a letter directed to him in his mothers wellknown handwriting he opened it hastily and with a feeling of solemnity read as follows my dear frank in the lower drawer wrapped in a piece of brown paper you will find two gold eagles worth twenty dollars you will need them when i am gone use them for grace and yourself i saved these for my children take them frank for i have nothing else to give you the furniture will pay the debt i owe deacon pinkerton there ought to be something over but i think he will take all i wish i had more to leave you dear frank but the god of the fatherless will watch over you to him i commit you and grace your affectionate mother ruth fowler frank following the instructions of the letter found the gold pieces and put them carefully into his pocketbook he did not mention the letter to grace at present for he knew not but deacon pinkerton might lay claim to the money to satisfy his debt if he knew it i am ready frank said grace entering the room shall we go yes grace there is no use in stopping here any longer as he spoke he heard the outer door open and a minute later deacon pinkerton entered the room none of the deacons pompousness was abated as he entered the house and the room will you take a seat said our hero with the air of master of the house i intended to said the deacon not acknowledging his claim so your poor mother is gone yes sir said frank briefly we must all die said the deacon feeling that it was incumbent on him to say something religious ahem your mother died poor she left no property it was not her fault of course not did she mention that i had advanced her money on the furniture my mother told me all about it sir ahem you are in a sad condition but you will be taken care of you ought to be thankful that there is a home provided for those who have no means what home do you refer to deacon pinkerton asked frank looking steadily in the face of his visitor i mean the poorhouse which the town generously provides for those who cannot support themselves this was the first intimation grace had received of the possibility that they would be sent to such a home and it frightened her oh frank she exclaimed must we go to the poorhouse no grace dont be frightened said frank soothingly we will not go frank fowler said the deacon sternly cease to mislead your sister i am not misleading her sir did you not tell her that she would not be obliged to go to the poorhouse yes sir then what do you mean by resisting my authority you have no authority over us we are not paupers and frank lifted his head proudly and looked steadily in the face of the deacon you are paupers whether you admit it or not we are not said the boy indignantly where is your money where is your property here sir said our hero holding out his hands i have two strong hands and they will help me make a living for my sister and myself may i ask whether you expect to live here and use my furniture i do not intend to sir i shall ask no favors of you neither for grace nor myself i am going to leave the house i only came back to get a few clothes mr pomeroy has invited grace and me to stay at his house for a few days i havent decided what i shall do afterward you will have to go to the poorhouse then i have no objection to your making this visit first it will be a saving to the town then sir we will bid you goodday grace let us go chapter v a little misunderstanding have you carried frank fowler to the poorhouse asked tom pinkerton eagerly on his fathers return no said the deacon he is going to make a visit at mr pomeroys first i shouldnt think you would have let him make a visit said tom discontentedly i should think you would have taken him to the poorhouse right off i feel it my duty to save the town unnecessary expense said deacon pinkerton so tom was compelled to rest satisfied with his fathers assurance that the removal was only deferred meanwhile frank and grace received a cordial welcome at the house of mr pomeroy sam and frank were intimate friends and our hero had been in the habit of calling frequently and it seemed homelike i wish you could stay with us all the time frank you and grace said sam one evening we should all like it said mr pomeroy but we cannot always have what we want if i had it in my power to offer frank any employment which it would be worth his while to follow it might do but he has got his way to make in the world have you formed any plans yet frank that is what i want to consult you about mr pomeroy i will give you the best advice i can frank i suppose you do not mean to stay in the village no sir there is nothing for me to do here i must go somewhere where i can make a living for grace and myself youve got a hard row to hoe frank said mr pomeroy thoughtfully have you decided where to go yes sir i shall go to new york what to the city yes sir ill get something to do no matter what it is but how are you going to live in the meantime ive got a little money that wont last long i know it but i shall soon get work if it is only to black boots in the streets with that spirit frank you will stand a fair chance to succeed what do you mean to do with grace i will take her with me i can think of a better plan leave her here till you have found something to do then send for her but if i leave her here deacon pinkerton will want to put her in the poorhouse i cant bear to have grace go there she need not she can stay here with me for three months will you let me pay her board i can afford to give her board for three months you are very kind mr pomeroy but it wouldnt be right for me to accept your kindness it is my duty to take care of grace i honor your independence frank it shall be as you say when you are ablemind not till then you may pay me at the rate of two dollars a week for graces board then said frank if you are willing to board grace for a while i think i had better go to the city at once i will look over your clothes tomorrow frank said mrs pomeroy and see if they need mending then i will start thursday morning the day after about four oclock the next afternoon he was walking up the main street when just in front of deacon pinkertons house he saw tom leaning against a tree how are you tom he said and was about to pass on where are you going tom asked abruptly to mr pomeroys how soon are you going to the poorhouse to live who told you i was going my father then your fathers mistaken aint you a pauper said tom insolently you havent got any money i have got hands to earn money and i am going to try anyway i advise you to resign as captain of the baseball club why because if you dont youll be kicked out do you think the fellows will be willing to have a pauper for their captain thats the second time you have called me a pauper dont call me so again you are a pauper and you know it frank was not a quarrelsome boy but this repeated insult was too much for him he seized tom by the collar and tripping him up left him on the ground howling with rage as valor was not his strong point he resolved to be revenged upon frank vicariously he was unable to report the case to his father till the next morning as the deacon did not return from a neighboring village whither he had gone on business till late but the result of his communication was a call at mr pomeroys from the deacon at nine oclock the next morning had he found frank it was his intention at toms request to take him at once to the poorhouse but he was too late our hero was already on his way to new york chapter vi frank gets a place so this is new york said frank to himself as he emerged from the railway station and looked about him with interest and curiosity black yer boots shine asked a bootblack seeing our hero standing still frank looked at his shoes they were dirty without doubt but he would not have felt disposed to be so extravagant considering his limited resources had he not felt it necessary to obtain some information about the city yes he said you may black them the boy was on his knees instantly and at work how much do you make in a day asked frank when its a good day i make a dollar thats pretty good said frank can you show me the way to broadway go straight ahead our hero paid for his shine and started in the direction indicated franks plans so far as he had any were to get into a store he knew that broadway was the principal business street in the city and this was about all he did know about it he reached the great thoroughfare in a few minutes and was fortunate enough to find on the window of the corner store the sign a boy wanted he entered at once and going up to the counter addressed a young man who was putting up goods do you want a boy i believe the boss wants one i dont go out to that desk frank found the desk and propounded the same question to a sandywhiskered man who looked up from his writing youre prompt he said that notice was only put out two minutes ago i only saw it one minute ago so you want the place do you i should like it do you know your way about the city no sir but i could soon find out that wont do i shall have plenty of applications from boys who live in the city and are familiar with the streets frank left the store rather discomfited he soon came to another store where there was a similar notice of a boy wanted it was a dry goods store do you live with your parents was asked my parents are dead said frank sadly very sorry but we cant take you why not sir in case you took anything we should make your parents responsible i shouldnt take anything said frank indignantly you might i cant take you our hero left this store a little disheartened by his second rebuff he made several more fruitless applications but did not lose courage wholly he was gaining an appetite however it is not surprising therefore that his attention was drawn to the bills of a restaurant on the opposite side of the street he crossed over and standing outside began to examine them to see what was the scale of prices while in this position he was suddenly aroused by a slap on the back turning he met the gaze of a young man of about thirty who was smiling quite cordially why frank my boy how are you he said offering his hand pretty well thank you said our hero bewildered for he had no recollection of the man who had called him by name the other smiled a little more broadly and thought it was a lucky guess his name is frank i am delighted to hear it he continued when did you reach the city this morning said the unsuspecting frank well its queer i happened to meet you so soon isnt it going to stay long i shall if i can get a place perhaps i can help you i suppose i ought to remember you ventured our hero but i cant think of your name jasper wheelock you dont mean to say you dont remember me perhaps it isnt strange as we only met once or twice in your country home but that doesnt matter im just as ready to help you by the way have you dined no no more have i come in and dine with me whatll you take asked jasper wheelock passing the bill of fare to frank i think i should like to have some roast beef said frank that will suit me here waiter two plates of roast beef and two cups of coffee how are they all at home asked jasper my mother has just died you dont say so said jasper sympathetically my sister is well i forgot your sisters name grace of course grace i find it hard to remember names the fact is i have been trying to recall your last name but its gone from me fowler to be sure frank fowler how could i be so forgetful the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of the coffee and roast beet which both he and his new friend attacked with vigor what kind of pudding will you have asked the stranger apple dumpling said frank that suits me apple dumpling for two in due time the apple dumpling was disposed of and two checks were brought amounting to seventy cents ill pay for both said jasper no thanks we are old acquaintances you know he put his hand into his pocket and quickly withdrew it with an exclamation of surprise well if that isnt a good joke he said ive left my money at home i remember now i left it in the pocket of my other coat i shall have to borrow the money of you you may as well hand me a dollar frank was not disposed to be suspicious but the request for money made him uneasy still there seemed no way of refusing and he reluctantly drew out the money his companion settled the bill and then led the way into the street jasper wheelock was not very scrupulous he was quite capable of borrowing money without intending to return it but he had his good side frank said he as they found themselves in the street you have done me a favor and i am going to help you in return have you got very much money no i had twenty dollars when i left home but i had to pay my fare in the cars and the dinner i have seventeen dollars and a half left then it is necessary for you to get a place as soon as possible yes i have a sister to support grace you know no i dont know the fact is frank i have been imposing upon you i never saw you before in the whole course of my life what made you say you knew me i wanted to get a dinner out of you dont be troubled though ill pay back the money ive been out of a place for three or four weeks but i enter upon one the first of next week for the rest of the week ive got nothing to do and i will try to get you a place the first thing is to get a room somewhere ill tell you what you may have part of my room is it expensive no i pay a dollar and a half a week i think the old lady wont charge more than fifty cents extra for you then my share would be a dollar you may pay only fifty cents ill keep on paying what i do now my room is on sixth avenue they had some distance to walk finally jasper halted before a bakers shop its over this he said he drew out a latchkey and entered this is my den he said it isnt large you cant get any better for the money i shall have to be satisfied said frank i want to get along as cheap as i can ive got to economize myself for a short time after this week i shall earn fifteen dollars a week what business are you in mr wheelock i am a journeyman printer it is a very good business and i generally have steady work i expect to have after i get started again now shall i give you some advice i wish you would you dont know your way around new york i believe i have a map somewhere ill just show you on it the position of the principal streets and that will give you a clearer idea of where we go the map was found and jasper explained to frank the leading topographical features of the island city one thing only was wanting now to make him contented and this was employment but it was too late to make any further inquiries ive been thinking frank said jasper the next morning that you might get the position as a cashboy what does a cashboy do in large retail establishments every salesman keeps a book in which his sales are entered he does not himself make change for it would not do to have so many having access to the moneydrawer the money is carried to the cashiers desk by boys employed for the purpose who return with the change do you think i can get a situation as cashboy i will try at gilbert macks i know one of the principal salesmen if there is a vacancy he will get it for you to oblige me they entered a large retail store on broadway it was broad and spacious twenty salesmen stood behind the counter and boys were running this way and that with small books in their hands how are you duncan said jasper the person addressed was about jasper wheelocks age he had a keen energetic look and manner and would be readily singled out as one of the leading clerks all right wheelock how are you he responded do you want anything in our line no goods i want a place for this youngster hes a friend of mine ill answer for his good character that will be satisfactory but what sort of a place does he want he is ready to begin as cashboy then we can oblige you as one of our boys has fallen sick and we have not supplied his place ill speak to mr gilbert he went up to mr gilbert a portly man in the back part of the store mr gilbert seemed to be asking two or three questions frank waited the result in suspense dreading another disappointment but this time he was fortunate the boy can stay reported duncan his wages are three dollars a week it was not much but frank was well pleased to feel that at last he had a place in the city he wrote a letter to grace in the evening announcing his success and expressing the hope that he would soon be able to send for her chapter vii the cash boy has an adventure four weeks passed the duties of a cashboy are simple enough and frank had no difficulty in discharging them satisfactorily at first he found it tiresome being on his feet all day for the cashboys were not allowed to sit down but he got used to this being young and strong all this was very satisfactory but one thing gave frank uneasiness his income was very inadequate to his wants what makes you so glum frank asked jasper wheelock one evening do i look glum said frank i was only thinking how i could earn more money you know how little i get i can hardly take care of myself much less take care of grace i can lend you some money frank thanks to your good advice i have got some laid up thank you jasper but that wouldnt help matters i should owe you the money and i dont know how i could pay you about increasing your income i really dont know said jasper i am afraid gilbert mack wouldnt raise your wages i dont expect it all the rest of the cashboys would ask the same thing true still i know they are very well pleased with you duncan told me you did more work than any of the rest of the boys i try to do all i can he said you would make a good salesman he thought of course you are too young for that yet i suppose i am frank i am earning fifteen dollars a week you know and i can get along on ten but of the five i save let me give you two i shall never feel it and by and by when you are promoted it wont be necessary jasper you are a true friend said frank warmly but it wouldnt be right for me to accept your kind offer though i shant forget it you have been a good friend to me and you to me frank ill look out for you perhaps i may hear of something for you small as franks income was he had managed to live within it it will be remembered that he had paid but fifty cents a week for a room by great economy he had made his meals cost but two dollars a week so that out of his three dollars he saved fifty cents but this saving would not be sufficient to pay for his clothes however he had had no occasion to buy any as yet and his little fund altogether amounted to twenty dollars of this sum he inclosedsic eight dollars to mr pomeroy to pay for four weeks board for grace i hope i shall be able to keep it up he said to himself thoughtfully at any rate ive got enough to pay for six weeks more before that time something may turn up several days passed without showing frank any way by which he could increase his income jasper again offered to give him two dollars a week out of his own wages but this our hero steadily refused one friday evening just as the store was about to close the head salesman called frank to him where do you live he asked in sixth avenue near twentyfifth street theres a bundle to go to fortysixth street ill pay your fare upon the stage if youll carry it i promised to send it tonight and i dont like to disappoint the lady i can carry it just as well as not frank took the bundle and got on board a passing omnibus there was just one seat vacant beside an old gentleman of seventy who appeared to be quite feeble at fortyfifth street he pulled the strap and prepared to descend leaning heavily on his cane as he did so by some mischance the horses started a little too soon and the old man losing his footing fell in the street frank observed the accident and sprang out instantly to his help i hope you are not much hurt sir he said hastily i have hurt my knee said the old gentleman let me assist you sir said frank helping him up thank you my boy i live at number fortyfive close by if you will lead me to the door and into the house i shall be much indebted to you certainly sir it is no trouble to me with slow step supported by our hero the old gentleman walked to his own door it was opened by a maid servant who looked with some surprise at frank i fell mary explained her master and this young gentleman has kindly helped me home did you hurt yourself much sir not seriously can i do anything more for you sir asked frank come in a moment our hero followed his new acquaintance into a handsomely furnished parlor now my young friend tell me if you have been taken out of your way by your attention to me oh no sir i intended to get out at the next street my dinner is just ready wont you stop and dine with me thank you sir he said hesitatingly but i promised to carry this bundle i believe it is wanted at once so you shall you say the house is in the next street you can go and return in five minutes you have done me a service and i may have it in my power to do something for you in return perhaps thought frank he can help me to some employment for my evenings then aloud thank you sir i will come five minutes later frank was ushered into a handsome diningroom the dinner was already on the table but chairs were only set for three the one at the head of the table was of course occupied by the old gentleman the one opposite by mrs bradley his housekeeper and one at the side was placed for frank mrs bradley said the old gentleman this is a young gentleman who was kind enough to help me home after the accident of which i just spoke to you i would mention his name but i must leave that to him frank fowler sir and my name is wharton now that we are all introduced we can talk more freely will you have some soup mr fowler asked the housekeeper she was a tall thin woman with a reserved manner that was somewhat repellant she had only nodded slightly at the introduction fixing her eyes coldly and searchingly on the face of our hero it was evident that whatever impression the service rendered might have made upon the mind of mr wharton it was not calculated to warm the housekeeper to cordiality thank you he answered but he could not help feeling at the same time that mrs bradley was not a very agreeable woman you ought to have a good appetite said mr wharton you have to work hard during the day our young friend is a cashboy at gilbert macks mrs bradley oh indeed said mrs bradley arching her brows as much as to say you have invited strange company to dinner do your parents live in the city frank i believe your name is frank no sir they are dead my mother died only a few weeks since and have you no brothers and sisters i have one sister grace i suppose she is in the city here with you no sir i left her in the country i am here alone i will ask you more about yourself after dinner if you have no engagement i should like to have you stay with me a part of the evening thank you sir frank accepted the invitation though he knew jasper would wonder what had become of him he saw that the old gentleman was kindly disposed toward him and in his present circumstances he needed such a friend but in proportion as mr wharton became more cordial mrs bradley became more frosty until at last the old gentleman noticed her manner dont you feel well this evening mrs bradley he asked i have a little headache said the housekeeper coldly you had better do something for it it will pass away of itself sir they arose from the dinner table and mr wharton followed by frank ascended the staircase to the front room on the second floor which was handsomely fitted up as a library what makes him take such notice of a mere cashboy said mrs bradley to herself that boy reminds me of somebody who is it chapter viii an unexpected engagement take a seat frank said mr wharton pointing to a luxurious armchair on one side of the cheerful grate fire i will take the other and you shall tell me all about yourself thank you sir said our hero his confidence was won by mr whartons kind tone and he briefly recounted his story at the conclusion mr wharton said how old are you frank fourteen sir you are a brave boy and a good boy and you deserve success thank you sir but i am bound to say that you have a hard task before you i know it sir why not let your sister go to the poorhouse for a few years till you are older and better able to provide for her i should be ashamed to do it sir he said i promised my mother to take care of grace and i will how much do you earn as a cashboy three dollars a week only three dollars a week why that wont pay your own expenses said the old gentleman in surprise yes sir it does i pay fifty cents a week for my room and my meals dont cost me much but you will want clothes i have enough for the present and i am laying up fifty cents a week to buy more when i need them you cant buy many for twentysix dollars a year but that doesnt allow anything for your sisters expenses that is what puzzles me sir said frank fixing a troubled glance upon the fire i shall have to work in the evenings for grace what can you do i could copy but i suppose there isnt much chance of getting copying to do then you have a good handwriting pretty fair sir let me see a specimen there are pen and ink on the table and here is a sheet of paper frank seated himself at the table and wrote his name on the paper very good said his host approvingly your hand is good enough for a copyist but you are correct in supposing that work of that kind is hard to get are you a good reader do you mean in reading aloud sir yes i will try if you wish take a book from the table any book and let me hear you read frank opened the first book that came to hand one of irvings and read in a clear unembarrassed voice about half a page very good indeed said mr wharton you have been well taught where did you attend school only in the town school sir you have at any rate made good use of your advantages but will it do me any good sir asked frank people are not paid for reading are they not in general but we will suppose the case of a person whose eyes are weak and likely to be badly affected by evening use then suppose such a person could secure the services of a good clear distinct reader dont you think he would be willing to pay something i suppose so do you know of any such person asked frank i am describing myself frank a year since i strained my eyes very severely and have never dared to use them much since by gaslight mrs bradley my housekeeper has read to me some but she has other duties and i dont think she enjoys it very much now why shouldnt i get you to read to me in the evening when you are not otherwise employed i wish you would mr wharton said frank eagerly i would do my best i have no doubt of that but there is another question perhaps you might ask a higher salary than i could afford to pay would a dollar a week be too much asked frank i dont think i could complain of that said mr wharton gravely very well i will engage you as my reader thank you sir but about the pay i have made up my mind to pay you five dollars a week five dollars a week frank repeated it is much more than my services will be worth sir let me judge of that frank i dont know how to thank you sir said frank gratefully i never expected to be so rich i shall have no trouble in paying for graces board and clothes now when do you want me to begin reading to you you may as well begin tonight that is unless you have some other engagement oh no sir i have nothing else to do take the evening post then and read me the leading editorial afterward i will tell you what to read frank had been reading about half an hour when a knock was heard at the door come in said mr wharton mrs bradley entered with a soft quiet step i thought sir she began you might like me to read to you as usual thank you mrs bradley but i am going to relieve you of that portion of your labors my young friend here is to come every evening and read to me indeed ejaculated the housekeeper in a tone of chilly displeasure and a sharp glance at frank which indicated no great amount of cordiality then as i am intruding i will take my leave there was something in her tone that made frank feel uncomfortable chapter ix the housekeepers nephew by no means said mr wharton as the housekeeper was about to withdraw dont imagine you are intruding come in and sit down thank you sir said mrs bradley in a measured tone you are very considerate i am sure but if youll excuse me i wont come in this evening mrs bradley has been with me a good many years explained mr wharton and i dare say she feels a little disturbed at seeing another occupy her place even in a duty like this i am afraid she will be offended with me sir said frank oh no i will explain matters to her go on with your reading frank at halfpast nine mr wharton took out his watch it is getting late he said i have no doubt you are tired and need rest i am not tired sir i believe in going to bed early i shall seldom keep you later than this do you think you can find your way out yes sir when shall i come tomorrow evening a little before eight i will be punctual jasper was waiting for him not wholly without anxiety for it was very unusual for frank to be late well frank he exclaimed this is a pretty time for you to come home i began to think you had got into trouble i was just going around to the nearest station house in search of you i was in quite a different place jasper frank told his story including an account of his engagement so it seems i am to lose your company in the evening i am sorry for that but i am glad you are so lucky it was better than i expected said frank with satisfaction what sort of a man is this mr wharton said jasper he is very kind and generous i am lucky to have so good a friend theres only one thing that is likely to be disagreeable whats that the housekeeper her name is mrs bradley for some reason or other she doesnt want me there what makes you think so her manner and the way she speaks she came in to read to mr wharton last evening and didnt seem to like it because i had been taken in her place she is evidently jealous you must take care not to offend her she might endeavor to have you dismissed i shall always treat her politely but i dont think i can ever like her meanwhile the housekeeper on leaving the library had gone to her own room in dudgeon mr whartons a fool she muttered to herself what possessed him to take this cashboy from the streets invite him to dinner and treat him as an honored guest and finally to engage him as a reader i never heard of anything so ridiculous is this little vagabond to take my place in the old mans good graces ive been slaving and slaving for twenty years and what have i got by it ive laid up two thousand dollars and what is that to provide for my old age if the old man would die and remember me handsomely in his will it would be worth while but this new favorite may stand in my way if he does ill be revenged on him as sure as my name is ulrica bradley here the area bell rang and in a moment one of the housemaids entered mrs bradleys room theres your nephew outside maam and wanting to see you tell him to come in and the housekeepers cold face became softer and pleasanter in aspect as a young man of twenty entered and greeted her carelessly how are you aunt pretty well thomas she answered you havent been here for some time no ive had a lot of work to do nothing but work work all the time he grumbled i wish i was rich you get through at six oclock dont you yes i hope you spend your evenings profitably thomas i aint likely to go on any sprees aunt if thats what you mean i only get twelve dollars a week i should think you might live on it starve you mean whats twelve dollars to a young fellow like me when hes got his board to pay and has to dress like a gentleman you are not in debt i hope thomas said mrs bradley uneasily i owe for the suit i have on and i dont know where im going to get the money to pay for it he was dressed in a flashy style not unlike what is popularly denominated a swell his coarse features were disfigured with unhealthy blotches and his outward appearance was hardly such as to recommend him but to him alone the cold heart of the housekeeper was warm he was her sisters son and her nearest relative her savings were destined for him and in her attachment she was not conscious of his disagreeable characteristics she had occasionally given him a fivedollar bill to eke out what he termed his miserable pay and now whenever he called he didnt spare hints that he was out of pocket and that a further gift would be acceptable indeed the only tie that bound him to his aunt was a mercenary one but the housekeeper sharpsighted as she ordinarily was did not detect the secret motive of such attention she received from her nephew she flattered herself that he really loved her not suspecting that he was too selfish to love anybody but himself thomas she said with a sudden thought i may be able to help you to an increase of your income mr wharton needs somebody to read to him evenings on my recommendation he might take you thank you aunt but i dont see it i dont want to be worked to death but think thomas said his aunt earnestly he is very rich he might take a fancy to you and remember you in his will i wish somebody would remember me in his will do you really think theres any chance of the old boys doing something handsome for me that depends on yourself you must try to please him well i must do something whatll he give i dont know yet in fact theres another reading to him just now then theres no chance for me listen to me its a boy hes picked up in the streets quite unsuited for the place hes a cashboy at gilbert macks why thats where you are she added with sudden recollection a cashboy from my own place whats his name fowler i believe i know him hes lately come how did he get in with the old man mr wharton fell in the street and he happened to be near and helped him home youll have to manage it aunt ill see what i can do tomorrow he ought to prefer my nephew to a strange boy seeing i have been twenty years in his service ill let you know as soon as i have accomplished anything i dont half like the idea of giving up my evenings i dont believe i can stand it it is only for a little while to get him interested in you maybe i might try it a week and then tell him my health was failing and get him to do something else for me at any rate the first thing must be to become acquainted thomas now withdrew for he did not enjoy spending an evening with his aunt the richer by five dollars half of which was spent before the evening closed at a neighboring billiard saloon chapter x the housekeeper scheming if mrs bradley had been wiser she would have felt less confident of her nephews producing a favorable impression upon mr wharton she resolved to open the subject at the breakfast table i didnt know mr wharton she commenced that you intended to engage a reader nor did i propose to do so until last evening i think youll excuse me for saying so that you will find that boy too young to suit you i dont think so he reads very clearly and distinctly if i had known you thought of engaging a reader i would have asked you to engage my nephew indeed i was not aware that you had a nephew in the city is he a boy no he is a young man he was twenty years old last june is he unfavorably situated he has a place as salesman with what firm gilbert mack why that is the same firm that employs my young friend it is a good firm perhaps it is but my poor nephew receives a very small salary he finds it very hard to get along your nephew is young he will be promoted if he serves his employers well thomas would have been glad to read to you in the evening sir said mrs bradley commencing the attack but for my present engagement i might have taken him said mr wharton politely have you engaged that boy for any length of time no but it is understood that he will stay while i need him and he continues to suit me i have a favorable opinion of him besides he needs the pay he receives but three dollars a week as a cashboy and has a sister to support as well as himself i am sorry she said in an injured tone i hope youll excuse my mentioning it but i took the liberty having been for twenty years in your employ to be sure you were quite right said her employer kindly perhaps i may be able to do something for your nephew though not that tell him to come and see me some time thank you sir said the housekeeper there was one question she wanted to determine and that was the amount of compensation received by frank she did not like to inquire directly from mr wharton but resolved to gain the information from our hero some evenings later she had the opportunity mr wharton had an engagement and asked her to tell frank when he arrived that he was released from duty instead of this she received him in the library herself probably mr wharton will not be at home this evening she said if he does not return in half an hour you need not wait she took up her work seated in mr whartons usual place and frank remained ready for duty mr wharton tells me you have a sister she said yes maam you must find it hard work to provide for her as well as yourself i do or rather i did till i came here how much does mr wharton pay you she asked in an indifferent tone five dollars a week answered frank you are lucky that you have such a chance she said yes maam it is more than i earn i know but it is a great help to me and how much do you get as cashboy three dollars a week so you actually receive nearly twice as much for a couple of hours in the evening as for the whole day yes maam what a pity thomas cant have this chance she thought when it was nine oclock she said you need not wait any longer mr wharton will not be home in time to hear you read goodevening mrs bradley said frank goodevening she responded coldly that boy is in the way she said to herself when she was left alone he is in my way and toms way i can see that he is artfully intriguing for mr whartons favor but i must checkmate him its odd she resumed after a pause but there is something in his face and voice that seems familiar to me what is it the following evening the housekeeper received another visit from her nephew how do aunt said thomas bradley carelessly as he entered the housekeepers room very well thank you thomas i am glad you are here i have been wanting to see you the old man isnt going to do anything for me is he how can you expect it so soon he doesnt know you yet how much do you think he pays the cashboy that reads to him in the evening i dont know five dollars a week i wouldnt give up my evenings for that he said it isnt so much the pay thomas though that would be a help he might take a fancy to you that might pay better when are you going to introduce me this evening that is i will ask mr wharton if he will see you mrs bradley entered the library where frank was engaged in reading aloud excuse my interruption she said but my nephew has just called and i should like to introduce him to you if you will kindly receive him certainly mrs bradley said mr wharton bring him in the housekeeper left the room but speedily reappeared followed by her nephew who seemed a little abashed my nephew thomas bradley mr wharton said his aunt by way of introduction you have often heard me speak of mr wharton thomas how do you do sir said thomas awkwardly pray take a seat mr bradley your aunt has been long a member of my family i am glad to see a nephew of hers i believe you are a salesman at gilbert macks yes sir then you must know my young friend here pointing to frank how are you cash said thomas laughing under the impression that he had said something smart very well mr bradley answered frank quietly you see thats all the name we call em in the store said thomas mr wharton could not help thinking how poorly this young man compares with my young friend still as he is mrs bradleys nephew i must be polite to him are there many cashboys in your establishment mr bradley about a dozen aint there fowler i believe so mr bradley gilbert mack do a good business i should judge yes they do but that doesnt do us poor salesmen much good we get just enough to keep soul and body together i am sorry to hear it said mr wharton why sir said thomas gaining confidence all they pay me is twelve dollars a week how can they expect a fellow to live on that i began my career about your age said mr wharton or perhaps a little younger and had to live on but six dollars a week didnt you come near starving he asked on the contrary i saved a little every week i cant said thomas a little discomfited why it takes half that to dress decently mr wharton glanced quietly at the rather loud and flashy dress worn by his visitor but only said a small salary of course makes economy necessary but when a fellow knows he earns a good deal more than he gets he doesnt feel like starving himself just that his employers may grow rich of course if he can better himself they cannot object thats just what i want to do said thomas but i expect i need influence to help me to something better thats a good hint thought he i was telling thomas said the housekeeper that you had kindly expressed a desire to be of service to him i am not now in active business said mr wharton and of course have not the opportunities i formerly had for helping young men but i will bear your case in mind mr bradley thank you sir said thomas i am sure i earn a thousand dollars a year i think thomas said mrs bradley we wont intrude on mr wharton longer this evening when he finds something for you he will tell me all right aunt goodnight mr wharton goodnight cash said thomas chuckling anew at the old joke well aunt said he when they were once more in the housekeepers room do you think the old gentleman will do anything for me i hope so but i am not sure thomas whether you were not too familiar you spoke of money too quick its my way to come to business i wish you were his reader instead of that boy well i dont i wouldnt want to he mewed up in that room with the old man every night i should get tired to death of it you would have a chance to get him interested in you that boy is artful he is doing all he can to win mr whartons favor he is the one you have most reason to dread do you think he will do me any harm i think he will injure your chances egad if i thought that id wring the young rascals neck theres a better way thomas whats that cant you get him dismissed from gilbert macks i havent enough influence with the firm suppose they thought him dishonest theyd give him the sack of course cant you make them think so thomas i dont know then make it your business to find out i suppose you know what good its going to do aunt but i dont hes got his place here with the old man if mr wharton hears that he is discharged and has lost his situation he will probably discharge him too perhaps so i suppose you know best do as i tell you and i will manage the rest all right i need your help enough tonight for instance im regularly cleaned out havent got but twentyfive cents to my name it seems to me thomas said his aunt with a troubled look you are always out of money ill give you five dollars thomas but you must remember that i am not made of money my wages are small you ought to have a good nestegg laid aside aunt ive got something thomas and when i die itll be yours i hope i shant have to wait too long thought thomas but he did not give utterance to the thought come again thomas and dont forget what i have said said mrs bradley chapter xi john wade a tall man with a sallow complexion and heavilybearded face stood on the deck of a cunard steamer only a few miles distant from new york harbor its three years since i have seen america he said to himself thoughtfully i suppose i ought to feel a patriotic fervor about setting foot once more on my native shore but i dont believe in nonsense i would be content to live in europe all my life if my uncles fortune were once in my possession i am his sole heir but he persists in holding on to his money bags and limits me to a paltry three thousand a year i must see if i cant induce him to give me a good round sum on account fifty thousand at least and then i can wait a little more patiently till he drops off when shall we reach port captain he asked as he passed that officer in four hours i think mr wade so this is my birthday he said to himself thirty five years old today half my life gone and i am still a dependent on my uncles bounty suppose he should throw me off leave me out in the cold where should i be if he should find the boy but no there is no chance of that i have taken good care of that by the way i must look him up soon cautiously of course and see what has become of him he will grow up a laborer or mechanic and die without a knowledge of his birth while i fill his place and enjoy his inheritance at six oclock the vessel reached the quarantine most of the passengers decided to remain on board one night more but john wade was impatient and leaving his trunks obtained a small boat and soon touched the shore it was nearly eight when john wade landed in the city it was halfpast eight when he stood on the steps of his uncles residence and rang the bell is my uncle is mr wharton at home he asked of the servant who answered the bell yes sir i am his nephew just arrived from europe let him know that i am here and would like to see him the servant who had never before seen him having only been six months in the house regarded him with a great deal of curiosity and then went to do his biddng my nephew arrived exclaimed mr wharton in surprise why he never let me know he was coming will you see him sir to be sure bring him in at once my dear uncle exclaimed john wade with effusion for he was a polite man and could act when it suited his interests to do so i am glad to see you how is your health i am getting older every day john you dont look a day older sir said john who did not believe what he said for he could plainly see that his uncle had grown older since he last saw him you think so john but i feel it your coming is a surprise you did not write that you intended sailing i formed the determination very suddenly sir were you tired of europe no but i wanted to see you sir thank you john said his uncle pressing his nephews hand i am glad you think so much of me did you have a pleasant voyage rather rough sir you have had no supper of course if you will ring the bell the housekeeper will see that some is got ready for you is mrs bradley still in your employ uncle yes john i am so used to her that i shouldnt know how to get along without her hitherto john wade had been so occupied with his uncle that he had not observed frank but at this moment our hero coughed involuntarily and john wade looked at him he seemed to be singularly affected he started perceptibly and his sallow face blanched as his eager eyes were fixed on the boys face good heavens he muttered to himself who is that boy how comes he here frank noticed his intent gaze and wondered at it but mr whartons eyesight was defective and he did not perceive his nephews excitement i see you have a young visitor uncle said john wade oh yes said mr wharton with a kindly smile he spends all his evenings with me what do you mean sir demanded john wade with sudden suspicion and fear he seems very young company for for a man of my years said mr wharton finishing the sentence you are right john but you see my eyes are weak and i cannot use them for reading in the evening so it occurred to me to engage a reader very true said his nephew he wished to inquire the name of the boy whose appearance had so powerfully impressed him but he determined not to do so at present what information he sought he preferred to obtain from the housekeeper he seemed surprised as if he had seen me some where before and recognized me thought frank but i dont remember him if i had seen his face before i think i should remember it dont come out uncle said john wade when summoned to tea by the housekeeper mrs bradley and i are going to have a chat by ourselves and i will soon return you are looking thin mr john said mrs bradley am i thinner than usual i never was very corpulent you know how is my uncles health he says he is well he is pretty well but he isnt as young as he was i think he looks older said john but that is not surprising at his age he is seventy isnt he not quite he is sixtynine his father died at seventyone yes but that is no reason why my uncle should not live till eighty i hope he will we all hope so said the housekeeper but she knew while she spoke that if as she supposed mr whartons will contained a generous legacy for her his death would not afflict her much she suspected also that john wade was waiting impatiently for his uncles death that he might enter upon his inheritance still their little social fictions must be kept up and so both expressed a desire for his continued life though neither was deceived as to the others real feeling on the subject by the way mrs bradley said john wade how came my uncle to engage that boy to read to him he was led into it sir said the housekeeper with a great deal of indignation by the boy himself hes an artful and designing fellow you may rely upon it whats his name frank fowler fowler is his name fowler he repeated with a startled expression yes sir answered the housekeeper rather surprised at his manner you dont know anything about him do you oh no said john wade recovering his composure he is a perfect stranger to me but i once knew a man of that name and a precious rascal he was when you mentioned his name i thought he might be a son of this man does he say his father is alive no he is dead and his mother too so the boy says you havent told me how my uncle fell in with him it was an accident your uncle fell in getting out of a broadway stage and this boy happened to be near and seeing mr wharton was a rich gentleman he helped him home and was invited in then he told some story about his poverty and so worked upon your uncles feelings that he hired him to read to him at five dollars a week is this all the boy does no he is cashboy in a large store on broadway he is employed there all day and he is here only in the evenings does my uncle seem attached to him asked john hes getting fond of him i should say the other day he asked me if i didnt think it would be a good thing to take him into the house and give him a room i suppose the boy put it into his head no doubt what did you say i opposed it i told him that a boy would be a great deal of trouble in the family you did right mrs bradley what did my uncle say he hinted about taking him from the store and letting him go to school the next thing would be his adopting him the fact is mr john the boy is so artful that he knows just how to manage your uncle no doubt he put the idea into mr whartons head and he may do it yet does my uncle give any reason for the fancy he has taken to the boy demanded john yes said the housekeeper he has taken it into his head that the boy resembles your cousin george who died abroad you were with him i believe yes i was with him is the resemblance strong i took very little notice of him you can look for yourself when you go back answered the housekeeper what else did my uncle say tell me all he said what would i give mrs bradley if i had such a grandson if georges boy had lived he would have been about franks age and continued the housekeeper i might as well speak plainly youre my masters heir or ought to be but if this artful boy stays here long theres no knowing what your uncle may be influenced to do if he gets into his dotage he may come to adopt him and leave the property away from you i believe you are quite right the danger exists and we must guard against it i see you dont like the boy said john wade no i dont hes separated your uncle and me before he came i used to spend my evenings in the library and read to your uncle besides when i found your uncle wanted a reader i asked him to take my nephew who is a salesman in the very same store where that boy is a cashboy but although ive been twenty years in this house i could not get him to grant the favor which he granted to that boy whom he never met till a few weeks ago mrs bradley i sympathize with you said her companion the boy is evidently working against us both you have been twenty years in my uncles service he ought to remember you handsomely in his will if i inherit the property as is my right your services shall be remembered said john wade thank you mr john said the gratified housekeeper that secures her help thought john in his turn she will now work hard for me when the time comes i can do as much or as little for her as i please of course we must work together against this interloper who appears to have gained a dangerous influence over my uncle you can depend upon me mr john said mrs bradley i will think it over and tell you my plan said john wade but my uncle will wonder at my appetite i must go back to the library we will speak of this subject again chapter xii a false friend when john wade reentered the library frank was reading but mr wharton stopped him that will do frank he said as i have not seen my nephew for a long time i shall not require you to read any longer you can go if you like frank bowed and bidding the two goodevening left the room that is an excellent boy john said the old gentleman as the door closed upon our hero how did you fall in with him asked john mr wharton told the story with which the reader is already familiar you dont know anything of his antecedents i suppose said john carelessly only what he told me his father and mother are dead and he is obliged to support himself and his sister did you notice anything familiar in franks expression asked mr wharton i dont know i didnt observe him very closely whenever i look at frank i think of george i suppose that is why i have felt more closely drawn to the boy i proposed to mrs bradley that the boy should have a room here but she did not favor it i think she is prejudiced against him probably she is afraid he would be some trouble replied john if georges boy had lived he would be about franks age it would have been a great comfort to me to superintend his education and watch him grow up i could not have wished him to be more gentlemanly or promising than my young reader decidedly that boy is in my way said john wade to himself i must manage to get rid of him and that speedily or my infatuated uncle will be adopting him of what disease did georges boy die john asked mr wharton a sudden fever i wish i could have seen him before he died but i returned only to find both son and grandson gone i had only the sad satisfaction of seeing his grave yes he was buried in the family lot at greenwood five days before you reached home when i see men of my own age surrounded by children and grandchildren it makes me almost envious said mr wharton sadly i declare to you john since that boy has been with me i have felt happier and more cheerful than for years that boy again muttered john to himself i begin to hate the young cub but i mustnt show it my first work will be to separate him from my uncle that will require consideration i wonder whether the boy knows that he is not fowlers son i must find out if he does and should happen to mention it in my uncles presence it might awaken suspicions in his mind i must interview the boy and find out what i can to enlist his confidence i must assume a friendly manner in furtherance of this determination john wade greeted our hero very cordially the next evening when they met a little to franks surprise when the reading terminated john wade said carelessly i believe uncle i will go out for a walk i think i shall be better for it ln what direction are you going frank down sixth avenue sir very good i will walk along with you frank and his companion walked toward sixth avenue my uncle tells me you have a sister to support said wade opening the conversation yes sir does your sister resemble you asked john wade no sir but that is not surprising for why is it not surprising frank hesitated you were about to assign some reason it is a secret said our hero slowly that is has been a secret but i dont know why i should conceal it grace is not my sister she is mrs fowlers daughter but i am not her son i will tell you the story that story frank told as briefly as possible john wade listened to it with secret alarm it is a strange story he said do you not feel a strong desire to learn your true parentage yes sir i dont know but i feel as if i should some day meet the man who gave me into mrs fowlers charge you have met him but it is lucky you dont suspect it thought john wade i am glad you told me this story said he aloud it is quite romantic i may be able to help you in your search but let me advise you to tell no one else at present no doubt there are parties interested in keeping the secret of your birth from you you must move cautiously and your chance of solving the mystery will be improved thank you sir i will follow your advice i was mistaken in him thought frank i disliked him at first but he seems inclined to be my friend when frank reached his lodging he found jasper waiting up for him he looked thoughtful so much so that frank noticed it you look as if you had something on your mind jasper you have guessed right i have read that letter he drew from his pocket a letter which frank took from his hands it is from an uncle of mine in ohio who is proprietor of a weekly newspaper he is getting old and finds the work too much for him he offers me a thousand dollars a year if i will come out and relieve him thats a good offer jasper i suppose you will accept it it is for my interest to do so probably my uncle will after a while surrender the whole establishment to me i shall be sorry to part with you jasper it will seem very lonely but i think you ought to go it is a good chance and if you refuse it you may not get such another my uncle wants me to come on at once i think i will start monday jasper saw no reason to change his determination and on monday morning he started on his journey to ohio thus at a critical moment in his fortunes when two persons were planning to injure him he lost the presence and help of a valued friend chapter xiii the spider and the fly uncle said john wade you spoke of inviting frank fowler to occupy a room in the house why dont you do it it would be more convenient to you and a very good chance for him i should like it said mr wharton but mrs bradley did not seem to regard it favorably when i suggested it oh mrs bradley is unused to boys and she is afraid he would give her trouble ill undertake to bring her around i wish you would john i dont think frank would give any trouble and it would enliven the house to have a boy here besides he reminds me of george as i told you the other day i agree with you uncle he said he does remind me a little of george well mrs bradley what do you think i have done asked john entering the housekeepers room directly after his interview with his uncle i dont know mr john she answered i have asked him to give that boy a room in the house are you carried away with him as well as your uncle not quite the fact is i have a motive in what i am doing ill tell you he bent over and whispered in her ear i never should have thought of that you see our purpose is to convince my uncle that he is unworthy of his favor at present that would be rather difficult but once get him into the house and we shall have no trouble i understand in due time john wade announced to his uncle that the housekeeper had withdrawn her objections to his plan then ill tell him tonight said mr wharton brightening up shortly after frank entered the library that evening mr wharton made the proposal you are very kind mr wharton he said i never thought of such a thing then it is settled that you are to come you can choose your own time for coming i will come tomorrow sir very well said mr wharton with satisfaction the next day by special favor frank got off from the store two hours earlier than usual he bought at a sixth avenue basement store a small second hand trunk for two dollars he packed his scanty wardrobe into the trunk which small as it was he was unable to fill and had it carried to mr whartons house he asked to see mrs bradley and she came to the door i am glad to see you she said graciously you may leave your trunk in the hall and i will have it carried up by the servants thank you said frank and he followed the housekeeper up the handsome staircase this is to be your room said the housekeeper opening the door of a small chamber on the third floor it looks very nice and comfortable said frank looking about him with satisfaction she left the room and five minutes later our heros modest trunk was brought up and deposited in the room that evening frank read to mr wharton as usual when nine oclock came he said you need not read aloud any more but if you see any books in my library which you would like to read to yourself you may do so in fact frank you must consider yourself one of the family and act as freely as if you were at home how kind you are to me mr wharton said frank the next morning after frank had left the house for his daily task john wade entered the housekeepers room the boy is out of the way now mrs bradley he said you had better see if you have a key that will unlock his trunk the two conspirators went upstairs and together entered franks room mrs bradley brought out a large bunch of keys and successively tried them but one after another failed to open it thats awkward said john wade i have a few keys in my pocket one may possibly answer the housekeeper kneeled down and made a trial of john wades keys the last one was successful the cover was lifted and the contents were disclosed however neither john nor mrs bradley seemed particularly interested in the articles for after turning them over they locked the trunk once more so far so good said john wade we have found the means of opening the trunk when we please when do you expect to carry out your plan mr john two weeks from this time my uncle is obliged to go to washington for a few days on business while he is gone we will spring the trap and when he comes back he will find the boy gone in disgrace well make short work of him chapter xiv springing the trap i am going to give you a few days vacation frank said mr wharton a fortnight later i am called to washington on business however you have got to feel at home here now oh yes sir and mrs bradley will see that you are comfortable i am sure of that sir said frank politely when frank returned at night mr wharton was already gone john wade and the housekeeper seated themselves in the library after dinner and by their invitation our hero joined them by the way frank said john wade did i ever show you this russia leather pocketbook producing one from his pocket no sir i believe not i bought it at vienna which is noted for its articles of russia leather it is very handsome sir so i think by the way you may like to look at my sleevebuttons they are of venetian mosaic i got them myself in venice last year they are very elegant you must have enjoyed visiting so many famous cities yes it is very interesting john wade took up the evening paper and frank occupied himself with a book from his patrons library after a while john threw down the paper yawning and said that he had an engagement nothing else occurred that evening which merits record two days later frank returned home in his usual spirits but at the table he was struck by a singular change in the manner of mrs bradley and john wade they spoke to him only on what it was absolutely necessary and answered his questions in monosyllables will you step into the library a moment said john wade as they arose from the table frank followed john into the library and mrs bradley entered also frank fowler the enemy began do you remember my showing you two evenings since a pocketbook also some sleevebuttons of venetian mosaic expensively mounted in gold certainly sir that pocketbook contained a considerable sum of money pursued his questioner i dont know anything about that you probably supposed so will you tell me what you mean mr wade demanded frank impatiently i have answered your questions but i cant understand why you ask them perhaps you may suspect said wade sarcastically it looks as if you had lost them and suspected me of taking them so it appears you are entirely mistaken mr wade i am not a thief i never stole anything in my life it is very easy to say that sneered john wade you and mrs bradley were the only persons present when i showed the articles and i suppose you wont pretend that she stole them no sir though she appears to agree with you that i am a thief i never thought of accusing her replied frank mr wade said the housekeeper i feel that it is my duty to insist upon search being made in my room do you make the same offer asked john wade turning to frank yes sir answered our hero proudly i wish you to satisfy yourself that i am not a thief if you will come to my room at once mr wade you and mrs bradley i will hand you the key of my trunk the two followed him upstairs exulting wickedly in his discomfiture which they had reason to forsee he handed his key to his artful enemy and the latter bending over opened the trunk which contained all our heros small possessions he raised the pile of clothes and to franks dismay disclosed the missing pocketbook and sleevebuttons in the bottom of the trunk what have you got to say for yourself now you young villain demanded john wade in a loud voice i dont understand it frank said in a troubled tone i dont know how the things came there i didnt put them there probably they crept in themselves sneered john someone put them there said frank pale but resolute some wicked person who wanted to get me into trouble what do you mean by that you young vagabond demanded john wade suspiciously i mean what i say he asserted i am away all day and nothing is easier than to open my trunk and put articles in in order to throw suspicion on me look here you rascal said john wade roughly i shall treat you better than you deserve i wont give you over to the police out of regard for my uncle but you must leave this house and never set foot in it again it will be the worse for you if you do john wade and the housekeeper left the room and our hero was left to realize the misfortune which had overwhelmed him frank arose at an early hour the next morning and left the house it was necessary for him to find a new home at once in order to be at the store in time he bought a copy of the sun and turned to the advertising columns he saw a cheap room advertised near the one he had formerly occupied finding his way there he rang the bell the door was opened by a slatternlylooking woman who looked as if she had just got up i see by the sun you have a room to let said frank yes do you want to see it now i should like to come upstairs and i will show you the room the room proved to be small and by no means neat in appearance but the rent was only a dollar and a quarter a week and frank felt that he could not afford to be particular so he quick closed the bargain the next day about eleven oclock in the forenoon he was surprised at seeing mrs bradley enter the store and thread her way to that part of the counter where her nephew was stationed she darted one quick look at him but gave him no sign of recognition his heart sank within him for he had a presentiment that her visit boded fresh evil for him chapter xv from bad to worse franks misgivings were not without good cause the housekeepers call at the store was connected with him how will be understood from a conversation which took place that morning between her and john wade its a relief to get that boy out of the house mrs bradley he said at the breakfast table that it is mr john she replied but hell be trying to get back take my word for it he wont dare to said john wade incredulously i told him if he came near the house i would give him up to the police i am afraid he will write to your uncle hes bold enough for anything i didnt think of that said john thoughtfully do you know his handwriting mrs bradley i think i should know it then if any letters come which you know to be from him keep them back from my uncle what shall i do with them give them to me i dont want my uncle worried by his appeals your uncle seems to be very attached to him he may go to the store to see him that is true i should not like that how shall we prevent it thats the question if gilbert mack knew that he was not honest they would discharge him exactly said john wade and as probably he would be unable to get another situation he would be compelled to leave the city and we should get rid of him i commend your shrewdness mrs bradley your plan is most excellent john wade had more reasons than the housekeeper knew of for desiring the removal of our young hero from the city reasons which the reader has probably guessed there was a dark secret in his life connected with a wrong done in years past from which he hoped some day to reap personal benefit unconsciously frank fowler stood in his way and must be removed such was his determination i am going out this morning said the housekeeper i will make it in my way to call at gilbert macks my nephew is a salesman there as i have told you i will drop a word in his ear and that will be enough to settle that boys hash your language is professional mrs bradley said john wade laughing but you shouldnt allude to hash in an aristocratic household i shall be glad to have you carry out your plan i hope youll speak to your uncle about my nephew mr john he gets very poor pay where he is i wont forget him said john carelessly in his heart he thought thomas bradley a very low obtrusive fellow whom he felt by no means inclined to assist but it was cheap to make promises the reader understands now why mrs bradley made a morning call at gilbert macks store she knew at what part of the counter her nephew was stationed and made her way thither at once he did not at first recognize her until she said goodmorning thomas goodmorning aunt what brings you here this morning any good news for me has the old gentleman come around and concluded to do something handsome mr wharton is not in the city he has gone to washington but that isnt what i came about this morning you remember that boy who has been reading to mr wharton one of our cashboys yes there he is just gone by well he has stolen mr johns pocketbook and some jewelry belonging to him what have you done about it what does mr wharton say hes away from home he doesnt know yet mr john gave him a lecture and ordered him to leave the house does he admit that he took the things no he denied it as bold as brass but it didnt do him any good there were the things in his trunk he couldnt get over that thomas fastened a shrewd glance on his aunts face for he suspected the truth so youve got rid of him he said what do you propose to do next mr john thinks your employer ought to know that he is a thief are you going to tell them i want you to do it you must tell them yourself aunt i shant then introduce me to mr gilbert thomas and ill do it follow me aunt he led his aunt to the rear of the store where mr gilbert was standing mr gilbert he said allow me to introduce my aunt mrs bradley the housekeeper was courteously received and invited to be seated she soon opened her business and blackened poor franks character as she had intended really mrs bradley i am sorry to hear this said mr gilbert you think there is no doubt of the boys guilt i am sorry to say that i have no doubt at all said the housekeeper hypocritically mr mack and myself have had a very good opinion of him he is faithful and prompt of course sir you will retain him in your employ if you are willing to take the risk but i thought it my duty to put you on your guard i am obliged to you mrs bradley though as i said i regret to find that my confidence in the boy has been misplaced late in the afternoon frank was called to the cashiers desk i am directed by mr gilbert to say that your services will not be required after today he said here are the weeks wages why am i discharged what have i done demanded frank while his heart sank within him i dont know you must ask mr gilbert answered the cashier i will speak to him at any rate and frank walked up to the senior partner and addressed to him the same question can you not guess asked mr gilbert sternly i can guess that a false accusation has been brought against me said frank a respectable lady has informed me that you are not honest i regret it for i have been pleased with your diligence of course i cannot retain you in my employ mr gilbert said frank earnestly the charge is false mrs bradley is my enemy and wishes me harm i dont understand how the things came into my trunk but i didnt put them there i hope you are innocent but i must discharge you business is dull now and i had decided to part with four of my cashboys i wont pass judgment upon you but you must go frank bowed in silence for he saw that further entreaty would be vain and left the store more dispirited than at any moment since he had been in the city ten days frank spent in fruitless efforts to obtain a place all this time his money steadily diminished he perceived that he would soon be penniless evidently something must be done he formed two determinations the first was to write to mr wharton who he thought must now have returned from washington asserting his innocence and appealing to him to see gilbert mack and reestablish him in their confidence the second was since he could not obtain a regular place to frequent the wharves and seek chances to carry bundles in this way he might earn enough with great economy to pay for his board and lodging one morning the housekeeper entered the library where john wade sat reading the daily papers mr john she said holding out a letter here is a letter from that boy i expected he would write to your uncle john wade deliberately opened the letter sit down mrs bradley and i will read the letter aloud it will be only necessary to quote the concluding sentences i hope mr wharton you will not be influenced against me by what mrs bradley and your nephew say i dont know why it is but they are my enemies though i have always treated them with respect i am afraid they have a desire to injure me in your estimation if they had not been they would have been content with driving me from your house without also slandering me to my employers and inducing them to discharge me since i was discharged i have tried very hard to get another place but as i cannot bring a recommendation from gilbert mack i have everywhere been refused i ask you mr wharton to consider my situation already my small supply of money is nearly gone and i do not know how i am to pay my expenses if it was any fault of mine that had brought me into this situation i would not complain but it seems hard to suffer when i am innocent i do not ask to return to your house mr wharton for it would not be pleasant since your nephew and mrs bradley dislike me but i have a right to ask that the truth may be told to my employers so that if they do not wish me to return to their service they may at least be willing to give me a recommendation that will give me a place elsewhere i must prevent the boy communicating with my uncle if it is a possible thing strike while the iron is hot i say i think that is very judicious mr john i have no doubt you will know how to manage matters john wade dressed himself for a walk and drawing out a cigar descended the steps of his uncles house into the street he reached fifth avenue and walked slowly downtown he was about opposite twentyeighth street when he came face to face with the subject of his thoughts where are you going john wade demanded sternly i dont know that i am bound to answer your question answered frank quietly but i have no objection i am going to thirtyninth street with this bundle hark you boy i have something to say to you continued john wade harshly you have had the impudence to write to my uncle what did he say nothing that you would like to hear he looks upon you as a thief you have slandered me to him mr wade he said angrily you might be in better business than accusingly a poor boy falsely hark you young man i have had enough of your impudence i will give you a bit of advice which you will do well to follow leave this city for a place where you are not known or i may feel disposed to shut you up on a charge of theft i shall not leave the city mr wade returned frank firmly i shall stay here in spite of you and without waiting for an answer he walked on chapter xvi an accomplice found no sooner had john wade parted from our hero than he saw approaching him a dark sinisterlooking man whom he had known years before goodmorning mr wade said the newcomer goodmorning mr graves are you busy just now no sir i am out of employment i have been unfortunate then i will give you a job do you see that boy said john wade rapidly yes i see him i want you to follow him find out where he lives and let me know this evening do you understand i understand you may rely upon me sir answered nathan graves and quickening his pace he soon came within a hundred feet of our hero after fulfilling his errand frank walked downtown again but did not succeed in obtaining any further employment wherever he went he was followed by graves unconsciously he exhausted the patience of that gentleman who got heartily tired of his tramp about the streets but the longest day will come to an end and at last he had the satisfaction of tracking frank to his humble lodging then and not till then he felt justified in leaving him nathan graves sought the residence of john wade he rang the bell as the clock struck eight well what success asked wade when they met i have tracked the boy what more can i do for you asked graves i want to get him away from the city the fact is i may as well tell you my uncle has taken a great fancy to the boy and might be induced to adopt him and cut me off from my rightful inheritance the boy is an artful young rascal and has been doing all he could to get into the good graces of my uncle who is old and weakminded it was nine oclock when nathan graves left the house john wade himself accompanying him to the door how soon do you think you can carry out my instructions asked wade tomorrow if possible the sooner the better it is lucky i fell in with him said nathan graves to himself with satisfaction as he slowly walked down fifth avenue its a queer business but thats none of my business the main thing for me to consider is that it brings money to my purse and of that i have need enough graves left the house richer by a hundred dollars than he entered it it was eleven oclock on the forenoon of the next day when frank walked up canal street toward broadway he had been down to the wharves since early in the morning seeking for employment he had offered his services to many but as yet had been unable to secure a job as he was walking along a man addressed him will you be kind enough to direct me to broadway it was nathan graves with whom frank was destined to have some unpleasant experiences straight ahead answered frank i am going there and will show you if you like thank you i wish you would i live only fifteen or twenty miles distant said graves but i dont often come to the city and am not much acquainted i keep a drygoods store but my partner generally comes here to buy goods by the way perhaps you can help me about the errand that calls me here today i will sir if i can said frank politely my youngest clerk has just left me and i want to find a successor a boy about your age say do you know any one who would like such a position i am out of employment myself just now do you think i will suit i think you will said mr graves you wont object to go into the country no sir i will give you five dollars a week and your board for the present if you suit me your pay will be raised at the end of six months will that be satisfactory asked his companion quite so sir when do you wish me to come can you go out with me this afternoon yes sir i only want to go home and pack up my trunk to save time i will go with you and we will start as soon as possible nathan graves accompanied frank to his room where his scanty wardrobe was soon packed a hack was called and they were speedily on their way to the cortland street ferry they crossed the ferry and mr graves purchased two tickets to elizabeth he bought a paper and occupied himself in reading frank felt that fortune had begun to shine upon him once more by and by he could send for grace and get her boarded near him as soon as his wages were raised he determined to do this while engaged in these pleasant speculations they reached the station we get out here said mr graves is your store in this place asked frank no it is in the next town nathan graves looked about him for a conveyance he finally drove a bargain with a man driving a shabbylooking vehicle and the two took their seats they were driven about six miles through a flat unpicturesque country when they reached a branch road leading away from the main one it was a narrow road and apparently not much frequented frank could see no houses on either side is your store on this road he asked oh no but i am not going to the store yet we will go to my house and leave your trunk at length the wagon stopped by graves orders in front of a gate hanging loosely by one hinge well get out here said graves frank looked with some curiosity and some disappointment at his future home it was a square unpainted house discolored by time and looked far from attractive there were no outward signs of occupation and everything about it appeared to have fallen into decay not far off was a barn looking even more dilapidated than the house at the front door instead of knocking there was no bell graves drew a rusty key from his pocket and inserted it in the lock they found themselves in a small entry uncarpeted and dingy well go upstairs said graves arrived on the landing he threw open a door and ushered in our hero this will be your room he said frank looked around in dismay it was a large square room uncarpeted and containing only a bed two chairs and a washstand all of the cheapest and rudest manufacture i hope you will soon feel at home here said graves ill go down and see if i can find something to eat he went out locking the door behind him what does this mean thought frank with a strange sensation chapter xvii frank and his jailer it was twenty minutes before frank waiting impatiently heard the steps of his late companion ascending the stairs but the door was not unlocked instead a slide was revealed about eight inches square through which his late traveling companion pushed a plate of cold meat and bread heres something to eat he said take it why do you lock me in demanded our hero you can get along without knowing i suppose said the other with a sneer i dont mean to said frank firmly i demand an explanation how long do you intend to keep me here i am sorry i cant gratify your curiosity but i dont know myself perhaps you think that i am rich but i am not i have no money you cant get anything out of me said frank that may be so but i shall keep you i suppose that was all a lie about your keeping store it was a pretty little story told for your amusement my dear boy said graves i was afraid you wouldnt come without it you are a villain said frank look here boy said graves in a different tone his face darkening you had better not talk in that way i advise you to eat your dinner and be quiet some supper will be brought to you before night so saying he abruptly closed the slide and descended the stairs leaving frank to his reflections which it may be supposed were not of the pleasantest character frank did not allow his unpleasant situation to take away his appetite and though he was fully determined to make the earliest possible attempt to escape he was sensible enough first to eat the food which his jailer had brought him his lunch dispatched he began at once to revolve plans of escape there were three windows in the room two on the front of the house the other at the side he tried one after another but the result was the same all were so fastened that it was quite impossible to raise them feeling that he could probably escape through one of the windows when he pleased though at the cost of considerable trouble frank did not trouble himself much or allow himself to feel unhappy he decided to continue his explorations in the corner of the room was a door probably admitting to a closet i suppose it is locked thought frank but on trying it he found that such was not the case he looked curiously about him but found little to repay him his attention was drawn however to several darkcolored masks lying upon a shelf he also discovered a small hole in the wall of the size of a marble actuated by curiosity he applied his eye to the opening and peeped into what was probably the adjoining room it was furnished in very much the same way as the one in which he was confined but at present it was untenanted having seen what little there was to be seen frank withdrew from his post of observation and returned to his room it was several hours later when he again heard steps ascending the stairs and the slide in the door was moved he looked toward it but the face that he saw was not that of nathan graves it was the face of a woman chapter xviii over the hill to the poorhouse we are compelled for a time to leave our hero in the hands of his enemies and return to the town of crawford where an event has occurred which influences seriously the happiness and position of his sister grace ever since frank left the town grace had been a welcome member of mr pomeroys family receiving the kindest treatment from all so that she had come to feel very much at home so they lived happily together till one disastrous night a fire broke out which consumed the house and they were forced to snatch their clothes and escape saving nothing else mr pomeroys house was insured for twothirds of its value and he proposed to rebuild immediately but it would be three months at least before the new house would be completed in the interim he succeeded in hiring a couple of rooms for his family but their narrow accommodations would oblige them to dispense with their boarder sorry as mr and mrs pomeroy were to part with her it was obvious that grace must find another home we must let frank know said mr pomeroy and having occasion to go up to the city at once to see about insurance he went to the store of gilbert mack and inquired for prank fowler what was he was asked a cashboy oh he is no longer here mr gilbert discharged him do you know why he was discharged asked mr pomeroy pained and startled no but there stands mr gilbert he can tell you mr pomeroy introduced himself to the head of the firm and repeated his inquiry if you are a friend of the lad said mr gilbert you will be sorry to learn that he was charged with dishonesty it was a very respectable lady who made the charge it is only fair to say that the boy denied it and that personally we found him faithful and trusty but as the dullness of trade compelled us to discharge some of our cashboys we naturally discharged him among the number without however judging his case then sir you have treated the boy very unfairly on the strength of a charge not proved you have dismissed him though personally you had noticed nothing out of the way in him and rendered it impossible for him to obtain another place there is something in what you say i admit perhaps i was too hasty if you will send the boy to me i will take him back on probation thank you sir said mr pomeroy gratefully i will send him here but this mr pomeroy was unable to do he did not know of franks new address and though he was still in the city he failed to find him he returned to crawford and communicated the unsatisfactory intelligence he tried to obtain a new boarding place for grace but no one was willing to take her at two dollars a week especially when mr pomeroy was compelled to admit that frank was now out of employment and it was doubtful if he would be able to keep up the payment tom pinkerton managed to learn that grace was now without a home and mentioned it to his father wont she have to go to the poorhouse now father he asked eagerly yes said deacon pinkerton there is no other place for her that i can see ah im glad said tom maliciously wont that upstarts pride be taken down he was too proud to go to the poorhouse where he belonged but he cant help his sisters going there if he isnt a pauper himself hell be the brother of a pauper and thats the next thing to it that is true said the deacon he was very impudent in return for my kindness still i am sorry for him i am afraid the deacons sorrow was not very deep for he certainly looked unusually cheerful when he harnessed up his horse and drove around to the temporary home of the pomeroys goodmorning mr pomeroy he said seeing the latter in the yard youve met with a severe loss yes deacon it is a severe loss to a poor man like me to be sure well ive called around to relieve you of a part of your cares i am going to take grace fowler to the poorhouse couldnt you get her a place with a private family to help about the house in return for her board while she goes to school theres nobody wants a young girl like her said the deacon her brother would pay part of her board that is when he has a place hasnt he got a place asked the deacon pricking up his ears i heard he was in a store in new york he lost his place said mr pomeroy reluctantly partly because of the dullness of general trade then he cant maintain his sister she will have to go to the poorhouse will you ask her to get ready and ill take her right over to the poorhouse there was no alternative mr pomeroy went into the house and broke the sad news to his wife and grace never mind she said with attempted cheerfulness though her lips quivered i shant have to stay there long frank will be sure to send for me very shortly its too bad grace said sam looking red about the eyes its too bad that you should have to go to the poorhouse come and see me sam said grace yes i will grace ill come often too you shant stay there long goodby said grace faltering you have all been very kind to me goodby my dear child said mrs pomeroy who knows but you can return to us when the new house is done so poor grace went out from her pleasant home to find the deacon grimfaced and stern waiting for her jump in little girl he said youve kept me waiting for you a long time and my time is valuable the distance to the poorhouse was about a mile and a half for the first half mile deacon pinkerton kept silence then he began to speak in a tone of cold condescension as if it were a favor for such a superior being to address an insignificant child about to become a pauper little girl have you heard from your brother lately not very lately sir what is he doing he is in a store i apprehend you are mistaken he has lost his place he has been turned away said the deacon with satisfaction frank turned away oh sir you must be mistaken mr pomeroy told me he found out yesterday when he went to the city poor grace she could not longer doubt now and her brothers misfortune saddened her even more than her own probably you will soon see your brother oh do you think so sir asked grace joyfully yes answered the deacon grimly he will find himself in danger of starvation in the city and hell creep back only too glad to obtain a nice comfortable home in the poorhouse but grace knew her brother better than that she knew his courage his selfreliance and his independent spirit and she was sure the deacon was mistaken the home for which grace was expected to be so grateful was now in sight it was a dark neglected looking house situated in the midst of barren fields and had a lonely and desolate aspect it was superintended by mr and mrs chase distant relations of deacon pinkerton mr chase was an inoffensive man but mrs chase had a violent temper she was at work in the kitchen when deacon pinkerton drove up hearing the sound of wheels she came to the door mrs chase said the deacon ive brought you a little girl to be placed under your care whats her name inquired the lady grace fowler grace humph why didnt she have a decent name you can call her anything you like said the deacon little girl you must behave well said deacon pinkerton by way of parting admonition the town expects it i expect it you must never cease to be grateful for the good home which it provides you free of expense grace did not reply looking in the face of her future taskmistress was scarcely calculated to awaken a very deep feeling of gratitude now said mrs chase addressing her new boarder just take off your things betsy and make yourself useful my name isnt betsy maam it isnt isnt it no it is grace you dont say so ill tell you one thing i shant allow anybody to contradict me here and your names got to be betsy while youre in this house now take off your things and hang them up on that peg im going to set you right to work yes maam said grace alarmed theres some dishes i want washed betsy and i wont have you loitering over your work neither very well maam such was the new home for which poor grace was expected to be grateful chapter xix what frank heard through the crevice frank looked with some surprise at the woman who was looking through the slide of his door he had expected to see nathan graves she also regarded him with interest i have brought you some supper she said frank reached out and drew in a small waiter containing a cup of tea and a plate of toast thank you he said where is the man who brought me here he has gone out do you know why he keeps me here in confinement no said the woman hastily i know nothing i see much but i know nothing are many prisoners brought here as i have been asked our hero in spite of the womans refusal to speak no i cant understand what object they can have in detaining me if i were rich i might guess but i am poor i am compelled to work for my daily bread and have been out of a place for two weeks i dont understand she said in a low voice rather to herself than to him but i cannot wait i must not stand here i will come up in fifteen minutes and if you wish another cup of tea or some toast i will bring them his confinement did not affect his appetite for he enjoyed his tea and toast and when as she had promised the woman came up he told her he would like another cup of tea and some more toast will you answer one question asked our hero i dont know answered the woman in a flurried tone you look like a good woman why do you stay in such a house as this i will tell you though i should do better to be silent but you wont betray me on no account i was poor starving when i had an application to come here the man who engaged me told me that it was to be a housekeeper and i had no suspicion of the character of the house that it was a den of she stopped short but frank understood what she would have said when i discovered the character of the house i would have left but for two reasons first i had no other home next i had become acquainted with the secrets of the house and they would have feared that i would reveal them i should incur great risk so i stayed here there was a sound below the woman started some one has come she said i must go down i will come up as soon as i can with the rest of your supper thank you you need not hurry our hero was left to ponder over what he had heard there was evidently a mystery connected with this lonely house a mystery which he very much desired to solve but there was one chance through the aperture in the closet he might both see and hear something provided any should meet there that evening the remainder of his supper was brought him by the same woman but she was in haste and he obtained no opportunity of exchanging another word with her frank did not learn who it was that had arrived listening intently he thought he heard some sounds in the next room opening the closet door and applying his eye to the aperture he saw two men seated in the room one of whom was the man who had brought him there he applied his ear to the opening and heard the following conversation i hear youve brought a boy here nathan said the other who was a stout lowbrowed man with an evil look yes said graves with a smile i am going to board him here a while whats it all about what are you going to gain by it ill tell you all i know ive known something of the family for a long time john wade employed me long ago the old millionaire had a son who went abroad and died there his cousin john wade brought home his son a mere baby the old mans grandson of course and sole heir or likely to be to the old mans wealth if he had lived in that case john wade would have been left out in the cold or put off with a small bequest yes did the boy live no he died very conveniently for john wade and thus removed the only obstacle from his path very convenient do you think there was any foul play there may have been but i should think the old man would have suspected he was away at the time when he returned to the city he heard from his nephew that the boy was dead it was a great blow to him of course now ill tell you what said graves sinking his voice so that frank found it difficult to hear ill tell you what ive thought at times i think the grandson may have been spirited off somewhere nothing more easy you know murder is a risky operation and john wade is respectable and wouldnt want to run the risk of a halter you may be right you dont connect this story of yours with the boy youve brought here do you i do answered graves emphatically i shouldnt be surprised if this was the very boy what makes you think so first because theres some resemblance between the boy and the old mans son as i remember him next it would explain john wades anxiety to get rid of him its my belief that john wade has recognized in this boy the baby he got rid of fourteen years ago and is afraid his uncle will make the same discovery frank left the crevice through which he had received so much information in a whirl of new and bewildering thoughts was it possible he asked himself that he could be the grandson of mr wharton his kind benefactor chapter xx the escape it was eight oclock the next morning before franks breakfast was brought to him i am sorry you have had to wait the housekeeper said as she appeared at the door with a cup of coffee and a plate of beefsteak and toast i couldnt come up before have the men gone away said frank yes then i have something to tell you i learned something about myself last night i was in the closet and heard the man who brought me here talking to another person may i tell you the story if you think it will do any good said the housekeeper but i cant help you if that is what you want he told the whole story as he proceeded the housekeeper betrayed increased almost eager interest and from time to time asked him questions in particular as to the personal appearance of john wade when frank had described him as well as he could she said in an excited manner yes it is it must be the same man the same man repeated our hero in surprise do you know anything about him i know that he is a wicked man i am afraid that i have helped him carry out his wicked plan but i did not know it at the time or i never would have given my consent i dont understand you said our hero puzzled will you tell me what you mean fourteen years ago i was very poor poor and sick besides my husband had died leaving me nothing but the care of a young infant whom it was necessary for me to support besides myself enfeebled by sickness i was able to earn but little but we lived in a wretched room in a crowded tenement house my infant boy was taken sick and died as i sat sorrowfully beside the bed on which he lay dead i heard a knock at the door i opened it and admitted a man whom i afterward learned to be john wade he very soon explained his errand he agreed to take my poor boy and pay all the expenses of his burial in greenwood cemetery provided i would not object to any of his arrangements he was willing besides to pay me two hundred dollars for the relief of my necessities though i was almost beside myself with grief for my childs loss and though this was a very favorable proposal i hesitated i could not understand why a stranger should make me such an offer i asked him the reason you ask too much he answered appearing annoyed i have made you a fair offer will you accept it or will you leave your child to have a paupers funeral that consideration decided me for my childs sake i agreed to his proposal and forebore to question him further he provided a handsome rosewood casket for my dear child but upon the silver plate was inscribed a name that was strange to me the name of francis wharton francis wharton exclaimed frank i was too weak and sorrowful to make opposition and my baby was buried as francis wharton not only this but a monument is erected over him at greenwood which bears this name she proceeded after a pause i did not then understand his object your story makes it clear i think that you are that francis wharton under whose name my boy was buried how strange said frank thoughtfully i cannot realize it but how did you know the name of the man who called upon you a card slipped from his pocket which i secured without his knowledge how fortunate that i met you said frank i mean to let mr wharton know all that i have learned and then he shall decide whether he will recognize me or not as his grandson i have been the means of helping to deprive you of your just rights though unconsciously now that i know the wicked conspiracy in which i assisted i will help undo the work thank you said frank the first thing is to get out of this place i cannot open the door of your room they do not trust me with the key the windows are not very high from the ground i can get down from the outside i will bring you a clothesline and a hatchet frank received them with exultation before i attempt to escape he said tell me where i can meet you in new york i want you to go with me to mr whartons i shall need you to confirm my story i will meet you tomorrow at no b street then we shall meet tomorrow what shall i call your name mrs parker thank you i will get away as quickly as possible and when we are in the city we will talk over our future plans with the help of the hatchet frank soon demolished the lower part of the window fastening the rope to the bedstead he got out of the window and safely descended to the ground a long and fatiguing walk lay before him but at last he reached the cars and half an hour later the ferry at jersey city frank thought himself out of danger for the time being but he was mistaken standing on the deck of the ferryboat and looking back to the pier from which he had just started he met the glance of a man who had intended to take the same boat but had reached the pier just too late his heart beat quicker when he recognized in the belated passenger his late jailer nathan graves carried away by his rage and disappointment nathan graves clenched his fist and shook it at his receding victim our hero walked into the cabin he wanted a chance to deliberate he knew that nathan graves would follow him by the next boat and it was important that he should not find him where was he to go fifteen minutes after frank set foot on the pier his enemy also landed but now the difficult part of the pursuit began he had absolutely no clew as to the direction which frank had taken for an hour and a half he walked the streets in the immediate neighborhood of the square but his labor was without reward not a glimpse could he catch of his late prisoner i suppose i must go to see mr wade he at last reluctantly decided he may be angry but he cant blame me i did my best i couldnt stand guard over the young rascal all day the address which the housekeeper had given frank was that of a policemans family in which she was at one time a boarder on giving his reference he was hospitably received and succeeded in making arrangements for a temporary residence about seven oclock mrs parker made her appearance she wag fatigued by her journey and glad to rest i was afraid you might be prevented from coming said frank i feared it also i was about to start at twelve oclock when to my dismay one of the men came home he said he had the headache i was obliged to make him some tea and toast he remained about till four oclock when to my relief he went upstairs to lie down i was afraid some inquiry might be made about you and your absence discovered especially as the rope was still hanging out of the window and i was unable to do anything more than cut off the lower end of it when the sick man retired to his bed i instantly left the house fearing that the return of some other of the band might prevent my escaping altogether suppose you had met one of them mrs parker i did it was about half a mile from the house did he recognize you yes he asked in some surprise where i was going i was obliged to make up a story about our being out of sugar he accepted it without suspicion and i kept on i hope i shall be forgiven for the lie i was forced to it you met no further trouble no i must tell you of my adventure said frank i came across the very man whom i most dreaded the man who made me a prisoner since he knows that you have escaped he is probably on your track said mrs parker it will be hardly safe for you to go to mr whartons why he will probably think you likely to go there and be lying in wait somewhere about but i must go to mr wharton said frank i must tell him this story it will be safer to write the housekeeper mrs bradley or john wade will get hold of the letter and suppress it i dont want to put them on their guard you are right it is necessary to be cautious you see i am obliged to call on my grandfather that is on mr wharton i can think of a better plan what is it go to a respectable lawyer tell him your story and place your case in his hands he will write to your grandfather inviting him to call at his office on business of importance without letting him know what is the nature of it you and i can be there to meet him and tell our story in this way john wade will know nothing and learn nothing of your movements that is good advice mrs parker but there is one thing you have not thought of said our hero what is that lawyers charge a great deal for their services and i have no money you have what is as good a recommendation a good case the lawyer will see at once that if not at present rich you stand a good chance of obtaining a position which will make you so besides your grandfather will be willing if he admits your claim to recompense the lawyer handsomely i did not think of that i will do as you advise tomorrow chapter xxi john wades disappointment mr wharton sat at dinner with his nephew and the housekeeper he had been at home for some time and of course on his arrival had been greeted with the news of our heros perfidy but to the indignation of mrs bradley and john he was obstinately incredulous there is some mistake i am sure he said such a boy as frank is incapable of stealing you may be mistaken after all john why did you not let him stay till i got back i should like to have examined him myself i was so angry with him for repaying your kindness in such a way that i instantly ordered him out of the house i blame you john for your haste said his uncle it was not just to the boy i acted for the best sir he forced himself to say in a subdued tone young people are apt to be impetuous and i excuse you but you should have waited for my return i will call at gilbert macks and inquire of frank himself what explanation he has to give of course sir you will do what you think proper said his nephew this ended the conversation and mr wharton according to his declared intention went to gilbert macks he returned disappointed with the information that our hero was no longer in the store i now return to mr wharton at dinner here is a letter for you sir said the housekeeper it was brought by the postman this afternoon mr wharton adjusted his spectacles and read as follows no wall street dear sir will you have the kindness to call at my office tomorrow morning at eleven oclock if it suits your convenience i have an important communication to make to you which will i think be of an agreeable character should the time named not suit you will you have the kindness to name your own time yours respectfully morris hall read that john said his uncle passing him the letter morris hall is a lawyer i believe sir said john have you any idea of the nature of the communication he desires to make no idea at all if it would relieve you sir i will go in your place said john whose curiosity was aroused thank you john but this is evidently a personal matter i shall go down there tomorrow at the appointed time john was far from suspecting that the communication related to frank though he had heard the day previous from nathan graves of the boys escape he had been very much annoyed and had given his agent a severe scolding with imperative orders to recapture the boy if possible it was not without a feeling of curiosity that mr wharton entered the law office of mr hall he announced himself and was cordially welcomed you have a communication to make to me said mr wharton i have tell me all without delay i will sir this is the communication i desire to make the story of john wades treachery was told and the means by which he had imposed upon his uncle but the lawyer carefully abstained from identifying the lost grandson with frank fowler when the story was concluded mr wharton said where is my grandson my poor georges boy find him for me and name your own reward i will show him to you at once sir frank at the word frank who was in an inner office entered mr wharton started in amazement frank he exclaimed my dear boy is it you who are my grandson grandfather mr wharton held out his arms and our hero already attached to him for his kindness was folded in close embrace then you believe i am your grandson said frank i believe it without further proof still mr wharton said the lawyer i want to submit my whole proof mrs parker mrs parker entered and detailed her part in the plot which for fourteen years had separated frank from his family enough said mr wharton i am convinced i did not believe my nephew capable of such baseness mrs parker you shall not regret your confession i will give you a pension which will relieve you from all fear of want call next week on mr hall and you shall learn what provision i have made for you you frank will return with me what will mr john say asked frank he shall no longer sleep under my roof said mr wharton sternly frank was taken to a tailor and fitted out with a handsome new suit readymade for immediate use while three more were ordered when mr wharton reached home he entered the library and rang the bell to the servant who answered he said is mr john at home yes sir he came in ten minutes ago tell him i wish to see him at once in the library summon the housekeeper also surprised at the summons john wade answered it directly he and mrs bradley met at the door and entered together their surprise and dismay may be conjectured when they saw our hero seated beside mr wharton dressed like a young gentleman john wade said his uncle sternly the boy whom you malign the boy you have so deeply wronged has found a permanent home in this house what sir you take him back i do there is no more fitting place for him than the house of his grandfather his grandfather exclaimed his nephew and the housekeeper in chorus i have abundant proof of the relationship this morning i have listened to the story of your treachery i have seen the woman whose son represented to me as my grandson lies in greenwood cemetery i have learned your wicked plans to defraud him of his inheritance and i tell you that you have failed i shall make my will tomorrow bequeathing all my property to my grandson excepting only an annual income of two thousand dollars to yourself and now i must trouble you to find a boarding place after what has passed i do not desire to have you in the family i do not believe he is your grandson said john wade too angry to heed prudential considerations your opinion is of little consequence then sir i have only to wish you goodmorning i will send for my trunks during the day goodmorning said mr wharton gravely and john wade left the room baffled and humiliated i hope sir said the housekeeper alarmed for her position i hope you dont think i knew mr frank was your grandson i never was so astonished and flustrated in my life i hope you wont discharge me sir me that have served you so faithfully for many years you shall remain on probation but if frank ever has any fault to find with you you must go i hope you will forgive me mr frank i forgive you freely said our hero who was at a generous disposition chapter xxii conclusion meanwhile poor grace had fared badly at the poorhouse in crawford it was a sad contrast to the gentle and kindly circle at mr pomeroys what made it worse for grace was that she could hear nothing of frank she feared he was sick or had met with some great misfortune which prevented his writing one day a handsome carriage drove up to the door from it descended our hero elegantly attired he knocked at the door mrs chase who was impressed by wealth came to the door in a flutter of respect induced by the handsome carriage what do you wish sir she asked not recognizing frank miss grace fowler repeated mrs chase almost paralyzed at grace being called for by such stylish acquaintances yes my sister grace what are you frank fowler yes i have come to take grace away i dont know as i have the right to let her go said mrs chase cautiously regretting that grace was likely to escape her clutches here is an order from deacon pinkerton chairman of the overseers of the poor that is sufficient she can go you look as if you had prospered in the city she added with curiosity yes i have found my grandfather who is very wealthy you dont say ejaculated mrs chase ill tell grace at once grace at work in the kitchen had not heard of the arrival what was her surprise when mrs chase entering the room said graciously go up at once grace and change your clothes your brother has come for you he is going to take you away grace almost gasped for breath is it true it is indeed your brother looks remarkably well he is rich he has found a rich grandfather and has come for you in a carriage in amazed bewilderment grace went upstairs and put on her best dress poor enough in comparison with her brothers clothes and was soon happy in his embrace i am glad to see you my dear child said mr wharton who had accompanied frank will you come to the city and live with me and your brother oh sir i shall be glad to be wherever frank is goodbye my dear child sand mrs chase whose feelings were very much changed now that grace was a rich young lady come and see me some time thank you mrs chase goodbye the carriage rolled on a few words only remain our hero was placed at a classical school and in due time entered college where he acquitted himself with distinction he is now making a tour of europe grace was also placed at an excellent school and has developed into a handsome and accomplished young lady it is thought she will marry sam pomeroy who obtained a place in a countingroom through mr whartons influence and is now head clerk with a prospect of partnership his father received a gift of five thousand dollars from mr wharton as an acknowledgment of his kindness to frank tom pinkerton holds a subordinate clerkship in the same house and is obliged to look up to sam as his superior it chafes his pride but his father has become a poor man and tom is too prudent to run the risk of losing his situation john wade draws his income regularly but he is never seen at his uncles house mr wharton is very happy in his grandson and made happier by the intelligence just received from europe of franks engagement to a brilliant young new york lady whom he met in his travels he bids fair though advanced in age to live some years yet to witness the happiness of his dear grandson once a humble cashboy
