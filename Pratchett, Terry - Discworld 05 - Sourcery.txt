sourcery by terry pratchett dedication many years ago i saw in bath a very large american lady towing a huge tartan suitcase very fast on little rattly wheels which caught in the pavement cracks and generally gave it a life of its own at that moment the luggage was born many thanks to that lady and everyone else in places like power cable neb who dont get nearly enough encouragement this book does not contain a map please feel free to draw your own there was a man and he had eight sons apart from that he was nothing more than a comma on the page of history its sad but thats all you can say about some people but the eighth son grew up and married and had eight sons and because there is only one suitable profession for the eighth son of an eighth son he became a wizard and he became wise and powerful or at any rate powerful and wore a pointed hat and there it would have ended should have ended but against the lore of magic and certainly against all reasonexcept the reasons of the heart which are warm and messy and well unreasonable he fled the halls of magic and fell in love and got married not necessarily in that order and he had seven sons each one from the cradle at least as powerful as any wizard in the world and then he had an eighth son a wizard squared a source of magic a sourcerer summer thunder rolled around the sandy cliffs far below the sea sucked on the shingle as noisily as an old man with one tooth who had been given a gobstopper a few seagulls hung lazily in the updraughts waiting for something to happen and the father of wizards sat among the thrift and rattling sea grasses at the edge of the cliff cradling the child in his arms staring out to sea there was a roil of black cloud out there heading inland and the light it pushed before it had that deep syrup quality it gets before a really serious thunderstorm he turned at a sudden silence behind him and looked up through tearreddened eyes at a tall hooded figure in a black robe ipslore the red it said the voice was as hollow as a cave as dense as a neutron star ipslore grinned the terrible grin of the suddenly mad and held up the child for deaths inspection my son he said i shall call him coin a name as good as any other said death politely his empty sockets stared down at a small round face wrapped in sleep despite rumour death isnt cruelmerely terribly terribly good at his job you took his mother said ipslore it was a flat statement without apparent rancour in the valley behind the cliffs ipslores homestead was a smoking ruin the rising wind already spreading the fragile ashes across the hissing dunes it was a heart attack at the end said death there are worse ways to die take it from me ipslore looked out to sea all my magic could not save her he said there are places where even magic may not go and now you have come for the child no the child has his own destiny i have come for you ah the wizard stood up carefully laid the sleeping baby down on the thin grass and picked up a long staff that had been lying there it was made of a black metal with a meshwork of silver and gold carvings that gave it a rich and sinister tastelessness the metal was octiron intrinsically magical i made this you know he said they all said you couldnt make a staff out of metal they said they should only be of wood but they were wrong i put a lot of myself into it i shall give it to him he ran his hands lovingly along the staff which gave off a faint tone he repeated almost to himself i put a lot of myself into it it is a good staff said death ipslore held it in the air and looked down at his eighth son who gave a gurgle she wanted a daughter he said death shrugged ipslore gave him a look compounded of bewilderment and rage what is he the eighth son of an eighth son of an eighth son said death unhelpfully the wind whipped at his robe driving the black clouds overhead what does that make him a sourcerer as you are well aware thunder rolled on cue what is his destiny shouted ipslore above the rising gale death shrugged again he was good at it sourcerers make their own destiny they touch the earth lightly ipslore leaned on the staff drumming on it with his fingers apparently lost in the maze of his own thoughts his left eyebrow twitched no he said softly no i will make his destiny for him i advise against it be quiet and listen when i tell you that they drove me out with their books and their rituals and their lore they called themselves wizards and they had less magic in their whole fat bodies than i have in my little finger banished me for showing that i was human and what would humans be without love rare said death nevertheless listen they drove us here to the ends of the world and that killed her they tried to take my staff away ipslore was screaming above the noise of the wind well i still have some power left he snarled and i say that my son shall go to unseen university and wear the archchancellors hat and the wizards of the world shall bow to him and he shall show them what lies in their deepest hearts their craven greedy hearts hell show the world its true destiny and there will be no magic greater than his no and the strange thing about the quiet way death spoke the word was this it was louder than the roaring of the storm it jerked ipslore back to momentary sanity ipslore rocked back and forth uncertainly what he said i said no nothing is final nothing is absolute except me of course such tinkering with destiny could mean the downfall of the world there must be a chance however small the lawyers of fate demand a loophole in every prophecy ipslore stared at deaths implacable face i must give them a chance yes tap tap tap went ipslores fingers on the metal of the staff then they shall have their chance he said when hell freezes over no i am not allowed to enlighten you even by default about current temperatures in the next world then ipslore hesitated then they shall have their chance when my son throws his staff away no wizard would ever throw his staff away said death the bond is too great yet it is possible you must agree death appeared to consider this must was not a word he was accustomed to hearing but he seemed to concede the point agreed he said is that a small enough chance for you sufficiently molecular ipslore relaxed a little in a voice that was nearly normal he said i dont regret it you know i would do it all again children are our hope for the future there is no hope for the future said death what does it contain then me besides you i mean death gave him a puzzled look im sorry the storm reached its howling peak overhead a seagull went past backwards i meant said ipslore bitterly what is there in this world that makes living worth while death thought about it cats he said eventually cats are nice curse you many have said death evenly how much longer do i have death pulled a large hourglass from the secret recesses of his robe the two bulbs were enclosed in bars of black and gold and the sand was nearly all in the bottom one oh about nine seconds ipslore pulled himself up to his full and still impressive height and extended the gleaming metal staff towards the child a hand like a little pink crab reached out from the blanket and grasped it then let me be the first and last wizard in the history of the world to pass on his staff to his eighth son he said slowly and sonorously and i charge him to use it to i should hurry up if i were you the full said ipslore becoming the mightiest the lightning screamed from the heart of the cloud hit ipslore on the point of his hat crackled down his arm flashed along the staff and struck the child the wizard vanished in a wisp of smoke the staff glowed green then white then merely redhot the child smiled in his sleep when the thunder had died away death reached down slowly and picked up the boy who opened his eyes they glowed golden from the inside for the first time in what for want of any better word must be called his life death found himself looking at a stare that he found hard to return the eyes seemed to be focused on a point several inches inside his skull i did not mean for that to happen said the voice of ipslore from out of the empty air is he harmed no death tore his gaze away from that fresh knowing smile he contained the power he is a sourcerer no doubt he will survive much worse and now you will come with me no yes you are dead you see death looked around for ipslores wavering shade and failed to find it where are you in the staff death leaned on his scythe and sighed foolish how easily could i cut you loose not without destroying the staff said the voice of ipslore and it seemed to death that there was a new thick exultant quality to it and now the child has accepted the staff you cannot destroy it without destroying him and that you cannot do without upsetting destiny my last magic rather neat l feel death prodded the staff it crackled and sparks crawled obscenely along its length strangely enough he wasnt particularly angry anger is an emotion and for emotion you need glands and death didnt have much truck with glands and needed a good run at it to get angry but he was mildly annoyed he sighed again people were always trying this sort of thing on the other hand it was quite interesting to watch and at least this was a bit more original than the usual symbolic chess game which death always dreaded because he could never remember how the knight was supposed to move youre only putting off the inevitable he said thats what being alive is all about but what precisely do you expect to gain i shall be by my sons side l shall teach him even though he wont know it i shall guide his understanding and when he is ready l shall guide his steps tell me said death how did you guide the steps of your other sons i drove them out they dared to argue with me they would not listen to what i could teach them but this one will is this wise the staff was silent beside it the boy chuckled at the sound of a voice only he could hear there was no analogy for the way in which great atuin the world turtle moved against the galactic night when you are ten thousand miles long your shell pocked with meteor craters and frosted with comet ice there is absolutely nothing you can realistically be like except yourself so great atuin swam slowly through the interstellar deeps like the largest turtle there has ever been carrying on its carapace the four huge elephants that bore on their backs the vast glittering waterfallfringed circle of the discworld which exists either because of some impossible blip on the curve of probability or because the gods enjoy a joke as much as anyone more than most people in fact near the shores of the circle sea in the ancient sprawling city of ankhmorpork on a velvet cushion on a ledge high up in the unseen university was a hat it was a good hat it was a magnificent hat it was pointy of course with a wide floppy brim but after disposing of these basic details the designer had really got down to business there was gold lace on there and pearls and bands of purest vermine and sparkling ankhstones and some incredibly tasteless sequins and a dead giveaway of course a circle of octarines since they werent in a strong magical field at the moment they werent glowing and looked like rather inferior diamonds spring had come to ankhmorpork it wasnt immediately apparent but there were signs that were obvious to the cognoscenti for example the scum on the river ankh that great wide slow waterway that served the double city as reservoir sewer and frequent morgue had turned a particularly iridescent green the citys drunken rooftops sprouted mattresses and bolsters as the winter bedding was put out to air in the weak sunshine and in the depths of musty cellars the beams twisted and groaned when their dry sap responded to the ancient call of root and forest birds nested among the gutters and eaves of unseen university although it was noticeable that however great the pressure on the nesting sites they never ever made nests in the invitingly open mouths of the gargoyles that lined the rooftops much to the gargoyles disappointment a kind of spring had even come to the ancient university itself tonight would be the eve of small gods and a new archchancellor would be elected well not exactly elected because wizards didnt have any truck with all this undignified voting business and it was well known that archchancellors were selected by the will of the gods and this year it was a pretty good bet that the gods would see their way clear to selecting old virrid wayzygoose who was a decent old boy and had been patiently waiting his turn for years the archchancellor of unseen university was the official leader of all the wizards on the disc once upon a time it had meant that he would be the most powerful in the handling of magic but times were a lot quieter now and to be honest senior wizards tended to look upon actual magic as a bit beneath them they tended to prefer administration which was safer and nearly as much fun and also big dinners and so the long afternoon wore on the hat squatted on its faded cushion in wayzygooses chambers while he sat in his tub in front of the fire and soaped his beard other wizards dozed in their studies or took a gentle stroll around the gardens in order to work up an appetite for the evenings feast about a dozen steps was usually considered quite sufficient in the great hall under the carved or painted stares of two hundred earlier archchancellors the butlers staff set out the long tables and benches in the vaulted maze of the kitchens well the imagination should need no assistance it should include lots of grease and heat and shouting vats of caviar whole roast oxen strings of sausages like paperchains strung from wall to wall the head chef himself at work in one of the cold rooms putting the finishing touches to a model of the university carved for some inexplicable reason out of butter he kept doing this every time there was a feast butter swans butter buildings whole rancid greasy yellow menageries and he enjoyed it so much noone had the heart to tell him to stop in his own labyrinth of cellars the butler prowled among his casks decanting and tasting the air of expectation had even spread to the ravens who inhabited the tower of art eight hundred feet high and reputedly the oldest building in the world its crumbling stones supported thriving miniature forests high above the citys rooftops entire species of beetles and small mammals had evolved up there and since people rarely climbed it these days owing to the towers distressing tendency to sway in the breeze the ravens had it all to themselves now they were flying around it in a state of some agitation like gnats before a thunderstorm if anyone below is going to take any notice of them it might be a good idea something horrible was about to happen you can tell cant you youre not the only one whats got into them shouted rincewind above the din the librarian ducked as a leatherbound grimoire shot out from its shelf and jerked to a midair halt on the end of its chain then he dived rolled and landed on a copy of maleficios discouverie of demonologie that was industriously bashing at its lectern oook he said rincewind put his shoulder against a trembling bookshelf and forced its rustling volumes back into place with his knees the noise was terrible books of magic have a sort of life of their own some have altogether too much for example the first edition of the necrotelicomicon has to be kept between iron plates the true arte of levitatione has spent the last one hundred and fifty years up in the rafters and ge fordges compenydyum of sex majick is kept in a vat of ice in a room all by itself and theres a strict rule that it can only be read by wizards who are over eighty and if possible dead but even the everyday grimoires and incunabula on the main shelves were as restless and nervy as the inmates of a chickenhouse with something rank scrabbling under the door from their shut covers came a muffled scratching like claws what did you say screamed rincewind oook right rincewind as honorary assistant librarian hadnt progressed much beyond basic indexing and bananafetching and he had to admire the way the librarian ambled among the quivering shelves here running a blackleather hand over a trembling binding here comforting a frightened thesaurus with a few soothing simian murmurings after a while the library began to settle down and rincewind felt his shoulder muscles relax it was a fragile peace though here and there a page rustled from distant shelves came the ominous creak of a spine after its initial panic the library was now as alert and jittery as a longtailed cat in a rockingchair factory the librarian ambled back down the aisles he had a face that only a lorry tyre could love and it was permanently locked in a faint smile but rincewind could tell by the way the ape crept into his cubbyhole under the desk and hid his head under a blanket that he was deeply worried examine rincewind as he peers around the sullen shelves there are eight levels of wizardry on the disc after sixteen years rincewind has failed to achieve even level one in fact it is the considered opinion of some of his tutors that he is incapable even of achieving level zero which most normal people are born at to put it another way it has been suggested that when rincewind dies the average occult ability of the human race will actually go up by a fraction he is tall and thin and has the scrubby kind of beard that looks like the kind of beard worn by people who werent cut out by nature to be beard wearers he is dressed in a dark red robe that has seen better days possibly better decades but you can tell hes a wizard because hes got a pointy hat with a floppy brim its got the word wizzard embroidered on it in big silver letters by someone whose needlework is even worse than their spelling theres a star on top it has lost most of its sequins clamping his hat on his head rincewind pushed his way through the librarys ancient doors and stepped out into the golden light of the afternoon it was calm and quiet broken only by the hysterical croaking of the ravens as they circled the tower of art rincewind watched them for a while the universitys ravens were a tough bunch of birds it took a lot to unsettle them on the other hand the sky was pale blue tinted with gold with a few high wisps of fluffy cloud glowing pinkly in the lengthening light the ancient chestnut trees in the quadrangle were in full bloom from an open window came the sound of a student wizard practising the violin rather badly it was not what you would call ominous rincewind leaned against the warm stonework and screamed the building was shuddering he could feel it come up through his hand and along his arms a faint rhythmic sensation at just the right frequency to suggest uncontrollable terror the stones themselves were frightened he looked down in horror at a faint clinking noise an ornamental drain cover fell backwards and one of the universitys rats poked its whiskers out it gave rincewind a desperate look as it scrambled up and fled past him followed by dozens of its tribe some of them were wearing clothes but that wasnt unusual for the university where the high level of background magic does strange things to genes as he stared around him rincewind could see other streams of grey bodies leaving the university by every drainpipe and flowing towards the outside wall the ivy by his ear rustled and a group of rats made a series of deathdefying leaps on to his shoulders and slid down his robe they otherwise ignored him totally but again this wasnt particularly unusual most creatures ignored rincewind he turned and fled into the university skirts flapping around his knees until he reached the bursars study he hammered on the door which creaked open ah its um rincewind isnt it said the bursar without much enthusiasm whats the matter were sinking the bursar stared at him for a few moments his name was spelter he was tall and wiry and looked as though he had been a horse in previous lives and had only just avoided it in this one he always gave people the impression that he was looking at them with his teeth sinking yes all the rats are leaving the bursar gave him another stare come inside rincewind he said kindly rincewind followed him into the low dark room and across to the window it looked out over the gardens to the river oozing peacefully towards the sea you havent been um overdoing it said the bursar overdoing what said rincewind guiltily this is a building you see said the bursar like most wizards when faced with a puzzle he started to roll himself a cigarette its not a ship there are ways of telling you know absence of porpoises frolicking around the bows a shortage of bilges that sort of thing the chances of foundering are remote otherwise um wed have to man the sheds and row for shore um but the rats grain ship in harbour i expect some um springtime ritual im sure i felt the building shaking too said rincewind a shade uncertainly here in this quiet room with the fire crackling in the grate it didnt seem quite so real a passing tremor great atuin hiccuping um possibly a grip on youself um is what you should get you havent been drinking have you no um would you like to spelter padded over to a dark oak cabinet and pulled out a couple of glasses which he filled from the water jug i tend to be best at sherry this time of day he said and spread his hands over the glasses say um the word sweet or dry um no said rincewind perhaps youre right i think ill go and have a bit of rest good idea rincewind wandered down the chilly stone passages occasionally hed touch the wall and appear to be listening and then hed shake his head as he crossed the quadrangle again he saw a herd of mice swarm over a balcony and scamper towards the river the ground they were running over seemed to be moving too when rincewind looked closer he could see that it was because it was covered with ants these werent ordinary ants centuries of magical leakage into the walls of the university had done strange things to them some of them were pulling very small carts some of them were riding beetles but all of them were leaving the university as quickly as possible the grass on the lawn rippled as they passed he looked up as an elderly striped mattress was extruded from an upper window and flopped down on to the flagstones below after a pause apparently to catch its breath it rose a little from the ground then it started to float purposefully across the lawn and bore down on rincewind who managed to jump out of its way just in time he heard a highpitched chittering and caught a glimpse of thousands of determined little legs under the bulging fabric before it hurtled onward even the bedbugs were on the move and in case they didnt find such comfortable quarters elsewhere they were leaving nothing to chance one of them waved at him and squeaked a greeting rincewind backed away until something touched the back of his legs and froze his spine it turned out to be a stone seat he watched it for some time it didnt seem in any hurry to run away he sat down gratefully theres probably a natural explanation he thought or a perfectly normal unnatural one anyway a gritty noise made him look across the lawn there was no natural explanation of this with incredible slowness easing themselves down parapets and drainpipes in total silence except for the occasional scrape of stone on stone the gargoyles were leaving the roof its a shame that rincewind had never seen poor quality stopmotion photography because then he would have known exactly how to describe what he was seeing the creatures didnt exactly move but they managed to progress in a series of high speed tableaux and lurched past him in a spindly procession of beaks manes wings claws and pigeon droppings whats happening he squeaked a thing with a goblins face harpys body and hens legs turned its head in a series of little jerks and spoke in a voice like the peristalsis of mountains it said a ourcerer is umming eee orr ife rincewind said pardon but the thing had gone past and was lurching awkwardly across the ancient lawn so rincewind sat and stared blankly at nothing much for fully ten seconds before giving a little scream and running as fast as he could he didnt stop until hed reached his own room in the library building it wasnt much of a room being mainly used to store old furniture but it was home against one shadowy wall was a wardrobe it wasnt one of your modern wardrobes fit only for nervous adulterers to jump into when the husband returned home early but an ancient oak affair dark as night in whose dusty depths coathangers lurked and bred herds of flaking shoes roamed its floor it was quite possible that it was a secret doorway to fabulous worlds but noone had ever tried to find out because of the distressing smell of mothballs and on top of the wardrobe wrapped in scraps of yellowing paper and old dust sheets was a large brassbound chest it went by the name of the luggage why it consented to be owned by rincewind was something only the luggage knew and it wasnt telling but probably no other item in the entire chronicle of travel accessories had quite such a history of mystery and grievous bodily harm it had been described as half suitcase half homicidal maniac it had many unusual qualities which may or may not become apparent soon but currently there was only one that set it apart from any other brassbound chest it was snoring with a sound like someone very slowly sawing a log the luggage might be magical it might be terrible but in its enigmatic soul it was kin to every other piece of luggage throughout the multiverse and preferred to spend its winters hibernating on top of a wardrobe rincewind hit it with a broom until the sawing stopped filled his pockets with odds and ends from the banana crate he used as a dressing table and made for the door he couldnt help noticing that his mattress had gone but that didnt matter because he was pretty clear that he was never going to sleep on a mattress again ever the luggage landed on the floor with a solid thump after a few seconds and with extreme care it rose up on hundreds of little pink legs it tilted backwards and forwards a bit stretching every leg and then it opened its lid and yawned are you coming or not the lid shut with a snap the luggage manoeuvred its feet into a complicated shuffle until it was facing the doorway and headed after its master the library was still in a state of tension with the occasional clinking of a chain or muffled crackle of a page rincewind reached under the desk and grabbed the librarian who was still hunched under his blanket come on i said oook ill buy you a drink said rincewind desperately the librarian unfolded like a fourlegged spider oook rincewind halfdragged the ape from his nest and out through the door he didnt head for the main gates but for an otherwise undistinguished area of wall where a few loose stones had for two thousand years offered students an unobtrusive way in after lightsout then he stopped so suddenly that the librarian cannoned into him and the luggage ran into both of them oook oh gods he said look at that oook there was a shiny black tide flowing out of a grating near the kitchens early evening starlight glinted off millions of little black backs but it wasnt the sight of the cockroaches that was so upsetting it was the fact that they were marching in step a hundred abreast of course like all the informal inhabitants of the university the roaches were a little unusual but there was something particularly unpleasant about the sound of billions of very small feet hitting the stones in perfect time rincewind stepped gingerly over the marching column the librarian jumped it the luggage of course followed them with a noise like someone tapdancing over a bag of crisps and so forcing the luggage to go all the way around to the gates anyway because otherwise itd only batter a hole in the wall rincewind quit the university with all the other insects and small frightened rodents and decided that if a few quiet beers wouldnt allow him to see things in a different light then a few more probably would it was certainly worth a try that was why he wasnt present in the great hall for dinner it would turn out to be the most important missed meal of his life further along the university wall there was a faint clink as a grapnel caught the spikes that lined its top a moment later a slim blackclad figure dropped lightly into the university grounds and ran soundlessly towards the great hall where it was soon lost in the shadows noone would have noticed it anyway on the other side of the campus the sourcerer was walking towards the gates of the university where his feet touched the cobbles blue sparks crackled and evaporated the early evening dew it was very hot the big fireplace at the turnwise end of the great hall was practically incandescent wizards feel the cold easily so the sheer blast of heat from the roaring logs was melting candles twenty feet away and bubbling the varnish on the long tables the air over the feast was blue with tobacco smoke which writhed into curious shapes as it was bent by random drifts of magic on the centre table the complete carcass of a whole roast pig looked extremely annoyed at the fact that someone had killed it without waiting for it to finish its apple and the model university made of butter was sinking gently into a pool of grease there was a lot of beer about here and there redfaced wizards were happily singing ancient drinking songs which involved a lot of kneeslapping and cries of ho the only possible excuse for this sort of thing is that wizards are celibate and have to find their amusement where they can another reason for the general conviviality was the fact that noone was trying to kill anyone else this is an unusual state of affairs in magical circles the higher levels of wizardry are a perilous place every wizard is trying to dislodge the wizards above him while stamping on the fingers of those below to say that wizards are healthily competitive by nature is like saying that piranhas are naturally a little peckish however ever since the great mage wars left whole areas of the disc uninhabitable wizards have been forbidden to settle their differences by magical means because it caused a lot of trouble for the population at large and in any case it was often difficult to tell which of the resultant patches of smoking fat had been the winner so they traditionally resort to knives subtle poisons scorpions in shoes and hilarious booby traps involving razorsharp pendulums on small gods eve however it was considered extremely bad form to kill a brother wizard and wizards felt able to let their hair down without fear of being strangled with it the archchancellors chair was empty wayzygoose was dining alone in his study as befits a man chosen by the gods after their serious discussion with sensible senior wizards earlier in the day despite his eighty years he was feeling a little bit nervous and hardly touched his second chicken in a few minutes he would have to make a speech wayzygoose had in his younger days sought power in strange places hed wrestled with demons in blazing octagrams stared into dimensions that men were not meant to wot of and even outfaced the unseen university grants committee but nothing in the eight circles of nothingness was quite so bad as a couple of hundred expectant faces staring up at him through the cigar smoke the heralds would soon be coming by to collect him he sighed and pushed his pudding away untasted crossed the room stood in front of the big mirror and fumbled in the pocket of the robe for his notes after a while he managed to get them in some sort of order and cleared his throat my brothers in art he began i cannot tell you how much i er how much fine traditions of this ancient university er as i look around me and see the pictures of archchancellors gone before he paused sorted through his notes again and plunged on rather more certainly standing here tonight i am reminded of the story about the threelegged pedlar and the er merchants daughters it seems that this merchant there was a knock at the door enter wayzygoose barked and peered at the notes carefully this merchant he muttered this merchant yes this merchant had three daughters i think it was yes it was three it would appear he looked into the mirror and turned round he started to say who are y and found that there are things worse than making speeches after all the small dark figure creeping along the deserted corridors heard the noise and didnt take too much notice unpleasant noises were not uncommon in areas where magic was commonly practised the figure was looking for something it wasnt sure what it was only that it would know it when it found it after some minutes its search led it to wayzygooses room the air was full of greasy coils little particles of soot drifted gently on the air currents and there were several footshaped burn marks on the floor the figure shrugged there was no accounting for the sort of things you found in wizards rooms it caught sight of its multifaceted reflection in the shattered mirror adjusted the set of its hood and got on with the search moving like one listening to inner directions it padded noiselessly across the room until it reached the table whereon stood a tall round and battered leather box it crept closer and gently raised the lid the voice from inside sounded as though it was talking through several layers of carpet when it said at last what kept you i mean how did they all get started i mean back in the old times there were real wizards there was none of this levels business they just went out and did it pow one or two of the other customers in the darkened bar of the mended drum tavern looked around hastily at the noise they were new in town regular customers never took any notice of surprising noises like groans or unpleasantly gristly sounds it was a lot healthier in some parts of the city curiosity didnt just kill the cat it threw it in the river with lead weights tied to its feet rincewinds hands weaved unsteadily over the array of empty glasses on the table in front of him hed almost been able to forget about the cockroaches after another drink he might manage to forget about the mattress too whee a fireball fizz vanishing like smoke whee sorry the librarian carefully pulled what remained of his beer out of the reach of rincewinds flailing arms proper magic rincewind stifled a belch oook rincewind stared into the frothy remnants of his last beer and then with extreme care in case the top of his head fell off leaned down and poured some into a saucer for the luggage it was lurking under the table which was a relief it usually embarrassed him in bars by sidling up to drinkers and terrorising them into feeding it crisps he wondered fuzzily where his train of thought had been derailed where was i oook the librarian hinted yeah rincewind brightened they didnt have all this levels and grades business you know they had sourcerers in those days they went out in the world and found new spells and had adventures he dipped a finger in a puddle of beer and doodled a design on the stained scratched timber of the table one of rincewinds tutors had said of him that to call his understanding of magical theory abysmal is to leave no suitable word to describe his grasp of its practice this had always puzzled him he objected to the fact that you had to be good at magic to be a wizard he knew he was a wizard deep in his head being good at magic didnt have anything to do with it that was just an extra it didnt actually define somebody when i was a little boy he said wistfully i saw this picture of a sourcerer in a book he was standing on a mountain top waving his arms and the waves were coming right up you know like they do down in ankh bay in a gale and there were flashes of lightning all round him oook i dont know why they didnt perhaps he had rubber boots on rincewind snapped and went on dreamily and he had this staff and a hat on just like mine and his eyes were sort of glowing and there was all this sort of like glitter coming out of his fingertips and i thought one day ill do that and oook just a half then oook how do you pay for this stuff every time anyone gives you any money you eat it oook amazing rincewind completed his sketch in the beer there was a stick figure on a cliff it didnt look much like him drawing in stale beer is not a precise art but it was meant to thats what i wanted to be he said pow not all this messing around all this books and stuff that isnt what it should all be about what we need is real wizardry that last remark would have earned the prize for the days most erroneous statement if rincewind hadnt then said its a pity there arent any of them around any more spelter rapped on the table with his spoon he was an impressive figure in his ceremonial robe with the purpleandvermine hood of the venerable council of seers and the yellow sash of a fifth level wizard hed been fifth level for three years waiting for one of the sixtyfour sixth level wizards to create a vacancy by dropping dead he was in an amiable mood however not only had he just finished a good dinner he also had in his quarters a small phial of a guaranteed untastable poison which used correctly should guarantee him promotion within a few months life looked good the big clock at the end of the hall trembled on the verge of nine oclock the tattoo with the spoon hadnt had much effect spelter picked up a pewter tankard and brought it down hard brothers he shouted and nodded as the hubbub died away thank you be upstanding please for the ceremony of the um keys there was a ripple of laughter and a general buzz of expectancy as the wizards pushed back their benches and got unsteadily to their feet the double doors to the hall were locked and triple barred an incoming archchancellor had to request entry three times before they would be unlocked signifying that he was appointed with the consent of wizardry in general or some such thing the origins were lost in the depths of time which was as good a reason as any for retaining the custom the conversation died away the assembled wizardry stared at the doors there was a soft knocking go away shouted the wizards some of them collapsing at the sheer subtlety of the humour spelter picked up the great iron ring that contained the keys to the university they werent all metal they werent all visible some of them looked very strange indeed who is that who knocketh without he intoned i do what was strange about the voice was this it seemed to every wizard that the speaker was standing right behind him most of them found themselves looking over their shoulders in that moment of shocked silence there was the sharp little snick of the lock they watched in fascinated horror as the iron bolts travelled back of their own accord the great oak balks of timber turned by time into something tougher than rock slid out of their sockets the hinges flared from red through yellow to white and then exploded slowly with a terrible inevitability the doors fell into the hall there was an indistinct figure standing in the smoke from the burning hinges bloody hell virrid said one of the wizards nearby that was a good one as the figure strode into the light they could all see that it was not after all virrid wayzygoose he was at least a head shorter than any other wizard and wore a simple white robe he was also several decades younger he looked about ten years old and in one hand he held a staff considerably taller than he was here hes no wizard wheres his hood then wheres his hat the stranger walked up the line of astonished wizards until he was standing in front of the top table spelter looked down at a thin young face framed by a mass of blond hair and most of all he looked into two golden eyes that glowed from within but he felt they werent looking at him they seemed to be looking at a point six inches beyond the back of his head spelter got the impression that he was in the way and considerably surplus to immediate requirements he rallied his dignity and pulled himself up to his full height what is the meaning of um this he said it was pretty weak he had to admit but the steadiness of that incandescent glare appeared to be stripping all the words out of his memory i have come said the stranger come come for what to take my place where is the seat for me are you a student demanded spelter white with anger what is your name young man the boy ignored him and looked around at the assembled wizards who is the most powerful wizard here he said i wish to meet him spelter nodded his head two of the college porters who had been sidling towards the newcomer for the last few minutes appeared at either elbow take him out and throw him in the street said spelter the porters big solid serious men nodded they gripped the boys pipestem arms with hands like banana bunches your father will hear of this said spelter severely he already has said the boy he glanced up at the two men and shrugged whats going on here spelter turned to see skarmer billias head of the order of the silver star whereas spelter tended towards the wiry billias was expansive looking rather like a small captive balloon that had for some reason been draped in blue velvet and vermine between them the wizards averaged out as two normalsized men unfortunately billias was the type of person who prided himself on being good with children he bent down as far as his dinner would allow and thrust a whiskery red face towards the boy whats the matter lad he said this child had forced his way into here because he says he wants to meet a powerful wizard said spelter disapprovingly spelter disliked children intensely which was perhaps why they found him so fascinating at the moment he was successfully preventing himself from wondering about the door nothing wrong with that said billias any lad worth his salt wants to be a wizard i wanted to be a wizard when i was a lad isnt that right lad are you puissant said the boy hmm i said are you puissant how powerful are you powerful said billias he stood up fingered his eighthlevel sash and winked at spelter oh pretty powerful quite powerful as wizards go good i challenge you show me your strongest magic and when i have beaten you why then i shall be archchancellor why you impudent began spelter but his protest was lost in the roar of laughter from the rest of the wizards billias slapped his knees or as near to them as he could reach a duel eh he said pretty good eh duelling is forbidden as well you know said spelter anyway its totally ridiculous i dont know who did the doors for him but i will not stand here and see you waste all our time now now said billias whats your name lad coin coin sir snapped spelter well now coin said billias you want to see the best i can do eh yes yes sir snapped spelter coin gave him an unblinking stare a stare as old as time the kind of stare that basks on rocks on volcanic islands and never gets tired spelter felt his mouth go dry billias held out his hands for silence then with a theatrical flourish he rolled up the sleeve of his left arm and extended his hand the assembled wizards watched with interest eighthlevels were above magic as a rule spending most of their time in contemplation normally of the next menu and of course avoiding the attentions of ambitious wizards of the seventhlevel this should be worth seeing billias grinned at the boy who returned it with a stare that focused on a point a few inches beyond the back of the old wizards head somewhat disconcerted billias flexed his fingers suddenly this wasnt quite the game he had intended and he felt an overpowering urge to impress it was swiftly overtaken by a surge of annoyance at his own stupidity in being unnerved i shall show you he said and took a deep breath maligrees wonderful garden there was a susurration from the diners only four wizards in the entire history of the university had ever succeeded in achieving the complete garden most wizards could create the trees and flowers and a few had managed the birds it wasnt the most powerful spell it couldnt move mountains but achieving the fine detail built into maligrees complex syllables took a finely tuned skill you will observe billias added nothing up my sleeve his lips began to move his hands flickered through the air a pool of golden sparks sizzled in the palm of his hand curved up formed a faint sphere began to fill in the detail legend had it that maligree one of the last of the true sourcerers created the garden as a small timeless private selflocking universe where he could have a quiet smoke and a bit of a think while avoiding the cares of the world which was itself a puzzle because no wizard could possibly understand how any being as powerful as a sourcerer could have a care in the world whatever the reason maligree retreated further and further into a world of his own and then one day closed the entrance after him the garden was a glittering ball in billiass hands the nearest wizards craned admiringly over his shoulders and looked down into a twofoot sphere that showed a delicate flowerstrewn landscape there was a lake in the middle distance complete in every ripple and purple mountains behind an interestinglooking forest tiny birds the size of bees flew from tree to tree and a couple of deer no larger than mice glanced up from their grazing and stared out at coin who said critically its quite good give it to me he took the intangible globe out of the wizards hands and held it up why isnt it bigger he said billias mopped his brow with a laceedged handkerchief well he said weakly so stunned by coins tone that he was quite unable to be affronted since the old days the efficacity of the spell has rather coin stood with his head on one side for a moment as though listening to something then he whispered a few syllables and stroked the surface of the sphere it expanded one moment it was a toy in the boys hands and the next the wizards were standing on cool grass in a shady meadow rolling down to the lake there was a gentle breeze blowing from the mountains it was scented with thyme and hay the sky was deep blue shading to purple at the zenith the deer watched the newcomers suspiciously from their grazing ground under the trees spelter looked down in shock a peacock was pecking at his bootlaces he began and stopped coin was still holding a sphere a sphere of air inside it distorted as though seen through a fisheye lens or the bottom of a bottle was the great hall of unseen university the boy looked around at the trees squinted thoughtfully at the distant snowcapped mountains and nodded at the astonished men its not bad he said i should like to come here again he moved his hands in a complicated motion that seemed in some unexplained way to turn them inside out now the wizards were back in the hall and the boy was holding the shrinking garden in his palm in the heavy shocked silence he put it back into billiass hands and said that was quite interesting now i will do some magic he raised his hands stared at billias and vanished him pandemonium broke out as it tends to on these occasions in the centre of it stood coin totally composed in a spreading cloud of greasy smoke ignoring the tumult spelter bent down slowly and with extreme care picked a peacock feather off the floor he rubbed it thoughtfully back and forth across his lips as he looked from the doorway to the boy to the vacant archchancellors chair and his thin mouth narrowed and he began to smile an hour later as thunder began to roll in the clear skies above the city and rincewind was beginning to sing gently and forget all about cockroaches and a lone mattress was wandering the streets spelter shut the door of the archchancellors study and turned to face his fellow mages there were six of them and they were very worried they were so worried spelter noted that they were listening to him a mere fifth level wizard hes gone to bed he said with a hot milk drink milk said one of the wizards with tired horror in his voice hes too young for alcohol explained the bursar oh yes silly of me the holloweyed wizard opposite said did you see what he did to the door i know what he did to billias what did he do i dont want to know brothers brothers said spelter soothingly he looked down at their worried faces and thought too many dinners too many afternoons waiting for the servants to bring in the tea too much time spent in stuffy rooms reading old books written by dead men too much gold brocade and ridiculous ceremony too much fat the whole university is ripe for one good push or one good pull i wonder if we really have um a problem here he said gravie derment of the sages of the unknown shadow hit the table with his fist good grief man he snapped some child wanders in out of the night beats two of the universitys finest sits down in the archchancellors chair and you wonder if we have a problem the boys a natural from what weve seen tonight there isnt a wizard on the disc who could stand against him why should we stand against him said spelter in a reasonable tone of voice because hes more powerful than we are yes spelters voice would have made a sheet of glass look like a ploughed field it made honey look like gravel it stands to reason gravie hesitated spelter gave him an encouraging smile ahem the ahemmer was marmaric carding head of the hoodwinkers he steepled his beringed fingers and peered sharply at spelter over the top of them the bursar disliked him intensely he had considerable doubt about the mans intelligence he suspected it might be quite high and that behind those veincrazed jowls was a mind full of brightly polished little wheels spinning like mad he does not seem overly inclined to use that power said carding what about billias and virrid childish pique said carding the other wizards stared from him to the bursar they were aware of something going on and couldnt quite put their finger on it the reason that wizards didnt rule the disc was quite simple hand any two wizards a piece of rope and they would instinctively pull in opposite directions something about their genetics or their training left them with an attitude towards mutual cooperation that made an old bull elephant with terminal toothache look like a worker ant spelter spread his hands brothers he said again do you not see what has happened here is a gifted youth perhaps raised in isolation out in the untutored um countryside who feeling the ancient call of the magic in his bones has journeyed far across tortuous terrain through who knows what perils and at last has reached his journeys end alone and afraid seeking only the steadying influence of us his tutors to shape and guide his talents who are we to turn him away into the um wintry blast shunning his the oration was interrupted by gravie blowing his nose its not winter said one of the other wizards flatly and its quite a warm night out into the treacherously changeable spring weather snarled spelter and cursed indeed would be the man who failed um at this time its nearly summer carding rubbed the side of his nose thoughtfully the boy has a staff he said who gave it to him did you ask no said spelter still glowering at the almanackical interjector carding started to look at his fingernails in what spelter considered to be a meaningful way well whatever the problem i feel sure it can wait until morning he said in what spelter felt was an ostentatiously bored voice ye gods he blew billias away said gravie and they say theres nothing in virrids room but soot they were perhaps rather foolish said carding smoothly i am sure my good brother that you would not be defeated in affairs of the art by a mere stripling gravie hesitated well er he said no of course not he looked at cardings innocent smile and coughed loudly certainly not of course billias was very foolish however some prudent caution is surely then let us all be cautious in the morning said carding cheerfully brothers let us adjourn this meeting the boy sleeps and in that at least he is showing us the way this will look better in the light i have seen things that didnt said gravie darkly who didnt trust youth he held that no good ever came of it the senior wizards filed out and back to the great hall where the dinner had got to the ninth course and was just getting into its stride it takes more than a bit of magic and someone being blown to smoke in front of him to put a wizard off his food for some unexplained reason spelter and carding were the last to leave they sat at either end of the long table watching each other like cats cats can sit at either end of a lane and watch each other for hours performing the kind of mental manoeuvring that would make a grand master appear impulsive by comparison but cats have got nothing on wizards neither was prepared to make a move until he had run the entire forthcoming conversation through his mind to see if it left him a move ahead spelter weakened first all wizards are brothers he said we should trust one another i have information i know said carding you know who the boy is spelters lips moved soundlessly as he tried to foresee the next bit of the exchange you cant be certain of that he said after a while my dear spelter you blush when you inadvertently tell the truth i didnt blush precisely said carding my point all right spelter conceded but you think you know something else the fat wizard shrugged a mere suspicion of a hunch he said but why should i ally he rolled the unfamiliar word around his tongue with you a mere fifth level i could more certainly obtain the information by rendering down your living brain i mean no offence you understand i ask only for knowledge the events of the next few seconds happened far too fast to be understood by nonwizards but went approximately like this spelter had been drawing the signs of megrims accelerator in the air under cover of the table now he muttered a syllable under his breath and fired the spell along the tabletop where it left a smoking path in the varnish and met about halfway the silver snakes of brother hushmasters potent aspspray as they spewed from cardings fingertips the two spells cannoned into one another turned into a ball of green fire and exploded filling the room with fine yellow crystals the wizards exchanged the kind of long slow glare you could roast chestnuts on bluntly carding was surprised he shouldnt have been eighthlevel wizards are seldom faced with challenging tests of magical skill in theory there are only seven other wizards of equal power and every lesser wizard is by definition well lesser this makes them complacent but spelter on the other hand was at the fifth level it may be quite tough at the top and it is probably even tougher at the bottom but halfway up its so tough you could use it for horseshoes by then all the nohopers the lazy the silly and the downright unlucky have been weeded out the fields cleared and every wizard stands alone and surrounded by mortal enemies on every side theres the pushy fours below waiting to trip him up theres the arrogant sixes above anxious to stamp out all ambition and of course all around are his fellow fives ready for any opportunity to reduce the competition a little and theres no standing still wizards of the fifth level are mean and tough and have reflexes of steel and their eyes are thin and narrow from staring down the length of that metaphorical last furlong at the end of which rests the prize of prizes the archchancellors hat the novelty of cooperation began to appeal to carding there was worthwhile power here which could be bribed into usefulness for as long as it was necessary of course afterwards it might have to be discouraged spelter thought patronage hed heard the term used though never within the university and he knew it meant getting those above you to give you a leg up of course no wizard would normally dream of giving a colleague a leg up unless it was in order to catch them on the hop the mere thought of actually encouraging a competitor but on the other hand this old fool might be of assistance for a while and afterwards well they looked at one another with mutual grudging admiration and unlimited mistrust but at least it was a mistrust each one felt he could rely on until afterwards his name is coin said spelter he says his fathers name is ipslore i wonder how many brothers has he got said spelter im sorry there hasnt been magic like that in this university in centuries said carding maybe for thousands of years ive only ever read about it we banished an ipslore thirty years ago said spelter according to the records hed got married i can see that if he had sons um theyd be wizards but i dont understand how that wasnt wizardry that was sourcery said carding leaning back in his chair spelter stared at him across the bubbling varnish sourcery the eighth son of a wizard would be a sourcerer i didnt know that it is not widely advertised yes but sourcerers were a long time ago i mean the magic was a lot stronger then um men were different it didnt have anything to do with well breeding spelter was thinking eight sons that means he did it eight times at least gosh sourcerers could do everything he went on they were nearly as powerful as the gods um there was no end of trouble the gods simply wouldnt allow that sort of thing any more depend upon it well there was trouble because the sourcerers fought among themselves said carding but one sourcerer wouldnt be any trouble one sourcerer correctly advised that is by older and wiser minds but he wants the archchancellors hat why cant he have it spelters mouth dropped open this was too much even for him carding smiled at him amiably but the hat its just a symbol said carding its nothing special if he wants it he can have it its a small enough thing just a symbol nothing more a figurehat figurehat worn by a figurehead but the gods choose the archchancellor carding raised an eyebrow do they he said and coughed well yes i suppose they do in a manner of speaking in a manner of speaking carding got up and gathered his skirts around him i think he said that you have a great deal to learn by the way where is that hat i dont know said spelter who was still quite shaken somewhere in um virrids apartments i suppose wed better fetch it said carding he paused in the doorway and stroked his beard reflectively i remember ipslore he said we were students together wild fellow odd habits superb wizard of course before he went to the bad had a funny way of twitching his eyebrow i remember when he was excited carding looked blankly across forty years of memory and shivered the hat he reminded himself lets find it it would be a shame if anything happened to it in fact the hat had no intention of letting anything happen to it and was currently hurrying towards the mended drum under the arm of a rather puzzled blackclad thief the thief as will become apparent was a special type of thief this thief was an artist of theft other thieves merely stole everything that was not nailed down but this thief stole the nails as well this thief had scandalised ankh by taking a particular interest in stealing with astonishing success things that were in fact not only nailed down but also guarded by keeneyed guards in inaccessible strongrooms there are artists that will paint an entire chapel ceiling this was the kind of thief that could steal it this particular thief was credited with stealing the jewelled disembowelling knife from the temple of offler the crocodile god during the middle of evensong and the silver shoes from the patricians finest racehorse while it was in the process of winning a race when gritoller mimpsey vicepresident of the thieves guild was jostled in the marketplace and then found on returning home that a freshlystolen handful of diamonds had vanished from their place of concealment he knew who to blame this was the type of thief that could steal the initiative the moment and the words right out of your mouth however it was the first time it had stolen something that not only asked it to in a low but authoritative voice but gave precise and somehow unarguable instructions about how it was to be disposed of it was that cusp of the night that marks the turning point of ankhmorporks busy day when those who make their living under the sun are resting after their labours and those who turn an honest dollar by the cold light of the moon are just getting up the energy to go to work the day had in fact reached that gentle point when it was too late for housebreaking and too early for burglary rincewind sat alone in the crowded smoky room and didnt take much notice when a shadow passed over the table and a sinister figure sat down opposite him there was nothing very remarkable about sinister figures in this place the drum jealousy guarded its reputation as the most stylishly disreputable tavern in ankhmorpork and the big troll that now guarded the door carefully vetted customers for suitability in the way of black cloaks glowing eyes magic swords and so forth rincewind never found out what he did to the failures perhaps he ate them when the figure spoke its husky voice came from the depths of a black velvet hood lined with fur psst it said not very said rincewind who was in a state of mind where he couldnt resist it but im working on it im looking for a wizard said the voice it sounded hoarse with the effort of disguising itself but again this was nothing unusual in the drum any wizard in particular rincewind said guardedly people could get into trouble this way one with a keen sense of tradition who would not mind taking risks for high reward said another voice it appeared to be coming from a round black leather box under the strangers arm ah said rincewind that narrows it down a bit then does this involve a perilous journey into unknown and probably dangerous lands it does as a matter of fact encounters with exotic creatures rincewind smiled could be almost certain death almost certainly rincewind nodded and picked up his hat well i wish you every success in your search he said id help you myself only im not going to what sorry i dont know why but the prospect of certain death in unknown lands at the claws of exotic monsters isnt for me ive tried it and i couldnt get the hang of it each to their own thats what i say and i was cut out for boredom he rammed his hat on his head and stood up a little unsteadily hed reached the foot of the steps leading up into the street when a voice behind him said a real wizard would have accepted he could have kept going he could have walked up the stairs out into the street got a pizza at the klatchian takeaway in sniggs alley and gone to bed history would have been totally changed and in fact would also have been considerably shorter but he would have got a good nights sleep although of course it would have been on the floor the future held its breath waiting for rincewind to walk away he didnt do this for three reasons one was alcohol one was the tiny flame of pride that flickers in the heart of even the most careful coward but the third was the voice it was beautiful it sounded like wild silk looks the subject of wizards and sex is a complicated one but as has already been indicated it does in essence boil down to this when it comes to wine women and song wizards are allowed to et drunk and croon as much as they like the reason given to young wizards was that the practice of magic is hard and demanding and incompatible with sticky and furtive activities it was a lot more sensible they were told to stop worrying about that sort of thing and really get to grips with woddeleys occult primer instead funnily enough this didnt seem to satisfy and young wizards suspected that the real reason was that the rules were made by old wizards with poor memories they were quite wrong although the real reason had long been forgotten if wizards were allowed to go around breeding all the time there was a risk of sourcery of course rincewind had been around a bit and had seen a thing or two and had thrown off his early training to such an extent that he was quite capable of spending hours at a time in a womans company without having to go off for a cold shower and a liedown but that voice would have made even a statue get down off its pedestal for a few brisk laps of the playing field and fifty pressups it was a voice that could make good morning sound like an invitation to bed the stranger threw back her hood and shook out her long hair it was almost pure white since her skin was tanned golden the general effect was calculated to hit the male libido like a lead pipe rincewind hesitated and lost a splendid opportunity to keep quiet from the top of the stairs came a thick trollish voice ere i thed you cant go freu dere she sprang forward and shoved a round leather box into rincewinds arms quick you must come with me she said youre in great danger why because i will kill you if you dont yes but hang on a moment in that case rincewind protested feebly three members of the patricians personal guard appeared at the top of the stairs their leader beamed down at the room the smile suggested that he intended to be the only one to enjoy the joke dont nobody move he suggested rincewind heard a clatter behind him as more guards appeared at the back door the drums other customers paused with their hands on assorted hilts these werent the normal city watch cautious and genially corrupt these were walking slabs of muscle and they were absolutely unbribable if only because the patrician could outbid anyone else anyway they didnt seem to be looking for anyone except the woman the rest of the clientele relaxed and prepared to enjoy the show eventually it might be worth joining it once it was certain which was the winning side rincewind felt the pressure tighten on his wrist are you mad he hissed this is messing with the man there was a swish and the sergeants shoulder suddenly sprouted a knife hilt then the girl spun around and with surgical precision planted a small foot in the groin of the first guard through the door twenty pairs of eyes watered in sympathy rincewind grabbed his hat and tried to dive under the nearest table but that grip was steel the next guard to approach got another knife in the thigh then she drew a sword like a very long needle and raised it threateningly anyone else she said one of the guards raised a crossbow the librarian sitting hunched over his drink reached out a lazy arm like two broom handles strung with elastic and slapped him backwards the bolt rebounded from the star on rincewinds hat and hit the wall by a respected procurer who was sitting two tables away his bodyguards threw another knife which just missed a thief across the room who picked up a bench and hit two guards who struck out at the nearest drinkers after that one thing sort of led to another and pretty soon everyone was fighting to get something either away out or even rincewind found himself pulled relentlessly behind the bar the landlord was sitting on his moneybags under the counter with two machetes crossed on his knees enjoying a quiet drink occasionally the sound of breaking furniture would make him wince the last thing rincewind saw before he was dragged away was the librarian despite looking like a hairy rubber sack full of water the orangutan had the weight and reach of any man in the room and was currently sitting on a guards shoulders and trying with reasonable success to unscrew his head of more concern to rincewind was the fact that he was being dragged upstairs my dear lady he said desperately what do you have in mind is there a way on to the roof yes whats in this box shhh she halted at a bend in the dingy corridor reached into a belt pouch and scattered a handful of small metal objects on the floor behind them each one was made of four nails welded together so that however the things fell one was always pointing upwards she looked critically at the nearest doorway you havent got about four feet of cheesewire on you have you she said wistfully shed drawn another throwing knife and was throwing it up and catching it again i dont think so said rincewind weakly pity ive run out okay come on why i havent done anything she went to the nearest window pushed open the shutters and paused with one leg over the sill fine she said over her shoulder stay here and explain it to the guards why are they chasing you i dont know oh come on there must be a reason oh theres plenty of reasons i just dont know which one are you coming rincewind hesitated the patricians personal guard was not known for its responsive approach to community policing preferring to cut bits off instead among the things they took a dim view of was well basically people being in the same universe running away from them was likely to be a capital offence i think maybe ill come along with you he said gallantly a girl can come to harm all alone in this city freezing fog filled the streets of ankhmorpork the flares of street traders made little yellow haloes in the smothering billows the girl peered around a corner weve lost them she said stop shaking youre safe now what you mean im all alone with a female homicidal maniac said rincewind fine she relaxed and laughed at him i was watching you she said an hour ago you were afraid that your future was going to be dull and uninteresting i want it to be dull and uninteresting said rincewind bitterly im afraid its going to be short turn your back she commanded stepping into an alley not on your life he said im going to take my clothes off rincewind spun around his face red there was a rustling behind him and a waft of scent after a while she said you can look round now he didnt you neednt worry ive put some more on he opened his eyes the girl was wearing a demure white lace dress with fetchingly puffed sleeves he opened his mouth he realised with absolute clarity that up to now the trouble he had been in was simple modest and nothing he couldnt talk his way out of given a decent chance or failing that a running start his brain started to send urgent messages to his sprinting muscles but before they could get through shed grabbed his arm again you really shouldnt be so nervous she said sweetly now lets have a look at this thing she pulled the lid off the round box in rincewinds unprotesting hands and lifted out the archchancellors hat the octarines around its crown blazed in all eight colours of the spectrum creating the kind of effects in the foggy alley that it would take a very clever special effects director and a whole battery of star filters to achieve by any nonmagical means as she raised it high in the air it created its own nebula of colours that very few people ever see in legal circumstances rincewind sank gently to his knees she looked down at him puzzled legs given out its its the hat the archchancellors hat said rincewind hoarsely his eyes narrowed youve stolen it he shouted struggling back to his feet and grabbing for the sparkling brim its just a hat give it to me this minute women musnt touch it it belongs to wizards why are you getting so worked up she said rincewind opened his mouth rincewind closed his mouth he wanted to say its the archchancellors hat dont you understand its worn by the head of all wizards well on the head of the head of all wizards no metaphorically its worn by all wizards potentially anyway and its what every wizard aspires to its the symbol of organised magic its the pointy tip of the profession its a symbol its what it means to all wizards and so on rincewind had been told about the hat on his first day at university and it had sunk into his impressionable mind like a lead weight into a jelly he wasnt sure of much in the world but he was certain that the archchancellors hat was important maybe even wizards need a little magic in their lives rincewind said the hat he stared at the girl it spoke to me like a voice in your head yes it did that to me too but it knew my name of course we do stupid fellow we are supposed to be a magic hat after all the hats voice wasnt only clothy it also had a strange choral effect as if an awful lot of voices were talking at the same time in almost perfect unison rincewind pulled himself together o great and wonderful hat he said pompously strike down this impudent girl who has had the audacity nay the oh do shut up she stole us because we ordered her to it was a near thing too but shes a rincewind hesitated shes of the female persuasion he muttered so was your mother yes well but she ran away before i was born rincewind mumbled of all the disreputable taverns in all the city you could have walked into you walked into his complained the hat he was the only wizard i could find said the girl he looked the part he had blizzard written on his hat and everything dont believe everything you read too late now anyway we havent got much time hold on hold on said rincewind urgently whats going on you wanted her to steal you why havent we got much time he pointed an accusing finger at the hat anyway you cant go around letting yourself be stolen youre supposed to be on on the archchancellors head the ceremony was tonight i should have been there something terrible is happening at the university it is vital that we are not taken back do you understand you must take us to klatch where there is someone fit to wear me why there was something very strange about the voice rincewind decided it sounded impossible to disobey as though it was solid destiny if it told him to walk over a cliff he thought hed be halfway down before it could occur to him to disobey the death of all wizardry is at hand rincewind looked around guiltily why he said the world is going to end what again i mean it said the hat sulkily the triumph of the ice giants the apocralypse the teatime of the gods the whole thing can we stop it the future is uncertain on that point rincewinds expression of determined terror faded slowly is this a riddle he said perhaps it would be simpler if you just did what youre told and didnt try to understand things said the hat young woman you will put us back in our box a great many people will shortly be looking for us hey hold on said rincewind ive seen you around here for years and you never talked before i didnt have anything that needed to be said rincewind nodded that seemed reasonable look just shove it in its box and lets get going said the girl a bit more respect if you please young lady said rincewind haughtily that is the symbol of ancient wizardry you happen to be addressing you carry it then she said hey look said rincewind scrambling along after her as she swept down the alleys crossed a narrow street and entered another alley between a couple of houses that leaned together so drunkenly that their upper storeys actually touched she stopped well she snapped youre the mystery thief arent you he said everyones been talking about you how youve taken things even from locked rooms and everything youre different than i imagined oh she said coldly how well youre shorter oh come on the street cressets not particularly common in this part of the city in any case gave out altogether here there was nothing but watchful darkness ahead i said come on she repeated what are you afraid of rincewind took a deep breath murderers muggers thieves assassins pickpockets cutpurses reevers snigsmen rapists and robbers he said thats the shades youre going into yes but people wont come looking for us in here she said oh theyll come in all right they just wont come out said rincewind nor will we i mean a beautiful young woman like you it doesnt bear thinking about i mean some of the people in there but ill have you to protect me she said rincewind thought he heard the sound of marching feet several streets away you know he sighed i knew youd say that down these mean streets a man must walk he thought and along some of them he will break into a run it is so black in the shades on this foggy spring night that it would be too dark to read about rincewinds progress through the eerie streets so the descriptive passage will lift up above the level of the ornate rooftops the forest of twisty chimneys and admire the few twinkling stars that manage to pierce the swirling billows it will try to ignore the sounds drifting up from below the patter of feet the rushes the gristly noises the groans the muffled screams it could be that some wild animal is pacing through the shades after two weeks on a starvation diet somewhere near the centre of the shades the district has never been adequately mapped is a small courtyard here at least there are torches on the walls but the light they throw is the light of the shades themselves mean reddened dark at the core rincewind staggered into the yard and hung on to the wall for support the girl stepped into the ruddy light behind him humming to herself are you all right she said nurrgh said rincewind sorry those men he bubbled i mean the way you kicked his when you grabbed them by the when you stabbed that one right in who are you my name is conina rincewind looked at her blankly for some time sorry he said doesnt ring a bell i havent been here long she said yes i didnt think you were from around these parts he said i would have heard ive taken lodgings here shall we go in rincewind glanced up at the dingy pole just visible in the smoky light of the spitting torches it indicated that the hostelry behind the small dark door was the trolls head it might be thought that the mended drum scene of unseemly scuffles only an hour ago was a seedy disreputable tavern in fact it was a reputable disreputable tavern its customers had a certain roughhewn respectability they might murder each other in an easygoing way as between equals but they didnt do it vindictively a child could go in for a glass of lemonade and be certain of getting nothing worse than a clip round the ear when his mother heard his expanded vocabulary on quiet nights and when he was certain the librarian wasnt going to come in the landlord was even known to put bowls of peanuts on the bar the trolls head was a cesspit of a different odour its customers if they reformed tidied themselves up and generally improved their image out of all recognition might just might aspire to be considered the utter dregs of humanity and in the shades a dreg is a dreg by the way the thing on the pole isnt a sign when they decided to call the place the trolls head they didnt mess about feeling sick and clutching the grumbling hatbox to his chest rincewind stepped inside silence it wrapped itself around them nearly as thickly as the smoke of a dozen substances guaranteed to turn any normal brain to cheese suspicious eyes peered through the smog a couple of dice clattered to a halt on a tabletop they sounded very loud and probably werent showing rincewinds lucky number he was aware of the stares of several score of customers as he followed the demure and surprisingly small figure of conina into the room he looked sideways into the leering faces of men who would kill him sooner than think and in fact would find it a great deal easier where a respectable tavern would have had a bar there was just a row of squat black bottles and a couple of big barrels on trestles against the wall the silence tightened like a tourniquet any minute now rincewind thought a big fat man wearing nothing but a fur vest and a leather loincloth pushed back his stool and lurched to his feet and winked evilly at his colleagues when his mouth opened it was like a hole with a hem looking for a man little lady he said she looked up at him please keep away a snake of laughter writhed around the room coninas mouth snapped shut like a letterbox ah the big man gurgled thats right i likes a girl with spirit coninas hand moved it was a pale blur stopping here and here after a few seconds of disbelief the man gave a little grunt and folded up very slowly rincewind shrank back as every other man in the room leaned forward his instinct was to run and he knew it was an instinct that would get him instantly killed it was the shades out there whatever was going to happen to him next was going to happen to him here it was not a reassuring thought a hand closed around his mouth two more grabbed the hatbox from his arms conina spun past him lifting her skirt to place a neat foot on a target beside rincewinds waist someone whimpered in his ear and collapsed as the girl pirouetted gracefully around she picked up two bottles knocked out their bottoms on the shelf and landed with their jagged ends held out in front of her morpork daggers they were called in the patois of the streets in the face of them the trolls heads clientele lost interest someone got the hat rincewind muttered through dry lips they slipped out of the back way she glared at him and made for the door the heads crowd of customers parted automatically like sharks recognising another shark and rincewind darted anxiously after her before they came to any conclusion about him they ran out into another alley and pounded down it rincewind tried to keep up with the girl people following her tended to tread on sharp things and he wasnt sure shed remember he was on her side whatever side that was a thin halfhearted drizzle was falling and at the end of the alley was a faint blue glow wait the terror in rincewinds voice was enough to slow her down whats wrong whys he stopped ill ask him said conina firmly whys he covered in snow she stopped and turned around arms thrust into her sides one foot tapping impatiently on the damp cobbles rincewind ive known you for an hour and im astonished youve lived even that long yes but i have havent i ive got a sort of talent for it ask anyone im an addict addicted to what life i got hooked on it at an early age and i dont want to give it up and take it from me this doesnt look right conina looked back at the figure surrounded by the glowing blue aura it seemed to be looking at something in its hands snow was settling on its shoulder like really bad dandruff terminal dandruff rincewind had an instinct for these things and he had a deep suspicion that the man had gone where shampoo would be no help at all they sidled along a glistening wall theres something very strange about him she conceded you mean the way hes got his own private blizzard doesnt seem to upset him hes smiling a frozen grin id call it the mans iciclehung hands had been taking the lid off the box and the glow from the hats octarines shone up into a pair of greedy eyes that were already heavily rimed with frost know him said conina rincewind shrugged ive seen him around he said hes called larry the fox or fezzy the stoat or something some sort of rodent anyway he just steals things hes harmless he looks incredibly cold conina shivered i expect hes gone to a warmer place dont you think we should shut the box its perfectly safe now said the hats voice from inside the glow and so perish all enemies of wizardry rincewind wasnt about to trust what a hat said we need something to shut the lid he muttered a knife or something you wouldnt have one would you look the other way conina warned there was a rustle and another gust of perfume you can look back now rincewind was handed a twelveinch throwing knife he took it gingerly little particles of metal glinted on its edge thanks he turned back not leaving you short am i i have others ill bet rincewind reached out gingerly with the knife as it neared the leather box its blade went white and started to steam he whimpered a little as the cold struck his hand a burning stabbing cold a cold that crept up his arm and made a determined assault on his mind he forced his numb fingers into action and with great effort nudged the edge of the lid with the tip of the blade the glow faded the snow became sleet then melted into drizzle conina nudged him aside and pulled the box out of the frozen arms i wish there was something we could do for him it seems wrong just to leave him here he wont mind said rincewind with conviction yes but we could at least lean him against the wall or something rincewind nodded and grabbed the frozen thief by his icicle arm the man slipped out of his grasp and hit the cobbles where he shattered conina looked at the pieces urg she said there was a disturbance further up the alley coming from the back door of the trolls head rincewind felt the knife snatched from his hand and then go past his ear in a flat trajectory that ended in the doorpost twenty yards away a head that had been sticking out withdrew hurriedly wed better go said conina hurrying along the alley is there somewhere we can hide your place i generally sleep at the university said rincewind hopping along behind her you must not return to the university growled the hat from the depths of its box rincewind nodded distractedly the idea certainly didnt seem attractive anyway they dont allow women inside after dark he said and before dark not then either conina sighed thats silly what have you wizards got against women then rincewinds brow wrinkled were not supposed to put anything against women he said thats the whole point sinister grey mists rolled through the docks of morpork dripping from the rigging coiling around the drunken rooftops lurking in alleys the docks at night were thought by some to be even more dangerous than the shades two muggers a sneak thief and someone who had merely tapped conina on the shoulder to ask her the time had already found this out do you mind if i ask you a question said rincewind stepping over the luckless pedestrian who lay coiled around his private pain well i mean i wouldnt like to cause offence well its just that i cant help noticing hmmm you have this certain way with strangers rincewind ducked but nothing happened what are you doing down there said conina testily sorry i know what youre thinking i cant help it i take after my father who was he then cohen the barbarian rincewind grinned to show it was a joke at least his lips moved in a desperate crescent no need to laugh about it wizard what its not my fault rincewinds lips moved soundlessly sorry he said have i got this right your father really is cohen the barbarian yes the girl scowled at rincewind everyone has to have a father she added even you i imagine she peered around a corner all clear come on she said and then when they were striding along the damp cobbles she continued i expect your father was a wizard probably i shouldnt think so said rincewind wizardry isnt allowed to run in families he paused he knew cohen hed even been a guest at one of his weddings when he married a girl of coninas age you could say this about cohen he crammed every hour full of minutes a lot of people would like to take after cohen i mean he was the best fighter the greatest thief he a lot of men would conina snapped she leaned against a wall and glared at him listen she said theres this long word see an old witch told me about itcant remember ityou wizards know about long words rincewind thought about long words marmalade he volunteered she shook her head irritably it means you take after your parents rincewind frowned he wasnt too good on the subject of parents kleptomania recidivist he hazarded begins with an h hedonism said rincewind desperately herrydeterry said conina this witch explained it to me my mother was a temple dancer for some mad god or other and father rescued her and they stayed together for a while they say i get my looks and figure from her and very good they are too said rincewind with hopeless gallantry she blushed yes well but from him i got sinews you could moor a boat with reflexes like a snake on a hot tin a terrible urge to steal things and this dreadful sensation every time i meet someone that i should be throwing a knife through his eye at ninety feet i can too she added with a trace of pride gosh it tends to put men off well it would said rincewind weakly i mean when they find out its very hard to hang on to a boyfriend except by the throat i imagine said rincewind not what you really need to build up a proper relationship no i can see said rincewind still pretty good if you want to be a famous barbarian thief but not said conina if you want to be a hairdresser ah they stared into the mist really a hairdresser said rincewind conina sighed not much call for a barbarian hairdresser i expect said rincewind i mean noone wants a shampooandbeheading its just that every time i see a manicure set i get this terrible urge to lay about me with a doublehanded cuticle knife i mean sword said conina rincewind sighed i know how it is he said i wanted to be a wizard but you are a wizard ah well of course but quiet rincewind found himself rammed against the wall where a trickle of condensed mist inexplicably began to drip down his neck a broad throwing knife had mysteriously appeared in coninas hand and she was crouched like a jungle animal or even worse a jungle human what rincewind began shut up she hissed somethings coming she stood up in one fluid movement spun on one leg and let the knife go there was a single hollow wooden thud conina stood and stared for once the heroic blood that pounded through her veins drowning out all chances of a lifetime in a pink pinny was totally at a loss ive just killed a wooden box she said rincewind looked round the corner the luggage stood in the dripping street the knife still quivering in its lid and stared at her then it changed its position slightly its little legs moving in a complicated tango pattern and stared at rincewind the luggage didnt have any features at all apart from a lock and a couple of hinges but it could stare better than a rockful of iguanas it could outstare a glasseyed statue when it came to a look of betrayed pathos the luggage could leave the average kicked spaniel moping back in its kennel it had several arrowheads and broken swords sticking in it what is it hissed conina its just the luggage said rincewind wearily does it belong to you not really sort of is it dangerous the luggage shuffled round to stare at her again theres two schools of thought about that said rincewind theres some people who say its dangerous and others who say its very dangerous what do you think the luggage raised its lid a fraction the luggage was made from the wood of the sapient peartree a plant so magical that it had nearly died out on the disc and survived only in one or two places it was a sort of rosebay willowherb only instead of bomb sites it sprouted in areas that had seen vast expenditures of magic wizards staves were traditionally made of it so was the luggage among the luggages magical qualities was a fairly simple and direct one it would follow its adopted owner anywhere not anywhere in any particular set of dimensions or country or universe or lifetime anywhere it was about as easy to shake off as a head cold and considerably more unpleasant the luggage was also extremely protective of its owner it would be hard to describe its attitude to the rest of creation but one could start with the phrase bloodyminded malevolence and work up from there conina stared at that lid it looked very much like a mouth i think id vote for terminally dangerous she said it likes crisps volunteered rincewind and then added well thats a bit strong it eats crisps what about people oh and people about fifteen so far i think were they good or bad just dead i think it also does your laundry for you you put your clothes in and they come out washed and ironed and covered in blood you know thats the funny thing said rincewind the funny thing repeated conina her eyes not leaving the luggage yes because you see the inside isnt always the same its sort of multidimensional and how does it feel about women oh its not choosy it ate a book of spells last year sulked for three days and then spat it out its horrible said conina and backed away oh yes said rincewind absolutely i mean the way it stares its very good at it isnt it we must leave for klatch said a voice from the hatbox one of these boats will be adequate commandeer it rincewind looked at the dim mistwreathed shapes that loomed in the mist under a forest of rigging here and there a riding light made a little fuzzy ball of light in the gloom hard to disobey isnt it said conina im trying said rincewind sweat prickled on his forehead go aboard now said the hat rincewinds feet began to shuffle of their own accord why are you doing this to me he moaned because i have no alternative believe me if i could have found an eighth level mage i would have done so i must not be worn why not you are the archchancellors hat and through me speak all the archchancellors who ever lived i am the university i am the lore i am the symbol of magic under the control of men and i will not be worn by a sourcerer there must be no more sourcerers the world is too worn out for sourcery conina coughed did you understand any of that she said cautiously i understood some of it but i didnt believe it said rincewind his feet remained firmly rooted to the cobbles they called me a figurehat the voice was heavy with sarcasm fat wizards who betray everything the university ever stood for and they called me a figurehat rincewind i command you and you madam serve me well and i will grant you your deepest desire how can you grant my deepest desire if the worlds going to end the hat appeared to think about it well have you got a deepest desire that need only take a couple of minutes look how can you do magic youre just a rincewinds voice trailed off i am magic proper magic besides you dont get worn by some of the worlds greatest wizards for two thousand years without learning a few things now we must flee but with dignity of course rincewind looked pathetically at conina who shrugged again dont ask me she said this looks like an adventure im doomed to have them im afraid thats genetics for you but im no good at them believe me ive been through dozens rincewind wailed ah experience said the hat no really im a terrible coward i always run away rincewinds chest heaved danger has stared me in the back of the head oh hundreds of times i dont want you to go into danger good i want you to stay out of danger rincewind sagged why me he moaned for the good of the university for the honour of wizardry for the sake of the world for your hearts desire and ill freeze you alive if you dont rincewind breathed a sigh almost of relief he wasnt good on bribes or cajolery or appeals to his better nature but threats now threats were familiar he knew where he was with threats the sun dawned on small gods day like a badly poached egg the mists had closed in over ankhmorpork in streamers of silver and gold damp warm silent there was the distant grumbling of springtime thunder out on the plains it seemed warmer than it ought to be wizards normally slept late on this morning however many of them had got up early and were wandering the corridors aimlessly they could feel the change in the air the university was filling up with magic of course it was usually full of magic anyway but it was an old comfortable magic as exciting and dangerous as a bedroom slipper but seeping through the ancient fabric was a new magic sawedged and vibrant bright and cold as comet fire it sleeted through the stones and crackled off sharp edges like static electricity on the nylon carpet of creation it buzzed and sizzled it curled wizardly beards poured in wisps of octarine smoke from fingers that had done nothing more mystical for three decades than a little light illusion how can the effect be described with delicacy and taste for most of the wizards it was like being an elderly man who suddenly faced with a beautiful young woman finds to his horror and delight and astonishment that the flesh is suddenly as willing as the spirit and in the halls and corridors of the university the word was being whispered sourcery a few wizards surreptitiously tried spells that they hadnt been able to master for years and watched in amazement as they unrolled perfectly sheepishly at first and then with confidence and then with shouts and whoops they threw fireballs to one another or produced live doves out of their hats or made multicoloured sequins fall out of the air sourcery one or two wizards stately men who had hitherto done nothing more blameworthy that eat a live oyster turned themselves invisible and chased the maids and bedders through the corridors sourcery some of the bolder spirits had tried out ancient flying spells and were bobbing a little uncertainly among the rafters sourcery only the librarian didnt share in the manic breakfast he watched the antics for some time pursing his prehensile lips and then knuckled stiffly off towards his library if anyone had bothered to notice theyd have heard him bolting the door it was deathly quiet in the library the books were no longer frantic theyd passed through their fear and out into the calm waters of abject terror and they crouched on their shelves like so many mesmerised rabbits a long hairy arm reached up and grabbed casplocks compleet lexicon of majik with precepts for the wise before it could back away soothed its terror with a longfingered hand and opened it under s the librarian smoothed the trembling page gently and ran a horny nail down the entries until he came to sourcerer n a protowizard a doorway through which new majik may enterr the world a wizard not limited by the physical capabilities of hys own bodie not by destinie nor by deathe it is written that there once werre sourcerers in the youth of the world but not may there by nowe and blessed be for sourcery is not for menne and the return of sourcery would mean the ende of the worlde if the creator hadd meant menne to bee as goddes he ould have given them wings see also thee apocralypse the legende of thee ice giants and thee teatime of the goddes the librarian read the crossreferences turned back to the first entry and stared at it through deep dark eyes for a long time then he put the book back carefully crept under his desk and pulled the blanket over his head but in the minstrel gallery over the great hall carding and spelter watched the scene with entirely different emotions standing side by side they looked almost exactly like the number what is happening said spelter hed had a sleepless night and wasnt thinking very straight magic is flowing into the university said carding thats what sourcerer means a channel for magic real magic my boy not the tired old stuff weve made do with these past centuries this is the dawning of a a new um dawn exactly a time of miracles a a anus mirabilis carding frowned yes he said eventually something like that i expect you have quite a way with words you know thank you brother the senior wizard appeared to ignore the familiarity instead he turned and leaned on the carved rail watching the magical displays below them his hands automatically went to his pockets for his tobacco pouch and then paused he grinned and snapped his fingers a lighted cigar appeared in his mouth havent been able to do that in years he mused big changes my boy they havent realised it yet but its the end of orders and levels that was just a rationing system we dont need them any more where is the boy still asleep spelter began i am here said coin he stood in the archway leading to the senior wizards quarters holding the octiron staff that was half again as tall as he was little veins of yellow fire coruscated across its matt black surface which was so dark that it looked like a slit in the world spelter felt the golden eyes bore through him as if his innermost thoughts were being scrolled across the back of his skull ah he said in a voice that he believed was jolly and avuncular but in fact sounded like a strangled death rattle after a start like that his contribution could only get worse and it did i see youre um up he said my dear boy said carding coin gave him a long freezing stare i saw you last night he said are you puissant only mildly said carding hurriedly recalling the boys tendency to treat wizardry as a terminal game of corkers but not so puissant as you im sure i am to be made archchancellor as is my destiny oh absolutely said carding no doubt about it may i have a look at your staff such an interesting design he reached out a pudgy hand it was a shocking breach of etiquette in any case no wizard should even think of touching anothers staff without his express permission but there are people who cant quite believe that children are fully human and think that the operation of normal good manners doesnt apply to them cardings fingers curled around the black staff there was a noise that spelter felt rather than heard and carding bounced across the gallery and struck the opposite wall with a sound like a sack of lard hitting a pavement dont do that said coin he turned and looked through spelter who had gone pale and added help him up he is probably not badly hurt the bursar scuttled hurriedly across the floor and bent over carding who was breathing heavily and had gone an odd colour he patted the wizards hand until carding opened one eye did you see what happened he whispered im not sure um what did happen hissed spelter it bit me the next time you touch the staff said coin matteroffactly you will die do you understand carding raised his head gently in case bits of it fell off absolutely he said and now i would like to see the university the boy continued i have heard a great deal about it spelter helped carding to his unsteady feet and supported him as they trotted obediently after the boy dont touch his staff muttered carding ill remember um not to said spelter firmly what did it feel like have you ever been bitten by a viper no in that case youll understand exactly what it felt like hmmm it wasnt like a snake bite at all they hurried after the determined figure as coin marched down the stairs and through the ravished doorway of the great hall spelter dodged in front anxious to make a good impression this is the great hall he said coin turned his golden gaze towards him and the wizard felt his mouth dry up its called that because its a hall dyou see and big he swallowed its a big hall he said fighting to stop the last of his coherence being burned away by the searchlight of that stare a great big hall which is why its called who are those people said coin he pointed with his staff the assembled wizards who had turned to watch him enter backed out of the way as though the staff was a flamethrower spelter followed the sourcerers stare coin was pointing to the portraits and statues of former archchancellors which decorated the walls fullbearded and pointhatted clutching ornamental scrolls or holding mysterious symbolic bits of astrological equipment they stared down with ferocious selfimportance or possibly chronic constipation from these walls said carding two hundred supreme mages look down upon you i dont care for them said coin and the staff streamed octarine fire the archchancellors vanished and the windows are too small the ceiling is too high everything is too old the wizards threw themselves flat as the staff flared and spat spelter pulled his hat over his ayes and rolled under a table when the very fabric of the university flowed around him wood creaked stone groaned something tapped him on the head he screamed stop that shouted carding above the din and pull your hat up show a little dignity why are you under the table then said spelter sourly we must seize our opportunity what like the staff follow me spelter emerged into a bright a horrible bright new world gone were the rough stone walls gone were the dark owlhaunted rafters gone was the tiled floor with its eyeboggling pattern of black and white tiles gone too were the high small windows with their gentle patina of antique grease raw sunlight streamed into the hall for the first time the wizards stared at one another mouths open and what they saw was not what they had always thought theyd seen the unforgiving rays transmuted rich gold embroidery into dusty gilt exposed opulent fabric as rather stained and threadbare velvet turned fine flowing beards into nicotinestained tangles betrayed splendid diamonds as rather inferior ankhstones the fresh light probed and prodded stripping away the comfortable shadows and spelter had to admit what was left didnt inspire confidence he was suddenly acutely aware that under his robes his tattered badlyfaded robes he realised with an added spasm of guilt the robes with the perforated area where the mice had got at them he was still wearing his bedroom slippers the hall was now almost all glass what wasnt glass was marble it was all so splendid that spelter felt quite unworthy he turned to carding and saw that his fellow wizard was staring at coin with his eyes gleaming most of the other wizards had the same expression if wizards werent attracted to power they wouldnt be wizards and this was real power the staff had them charmed like so many cobras carding reached out to touch the boy on the shoulder and then thought better of it magnificent he said instead he turned to the assembled wizardry and raised his arms my brothers he intoned we have in our midst a wizard of great power spelter tugged at his robe he nearly killed you he hissed carding ignored him and i propose carding swallowed i propose him for archchancellor there was a moments silence and then a burst of cheering and shouts of dissent several quarrels broke out at the back of the crowd the wizards nearer the front werent quite so ready to argue they could see the smile on coins face it was bright and cold like the smile on the face of the moon there was a commotion and an elderly wizard fought his way to the front of the throng spelter recognised ovin hakardly a seventhlevel wizard and a lecturer in lore he was red with anger except where he was white with rage when he spoke his words seared through the air like so many knives clipped as topiary crisp as biscuits are you mad he said noone but a wizard of the eighth level may become archchancellor and he must be elected by the other most senior wizards in solemn convocation it is the lore hakardly had studied the lore of magic for years and because magic always tends to be a twoway process it had made its mark on him he gave the impression of being as fragile as a cheese straw and in some unaccountable way the dryness of his endeavours had left him with the ability to pronounce punctuation he stood vibrating with indignation and he became aware he was rapidly standing alone in fact he was the centre of an expanding circle of empty floor fringed with wizards who were suddenly ready to swear that theyd never clapped eyes on him in their life coin had raised his staff hakardly raised an admonitory finger you do not frighten me young man he snapped talented you may be but magical talent alone is not enough there are many other qualities required of a great wizard administrative ability for example and wisdom and the coin lowered his staff the lore applies to all wizards does it not he said absolutely it was drawn up but i am not a wizard lord hakardly the wizard hesitated ah he said and hesitated again good point he said but i am well aware of the need for wisdom foresight and good advice and i would be honoured if you could see your way clear to providing those muchvalued commodities for example why is it that wizards do not rule the world what it is a simple question there are in this room coins lips moved for a fraction of a second four hundred and seventytwo wizards skilled in the most subtle of arts yet all you rule are these few acres of rather inferior architecture why is this the most senior wizards exchanged knowing glances such it may appear said hakardly eventually but my child we have domains beyond the ken of the temporal power his eyes gleamed magic can surely take the mind to inner landscape of arcane yes yes said coin yet there are extremely solid walls outside your university why is this carding ran his tongue over his lips it was extraordinary the child was speaking his thoughts you squabble for power said coin sweetly and yet beyond these walls to the man who carts nightsoil or the average merchant is there really so much difference between a highlevel mage and a mere conjuror hakardly stared at him in complete and untrammelled astonishment child its obvious to the meanest citizen he said the robes and trimmings themselves ah said coin the robes and trimmings of course a short heavy and thoughtful silence filled the hall it seems to me said coin eventually that wizards rule only wizards who rules in the reality outside as far as the city is concerned that would be the patrician lord vetinari said carding with some caution and is he a fair and just ruler carding thought about it the patricians spy network was said to be superb i would say he said carefully that he is unfair and unjust but scrupulously evenhanded he is unfair and unjust to everyone without fear or favour and you are content with this said coin carding tried not to catch hakardlys eye its not a case of being content with it he said i suppose weve not given it much thought a wizards true vocation you see is it really true that the wise suffer themselves to be ruled in this way carding growled of course not dont be silly we merely tolerate it thats what wisdom is all about youll find that out when you grow up its a case of biding ones time where is this patrician i would like to see him that can be arranged of course said carding the patrician is always graciously pleased to grant wizards an interview and now i will grant him an interview said coin he must learn that wizards have bided their time long enough stand back please he pointed the staff the temporal ruler of the sprawling city of ankhmorpork was sitting in his chair at the foot of the steps leading up to the throne looking for any signs of intelligence in intelligence reports the throne had been empty for more than two thousand years since the death of the last of the line of the kings of ankh legend said that one day the city would have a king again and went on with various comments about magic swords strawberry birthmarks and all the other things that legends gabble on about in these circumstances in fact the only real qualification now was the ability to stay alive for more than about five minutes after revealing the existence of any magic swords or birthmarks because the great merchant families of ankh had been ruling the city for the last twenty centuries and were about to relinquish power as the average limpet is to let go of its rock the current patrician head of the extremely rich and powerful vetinari family was thin tall and apparently as coldblooded as a dead penguin just by looking at him you could tell he was the sort of man youd expect to keep a white cat and caress it idly while sentencing people to death in a piranha tank and youd hazard for good measure that he probably collected rare thin porcelain turning it over and over in his bluewhite fingers while distant screams echoed from the depths of the dungeons you wouldnt put it past him to use the word exquisite and have thin lips he looked the kind of person who when they blink you mark it off on the calendar practically none of this was in fact the case although he did have a small and exceedingly elderly wirehaired terrier called wuffles that smelled badly and wheezed at people it was said to be the only thing in the entire world he truly cared about he did of course sometimes have people horribly tortured to death but this was considered to be perfectly acceptable behaviour for a civic ruler and generally approved of by the overwhelming majority of citizens the people of ankh are of a practical persuasion and felt that the patricians edict forbidding all street theatre and mime artists made up for a lot of things he didnt administer a reign of terror just the occasional light shower the patrician sighed and laid the latest report on top of the large heap beside the chair when he had been a little boy he had seen a showman who could keep a dozen plates spinning in the air if the man had been capable of working the same trick with a hundred of them lord vetinari considered he would just about begin to be ready for training in the art of ruling ankhmorpork a city once described as resembling an overturned termite heap without the charm he glanced out of the window at the distant pillar of the tower of art the centre of unseen university and wondered vaguely whether any of those tiresome old fools could come up with a better way of collating all this paperwork they wouldnt of course you couldnt expect a wizard to understand anything as basic as elementary civic espionage he sighed again and picked up the transcript of what the president of the thieves guild had said to his deputy at midnight in the soundproof room hidden behind the office in the guild headquarters and was in the great ha was not in the great hall of unseen university where he had spent some interminable dinners but there were a lot of wizards around him and they were different like death which some of the citys less fortunate citizens considered he intimately resembled the patrician never got angry until he had time to think about it but sometimes he thought very quickly he stared around at the assembled wizards but there was something about them that choked the words of outrage in his throat they looked like sheep who had suddenly found a trapped wolf at exactly the same time as they heard about the idea of unity being strength there was something about their eyes what is the meaning of this outr he hesitated and concluded this a merry small gods day prank is it his eyes swivelled to meet those of a small boy holding a long metal staff the child was smiling the oldest smile the patrician had ever seen carding coughed my lord he began out with it man snapped lord vetinari carding had been diffident but the patricians tone was just that tiny bit too peremptory the wizards knuckles went white i am a wizard of the eighth level he said quietly and you will not use that tone to me well said said coin take him to the dungeons said carding we havent got any dungeons said spelter this is a university then take him to the wine cellars snapped carding and while youre down there build some dungeons have you the faintest inkling of what you are doing said thepatrician i demand to know the meaning of this you demand nothing at all said carding and the meaning is that from now on the wizards will rule as it was ordained now take you rule ankhmorpork wizards who can barely govern themselves yes carding was aware that this wasnt the last word in repartee and was even more alive to the fact that the dog wuffles who had been teleported along with his master had waddled painfully across the floor and was peering shortsightedly at the wizards boots then all truly wise men would prefer the safety of a nice deep dungeon said the patrician and now you will cease this foolery and replace me in my palace and it is just possible that we will say no more about this or at least that you wont have the chance to wuffles gave up investigating cardings boots and trotted towards coin shedding a few hairs on the way this pantomime has gone on long enough said the patrician now i am getting wuffles growled it was a deep primeval noise which struck a chord in the racial memory of all those present and filled them with an urgent desire to climb a tree it suggested long grey shapes hunting in the dawn of time it was astonishing that such a small animal could contain so much menace and all of it was aimed at the staff in coins hand the patrician strode forward to snatch the animal and carding raised his hand and sent a blaze of orange and blue fire searing across the room the patrician vanished on the spot where he had been standing a small yellow lizard blinked and glared with malevolent reptilian stupidity carding looked in astonishment at his fingers as if for the first time all right he whispered hoarsely the wizards stared down at the panting lizard and then out at the city sparkling in the early morning light out there was the council of aldermen the city watch the guild of thieves the guild of merchants the priesthoodsand none of them knew what was about to hit them it has begun said the hat from its box on the deck what has said rincewind the rule of sourcery rincewind looked blank is that good do you ever understand anything anyone says to you rincewind felt on firmer ground here no he said not always not lately not often are you sure you are a wizard said conina its the only thing ive ever been sure of he said with conviction how strange rincewind sat on the luggage in the sun on the foredeck of the ocean waltzer as it lurched peacefully across the green waters of the circle sea around them men did what he was sure were important nautical things and he hoped they were doing them correctly because next to heights he hated depths most of all you look worried said conina who was cutting his hair rincewind tried to make his head as small as possible as the blades flashed by thats because i am what exactly is the apocralypse rincewind hesitated well he said its the end of the world sort of sort of sort of the end of the world you mean we wont be certain well look around and say pardon me did you hear something its just that no two seers have ever agreed about it there have been all kinds of vague predictions quite mad some of them so it was called the apocralypse he looked embarrassed its a sort of apocryphal apocalypse a kind of pun you see not very good no i suppose not coninas scissors snipped busily i must say the captain seemed quite happy to have us aboard she observed thats because they think its lucky to have a wizard on the boat said rincewind it isnt of course lots of people believe it she said oh its lucky for other people just not for me i cant swim what not a stroke rincewind hesitated and twiddled the star on his hat cautiously about how deep is the sea here would you say approximately he said about a dozen fathoms i believe then i could probably swim about a dozen fathoms whatever they are stop trembling like that i nearly had your ear off conina snapped she glared at a passing seaman and waved her scissors whats the matter you never saw a man have a haircut before someone up in the rigging made a remark which caused a ripple of ribald laughter in the topgallants unless they were forecastles i shall pretend i didnt hear that said conina and gave the comb a savage yank dislodging numerous inoffensive small creatures well you should keep still its a little difficult to keep still knowing who it is thats waving a couple of steel blades around my head and so the morning passed with scudding wavelets the creaking of the rigging and a rather complex layer cut rincewind had to admit looking at himself in a shard of mirror that there was a definite improvement the captain had said that they were bound for the city of al khali on the hubward coast of klatch like ankh only with sand instead of mud said rincewind leaning over the rail but quite a good slave market slavery is immoral said conina firmly is it gosh said rincewind would you like me to trim your beard said conina hopefully she stopped scissors drawn and stared out to sea is there a kind of sailor that uses a canoe with sort of extra bits on the side and a sort of red eye painted on the front and a small sail she said ive heard of klatchian slave pirates said rincewind but this is a big boat i shouldnt think one of them would dare attack it one of them wouldnt said conina still staring at the fuzzy area where the sea became the sky but these five might rincewind peered at the distant haze and then looked up at the man on watch who shook his head come on he chuckled with all the humour of a blocked drain you cant really see anything out there can you ten men in each canoe said conina grimly look a jokes a joke with long curvy swords well i cant see a their long and rather dirty hair blowing in the wind with split ends i expect said rincewind sourly are you trying to be funny me and heres me without a weapon said conina sweeping back across the deck i bet there isnt a decent sword anywhere on this boat never mind perhaps theyve just come for a quick shampoo while conina rummaged frantically in her pack rincewind sidled over to the archchancellors hatbox and cautiously raised the lid theres nothing out there is there he asked how should i know put me on what on my head good grief but im not an archchancellor said rincewind i mean ive heard of coolheaded but i need to use your eyes now put me on on your head um trust me rincewind couldnt disobey he gingerly removed his battered grey hat looked longingly at its dishevelled star and lifted the archchancellors hat out of its box it felt rather heavier than hed expected the octarines around the crown were glowing faintly he lowered it carefully on to his new hairstyle clutching the brim tightly in case he felt the first icy chill in fact he simply felt incredibly light and there was a feeling of great knowledge and power not actually present but just mentally speaking on the tip of his metaphorical tongue odd scraps of memory flickered across his mind and they werent any memories he remembered remembering before he probed gently as one touches a hollow tooth with the tongue and there they were two hundred dead archchancellors dwindling into the leaden freezing past one behind the other watched him with blank grey eyes thats why its so cold he told himself the warmth seeps into the dead world oh no when the hat spoke he saw two hundred pairs of pale lips move who are you rincewind thought rincewind and in the inner recesses of his head he tried to think privately to himself help he felt his knees begin to buckle under the weight of centuries whats it like being dead he thought death is but a sleep said the dead mages but what does it feel like rincewind thought you will have an unrivalled chance to find out when those war canoes get here rincewind with a yelp of terror he thrust upwards and forced the hat off his head real life and sound flooded back in but since someone was frantically banging a gong very close to his ear this was not much of an improvement the canoes were visible to everyone now cutting through the water with an eerie silence those blackclad figures manning the paddles should have been whooping and screaming it wouldnt have made it any better but it would have seemed more appropriate the silence bespoke an unpleasant air of purpose gods that was awful he said mind you so is this crew members scurried across the deck cutlasses in hand conina tapped rincewind on the shoulder theyll try to take us alive she said oh said rincewind weakly good then he remembered something else about klatchian slavers and his throat went dry youll youll be the one theyll really be after he said ive heard about what they do should i know said conina to rincewinds horror she didnt appear to have found a weapon theyll throw you in a seraglio she shrugged could be worse but its got all these spikes and when they shut the door hazarded rincewind the canoes were close enough now to see the determined expressions of the rowers thats not a seraglio thats an iron maiden dont you know what a seraglio is um she told him he went crimson anyway theyll have to capture me first said conina primly its you who should be worrying why me youre the only other one whos wearing a dress rincewind bridled its a robe robe dress you better hope they know the difference a hand like a bunch of bananas with rings on grabbed rincewinds shoulder and spun him around the captain a hublander built on generous bearlike lines beamed at him through a mass of facial hair hah he said they know not that we aboard a wizard have to create in their bellies the burning green fire hah the dark forests of his eyebrows wrinkled as it became apparent that rincewind wasnt immediately ready to hurl vengeful magic at the invaders hah he insisted making a mere single syllable do the work of a whole string of bloodcongealing threats yes well im just im just girding my loins said rincewind hats what im doing girding them green fire you want also to make hot lead run in their bones said the captain also their skins to blister and living scorpions without mercy to eat their brains from inside and the leading canoe came alongside and a couple of grapnels thudded into the rail as the first of the savers appeared the captain hurried away drawing his sword he stopped for a moment and turned to rincewind you gird quickly he said or no loins hah rincewind turned to conina who was leaning on the rail examining her fingernails youd better get on with it she said thats fifty green fires and hot leads to go with a side order for blisters and scorpions hold the mercy this sort of thing is always happening to me he moaned he peered over the rail to what he thought of as the main floor of the boat the invaders were winning by sheer weight of numbers using nets and ropes to tangle the struggling crew they worked in absolute silence clubbing and dodging avoiding the use of swords wherever possible musnt damage the merchandise said conina rincewind watched in horror as the captain went down under a press of dark shapes screaming green fire green fire rincewind backed away he wasnt any good at magic but hed had a hundred per cent success at staying alive up to now and didnt want to spoil the record all he needed to do was to learn how to swim in the time it took to dive into the sea it was worth a try what are you waiting for lets go while theyre occupied he said to conina i need a sword she said youll be spoilt for choice in a minute one will be enough rincewind kicked the luggage come on he snarled youve got a lot of floating to do the luggage extended its little legs with exaggerated nonchalance turned slowly and settled down beside the girl traitor said rincewind to its hinges the battle already seemed to be over five of the raiders stalked up the ladder to the afterdeck leaving most of their colleagues to round up the defeated crew below the leader pulled down his mask and leered briefly and swarthily at conina and then he turned and leered for a slightly longer period at rincewind this is a robe said rincewind quickly and youd better watch out because im a wizard he took a deep breath lay a finger on me and youll make me wish you hadnt i warn you a wizard wizards dont make good strong slaves mused the leader absolutely right said rincewind so if youll just see your way clear to letting me go the leader turned back to conina and signalled to one of his companions he jerked a tattooed thumb towards rincewind do not kill him too quickly in fact he paused and treated rincewind to a smile full of teeth maybe yes and why not can you sing wizard i might be able to said rincewind cautiously why you could be just the man the seriph needs for a job in the harem a couple of slavers sniggered it could be a unique opportunity the leader went on encouraged by this audience appreciation there was more broadminded approval from behind him rincewind backed away i dont think so he said thanks all the same im not cut out for that kind of thing oh but you could be said the leader his eyes bright you could be oh for goodness sake muttered conina she glanced at the men on either side of her and then her hands moved the one stabbed with the scissors was possibly better off than the one she raked with the comb given the kind of mess a steel comb can make of a face then she reached down snatched up a sword dropped by one of the stricken men and lunged at the other two the leader turned at the screams and saw the luggage behind him with its lid open and then rincewind cannoned into the back of him pitching him forward into whatever oblivion lay in the multidimensional depths of the chest there was the start of a bellow abruptly cut off then there was a click like the shooting of the bolt on the gates of hell rincewind backed away tremblinga unique opportunity he muttered under his breath having just got the reference at least he had a unique opportunity to watch conina fight not many men ever got to see it twice her opponents started off grinning at the temerity of a slight young girl in attacking them and then rapidly passed through various stages of puzzlement doubt concern and abject gibbering terror as they apparently became the centre of a flashing tightening circle of steel she disposed of the last of the leaders bodyguard with a couple of thrusts that made rincewinds eyes water and with a sigh vaulted the rail on the main deck to rincewinds annoyance the luggage barrelled after her cushioning its fall by dropping heavily on to a slaver and adding to the sudden panic of the invaders because while it was bad enough to be attacked with deadly and ferocious accuracy by a rather pretty girl in a white dress with flowers on it it was even worse for the male ego to be tripped up and bitten by a travel accessory it was pretty bad for all the rest of the male too rincewind peered over the railing showoff he muttered a throwing knife clipped the wood near his chin and ricocheted past his ear he raised his hand to the sudden stinging pain and stared at in in horror before gently passing out it wasnt blood in general he couldnt stand the sight of it was just his blood in particular that was so upsetting the market in sator square the wide expanse of cobbles outside the black gates of the university was in full cry it was said that everything in ankhmorpork was for sale except for the beer and the women both of which one merely hired and most of the merchandise was available in sator market which over the years had grown stall by stall until the newcomers were up against the ancient stones of the university itself in fact they made a handy display area for bolts of cloth and racks of charms noone noticed the gates swing back but a silence rolled out of the university spreading out across the noisy crowded square like the first fresh wavelets of the tide trickling over a brackish swamp in fact it wasnt true silence at all but a great roar of antinoise silence isnt the opposite of sound it is merely its absence but this was the sound that lies on the far side of silence antinoise its shadowy decibels throttling the market cries like a fall of velvet the crowds stared around wildly mouthing like goldfish and with about as much effect all heads turned towards the gates something else was flowing out besides that cacophony of hush the stalls nearest the empty gateway began to grind across the cobbles shedding merchandise their owners dived out of the way as the stalls hit the row behind them and scraped relentlessly onwards piling up until a wide avenue of clean empty stones stretched the whole width of the square ardrothy longstaff purveyor of pies full of personality peered over the top of the wreckage of his stall in time to see the wizards emerge he knew wizards or up until now hed always thought he did they were vague old boys harmless enough in their way dressed like ancient sofas always ready customers for any of his merchandise that happened to be marked down on account of age and rather more personality than a prudent housewife would be prepared to put up with but these wizards were something new to ardrothy they walked out into sator square as if they owned it little blue sparks flashed around their feet they seemed a little taller somehow or perhaps it was just the way they carried themselves yes that was it ardrothy had a touch of magic in his genetic makeup and as he watched the wizards sweep across the square it told him that the very best thing he could do for his health would be to pack his knives and mincers in his little pack and have it away out of the city at any time in the next ten minutes the last wizard in the group lagged behind his colleagues and looked around the square with disdain there used to be fountains out here he said you people be off the traders stared at one another wizards normally spoke imperiously that was to be expected but there was an edge to the voice that noone had heard before it had knuckles in it ardrothys eyes swivelled sideways arising out of the ruins of his jellied starfish and clam stall like an avenging angel dislodging various molluscs from his beard and spitting vinegar was miskin koble who was said to be able to open oysters with one hand years of pulling limpets off rocks and wrestling the giant cockles in ankh bay had given him the kind of physical development normally associated with tectonic plates he didnt so much stand up as unfold then he thudded his way towards the wizard and pointed a trembling finger at the ruins of his stall from which half a dozen enterprising lobsters were making a determined bid for freedom muscles moved around the edges of his mouth like angry eels did you do that he demanded stand aside oaf said the wizard three words which in the opinion of ardrothy gave him the ongoing life expectancy of a glass cymbal i hates wizards said koble i really hates wizards so i am going to hit you all right he brought his fist back and let fly the wizard raised an eyebrow yellow fire sprang up around the shellfish salesman there was a noise like tearing silk and koble had vanished all that was left was his boots standing forlornly on the cobbles with little wisps of smoke coming out of them noone knows why smoking boots always remain no matter how big the explosion it seems to be just one of those things it seemed to the watchful eyes of ardrothy that the wizard himself was nearly as socked as the crowd but he rallied magnificently and gave his staff a flourish you people had better jolly well learn from this he said noone raises their hand to a wizard do you understand there are going to be a lot of changes around here yes what do you want this last comment was to ardrothy who was trying to sneak past unnoticed he scrabbled quickly in his pie tray i was just wondering if your honourship would care to purchase one of these finest pies he said hurriedly full of nourish watch closely pieselling person said the wizard he stretched out his hand made a strange gesture with his fingers and produced a pie out of the air it was fat goldenbrown and beautifully glazed just by looking at it ardrothy knew it was packed edge to edge with prime lean pork with none oft hose spacious areas of good fresh air under the lid that represented his own profit margin it was the kind of pie piglets hope to be when they grew up his heart sank his ruin was floating in front of him with shortcrust pastry on it want a taste said the wizard theres plenty more where that came from wherever it came from said ardrothy he looked past the shiny pastry to the face of the wizard and in the manic gleam of those eyes he saw the world turning upside down he turned away a broken man and set out for the nearest city gate as if it wasnt bad enough that wizards were killing people he thought bitterly they were taking away their livelihood as well a bucket of water splashed into rincewinds face jerking him out of a dreadful dream in which a hundred masked women were attempting to trim his hair with broadswords and cutting it very fine indeed some people having a nightmare like that would dismiss it as castration anxiety but rincewinds subconscious knew beingcuttotinybitsmortal dread when it saw it it saw it most of the time he sat up are you all right said conina anxiously rincewind swivelled his eyes around the cluttered deck not necessarily he said cautiously there didnt seem to be any blackclad slavers around at least vertically there were a good many crew members all of them maintaining a respectful distance from conina only the captain stood reasonably close an inane grin on his face they left said conina took what they could and left they bastards said the captain but they paddle pretty fast conina winced as he gave her a ringing slap on the back she fight real good for a lady he added yes rincewind got unsteadily to his feet the boat was scudding along cheerfully towards a distant smear on the horizon that had to be hubward klatch he was totally unharmed he began to cheer up a bit the captain gave them both a hearty nod and hurried off to shout orders connected with sails and ropes and things conina sat down on the luggage which didnt seem to object he said hes so grateful hell take us all the way to al khali she said i thought thats what we arranged anyway said rincewind i saw you give him money and everything yes but he was planning to overpower us and sell me as a slave when he got there what not sell me said rincewind and then snorted of course its the wizards robes he wouldnt dare um actually he said hed have to give you away said conina picking intently at an imaginary splinter on the luggages lid give me away yes um sort of like one free wizard with every concubine sold um i dont see what vegetables have got to do with it conina gave him a long hard stare and when he didnt break into a smile she sighed and said why are you wizards always nervous around women rincewind bridled at this slur i like that he said ill have you know that look anyway the point is i get along very well with women in general its just women with swords that upset me he considered this for a while and added everyone with swords upset me if it comes to that conina picked industriously at the splinter the luggage gave a contented creak i know something else thatll upset you she muttered hmmm the hats gone what i couldnt help it they just grabbed whatever they could the slavers have made off with the hat dont you take that tone with me i wasnt having a quiet sleep at the time rincewind waved his hands frantically nonono dont get excited i wasnt taking any tone i want to think about this the captain says theyll probably go back to al khali he heard conina say theres a place where the criminal element hang out and we can soon i dont see why we have to do anything said rincewind the hat wanted to keep out the way of the university and i shouldnt think those slavers ever drop in there for a quick sherry youll let them run off with it said conina in genuine astonishment well someones got to do it the way i see it why me but you said its the symbol of wizardry what wizards all aspire to you cant just let it go like that you watch me rincewind sat back he felt oddly surprised he was making a decision it was his it belonged to him noone was forcing him to make it sometimes it seemed that his entire life consisted of getting into trouble because of what other people wanted but this time hed made a decision and that was that hed get off the boat at al khali and find some way of going home someone else could save the world and he wished them luck hed made a decision his brow furrowed why didnt he feel happy about it because its the wrong bloody decision you idiot right he thought ive had enough voices in my head out but i belong here you mean youre me your conscience oh you cant let the hat be destroyed its the symbol all right i know the symbol of magic under the lore magic under the control of mankind you dont want to go back to those dark ians what ians do i mean aeons right aeons go back aeons to the time when raw magic ruled the whole framework of reality trembled daily it was pretty terrible i can tell me how do i know racial memory gosh have i got one of those well a part of one yes all right but why me in your soul you know you are a true wizard the word wizard is engraved on your heart yes but the trouble is i keep meeting people who might try to find out said rincewind miserably what did you say said conina rincewind stared at the smudge on the horizon and sighed just talking to myself he said carding surveyed the hat critically he walked around the table and stared at it from a new angle at last he said its pretty good where did you get the octarines theyre just very good ankhstones said spelter they fooled you did they it was a magnificent hat in fact spelter had to admit it looked a lot better than the real thing the old archchancellors hat had looked rather battered its gold thread tarnished and unravelling the replica was a considerable improvement it had style i especially like the lace said carding it took ages why didnt you try magic carding waggled his fingers and grasped the tall cool glass that appeared in midair under its paper umbrella and fruit salad it contained some sticky and expensive alcohol didnt work said spelter just couldnt seem um to get it right i had to sew every sequin on by hand he picked up the hatbox carding coughed into his drink dont put it away just yet he said and took it out of the bursars hands ive always wanted to try this he turned to the big mirror on the bursars wall and reverently lowered the hat on his rather grubby locks it was the ending of the first day of the sourcery and the wizards had managed to change everything except themselves they had all tried on the quiet and when they thought noone else was looking even spelter had a go in the privacy of his study he had managed to become twenty years younger with a torso you could crack rocks on but as soon as he stopped concentrating he sagged very unpleasantly back into his old familiar shape and age there was something elastic about the way you were the harder you threw it the faster it came back the worse it was when it hit too spiked iron balls broadswords and large heavy sticks with nails in were generally considered pretty fearsome weapons but they were nothing at all compared to twenty years suddenly applied with considerable force to the back of the head this was because sourcery didnt seem to work on things that were instrinsically magical nevertheless the wizards had made a few important improvements cardings robe for example had become a silk and lace confection of overpoweringly expensive tastelessness and gave him the appearance of a big red jelly draped with antimacassars it suits me dont you think said carding he adjusted the hat brim giving it an inappropriately rakish air spelter said nothing he was looking out of the window there had been a few improvements all right it had been a busy day the old stone walls had vanished there were some rather nice railings now beyond them the city fairly sparkled a poem in white marble and red tiles the river ankh was no longer the siltladen sewer hed grown up knowing but a glittering glassclear ribbon in which a nice touch fat carp mouthed and swam in water pure as snowmelt from the air ankhmorpork must have been blinding it gleamed the detritus of millennia had been swept away it made spelter strangely uneasy he felt out of place as though he was wearing new clothes that itched of course he was wearing new clothes and they did itch but that wasnt the problem the new world was all very nice it was exactly how it should be and yet and yet had he wanted to change he thought or had he only wanted things rearranged more suitably i said dont you think it was made for me said carding spelter turned back his face blank um the hat man oh um very suitable with a sigh carding removed the baroque headpiece and carefully replaced it in its box wed better take it to him he said hes starting to ask about it im still bothered about where the real hat is said spelter its in here said carding firmly tapping the lid i mean the um real one this is the real one i meant this is the archchancellors hat said carding carefully you should know you made it yes butbegan the bursar wretchedly after all you wouldnt make a forgery would you not as um such its just a hat its whatever people think it is people see the archchancellor wearing it they think its the original hat in a certain sense it is things are defined by what they do and people of course fundamental basis of wizardry is that carding paused dramatically and plonked the hatbox into spelters arms cogitum ergot hatto you might say spelter had made a special study of old languages and did his best i think therefore i am a hat he hazarded what said carding as they set off down the stairs to the new incarnation of the great hall i considered im a mad hat spelter suggested just shut up all right the haze still hung over the city its curtains of silver and gold turned to blood by the light of the setting sun which streamed in through the windows of the hall coin was sitting on a stool with his staff across his knees it occurred to spelter that he had never seen the boy without it which was odd most wizards kept their staves under the bed or hooked up over the fireplace he didnt like this staff it was black but not because that was its colour more because it seemed to be a moveable hole into some other more unpleasant set of dimensions it didnt have eyes but nevertheless it seemed to stare at spelter as if it knew his innermost thoughts which at the moment was more than he did his skin prickled as the two wizards crossed the floor and felt the blast of a raw magic flowing outwards from the seated figure several dozen of the most senior wizards were clustered around the stool staring in awe at the floor spelter craned to see and saw the world it floated in a puddle of black night somehow set into the floor itself and spelter knew with a terrible certainty that it was the world not some image or simple projection there were cloud patterns and everything there were the frosty wastes of the hublands the counterweight continent the circle sea the rimfall all tiny and pastelcoloured but nevertheless real someone was speaking to him um he said and the sudden drop in metaphorical temperature jerked him back into reality he realised with horror that coin had just directed a remark at him im sorry he corrected himself it was just that the world so beautiful our spelter is an aesthete said coin and there was a brief chuckle from one or two wizards who knew what the word meant but as to the world it could be improved i had said spelter that everywhere we look we can see cruelty and inhumanity and greed which tell us that the world is indeed governed badly does it not spelter was aware of two dozen pairs of eyes turning to him um he said well you cant change human nature there was dead silence spelter hesitated can you he said that remains to be seen said carding but if we change the world then human nature also will change is that not so brothers we have the city said one of the wizards i myself have created a castle we rule the city but who rules the world said carding there must be a thousand petty kings and emperors and chieftains down there not one of whom can read without moving his lips said a wizard the patrician could read said spelter not if you cut off his index finger said carding what happened to the lizard anyway never mind the point is the world should surely be run by men of wisdom and philosophy it must be guided weve spent centuries fighting amongst ourselves but together who knows what we could do today the city tomorrow the world said someone at the back of the crowd carding nodded tomorrow the world and he calculated quicklyon friday the universe that leaves the weekend free thought spelter he recalled the box in his arms and held it out towards coin but carding floated in front of him seized the box in one fluid movement and offered it to the boy with a flourish the archchancellors hat he said rightfully yours we think coin took it for the first time spelter saw uncertainty cross his face isnt there some sort of formal ceremony he said carding coughed ier no he said no i dont think so he glanced up at the other senior mages who shook their heads no weve never had one apart from the feast of course er you see its not like a coronation the archchancellor you see he leads the fraternity of wizards hes cardings voice ran down slowly in the light of that golden gaze hes you see hes the firstamong equals he stepped back hurriedly as the staff moved eerily until it pointed towards him once again coin seemed to be listening to an inner voice no he said eventually and when he spoke next his voice had that wide echoing quality that if you are not a wizard you can only achieve with a lot of very expensive audio equipment there will be a ceremony there must be a ceremony people must understand that wizards are ruling but it will not be here i will select a place and all the wizards who have passed through these gates will attend is that understood some of them live far off said carding carefully it will take them some time to travel so when were you thinking of they are wizards shouted coin they can be here in the twinkling of an eye i have given them the power besides his voice dropped back to something like normal pitch the university is finished it was never the true home of magic only its prison i will build us a new place he lifted the new hat out of its box and smiled at it spelter and carding held their breath but they looked around hakardly the lore master had spoken and now stood with his mouth opening and shutting coin turned to him one eyebrow raised you surely dont mean to close the university said the old wizard his voice trembling it is no longer necessary said coin its a place of dust and old books it is behind us is that not so brothers there was a chorus of uncertain mumbling the wizards found it hard to imagine life without the old stones of uu although come to think of it there was a lot of dust of course and the books were pretty old after all brothers who among you has been into your dark library these past few days the magic is inside you now not imprisoned between covers is that not a joyous thing is there not one among you who has done more magic real magic in the past twentyfour hours than he has done in the whole of his life before is there one among you who does not in his heart of hearts truly agree with me spelter shuddered in his heart of hearts an inner spelter had woken and was struggling to make himself heard it was a spelter who suddenly longed for those quiet days only hours ago when magic was gentle and shuffled around the place in old slippers and always had time for a sherry and wasnt like a hot sword in the brain and above all didnt kill people terror seized him as he felt his vocal chords twang to attention and prepare despite all his efforts to disagree the staff was trying to find him he could feel it searching for him it would vanish him just like poor old billias he clamped his jaws together but it wouldnt work he felt his chest heave his jaw creaked carding shifting uneasily stood on his foot spelter yelped sorry said carding is something the matter spelter said coin spelter hopped on one leg suddenly released his body flooding with relief as his toes flooded with agony more grateful than anyone in the entire history of the world that seventeen stones of wizardry had chosen his instep to come down heavily on his scream seemed to have broken the spell coin sighed and stood up it has been a good day he said it was two oclock in the morning river mists coiled like snakes through the streets of ankhmorpork but they coiled alone wizards did not hold with other people staying up after midnight and so noone did they slept the troubled sleep of the enchanted instead in the plaza of broken moons once the boutique of mysterious pleasures from whose flarelit and curtainhung stalls the latenight reveller could obtain anything from a plate of jellied eels to the venereal disease of his choice the mists coiled and dripped into chilly emptiness the stalls had gone replaced by gleaming marble and a statue depicting the spirit of something or other surrounded by illuminated fountains their dull splashing was the only sound that broke the cholesterol of silence that had the heart of the city in its grip silence reigned too in the dark bulk of unseen university except spelter crept along the shadowy corridors like a twolegged spider darting or at least limping quickly from pillar to archway until he reached the forbidding doors of the library he peered nervously at the darkness around him and after some hesitation tapped very very lightly silence poured from the heavy woodwork but unlike the silence that had the rest of the city under its thrall this was a watchful alert silence it was the silence of a sleeping cat that had just opened one eye when he could bear it no longer spelter dropped to his hands and knees and tried to peer under the doors finally he put his mouth as close as he could to the draughty dusty gap under the bottommost hinge and whispered i say um can you hear me he felt sure that something moved far back in the darkness he tried again his mood swinging between terror and hope with every erratic thump of his heart i say its me um spelter you know could you speak to me please perhaps large leathery feet were creeping gently across the floor in there or maybe it was only the creaking of spelters nerves he tried to swallow away the dryness in his throat and had another go look all right but look theyre talking about shutting the library the silence grew louder the sleeping cat had cocked an ear what is happening is all wrong the bursar confided and clapped his hand over his mouth at the enormity of what he had said oook it was the faintest of noises like the eructation of cockroaches suddenly emboldened spelter pressed his lips closer to the crack have you got the um patrician in there oook what about the little doggie oook oh good spelter lay full length in the comfort of the night and drummed his fingers on the chilly floor you wouldnt care to um let me in too he ventured oook spelter made a face in the gloom well would you um let me come in for a few minutes we need to discuss something urgently man to man eeek i meant ape oook look wont you come out then oook spelter sighed this show of loyalty is all very well but youll starve in there oook oook what other way in oook oh have it your way spelter sighed but somehow he felt better for the conversation everyone else in the university seemed to be living in a dream whereas the librarian wanted nothing more in the whole world than soft fruit a regular supply of index cards and the opportunity every month or so to hop over the wall of the patricians private menagerie it was strangely reassuring so youre all right for bananas and so forth he inquired after another pause oook dont let anyone in will you um i think thats frightfully important oook good spelter stood up and dusted off his knees then he put his mouth to the keyhole and added dont trust anyone oook it was not completely dark in the library because the serried rows of magical books gave off a faint octarine glow caused by thaumaturgical leakage into a strong occult field it was just bright enough to illuminate the pile of shelves wedged against the door the former patrician had been carefully decanted into a jar on the librarians desk the librarian himself sat under it wrapped in his blanket and holding wuffles on his lap occasionally he would eat a banana spelter meanwhile limped back along the echoing passages of the university heading for the security of his bedroom it was because his ears were nervously straining the tiniest of sounds out of the air that he heard right on the cusp of audibility the sobbing it wasnt a normal noise up here in the carpeted corridors of the senior wizards quarters there were a number of sounds you might hear late at night such as snoring the gentle clinking of glasses tuneless singing and once in a while the zip and sizzle of a spell gone wrong but the sound of someone quietly crying was such a novelty that spelter found himself edging down the passage that led to the archchancellors suite the door was ajar telling himself that he really shouldnt tensing himself for a hurried dash spelter peered inside rincewind stared what is it he whispered i think its a temple of some sort said conina rincewind stood and gazed upwards the crowds of ai khali bouncing off and around him in a kind of human brownian motion a temple he thought well it was big and it was impressive and the architect had used every trick in the book to make it look even bigger and even more impressive than it was and to impress upon everyone looking at it that they on the other hand were very small and ordinary and didnt have as many domes it was the kind of place that looked exactly as you were always going to remember it but rincewind felt he knew holy architecture when he saw it and the frescoes on the big and of course impressive walls above him didnt look at all religious for one thing the participants were enjoying themselves almost certainly they were enjoying themselves yes they must be it would be pretty astonishing if they werent theyre not dancing are they he said in a desperate attempt not to believe the evidence of his own eyes or maybe its some sort of acrobatics conina squinted upwards in the hard white sunlight i shouldnt think so she said thoughtfully rincewind remembered himself i dont think a young woman like you should be looking at this sort of thing he said sternly conina gave him a smile i think wizards are expressly forbidden to she said sweetly its supposed to turn you blind rincewind turned his face upwards again prepared to risk maybe one eye this sort of thing is only to be expected he told himself they dont know any better foreign countries are well foreign countries they do things differently there although some things he decided were done in very much the same way only with rather more inventiveness and by the look of it far more often the temple frescoes of al khali are famous far and wide said conina as they walked through crowds of children who kept trying to sell rincewind things and introduce him to nice relatives well i can see they would be rincewind agreed look push off will you no i dont want to buy whatever it is no i dont want to meet her or him either or it you nasty little boy get off will you the last scream was to the group of children riding sedately on the luggage which was plodding along patiently behind rincewind and making no attempt to shake them off perhaps it was sickening for something he thought and brightened up a bit how many people are there on this continent do you think he said i dont know said conina without turning round millions i expect if i were wise i wouldnt be here said rincewind with feeling they had been in al khali gateway to the whole mysterious continent of klatch for several hours he was beginning to suffer a decent city should have a bit of fog about it he considered and people should live indoors not spend all their time out on the streets there shouldnt be all this sand and heat as for the wind ankhmorpork had its famous smell so full of personality that it could reduce a strong man to tears but al khali had its wind blowing from the vastness of the deserts and continents nearer the rim it was a gentle breeze but it didnt stop and eventually it had the same effect on visitors that a cheesegrater achieves on a tomato after a while it seemed to have worn away your skin and was rasping directly across the nerves to coninas sensitive nostrils it carried aromatic messages from the heart of the continent compounded of the chill of deserts the stink of lions the compost of jungles and the flatulence of wildebeest rincewind of course couldnt smell any of this adaptation is a wonderful thing and most morporkians would be hard put to smell a burning feather mattress at five feet where to next he said somewhere out of the wind my father spent some time in khali when he was hunting for the lost city of ee said conina and i seem to remember he spoke very highly of the soak its a kind of bazaar i suppose we just go and look for the secondhand hat stalls said rincewind because the whole idea is totally what i was hoping was that maybe we could be attacked that seems the most sensible idea my father said that very few strangers who entered the soak ever came out again some very murderous types hang out there he said rincewind gave this due consideration just run that by me again will you he said after you said we should be attacked i seemed to hear a ranging in my ears well we want to meet the criminal element dont we not exactly want said rincewind that wasnt the phrase i would have chosen how would you put it then er i think the phrase not want sums it up pretty well but you agreed that we should get the hat but not die in the process said rincewind wretchedly that wont do anyone any good not me anyway my father always said that death is but a sleep said conina yes the hat told me that said rincewind as they turned down a narrow crowded street between white adobe walls but the way i see it its a lot harder to get up in the morning look said conina theres not much risk youre with me yes and youre looking forward to it arent you said rincewind accusingly as conina piloted them along a shady alley with their retinue of pubescent entrepreneurs at their heels its the old herrydeterry at work just shut up and try to look like a victim will you i can do that all right said rincewind beating off a particularly stubborn member of the junior chamber of commerce ive had a lot of practice for the last time i dont want to buy anyone you wretched child he looked gloomily at the walls around them at least there werent any of those disturbing pictures here but the hot breeze still blew the dust around him and he was sick and tired of looking at sand what he wanted was a couple of cool beers a cold bath and a change of clothing it probably wouldnt make him feel better but it would at least make feeling awful more enjoyable not that there was any beer here probably it was a funny thing but in chilly cities like ankhmorpork the big drink was beer which cooled you down but in places like this where the whole sky was an oven with the door left open people drank tiny little sticky drinks which set fire to the back of your throat and the architecture was all wrong and they had statues in their temples that well just werent suitable this wasnt the right kind of place for wizards of course they had some local grown alternative enchanters or some such but not what youd call decent magic conina strolled ahead of him humming to herself you rather like her dont you i can tell said a voice in his head oh blast thought rincewind youre not my conscience again are you your libido its a bit stuffy in here isnt it you havent had it done up since the last time i was around look go away will you im a wizard wizards are ruled by their heads not by their hearts and im getting votes from your glands and theyre telling me that as far as your body is concerned your brain is in a minority of one yes but its got the casting vote then hah thats what you think your heart has got nothing to do with this by the way its merely a muscular organ which powers the circulation of the blood but look at it like this you quite like her dont you well rincewind hesitated yes he thought er shes pretty good company eh nice voice well of course youd like to see more of her well rincewind realised with some surprise that yes he would it wasnt that he was entirely unused to the company of women but it always seemed to cause trouble and of course it was a well known fact that it was bad for the magical abilities although he had to admit that his particular magical abilities being approximately those of a rubber hammer were shaky enough to start with then youve got nothing to lose have you his libido put in in an oily tone of thought it was at this point rincewind realised that something important was missing it took him a little while to realise what it was noone had tried to sell him anything for several minutes in al khali that probably meant you were dead he corona and the luggage were alone in a long shady alley he could hear the bustle of the city some way away but immediately around them there was nothing except a rather expectant silence theyve run off said conina are we going to be attacked could be theres been three men following us on the rooftops rincewind squinted upwards at almost the same time as three men dressed in flowing black robes dropped lightly into the alleyway in front of them when he looked around two more appeared from around a corner all five were holding long curved swords and although the lower halves of their faces were masked it was almost certain that they were grinning evilly rincewind rapped sharply on the luggages lid kill he suggested the luggage stood stock still for a moment and then plodded over and stood next to conina it looked slightly smug and rincewind realised with jealous horror rather embarrassed why you he growled and gave it a kick you handbag he sidled closer to the girl who was standing there with a thoughtful smile on her face what now he said are you going to offer them all a quick perm the men edged a little closer they were he noticed only interested in conina im not armed she said what happened to your legendary comb left it on the boat youve got nothing conina shifted slightly to keep as many of the men as possible in her field of vision ive got a couple of hairgrips she said out of the corner of her mouth any good dont know never tried you got us into this relax i think theyll just take us prisoner oh thats fine for you to say youre not marked down as this weeks special offer the luggage snapped its lid once or twice a little uncertain about things one of the men gingerly extended his sword and prodded rincewind in the small of the back they want to take us somewhere see said conina she gritted her teeth oh no she muttered whats the matter now i cant do it what conina put her head in her hands i cant let myself be taken prisoner without a fight i can feel a thousand barbarian ancestors accusing me of betrayal she hissed urgently pull the other one no really this wont take a minute there was a sudden blur and the nearest man collapsed in a small gurgling heap then coninas elbows went back and into the stomachs of the men behind her her left hand rebounded past rincewinds ear with a noise like tearing silk and felled the man behind him the fifth made a run for it and was brought down by a flying tackle hitting his head heavily on the wall conina rolled off him and sat up panting her eyes bright i dont like to say this but i feel better for that she said its terrible to know that i betrayed a fine hairdressing tradition of course oh yes said rincewind sombrely i wondered if youd noticed them coninas eyes scanned the line of bowmen who had appeared along the opposite wall they had that stolid impassive look of people who have been paid to do a job and dont much mind if the job involves killing people time for those hairgrips said rincewind conina didnt move my father always said that it was pointless to undertake a direct attack against an enemy extensively armed with efficient projectile weapons she said rincewind who knew cohens normal method of speech gave her a look of disbelief well what he actually said she added was never enter an arsekicking contest with a porcupine spelter couldnt face breakfast he wondered whether he ought to talk to carding but he had a chilly feeling that the old wizard wouldnt listen and wouldnt believe him anyway in fact he wasnt quite sure he believed it himself yes he was hed never forget it although he intended to make every effort one of the problems about living in the university these days was that the building you went to sleep in probably wasnt the same building when you woke up rooms had a habit of changing and moving around a consequence of all this random magic it built up in the carpets charging up the wizards to such an extent that shaking hands with somebody was a surefire way of turning them into something the build up of magic in fact was overflowing the capacity of the area to hold it if something wasnt done about it soon then even the common people would be able to use it a chilling thought but since spelters mind was already so full of chilling thoughts you could use it as an ice tray not one he was going to spend much time worrying about mere household geography wasnt the only difficulty though sheer pressure of thaumaturgical inflow was even affecting the food what was a forkful of kedgeree when you lifted it off the plate might well have turned into something else by the time it entered your mouth if you were lucky it was inedible if you were unlucky it was edible but probably not something you liked to think you were about to eat or worse had already eaten half of spelter found coin in what had been late last night a broom cupboard it was a lot bigger now it was only because spelter had never heard of aircraft hangars that he didnt know what to compare it with although to be fair very few aircraft hangars have marble floors and a lot of statuary around the place a couple of brooms and a small battered bucket in one corner looked distinctly out of place but not as out of place as the crushed tables in the former great hall which owing to the surging tides of magic now flowing through the place had shrunk to the approximate size of what spelter if he had ever seen one would have called a small telephone box he sidled into the room with extreme caution and took his place among the council of wizards the air was greasy with the feel of power spelter created a chair beside carding and leant across to him youll never believe he began quiet hissed carding this is amazing coin was sitting on his stool in the middle of the circle one hand on his staff the other extended and holding something small white and egglike it was strangely fuzzy in fact spelter thought it wasnt something small seen close to it was something huge but a long way off and the boy was holding it in his hand whats he doing spelter whispered im not exactly sure murmured carding as far as we can understand it hes creating a new home for wizardry streamers of coloured light flashed about the indistinct ovoid like a distant thunderstorm the glow lit coins preoccupied face from below giving it the semblance of a mask i dont see how we will all fit in the bursar said carding last night i saw it is finished said coin he held up the egg which flashed occasionally from some inner light and gave off tiny white prominences not only was it a long way off spelter thought it was also extremely heavy it went right through heaviness and out the other side into that strange negative realism where lead would be a vacuum he grabbed cardings sleeve again carding listen its important listen when i looked in i really wish youd stop doing that but the staff his staff its not coin stood up and pointed the staff at the wall where a doorway instantly appeared he marched out through it leaving the wizards to follow him he went through the archchancellors garden followed by a gaggle of wizards in the same way that a comet is followed by its tail and didnt stop until he reached the banks of the ankh there were some hoary old willows here and the river flowed or at any rate moved in a horseshoe bend around a small newthaunted meadow known rather optimistically as wizards pleasaunce on summer evenings if the wind was blowing towards the river it was a nice area for an afternoon stroll the warm silver haze still hung over the city as coin padded through the damp grass until he reached the centre he tossed the egg which drifted in a gentle arc and landed with a squelch he turned to the wizards as they hurried up stand well back he commanded and be prepared to run he pointed the octiron staff at the halfsunken thing a bolt of octarine light shot from its tip and struck the egg exploding into a shower of sparks that left blue and purple afterimages there was a pause a dozen wizards watched the egg expectantly a breeze shook the willow trees in a totally unmysterious way nothing else happened er spelter began and then came the first tremor a few leaves fell out of the trees and some distant water bird took off in fright the sound started as a low groaning experienced rather than heard as though everyones feet had suddenly become their ears the trees trembled and so did one or two wizards the mud around the egg began to bubble and exploded the ground peeled back like lemon rind gouts of steaming mud spattered the wizards as they dived for the cover of the trees only coin spelter and carding were left to watch the sparkling white building arise from the meadow grass and dirt pouring off it other towers erupted from the ground behind them buttresses grew through the air linking tower with tower spelter whimpered when the soil flowed away from around his feet and was replaced by flagstones flecked with silver he lurched as the floor rose inexorably carrying the three high above the treetops the rooftops of the university went past and fell away below them ankhmorpork spread out like a map the river a trapped snake the plains a misty blur spelters ears popped but the climb went on into the clouds they emerged drenched and cold into blistering sunlight with the cloud cover spreading away in every direction other towers were rising around them glinting painfully in the sharpness of the day carding knelt down awkwardly and felt the floor gingerly he signalled to spelter to do the same spelter touched a surface that was smoother than stone it felt like ice would feel if ice was slightly warm and looked like ivory while it wasnt exactly transparent it gave the impression that it would like to be he got the distinct feeling that if he closed his eyes he wouldnt be able to feel it at all he met cardings gaze dont look at um me he said i dont know what it is either they looked up at coin who said its magic yes lord but what is it made of said carding it is made of magic raw magic solidified curdled renewed from second to second could you imagine a better substance to build the new home of sourcery the staff flared for a moment melting the clouds the discworld appeared below them and from up here you could see that it was indeed a disc pinned to the sky by the central mountain of cori celesti where the gods lived there was the circle sea so close that it might even be possible to dive into it from here there was the vast continent of klatch squashed by perspective the rimfall around the edge of the world was a sparkling curve its too big said spelter under his breath the world he had lived in hadnt stretched much further than the gates of the university and hed preferred it that way a man could be comfortable in a world that size he certainly couldnt be comfortable about being half a mile in the air standing on something that wasnt in some fundamental way there the thought shocked him he was a wizard and he was worrying about magic he sidled cautiously back towards carding who said it isnt exactly what i expected um it looks a lot smaller up here doesnt it well i dont know listen i must tell you look at the ramtops now you could almost reach out and touch them they stared out across two hundred leagues towards the towering mountain range glittering and white and cold it was said that if you travelled hubwards through the secret valleys of the ramtops you would find in the frozen lands under cori celesti itself the secret realm of the ice giants imprisoned after their last great battle with the gods in those days the mountains had been mere islands in a great sea of ice and ice lived on them still coin smiled his golden smile what did you say carding he said its the clear air lord and they look so close and small i only said i could almost touch them coin waved him into silence he extended one thin arm rolling back his sleeve in the traditional sign that magic was about to be performed without trickery he reached out and then turned back with his fingers closed around what was without any shadow of a doubt a handful of snow the two wizards observed it in stunned silence as it melted and dripped on to the floor coin laughed you find it so hard to believe he said shall i pick pearls from rimmost krull or sand from the great nef could your old wizardry do half as much it seemed to spelter that his voice took on a metallic edge he stared intently at their faces finally carding sighed and said rather quietly no all my life i have sought magic and all i found was coloured lights and little tricks and old dry books wizardry has done nothing for the world and if i tell you that i intend to dissolve the orders and close the university although of course my senior advisors will be accorded all due status cardings knuckles whitened but he shrugged there is little to say he said what good is a candle at noonday coin turned to spelter so did the staff the filigree carvings were regarding him coldly one of them near the top of the staff looked unpleasantly like an eyebrow youre very quiet spelter do you not agree no the world had sourcery once and gave it up for wizardry wizardry is magic for men not gods its not for us there was something wrong with it and we have forgotten what it was i liked wizardry it didnt upset the world it fitted it was right a wizard was all i wanted to be he looked down at his feet yes he whispered good said coin in a satisfied tone of voice he strolled to the edge of the tower and looked down at the street map of ankhmorpork far below the tower of art came barely a tenth of the way towards them i believe he said i believe that we will hold the ceremony next week at full moon er it wont be full moon for three weeks said carding next week coin repeated if i say the moon will be full there will be no argument he continued to stare down at the model buildings of the university and then pointed whats that carding craned er the library yes its the library er the silence was so oppressive that carding felt something more was expected of him anything would be better than that silence its where we keep the books you know ninety thousand volumes isnt it spelter um oh yes about ninety thousand i suppose coin leaned on the staff and stared burn them he said all of them midnight strutted its black stuff along the corridors of unseen university as spelter with rather less confidence crept cautiously towards the impassive doors of the library he knocked and the sound echoed so loudly in the empty building that he had to lean against the wall and wait for his heart to slow down a bit after a while he heard a sound like heavy furniture being moved about oook its me oook spelter oook look youve got to get out hes going to burn the library there was no reply spelter let himself sag to his knees hell do it too he whispered hell probably make me do it its that staff um it knows everything thats going on it knows that i know about it please help me oook the other night i looked into his room the staff the staff was glowing it was standing there in the middle of the room like a beacon and the boy was on the bed sobbing i could feel it reaching out teaching him whispering terrible things and then it noticed me youve got to help me youre the only one who isnt under the spelter stopped his face froze he turned around very slowly without willing it because something was gently spinning him he knew the university was empty the wizards had all moved into the new tower where the lowliest student had a suite more splendid than any senior mage had before the staff hung in the air a few feet away it was surrounded by a faint octarine glow he stood up very carefully and keeping his back to the stonework and his eyes firmly fixed on the thing slithered gingerly along the wall until he reached the end of the corridor at the corner he noted that the staff while not moving had revolved on its axis to follow him he gave a little cry grasped the skirts of his robe and ran the staff was in front of him he slid to a halt and stood there catching his breath you dont frighten me he lied and turned on his heel and marched off in a different direction snapping his fingers to produce a torch that burned with a fine white flame once again the staff was in front of him the light of his torch was sucked into a thin singing steam of white fire that flared and vanished with a pop he waited his eyes watering with blue afterimages but if the staff was still there it didnt seem to be inclined to take advantage of him when vision returned he felt he could make out an even darker shadow on his left the stairway down to the kitchens he darted for it leaping down the unseen steps and landing heavily and unexpectedly on uneven flags a little moonlight filtered through a grating in the distance and somewhere up there he knew was a doorway into the outside world staggering a little his ankles aching the noise of his own breath booming in his ears as though hed stuck his entire head in a seashell spelter set off across the endless dark desert of the floor things clanked underfoot there were no rats here now of course but the kitchen had fallen into disuse lately the universitys cooks had been the best in the world but now any wizard could conjure up meals beyond mere culinary skill the big copper pans hung neglected on the wall their sheen already tarnishing and the kitchen ranges under the giant chimney arch were filled with nothing but chilly ash the staff lay across the back door like a bar it spun up as spelter tottered towards it and hung radiating quiet malevolence a few feet away then quite smoothly it began to glide towards him he backed away his feet slipping on the greasy stones a thump across the back of his thighs made him yelp but as he reached behind him he found it was only one of the chopping blocks his hand groped desperately across its scarred surface and against all hope found a cleaver buried in the wood in an instinctive gesture as ancient as mankind spelters fingers closed around its handle he was out of breath and out of patience and out of space and time and also scared very nearly out of his mind so when the staff hovered in front of him he wrenched the chopper up and around with all the strength he could muster and hesitated all that was wizardly in him cried out against the destruction of so much power power that perhaps even now could be used used by him and the staff swung around so that its axis was pointing directly at him and several corridors away the librarian stood braced with his back against the library door watching the blue and white flashes that flickered across the floor he heard the distant snap of raw energy and a sound that started low and ended up in zones of pitch that even wuffles lying with his paws over his head could not hear and then there was a faint ordinary tinkling noise such as might be made by a fused and twisted metal cleaver dropping on to flagstones it was the sort of noise that makes the silence that comes after it roll forward like a warm avalanche the librarian wrapped the silence around him like a cloak and stood staring up at the rank on rank of books each one pulsing faintly in the glow of its own magic shelf after shelf looked down at him they had heard he could feel the fear the orangutan stood statuestill for several minutes and then appeared to reach a decision he knuckled his way across to his desk and after much rummaging produced a heavy keyring bristling with keys then he went back and stood in the middle of the floor and said very deliberately oook the books craned forward on their shelves now he had their full attention what is this place said conina rincewind looked around him and made a guess they were still in the heart of al khali he could hear the hum of it beyond the walls but in the middle of the teeming city someone had cleared a vast space walled it off and planted a garden so romantically natural that it looked as real as a sugar pig it looks like someone has taken twice five miles of inner city and girdled them round with walls and towers he hazarded what a strange idea said conina well some of the religions herewell when you die you see they think you go to this sort of garden where theres all this sort of music and and he continued wretchedly sherbet and and young women conina took in the green splendour of the walled garden with its peacocks intricate arches and slightly wheezy fountains a dozen reclining women stared back at her impassively a hidden string orchestra was playing the complicated klatchian bhong music im not dead she said im sure i would have remembered besides this isnt my idea of paradise she looked critically at the reclining figures and added i wonder who does their hair a sword point prodded her in the small of the back and the two of them set out along the ornate path towards a small domed pavilion surrounded by olive trees she scowled anyway i dont like sherbet rincewind didnt comment he was busily examining the state of his own mind and wasnt happy at the sight of it he had a horrible feeling that he was falling in love he was sure he had all the symptoms there were the sweaty palms the hot sensation in the stomach the general feeling that the skin of his chest was made of tight elastic there was the feeling every time conina spoke that someone was running hot steel into his spine he glanced down at the luggage tramping stoically alongside him and recognised the symptoms not you too he said possibly it was only the play of sunlight on the luggages battered lid but it was just possible that for an instant it looked redder than usual of course sapient pearwood has this sort of weird mental link with its owner rincewind shook his head still itd explain why the thing wasnt its normal malignant self itd never work he said i mean shes a female and youre a well youre a he paused well whatever you are youre of the wooden persuasion itd never work people would talk he turned and glared at the blackrobed guards behind him i dont know what youre looking at he said severely the luggage sidled over to conina following her so closely that she banged an ankle on it push off she snapped and kicked it again this time on purpose insofar as the luggage ever had an expression it looked at her in shocked betrayal the pavilion ahead of them was an ornate onionshaped dome studded with precious stones and supported on four pillars its interior was a mass of cushions on which lay a rather fat middleaged man surrounded by three young women he wore a purple robe interwoven with gold thread they as far as rincewind could see demonstrated that you could make six small saucepan lids and a few yards of curtain netting go a long way although he shivered not really far enough the man appeared to be writing he glanced up at them i suppose you dont know a good rhyme for thou he said peevishly rincewind and conina exchanged glances plough said rincewind bough cow suggested conina with forced brightness the man hesitated cow i quite like he said cow has got possibilities cow might in fact do do pull up a cushion by the way have some sherbet why are you standing there like that its these ropes said conina i have this allergy to cold steel rincewind added really how tiresome said the fat man and clapped a pair of hands so heavy with rings that the sound was more of a clang two guards stepped forward smartly and cut the bonds and then the whole battalion melted away although rincewind was acutely conscious of dozens of dark eyes watching them from the surrounding foliage animal instinct told him that while he now appeared to be alone with the man and conina any aggressive moves on his part would suddenly make the world a sharp and painful place he tried to radiate tranquillity and total friendliness he tried to think of something to say well he ventured looking around at the brocaded hangings the rubystudded pillars and the gold filigree cushions youve done this place up nicely its he sought for something suitably descriptive well pretty much of a miracle of rare device one aims for simplicity sighed the man still scribbling busily why are you here not that it isnt always a pleasure to meet fellow students of the poetic muse we were brought here said conina men with swords added rincewind dear fellows they do so like to keep in practice would you like one of these he snapped his fingers at one of the girls not er right now rincewind began but shed picked up a plate of goldenbrown sticks and demurely passed it towards him he tried one it was delicious a sort of sweet crunchy flavour with a hint of honey he took two more excuse me said conina but who are you and where is this my name is creosote seriph of al khali said the fat man and this is my wilderness one does ones best rincewind coughed on his honey stick not creosote as in as rich as creosote he said that was my dear father i am in fact rather richer when one has a great deal of money i am afraid it is hard to achieve simplicity one does ones best he sighed you could try giving it away said conina he sighed again that isnt easy you know no one just has to try to do a little with a lot no no but look said rincewind spluttering bits of stick they say i mean everything you touch turns into gold for goodness sake that could make going to the lavatory a bit tricky said conina brightly sorry one hears such stories about oneself said creosote affecting not to have heard so tiresome as if wealth mattered true riches lie in the treasure houses of literature the creosote i heard of said conina slowly was head of this band of well mad killers the original assassins feared throughout hubward klatch no offence meant ah yes dear father said creosote junior the hashishim such a novel idea but not really very efficient so we hired thugs instead ah named after a religious sect said conina knowingly creosote gave her a long look no he said slowly i dont think so i think we named them after the way they push peoples faces through the back of their heads dreadful really he picked up the parchment he had been writing on and continued i seek a more cerebral life which is why i had the city centre converted into a wilderness so much better for the mental flow one does ones best may i read you my latest oeuvre egg said rincewind who wasnt following this creosote thrust out one pudgy hand and declaimed as follows a summer palace underneath the bough a flask of wine a loaf of bread some lamb couscous with courgettes roast peacock tongues kebabs iced sherbet selection of sweets from the trolley and choice of thou singing beside me in the wilderness and wilderness is he paused and picked up his pen thoughtfully maybe cow isnt such a good idea he said now that i come to look at it rincewind glanced at the manicured greenery carefully arranged rocks and high surrounding walls one of the thous winked at him this is a wilderness he said my landscape gardeners incorporated all the essential features i believe they spent simply ages getting the rills sufficiently sinuous i am reliably informed that they contain prospects of rugged grandeur and astonishing natural beauty and scorpions said rincewind helping himself to another honey stick i dont know about that said the poet scorpions sound unpoetic to me wild honey and locusts seem more appropriate according to the standard poetic instructions although ive never really developed the taste for insects i always understood that the kind of locust people ate in wildernesses was the fruit of a kind of tree said conina father always said it was quite tasty not insects said creosote i dont think so the seriph nodded at rincewind you might as well finish them up then he said nasty crunchy things i couldnt see the point i dont wish to sound ungrateful said conina over the sound of rincewinds frantic coughing but why did you have us brought here good question creosote looked at her blankly for a few seconds as if trying to remember why they were there you really are a most attractive young woman he said you cant play a dulcimer by any chance how many blades has it got said conina pity said the seriph i had one specially imported my father taught me to play the harmonica she volunteered creosotes lips moved soundlessly as he tried out the idea no good he said doesnt scan thanks all the same though he gave her another thoughtful look you know you really are most becoming has anyone ever told you your neck is as a tower of ivory never said conina pity said creosote again he rummaged among his cushions and produced a small bell which he rang after a while a tall saturnine figure appeared from behind the pavilion he had the look of someone who could think his way through a corkscrew without bending and a certain something about the eyes which would have made the average rabid rodent tiptoe away discouraged that man you would have said has got grand vizier written all over him noone can tell him anything about defrauding widows and imprisoning impressionable young men in alleged jewel caves when it comes to dirty work he probably wrote the book or more probably stole it from someone else he wore a turban with a pointy hat sticking out of it he had a long thin moustache of course ah abrim said creosote highness my grand vizier said the seriph thought so said rincewind to himself these people why did we have them brought here the vizier twirled his moustache probably foreclosing another dozen mortgages the hat highness he said the hat if you remember ah yes fascinating where did we put it hold on said rincewind urgently this hat it wouldnt be a sort of battered pointy one with lots of stuff on it sort of lace and stuff and and he hesitatednoones tried to put it on have they it specifically warned us not to said creosote so abrim got a slave to try it on of course he said it gave him a headache it also told us that you would shortly be arriving said the vizier bowing slightly at rincewind and therefore i that is to say the seriph felt that you might be able to tell us more about this wonderful artifact there is a tone of voice known as interrogative and the vizier was using it a slight edge to his words suggested that if he didnt learn more about the hat very quickly he had various activities in mind in which further words like red hot and knives would appear of course all grand viziers talk like that all the time theres probably a school somewhere gosh im glad youve found it said rincewind that hat is gngngnh i beg your pardon said abrim signalling a couple of lurking guards to step forward i missed the bit after the young lady he bowed at coninaelbowed you in the ear i think said conina politely but firmly youd better take us to see it five minutes later from its resting place on a table in the seriphs treasury the hat said at last what kept you it is at a time like this with rincewind and conina probably about to be the victims of a murderous attack and coin about to address the assembled cowering wizards on the subject of treachery and the disc about to fall under a magical dictatorship that it is worth mentioning the subject of poetry and inspiration for example the seriph in his bijou wildernessette has just riffled back through his pages of verse to revise the lines which begin get up for morning in the cup of day has dropped the spoon that scares the stars away and he has sighed because the whitehot lines searing across his imagination never seem to come out exactly as he wants them it is in fact impossible that they ever will sadly this sort of thing happens all the time it is a wellknown established fact throughout the manydimensional worlds of the multiverse that most really great discoveries are owed to one brief moment of inspiration theres a lot of spadework first of course but what clinches the whole thing is the sight of say a falling apple or a boiling kettle or the water slopping over the edge of the bath something goes click inside the observers head and then everything falls into place the shape of dna it is popularly said owes its discovery to the chance sight of a spiral staircase when the scientists mind was just at the right receptive temperature had he used the lift the whole science of genetics might have been a good deal different this is thought of as somehow wonderful it isnt it is tragic little particles of inspiration sleet through the universe all the time travelling through the densest matter in the same way that a neutrino passes through a candyfloss haystack and most of them miss even worse most of the ones that hit the exact cerebral target hit the wrong one for example the weird dream about a lead doughnut on a milehigh gantry which in the right mind would have been the catalyst for the invention of repressedgravitational electricity generation was in fact had by a small and bewildered duck by another stroke of bad luck the sight of a herd of white horses galloping through a field of wild hyacinths would have led a struggling composer to write the famous flying god suite bringing succour and balm to the souls of millions had he not been at home in bed with shingles the inspiration therefore fell to a nearby frog who was not in much of a position to make a startling contribution to the field of tone poetry many civilisations have recognised this shocking waste and tried various methods to prevent it most of them involving enjoyable but illegal attempts to tune the mind into the right wavelength by the use of exotic herbage or yeast products it never works properly and so creosote who had dreamt the inspiration for a rather fine poem about life and philosophy and how they both look much better through the bottom of a wine glass was totally unable to do anything about it because he had as much poetic ability as a hyena why the gods allow this sort of thing to continue is a mystery actually the flash of inspiration needed to explain it clearly and precisely has taken place but the creature who received it a small female bluetit has never been able to make the position clear even after some really strenuous coded messages on the tops of milk bottles by a strange coincidence a philosopher who had been devoting some sleepless nights to the same mystery woke up that morning with a wonderful new idea for getting peanuts out of bird tables which brings us rather neatly on to the subject of magic a long way out in the dark gulfs of interstellar space one single inspiration particle is clipping along unaware of its destiny which is just as well because its destiny is to strike in a matter of hours a tiny area of rincewinds mind it would be a tough destiny even if rincewinds creative node was a reasonable size but the particles karma had handed it the problem of hitting a moving target the size of a small raisin over a distance of several hundred lightyears life can be very difficult for a little subatomic particle in a great big universe if it pulls it off however rincewind will have a serious philosophic idea if it doesnt a nearby brick will have an important insight which it will be totally unequipped to deal with the seriphs palace known to legend as the rhoxie occupied most of the centre of al khali that wasnt occupied by the wilderness most things connected with creosote were famed in mythology and the arched domed manypillared palace was said to have more rooms than any man had been able to count rincewind didnt know which number he was in its magic isnt it said abrim the vizier he prodded rincewind in the ribs youre a wizard he said tell me what it does how do you know im a wizard said rincewind desperately its written on your hat said the vizier ah and you were on the boat with it my men saw you the seriph employs slavers snapped conina that doesnt sound very simple oh i employ the slavers i am the vizier after all said abrim it is rather expected of me he gazed thoughtfully at the girl and then nodded at a couple of the guards the current seriph is rather literary in his views he said i on the other hand am not take her to the seraglio although he rolled his eyes and gave an irritable sigh im sure the only fate that awaits her there is boredom and possibly a sore throat he turned to rincewind dont say anything he said dont move your hands dont try any sudden feats of magic i am protected by strange and powerful amulets now just hold on a minute rincewind began and conina said all right ive always wondered what a harem looked like rincewinds mouth went on opening and shutting but no sounds came out finally he managed have you she waggled an eyebrow at him it was probably a signal of some sort rincewind felt he ought to have understood it but peculiar passions were stirring in the depths of his being they werent actually going to make him brave but they were making him angry speeded up the dialogue behind his eyes was going something like this ugh whos that your conscience i feel terrible look theyre marching her off to the harem rather her than me thought rincewind but without much conviction do something theres too many guards theyll kill me so theyll kill you its not the end of the world it will be for me thought rincewind grimly but just think how good youll feel in your next life look just shut up will i ive had just about enough of me abrim stepped across to rincewind and looked at him curiously who are you talking to he said i warn you said rincewind between clenched teeth i have this magical box on legs which is absolutely merciless with attackers one word from me and im impressed said abrim is it invisible rincewind risked a look behind him im sure i had it when i came in he said and sagged it would be mistaken to say the luggage was nowhere to be seen it was somewhere to be seen it was just that the place wasnt anywhere near rincewind abrim walked slowly around the table on which sat the hat twirling his moustache once again he said i ask you this is an artifact of power i feel it and you must tell me what it does why dont you ask it said rincewind it refuses to tell me well why do you want to know abrim laughed it wasnt a nice sound it sounded as though he had had laughter explained to him probably slowly and repeatedly but had never heard anyone actually do it youre a wizard he said wizardry is about power i have taken an interest in magic myself i have the talent you know the vizier drew himself up stiffly oh yes but they wouldnt accept me at your university they said i was mentally unstable can you believe that no said rincewind truthfully most of the wizards at unseen had always seemed to him to be several bricks short of a shilling abrim seemed pretty normal wizard material abrim gave him an encouraging smile rincewind looked sideways at the hat it said nothing he looked back at the vizier if the laughter had been weird the smile made it sound as normal as birdsong it looked as though the vizier had learned it from diagrams wild horses wouldnt get me to help you in any way he said ah said the vizier a challenge he beckoned to the nearest guard do we have any wild horses in the stables some fairly angry ones master infuriate four of them and take them to the turnwise courtyard and oh bring several lengths of chain right away master um look said rincewind yes said abrim well if you put it like that you wish to make a point its the archchancellors hat if you must know said rincewind the symbol of wizardry powerful rincewind shivered very he said why is it called the archchancellors hat the archchancellor is the most senior wizard you see the leader but look abrim picked up the hat and turned it around and around in his hands it is you might say the symbol of office absolutely but look if you put it on id better warn you shut up abrim leapt back the hat dropping to the floor the wizard knows nothing send him away we must negotiate the vizier stared down at the glittering octarines around the hat i negotiate with an item of apparel i have much to offer on the right head rincewind was appalled it has already been indicated that he had the kind of instinct for danger usually found only in certain small rodents and it was currently battering on the side of his skull in an attempt to run away and hide somewhere dont listen he shouted put me on said the hat beguilingly in an ancient voice that sounded as though the speaker had a mouthful of felt if there really was a school for viziers abrim had come top of the class well talk first he said he nodded at the guards and pointed to rincewind take him away and throw him in the spider tank he said no not spiders on top of everything else moaned rincewind the captain of the guard stepped forward and knuckled his forehead respectfully run out of spiders master he said oh the vizier looked momentarily blank in that case lock him in the tiger cage the guard hesitated trying to ignore the sudden outburst of whimpering beside him the tigers been ill master backwards and forwards all night then throw this snivelling coward down the shaft of eternal fire a couple of the guards exchanged glances over the head of rincewind who had sunk to his knees ah well need a bit of notice of that master to get it going again like the viziers fist came down hard on the table the captain of the guard brightened up horribly theres the snake pit master he said the other guards nodded there was always the snake pit four heads turned towards rincewind who stood up and brushed the sand off his knees how do you feel about snakes said one of the guards snakes i dont like snakes much the snake pit said abrim right the snake pit agreed the guards i mean some snakes are okay rincewind continued as two guards grabbed him by the elbows in fact there was only one very cautious snake which remained obstinately curled up in a corner of the shadowy pit watching rincewind suspiciously possibly because he reminded it of a mongoose hi it said eventually are you a wizard as a line of snake dialogue this was a considerable improvement on the normal string of esses but rincewind was sufficiently despondent not to waste time wondering and simply replied its on my hat cant you read in seventeen languages actually i taught myself really i sent off for courses but i try not to read of course its not in character i suppose it wouldnt be it was certainly the most cultured snake voice that rincewind had ever heard its the same with the voice im afraid the snake added i shouldnt really be talking to you now not like this anyway i suppose i could grunt a bit i rather think i should be trying to kill you in fact i have curious and unusual powers said rincewind fair enough he thought an almost total inability to master any form of magic is pretty unusual for a wizard and anyway it doesnt matter about lying to a snake gosh well i expect you wont be in here long then hmm i expect youll be levitating out of here like a shot any minute rincewind looked up at the fifteenfootdeep walls of the snake pit and rubbed his bruises i might he said cautiously in that case you wouldnt mind taking me with you would you eh its a lot to ask i know but this pit is well its the pits take you but youre a snake its your pit the idea is that you stay here and people come to you i mean i know about these things a shadow behind the snake unfolded itself and stood up thats a pretty unpleasant thing to say about anyone it said the figure stepped forward into the pool of light it was a young man taller than rincewind that is to say rincewind was sitting down but the boy would have been taller than him even if he was standing up to say that he was lean would be to miss a perfect opportunity to use the word emaciated he looked as though toast racks and deckchairs had figured in his ancestry and the reason it was so obvious was his clothes rincewind looked again he had been right the first time the lankhaired figure in front of him was wearing the practically traditional garb for barbarian heroes a few studded leather thongs big furry boots a little leather holdall and goosepimples there was nothing unusual about that youd see a score of similarlydressed adventurers in any street of ankhmorpork except that youd never see another one wearing the young man followed his gaze looked down and shrugged i cant help it he said i promised my mother woolly underwear strange things were happening in al khali that night there was a certain silveriness rolling in from the sea which baffled the citys astronomers but that wasnt the strangest thing there were little flashes of raw magic discharging off sharp edges like static electricity but that wasnt the strangest thing the strangest thing walked into a tavern on the edge of the city where the everlasting wind blew the smell of the desert through every unglazed window and sat down in the middle of the floor the occupants watched it for some time sipping their coffee laced with desert orakh this drink made from cacti sap and scorpion venom is one of the most virulent alcoholic beverages in the universe but the desert nomads dont drink it for its intoxicating effects they use it because they need something to mitigate the effect of klatchian coffee not because you could use the coffee to waterproof roofs not because it went through the untrained stomach lining like a hot ball bearing through runny butter what it did was worse it made you knurd the sons of the desert glanced suspiciously into their thimblesized coffeecups and wondered whether they had overdone the orakh were they all seeing the same thing would it be foolish to pass a remark these are the sort of things you need to worry about if you want to retain any credibility as a steelyeyed son of the deep desert pointing a shaking finger and saying hey look a box just walked in here on hundreds of little legs isnt that extraordinary would show a terrible and possibly fatal lack of machismo the drinkers tried not to catch one anothers eye even when the luggage slid up to the row of orakh jars against the far wall the luggage had a way of standing still that was somehow even more terrible than watching it move about finally one of them said i think it wants a drink there was a long silence and then one of the others said with the precision of a chess grand master making a killing move what does the rest of the drinkers gazed impassively into their glasses there was no sound for a while other than the plopplopping of a geckos footsteps across the sweating ceiling the first drinker said the demon thats just moved up behind you is what i was referring to o brother of the sands the current holder of the allwadi imperturbability championship smiled glassily until he felt a tugging on his robe the smile stayed where it was but the rest of his face didnt seem to want to be associated with it the luggage was feeling crossed in love and was doing what any sensible person would do in these circumstances which was get drunk it had no money and no way of asking for what it wanted but the luggage somehow never had much difficulty in making itself understood the tavern keeper spent a very long lonely night filling a saucer with orakh before the luggage rather unsteadily walked out through one of the walls the desert was silent it wasnt normally silent it was normally alive with the chirruping of crickets the buzz of mosquitoes the hiss and whisper of hunting wings skimming across the cooling sands but tonight it was silent with the thick busy silence of dozens of nomads folding their tents and getting the hell out of it i promised my mother said the boy i get these colds you see perhaps you should try wearing well a bit more clothing oh i couldnt do that youve got to wear all this leather stuff i wouldnt call it all said rincewind theres not enough of it to call it all why have you got to wear it so people know im a barbarian hero of course rincewind leaned his back against the fetid walls of the snake pit and stared at the boy he looked at two eyes like boiled grapes a shock of ginger hair and a face that was a battleground between its native freckles and the dreadful invading forces of acne rincewind rather enjoyed times like this they convinced him that he wasnt mad because if he was mad that left no word at all to describe some of the people he met barbarian hero he murmured its all right isnt it all this leather stuff was very expensive yes but look whats your name lad nijel you see nijel nijel the destroyer nijel added you see nijel the destroyer all right the destroyer said rincewind desperately son of harebut the provision merchant what youve got to be the son of someone nijel explained it says it here somewhere he halfturned and fumbled inside a grubby fur bag eventually bringing out a thin torn and grubby book theres a bit in here about selecting your name he muttered how come you ended up in this pit then i was intending to steal from creosotes treasury but i had an asthma attack said nijel still fumbling through the crackling pages rincewind looked down at the snake which was still trying to keep out of everyones way it had a good thing going in the pit and knew trouble when it saw it it wasnt about to cause any aggro for anyone it stared right back up at rincewind and shrugged which is pretty clever for a reptile with no shoulders how long have you been a barbarian hero im just getting started ive always wanted to be one you see and i thought maybe i could pick it up as i went along nijel peered shortsightedly at rincewind thats all right isnt it its a desperate sort of life by all accounts rincewind volunteered have you thought what it might be like selling groceries for the next fifty years nijel muttered darkly rincewind thought is lettuce involved he said oh yes said nijel shoving the mysterious book back in his bag then he started to pay close attention to the pit walls rincewind sighed he liked lettuce it was so incredibly boring he had spent years in search of boredom but had never achieved it just when he thought he had it in his grasp his life would suddenly become full of nearterminal interest the thought that someone could voluntarily give up the prospect of being bored for fifty years made him feel quite weak with fifty years ahead of him he thought he could elevate tedium to the status of an art form there would be no end to the things he wouldnt do do you know any lampwick jokes he said settling himself comfortably on the sand i dont think so said nijel politely tapping a slab i know hundreds they are very droll for example do you know how many trolls it takes to change a lampwick this slab moves said nijel look its a sort of door give me a hand he pushed enthusiastically his biceps standing out on his arms like peas on a pencil i expect its some sort of secret passage he added come on use a bit of magic will you its stuck dont you want to hear the rest of the joke said rincewind in a pained voice it was warm and dry down here with no immediate danger not counting the snake which was trying to look inconspicuous some people were never satisfied i think not right at the moment said nijel i think i would prefer a bit of magical assistance im not very good at it said rincewind never got the hang of it see its more than just pointing a finger at it and saying kazam there was a sound like a thick bolt of octarine lightning zapping into a heavy rock slab and smashing it into a thousand bits of spitting whitehot shrapnel and no wonder after a while nijel slowly got to his feet beating out the small fires in his vest yes he said in the voice of one determined not to lose his selfcontrol well very good well just let it cool down a bit shall we and then we then we we might as well be going he cleared his throat a bit nnh said rincewind he was starting fixedly at the end of his finger holding it out at arms length in a manner that suggested he was very sorry he hadnt got longer arms nijel peered into the smouldering hole it seems to open into some kind of room he said nnh after you said nijel he gave rincewind a gentle push the wizard staggered forward bumped his head on the rock and didnt appear to notice and then rebounded into the hole nijel patted the wall and his brow wrinkled can you feel something he said should the stone be trembling nnh are you all right nnh nijel put his ear to the stones theres a very strange noise he said a sort of humming a bit of dust shook itself free from the mortar over his head and floated down then a couple of much heavier rocks danced free from the walls of the pits and thudded into the sand rincewind had already staggered off down the tunnel making little shocked noises and completely ignoring the stones that were missing him by inches and in some cases hitting him by kilograms if he had been in any state to notice it he would have known what was happening the air had a greasy feel and smelled like burning tin faint rainbows filmed every point and edge a magical charge was building up somewhere very close to them and it was a big one and it was trying to earth itself a handy wizard even one as incapable as rincewind stood out like a copper lighthouse nijel blundered out of the rumbling broiling dust and bumped into him standing surrounded by an octarine corona in another cave rincewind looked terrible creosote would have probably noted his flashing eyes and floating hair he looked like someone who had just eaten a handful of pineal glands and washed them down with a pint of adrenochrome he looked so high you could bounce intercontinental tv off him every single hair stood out from his head giving off little sparks even his skin gave the impression that it was trying to get away from him his eyes appeared to be spinning horizontally when he opened his mouth peppermint sparks flashed from his teeth where he had trodden stone melted or grew ears or turned into something small and scaly and purple and flew away i say said nijel are you all right nnh said rincewind and the syllable turned into a large doughnut you dont look all right said nijel with what might be called in the circumstances unusual perspicacity nnh why not try getting us out of here nijel added and wisely flung himself flat on the floor rincewind nodded like a puppet and pointed his loaded digit at the ceiling which melted like ice under a blowlamp still the rumbling went on sending its disquieting harmonics dancing through the palace it is a wellknown factoid that there are frequencies that can cause panic and frequencies that can cause embarrassing incontinence but the shaking rock was resonating at the frequency that causes reality to melt and run out at the corners nijel regarded the dripping ceiling and cautiously tasted it lime custard he said and added i suppose theres no chance of stairs is there more fire burst from rincewinds ravaged fingers coalescing into an almost perfect escalator except that possibly no other moving staircase in the universe was floored with alligator skin nijel grabbed the gently spinning wizard and leapt aboard fortunately they had reached the top before the magic vanished very suddenly sprouting out of the centre of the palace shattering rooftops like a mushroom bursting through an ancient pavement was a white tower taller than any other building in al khali huge double doors had opened at its base and out of them striding along as though they owned the place were dozens of wizards rincewind thought he could recognise a few faces faces which hed seen before bumbling vaguely in lecture theatres or peering amiably at the world in the university grounds they werent faces built for evil they didnt have a fang between them but there was some common denominator among their expressions that could terrify a thoughtful person nijel pulled back behind a handy wall he found himself looking into rincewinds worried eyes hey thats magic i know said rincewind its not right nijel peered up at the sparkling tower but it feels wrong said rincewind dont ask me why half a dozen of the seriphs guards erupted from an arched doorway and plunged towards the wizards their headlong rush made all the more sinister by their hastly battle silences for a moment their swords flashed in the sunlight and then a couple of the wizards turned extended their hands and nijel looked away urgh he said a few curved swords dropped on to the cobbles i think we should very quietly go away said rincewind but didnt you see what they just turned them into dead people said rincewind i know i dont want to think about it nijel thought hed never stop thinking about it especially around sam on windy nights the point about being killed by magic was that it was much more inventive than say steel there were all sorts of interesting new ways to die and he couldnt put out of his mind the shapes hed seen just for an instant before the wash of octarine fire had mercifully engulfed them i didnt think wizards were like that he said as they hurried down a passageway i thought they were more well more silly than sinister sort of figures of fun laugh that one off then muttered rincewind but they just killed them without even i wish you wouldnt go on about it i saw it as well nijel drew back his eyes narrowed youre a wizard too he said accusingly not that kind im not said rincewind shortly what kind are you then the nonkilling kind it was the way they looked at them as if it just didnt matter said nijel shaking his head that was the worst bit yes rincewind dropped the single syllable heavily in front of nijels train of thought like a tree trunk the boy shuddered but at least he shut up rincewind actually began to feel sorry for him which was very unusualhe normally felt he needed all his pity for himself is that the first time youve seen someone killed he said yes exactly how long have you been a barbarian hero er what year is this rincewind peered around a corner but such people as were around and vertical were far too busy panicking to bother about them out on the road then he said quietly lost track of time i know how it is this is the year of the hyena oh in that case about nijels lips moved soundlesslyabout three days look he added quickly how can people kill like that without even thinking about it i dont know said rincewind in a tone of voice that suggested he was thinking about it i mean even when the vizier had me thrown in the snake pit at least he seemed to be taking an interest thats good everyone should have an interest i mean he even laughed ah a sense of humour too rincewind felt that he could see his future with the same crystal clarity that a man falling off a cliff sees the ground and for much the same reason so when nijel said they just pointed their fingers without so much as rincewind snapped just shut up will you how do you think i feel about it im a wizard too yes well youll be all right then muttered nijel it wasnt a heavy blow because even in a rage rincewind still had muscles like tapioca but it caught the side of nijels head and knocked him down more by the weight of surprise than its intrinsic energy yes im a wizard all right rincewind hissed a wizard who isnt much good at magic ive managed to survive up till now by not being important enough to die and when all wizards are hated and feared exactly how long do you think ill last thats ridiculous rincewind couldnt have been more taken aback if nijel had struck him what idiot all you have to do is stop wearing that silly robe and get rid of that daft hat and no one will even know youre a wizard rincewinds mouth opened and shut a few times as he gave a very lifelike impression of a goldfish trying to grasp the concept of tapdancing stop wearing the robe he said sure all those tatty sequins and things its a total giveaway said nijel struggling to his feet get rid of the hat youve got to admit that going around with wizzard written on it is a bit of a heavy hint rincewind gave him a worried grin sorry he said i dont quite follow you just get rid of them its easy enough isnt it just drop them somewhere and then you could be a a well whatever something that isnt a wizard there was a pause broken only by the distant sounds of fighting er said rincewind and shook his head youve lost me there good grief its perfectly simple to understand not sure i quite catch your drift murmured rincewind his face ghastly with sweat you can just stop being a wizard rincewinds lips moved soundlessly as he replayed every word one at a time then all at once what he said and then he said oh got it want to try it one more time rincewind nodded gloomily i dont think you understand a wizard isnt what you do its what you are if i wasnt a wizard i wouldnt be anything he took off his hat and twiddled nervously with the loose star on its point causing a few more cheap sequins to part company i mean its got wizard written on my hat he said its very important he stopped and stared at the hat hat he said vaguely aware of some importunate memory pressing its nose up against the windows of his mind its a good hat said nijel who felt that something was expected of him hat said rincewind again and then added the hat weve got to get the hat youve got the hat nijel pointed out not this hat the other hat and conina he took a few random steps along a passageway and then sidled back where do you suppose they are he said who theres a magic hat ive got to find and a girl why it might be rather difficult to explain i think there might be screaming involved somewhere nijel didnt have much of a jaw but such as it was he stuck it out theres a girl needs rescuing he said grimly rincewind hesitated someone will probably need rescuing he admitted it might possibly be her or at least in her vicinity why didnt you say so this is more like it this is what i was expecting this is what heroism is all about lets go there was another crash and the sound of people yelling where said rincewind anywhere heroes usually have an ability to rush madly around crumbling palaces they hardly know save everyone and get out just before the whole place blows up or sinks into the swamp in fact nijel and rincewind visited the kitchens assorted throne rooms the stables and what seemed to rincewind like several miles of corridor occasionally groups of blackclad guards would scurry past them without so much as a second glance this is ridiculous said nijel why dont we ask someone are you all right rincewind leaned against a pillar decorated with embarrassing sculpture and wheezed you could grab a guard and torture the information out of him he said gulping air nijel gave him an odd look wait here he said and wandered off until he found a servant industriously ransacking a cupboard excuse me he said which way to the harem turn left three doors down said the man without looking around right he wandered back again and told rincewind yes but did you torture him no that wasnt very barbaric of you was it well im working up to it said nijel i mean i didnt say thank you thirty seconds later they pushed aside a heavy bead curtain and entered the seraglio of the seriph of al khali there were gorgeous songbirds in cages of gold filigree there were tinkling fountains there were pots of rare orchids through which hummingbirds skimmed like tiny brilliant jewels there were about twenty young women wearing enough clothes for say about half a dozen huddled together in a silent crowd rincewind had eyes for none of this that is not to say that the sight of several dozen square yards of hip and thigh in every shade from pink to midnight black didnt start certain tides flowing deep in the crevasses of his libido but they were swamped by the considerably bigger flood of panic at the sight of four guards turning towards him with scimitars in their hands and the light of murder in their eyes without hesitation rincewind took a step backwards over to you friend he said right nijel drew his sword and held it out in front of him his arms trembling at the effort there were a few seconds of total silence as everyone waited to see what would happen next and then nijel uttered the battle cry that rincewind would never quite forget to the end of his life erm he said excuse me it seems a shame said a small wizard the others didnt speak it was a shame and there wasnt a man among them who couldnt hear the hot whine of guilt all down their backbones but as so often happens by that strange alchemy of the soul the guilt made them arrogant and reckless just shut up will you said the temporary leader he was called benado sconner but there is something in the air tonight that suggests that it is not worth committing his name to memory the air is dark and heavy and full of ghosts the unseen university isnt empty there just arent any people there but of course the six wizards sent to burn down the library arent afraid of ghosts because theyre so charged with magic that they practically buzz as they walk theyre wearing robes more splendid than any archchancellor has worn their pointy hats are more pointed than any hats have hitherto been and the reason theyre standing so close together is entirely coincidental its awfully dark in here said the smallest of the wizards its midnight said sconner sharply and the only dangerous things in here are us isnt that right boys there was a chorus of vague murmurs they were all in awe of sconner who was rumoured to do positivethinking exercises and were not scared of a few old books are we lads he glowered at the smallest wizard youre not are you he added sharply me oh no of course not theyre just paper like he said said the wizard quickly well then theres ninety thousand of them mind said another wizard i always heard there was no end to em said another its all down to dimensions i heard like what we see is only the tip of the whatever you know the thing that is mostly underwater hippopotamus alligator ocean look just shut up all of you shouted sconner he hesitated the darkness seemed to suck at the sound of his voice it packed the air like feathers he pulled himself together a bit right then he said and turned towards the forbidding doors of the library he raised his hands made a few complicated gestures in which his fingers in some eyewatering way appeared to pass through each other and shattered the doors into sawdust the waves of silence poured back again strangling the sound of falling woodchips there was no doubt that the doors were smashed four forlorn hinges hung trembling from the frame and a litter of broken benches and shelves lay in the wreckage even sconner was a little surprised there he said its as easy as that you see nothing happened to me right there was a shuffling of curlytoed boots the darkness beyond the doorway was limned with the indistinct eyeaching glow of thaumaturgic radiation as possibility particles exceeded the speed of reality in a strong magical field now then said sconner brightly who would like the honour of setting the fire ten silent seconds later he said in that case i will do it myself honestly i might as well be talking to the wall he strode through the doorway and hurried across the floor to the little patch of starlight that lanced down from the glass dome high above the centre of the library he stretched out his arms there see absolutely nothing has happened now come on in the other wizards did so with great reluctance and a tendency to duck as they passed through the ravished arch okay said sconner with some satisfaction now has everyone got their matches as instructed magical fire wont work not on these books so i want everyone to something moved up there said the smallest wizard sconner blinked what something moved up by the dome said the wizard adding by way of explanation i saw it sconner squinted upwards into the bewildering shadows and decided to exert a bit of authority nonsense he said briskly he pulled out a bundle of foulsmelling yellow matches and said now i want you all to pile i did see it you know said the small wizard sulkily all right what did you see well im not exactly you dont know do you snapped sconner i saw someth you dont know repeated sconner youre just seeing shadows just trying to undermine my authority isnt that it sconner hesitated and his eyes glazed momentarily i am calm he intoned i am totally in control i will not let it was listen shortarse you can just jolly well shut up all right one of the other wizards who had been staring upwards to conceal his embarrassment gave a strangled little cough er sconner and that goes for you too sconner pulled himself to his full bristling height and flourished the matches as i was saying he said i want you to light the matches and i suppose ill have to show you how to light matches for the benefit of shortarse thereand im not out of the window you know good grief look at me you take a match he lit a match the darkness blossomed into a ball of sulphurous white light and the librarian dropped on him like the descent of man they all knew the librarian in the same definite but diffused way that people know walls and floors and all the other minor but necessary scenery on the stage of life if they recall him at all it was as a sort of gentle mobile sigh sitting under his desk repairing books or knuckling his way among the shelves in search of secret smokers any wizard unwise enough to hazard a clandestine rollup wouldnt know anything about it until a soft leathery hand reached up and removed the offending homemade but the librarian never made a fuss he just looked extremely hurt and sorrowful about the whole sad business and then ate it whereas what was now attempting with considerable effort to unscrew sconners head by the ears was a screaming nightmare with its lips curled back to reveal long yellow fangs the terrified wizards turned to run and found themselves bumping into bookshelves that had unaccountably blocked the aisles the smallest wizard yelped and rolled under a table laden with atlases and lay with his hands over his ears to block out the dreadful sounds as the remaining wizards tried to escape eventually there was nothing but silence but it was that particularly massive silence created by something moving very stealthily as it might be in search of something else the smallest wizard ate the tip of his hat out of sheer terror the silent mover grabbed him by the leg and pulled him gently but firmly out into the open where he gibbered a bit with his eyes shut and then when ghastly teeth failed to meet in his throat ventured a quick glance the librarian picked him up by the scruff of his neck and dangled him reflectively a foot off the ground just out of reach of a small and elderly wirehaired terrier who was trying to remember how to bite peoples ankles er said the wizard and was then thrown in an almost flat trajectory through the broken doorway where his fall was broken by the floor after a while a shadow next to him said well thats it then anyone seen that daft bastard sconner and a shadow on the other side of him said i think my necks broken whos that that daft bastard said the shadow nastily oh sorry sconner sconner stood up his whole body now outlined in magical aura he was trembling with rage as he raised his hands ill show that wretched throwback to respect his evolutionary superiors he snarled get him lads and sconner was borne to the flagstones again under the weight of all five wizards sorry but you know that if you use magic near the library with all the magic thats in there get one thing wrong and its a critical mass and then bang goodnight world sconner growled the wizards sitting on him decided that getting up was not the wisest thing they could do at this point eventually he said right youre right thank you it was wrong of me to lose my temper like that clouded my judgement essential to be dispassionate youre absolutely right thank you get off they risked it sconner stood up that monkey he said has eaten its last banana fetch er ape sconner said the smallest wizard unable to stop himself its an ape you see not a monkey he wilted under the stare who cares ape monkey whats the difference said sconner whats the difference mr zoologist i dont know sconner said the wizard meekly i think its a class thing shut up yes sconner you ghastly little man said sconner he turned and added in a voice as level as a sawblade i am perfectly controlled my mind is as cool as a bald mammoth my intellect is absolutely in charge which one of you sat on my head no i must not get angry i am not angry i am thinking positively my faculties are fully engaged do any of you wish to argue no sconner they chorused then get me a dozen barrels of oil and all the kindling you can find that apes gonna fry from high in the library roof home of owls and bats and other things there was a clink of chain and the sound of glass being broken as respectfully as possible they dont look very worried said nijel slightly affronted how can i put this said rincewind when they come to write the list of great battle cries of the world erm excuse me wont be one of them he stepped to one side im not with him he said earnestly to a grinning guard i just met him somewhere in a pit he gave a little laugh this sort of thing happens to me all the time he said the guards stared through him erm he said okay he said he sidled back to nijel are you any good with that sword without taking his eyes off the guards nijel fumbled in his pack and handed rincewind the book ive read the whole of chapter three he said its got illustrations rincewind turned over the crumpled pages the book had been used so hard you could have shuffled it but what was probably once the front cover showed a rather poor woodcut of a muscular man he had arms like two bags full of footballs and he was standing kneedeep in languorous women and slaughtered victims with a smug expression on his face about him was the legend inne juste dayes i wille make you a barbearian hero below it in a slightly smaller type was the name cohen the barbarean rincewind rather doubted it he had met cohen and while he could read after a fashion the old boy had never really mastered the pen and still signed his name with an x which he usually spelled wrong on the other hand he gravitated rapidly to anything with money in it rincewind looked again at the illustration and then at nijel seven days well im a slow reader ah said rincewind and i didnt bother with chapter six because i promised my mother id stick with just the looting and pillaging until i find the right girl and this book teaches you how to be a hero oh yes its very good nijel gave him a worried glance thats all right isnt it it cost a lot of money well er i suppose youd better get on with it then nijel squared his for want of a better word shoulders and waved his sword again you four had better just jolly well watch out he said or hold on a moment he took the book from rincewind and riffled through the pages until he found what he was looking for and continued yes or the chill winds of fate will blow through your bleached skeletons the legions of hell will drown your living soul in acid there how dyou like them excuse me a moment apples there was a metallic chord as four men drew their swords in perfect harmony nijels sword became a blur it made a complicated figure eight in the air in front of him spun over his arm flicked from hand to hand behind his back seemed to orbit his chest twice and leapt like a salmon one or two of the harem ladies broke into spontaneous applause even the guards looked impressed thats a triple orcthrust with extra flip said nijel proudly i broke a lot of mirrors learning that look theyre stopping theyve never seen anything like it i imagine said rincewind weakly judging the distance to the doorway i should think not especially the last bit where it stuck in the ceiling nijel looked upwards funny he said it always did that at home too i wonder what im doing wrong search me gosh im sorry said nijel as the guards seemed to realise that the entertainment was over and closed in for the kill dont blame youself said rincewind as nijel reached up and tried unsuccessfully to free the blade thank you ill do it for you rincewind considered his next step in fact he considered several steps but the door was too far away and anyway by the sound of it things were not a lot healthier out there there was only one thing for it hed have to try magic he raised his hand and two of the men fell over he raised his other hand and the other two fell over just as he was beginning to wonder about this conina stepped daintily over the prone bodies idly rubbing the sides of her hands i thought youd never turn up she said whos your friend as has already been indicated the luggage seldom shows any sign of emotion or at least any emotion less extreme than blind rage and hatred and therefore it is hard to gauge its feelings when it woke up a few miles outside al khali on its lid in a driedup wadi with its legs in the air even a few minutes after dawn the air was like the breath of a furnace after a certain amount of rocking the luggage managed to get most of its feet pointing the right way and stood doing a complicated slowmotion jig to keep as few of them on the burning sand as possible it wasnt lost it always knew exactly where it was it was always here it was just that everywhere else seemed to have been temporarily mislaid after some deliberation the luggage turned and walked very slowly into a boulder it backed away and sat down rather puzzled it felt as though it had been stuffed with hot feathers and it was dimly aware of the benefits of shade and a nice cool drink after a few false starts it walked to the top of a nearby sand dune which gave it an unrivalled view of hundreds of other dunes deep in its heartwood the luggage was troubled it had been spurned it had been told to go away it had been rejected it had also drunk enough orakh to poison a small country if there is one thing a travel accessory needs more than anything else it is someone to belong to the luggage set off unsteadily across the scorching sand full of hope i dont think weve got time for introductions said rincewind as a distant part of the palace collapsed with a thump that vibrated the floor its time we were he realised he was talking to himself nijel let go of the sword conina stepped forward oh no said rincewind but it was far too late the world had suddenly separated into two parts the bit which contained nijel and conina and the bit which contained everything else the air between them crackled probably in their half a distant orchestra was playing bluebirds were tweeting little pink clouds were barrelling through the sky and all the other things that happen at times like this when that sort of thing is going on mere collapsing palaces in the next world dont stand a chance look perhaps we can just get the introductions over with said rincewind desperately nijel the destroyer said nijel dreamily all right nijel the destroyer said rincewind and added son of harebut the mighty said nijel rincewind gaped a bit and then shrugged well whoever he conceded anyway this is conina which is rather a coincidence because youll be interested to know that her father was mmph conina without turning her gaze had extended a hand and held rincewinds face in a gentle grip which with only a slight increase in finger pressure could have turned his head into a bowling ball although i could be mistaken he added when she took her hand away who knows who cares what does it matter they didnt take any notice ill just go and see if i can find the hat shall i he said good idea murmured conina i expect i shall get murdered but i dont mind said rincewind jolly good said nijel i dont expect anyone will even notice im gone said rincewind fine fine said conina i shall be chopped into small pieces i expect said rincewind walking toward the door at the speed of a dying snail conina blinked what hat she said and then oh that hat i suppose theres no possible chance that you two might be of some assistance rincewind ventured somewhere inside conina and nijels private world the bluebirds went to roost the little pink clouds drifted away and the orchestra packed up and sneaked off to do a private gig at a nightclub somewhere a bit of reality reasserted itself conina dragged her admiring gaze away from nijels rapt face and turned it on to rincewind where it grew slightly cooler she sidled across the floor and grabbed the wizard by the arm look she said you wont tell him who i really am will you only boys get funny ideas and well anyway if you do i will personally break all your ill be far too busy said rincewind what with you helping me get the hat and everything not that i can imagine what you see in him he added haughtily hes nice i dont seem to meet many nice people yes well hes looking at us so what youre not frightened of him are you suppose he talks to me rincewind looked blank not for the first time in his life he felt that there were whole areas of human experience that had passed him by if areas could pass by people maybe he had passed them by he shrugged why did you let them take you off to the harem without a fight he said ive always wanted to know what went on in one there was a pause well said rincewind well we all sat round and then after a bit the seriph came in and then he asked me over and said that since i was new it would be my turn and then youll never guess what he wanted me to do the girls said its the only thing hes interested in er are you all right fine fine rincewind muttered your face has gone all shiny no im fine fine he asked me to tell him a story what about said rincewind suspiciously the other girls said he prefers something with rabbits in it ah rabbits small fluffy white ones but the only stories i know are the ones father taught me when i was little and i dont think theyre really suitable not many rabbits lots of arms and legs being chopped off said conina and sighed thats why you mustnt tell him about me you see im just not cut out for a normal life telling stories in a harem isnt bloody normal said rincewind itll never catch on hes looking at us again conina grabbed rincewinds arm he shook her off oh good grief he said and hurried across the room to nijel who grabbed his other arm you havent been telling her about me have you he demanded ill never live it down if youve told her that im only just learning how nonono she just wants you to help us its a sort of quest nijels eyes gleamed you mean a geas he said pardon its in the book to be a proper hero it says youve got to labour under a geas rincewinds forehead wrinkled is it a sort of bird i think its more a sort of obligation or something said nijel but without much certainty sounds more like a kind of bird to me said rincewind im sure i read it in a bestiary once large couldnt fly big pink legs it had his face went blank as his ears digested what they had just heard his lips say five seconds later they were out of the room leaving behind four prone guards and the harem ladies themselves who settled down for a bit of storytelling the desert rimwards of al khali is bisected by the river tsort famed in myth and lies which insinuates its way through the brown landscapes like a long damp descriptive passage punctuated with sandbanks and every sandbank is covered with sunbaked logs and most of the logs are the kind of logs that have teeth and most of the logs opened one lazy eye at the distant sounds of splashing from upstream and suddenly most of the logs had legs a dozen scaly bodies slipped into the turbid waters which rolled over them again the dark waters were unruffled except for a few inconsequential v shaped ripples the luggage paddled gently down the stream the water was making it feel a little better it spun gently in the weak current the focus of several mysterious little swirls that sped across the surface of the water the ripples converged the luggage jerked its lid flew open it shot under the surface with a brief despairing creak the chocolatecoloured waters of the tsort rolled back again they were getting good at it and the tower of sourcery loomed over al khali like a vast and beautiful fungus the kind that appear in books with little skullandcrossbones symbols beside them the seriphs guard had fought back but there were now quite a lot of bewildered frogs and newts around the base of the tower and they were the fortunate ones they still had arms and legs of a sort and most of their essential organs were still on the inside the city was under the rule of sourcery martial lore some of the buildings nearest the base of the tower were already turning into the bright white marble that the wizards obviously preferred the trio stared out through a hole in the palace walls very impressive said conina critically your wizards are more powerful than i thought not my wizards said rincewind i dont know whose wizards they are i dont like it all the wizards i knew couldnt stick one brick on another i dont like the idea of wizards ruling everybody said nijel of course as a hero i am philosophically against the whole idea of wizardry in any case the time will come when his eyes glazed slightly as if he was trying to remember something hed seen somewhere the time will come when all wizardry has gone from the face of the world and the sons of of anyway we can all be a bit more practical about things he added lamely read it in a book did you said rincewind sourly any geas in it hes got a point said conina ive nothing against wizards but its not as if they do much good there just a bit of decoration really up to now rincewind pulled off his hat it was battered stained and covered with rock dust bits of it had been sheared off the point was dented and the star was shedding sequins like pollen but the word blizzard was still just readable under the grime see this he demanded red in the face do you see it do you what does it tell you that you cant spell said nijel what no it says im a wizard thats what twenty years behind the staff and proud of it ive done my time i have ive pas ive sat dozens of exams if all the spells ive read were piled on top of one another theyd itd youd have a lot of spells yes but conina began yes youre not actually very good at them are you rincewind glared at her he tried to think of what to say next and a small receptor area opened in his mind at the same time as an inspiration particle its path bent and skewed by a trillion random events screamed down through the atmosphere and burst silently just at the right spot talent just defines what you do he said it doesnt define what you are deep down i mean when you know what you are you can do anything he thought a bit more and added thats what makes sourcerers so powerful the important thing is to know what you really are there was a pause full of philosophy rincewind said conina kindly hmm said rincewind who was still wondering how the words got into his head you really are an idiot do you know that you will all stand very still abrim the vizier stepped out of a ruined archway he was wearing the archchancellors hat the desert fried under the flame of the sun nothing moved except the shimmering air hot as a stolen volcano dry as a skull a basilisk lay panting in the baking shade of a rock dribbling corrosive yellow slime for the last five minutes its ears had been detecting the faint thump of hundreds of little legs moving unsteadily over the dunes which seemed to indicate that dinner was on the way it blinked its legendary eyes and uncoiled twenty feet of hungry body winding out and on to the sand like fluid death the luggage staggered to a halt and raised its lid threateningly the basilisk hissed but a little uncertainly because it had never seen a walking box before and certainly never one with lots of alligator teeth stuck in its lid there were also scraps of leathery hide adhering to it as though it had been involved in a fight in a handbag factory and in a way that the basilisk wouldnt have been able to describe even if it could talk it appeared to be glaring right the reptile thought if thats the way you want to play it it turned on the luggage a stare like a diamond drill a stare that nipped in via the starees eyeballs and flayed the brain from the inside a stare that tore the frail net curtains on the windows of the soul a stare that the basilisk realised something was very wrong an entirely new and unwelcome sensation started to arise just behind its saucershaped eyes it started small like the little itch in those few square inches of back that no amount of writhing will allow you to scratch and grew until it became a second redhot internal sun the basilisk was feeling a terrible overpowering and irresistible urge to blink it did something incredibly unwise it blinked hes talking through his hat said rincewind eh said nijel who was beginning to realise that the world of the barbarian hero wasnt the clean simple place he had imagined in the days when the most exciting thing he had ever done was stack parsnips the hats talking through him you mean said conina and she backed away too as one tends to do in the presence of horror eh i will not harm you you have been of some service said abrim stepping forwards with his hands out but you are right he thought he could gain power through wearing me of course it is the other way around an astonishingly devious and clever mind so you tried his head on for size said rincewind he shuddered hed worn the hat obviously he didnt have the right kind of mind abrim did have the right kind of mind and now his eyes were grey and colourless his skin was pale and he walked as though his body was hanging down from his head nijel had pulled out his book and was riffling feverishly through the pages what on earth are you doing said conina not taking her eyes off the ghastly figure im looking up the index of wandering monsters said nijel do you think its an undead theyre awfully difficult to kill you need garlic and you wont find this in there said rincewind slowly its its a vampire hat of course it might be a zombie said nijel running his finger down a page it says here you need black pepper and sea salt but youre supposed to fight the bloody things not eat them said conina this is a mind i can use said the hat now i can fight back i shall rally wizardry there is room for only one magic in this world and i embody it sourcery beware oh no said rincewind under his breath wizardry has learned a lot in the last twenty centuries this upstart can be beaten you three will follow me it wasnt a request it wasnt even an order it was a sort of forecast the voice of the hat went straight to the hindbrain without bothering to deal with the consciousness and rincewinds legs started to move of their own accord the other two also jerked forward walking with the awkward dolllike jerking that suggested that they too were on invisible strings why the oh no said conina i mean oh no on general principles i can understand but was there any particular reason if we get a chance we must run said rincewind did you have anywhere in mind it probably wont matter were doomed anyway why said nijel well said rincewind have you ever heard of the mage wars there were a lot of things on the disc that owed their origin to the mage wars sapient pearwood was one of them the original tree was probably perfectly normal and spent its days drinking groundwater and eating sunshine in a state of blessed unawareness and then the magic wars broke around it and pitchforked its genes into a state of acute perspicacity it also left it ingrained as it were with a bad temper but sapient pearwood got off lightly once when the level of background magic on the disc was young and high and found every opportunity to burst on the world wizards were all as powerful as sourcerers and built their towers on every hilltop and if there was one thing a really powerful wizard cant stand it is another wizard his instinctive approach to diplomacy is to hex em till they glow then curse them in the dark that could only mean one thing all right two things three things allout thaumaturgical war and there were of course no alliances no sides no deals no mercy no cease the skies twisted the seas boiled the scream and whizz of fireballs turned the night into day but that was all right because the ensuing clouds of black smoke turned the day into night the landscape rose and fell like a honeymoon duvet and the very fabric of space itself was tied in multidimensional knots and bashed on a flat stone down by the river of time for example a popular spell at the time was pelepels temporal compressor which on one occasion resulted in a race of giant reptiles being created evolving spreading flourishing and then being destroyed in the space of about five minutes leaving only its bones in the earth to mislead forthcoming generations completely trees swam fishes walked mountains strolled down to the shops for a packet of cigarettes and the mutability of existence was such that the first thing any cautious person would do when they woke up in the mornings was count their arms and legs that was in fact the problem all the wizards were pretty evenly matched and in any case lived in high towers well protected with spells which meant that most magical weapons rebounded and landed on the common people who were trying to scratch an honest living from what was temporarily the soil and lead ordinary decent lives but still the fighting raged battering the very structure of the universe of order weakening the walls of reality and threatening to topple the whole rickety edifice of time and space into the darkness of the dungeon dimensions one story said that the gods stepped in but the gods dont usually take a hand in human affairs unless it amuses them another one and this was the one that the wizards themselves told and wrote down in their books was that the wizards themselves got together and settled their differences amicably for the good of mankind and this was generally accepted as the true account despite being as internally likely as a lead lifebelt the truth isnt easily pinned to a page in the bathtub of history the truth is harder to hold than the soap and much more difficult to find what happened then said conina it doesnt matter said rincewind mournfully its going to start all over again i can feel it ive got this instinct theres too much magic flowing into the world theres going to be a horrible war its all going to happen the disc is too old to take it this time everythings been worn too thin doom darkness and destruction bear down on us the apocralypse is nigh death walks abroad added nijel helpfully what snapped rincewind angry at being interrupted i said death walks abroad said nijel abroad i dont mind said rincewind theyre all foreigners its death walking around here im not looking forward to its only a metaphor said conina thats all you know ive met him what did he look like said nijel put it like this yes he didnt need a hairdresser now the sun was a blowlamp nailed to the sky and the only difference between the sand and redhot ash was the colour the luggage plodded erratically across the burning dunes there were a few traces of yellow slime rapidly drying on its lid the lonely little oblong was watched from atop of a stone pinnacle the shape and temperature of a firebrick by a chimera the chimera was an extremely rare species and this particular one wasnt about to do anything to help matters it judged its moment carefully kicked away with its talons folded its leathery wings and plummeted down towards its victim the chimeras technique was to swoop low over the prey lightly boiling it with its fiery breath and then turn and rend its dinner with its teeth it managed the fire part but then at the point where experience told the creature it should be facing a stricken and terrified victim found itself on the ground in the path of a scorched and furious luggage the only thing incandescent about the luggage was its rage it had spent several hours with a headache during which it had seemed the whole world had tried to attack it it had had enough when it had stamped the unfortunate chimera into a greasy puddle on the sand it paused for a moment apparently considering its future it was becoming clear that not belonging to anyone was a lot harder than it had thought it had vague comforting recollections of service and a wardrobe to call its own it turned around very slowly pausing frequently to open its lid it might have been sniffing the air if it had a nose at last it made up its mind if it had a mind the hat and its wearer also strode purposefully across the rubble that had been the legendary rhoxie to the foot of the tower of sourcery their unwilling entourage straggling along behind them there were doors at the foot of the tower unlike those of unseen university which were usually propped wide open they were tightly shut they seemed to glow you three are privileged to be here said the hat through abrims slack mouth this is the moment when wizardry stops running he glanced witheringly at rincewind and starts fighting back you will remember it for the rest of your lives what until lunchtime said rincewind weakly watch closely said abrim he extended his hands if we get a chance whispered rincewind to nijel we run right where to from said rincewind the important word is from i dont trust this man said nijel i try not to judge from first impressions but i definitely think hes up to no good he had you thrown in a snake pit perhaps i should have taken the hint the vizier started to mutter even rincewind whose few talents included a gift for languages didnt recognise it but it sounded the kind of language designed specifically for muttering the words curling out like scythes at ankle height dark and red and merciless they made complicated swirls in the air and then drifted gently towards the doors of the tower where they touched the white marble it turned black and crumbled as the remains drifted to the ground a wizard stepped through and looked abrim up and down rincewind was used to the dressy ways of wizards but this one was really impressive his robe so padded and crenellated and buttressed in fantastic folds and creases that it had probably been designed by an architect the matching hat looked like a wedding cake that had collided intimately with a christmas tree the actual face peering through the small gap between the baroque collar and the filigreed fringe of the brim was a bit of a disappointment at some time in the past it had thought its appearance would be improved by a thin scruffy moustache it had been wrong that was our bloody door it said youre really going to regret this abrim folded his arms this seemed to infuriate the other wizard he flung up his arms untangled his hands from the lace on his sleeves and sent a flare screaming across the gap it struck abrim in the chest and rebounded in a gout of incandescence but when the blue afterimages allowed rincewind to see he saw abrim unharmed his opponent frantically patted out the last of the little fires in his own clothing and looked up with murder in his eyes you dont seem to understand he rasped its sourcery youre dealing with now you cant fight sourcery i can use sourcery said abrim the wizard snarled and lofted a fireball which burst harmlessly inches from abrims dreadful grin a look of acute puzzlement passed across the other ones face he tried again sending lines of bluehot magic lancing straight from infinity towards abrims heart abrim waved them away your choice is simple he said you can join me or you can die it was at this point that rincewind became aware of a regular scraping sound close to his ear it had an unpleasant metallic ring he halfturned and felt the familiar and very uncomfortable prickly feeling of time slowing down around him death paused in the act of running a whetstone along the edge of his scythe and gave him a nod of acknowledgement as between one professional and another he put a bony digit to his lips or rather to the place where his lips would have been if hed had lips all wizards can see death but they dont necessarily want to there was a popping in rincewinds ears and the spectre vanished abrim and the rival wizard were surrounded by a corona of randomised magic and it was evidently having no effect on abrim rincewind drifted back into the land of the living just in time to see the man reach out and grab the wizard by his tasteless collar you cannot defeat me he said in the hats voice i have had two thousand years of harnessing power to my own ends l can draw my power from your power yeld to me or you wont even have time to regret it the wizard struggled and unfortunately let pride win over caution never he said die suggested abrim rincewind had seen many strange things in his life most of them with extreme reluctance but he had never seen anyone actually killed by magic wizards didnt kill ordinary people because a they seldom noticed them and b it wasnt considered sporting and c besides whod do all the cooking and growing food and things and killing a brother wizard with magic was wellnigh impossible on account of the layers of protective spells that any cautious wizard maintained about his person at all times the first thing a young wizard learns at unseen university apart from where his peg is and which way to the lavatory is that he must protect himself at all times some people think this is paranoia but it isnt paranoids only think everyone is out to get them wizards know it the little wizard was wearing the psychic equivalent of three feet of tempered steel and it was being melted like butter under a blowlamp it streamed away vanished if there are words to describe what happened to the wizard next then theyre imprisoned inside a wild thesaurus in the unseen university library perhaps its best left to the imagination except that anyone able to imagine the kind of shape that rincewind saw writhing painfully for a few seconds before it mercifully vanished must be a candidate for the famous white canvas blazer with the optional long sleeves so perish all enemies said abrim he turned his face up to the heights of the tower i challenge he said and those who will not face me must follow me according to the lore there was a long thick pause caused by a lot of people listening very hard eventually from the top of the tower a voice called out uncertainly whereabouts in the lore i embody the lore there was a distant whispering and then the same voice called out the lore is dead sourcery is above the lo the sentence ended in a scream because abrim raised his left hand and sent a thin beam of green light in the precise direction of the speaker it was at about this moment that rincewind realised that he could move his limbs himself the hat had temporarily lost interest in them he glanced sideways at conina in instant unspoken agreement they each grasped one of nijels arms and turned and ran and didnt stop until theyd put several walls between them and the tower rincewind ran expecting something to hit him in the back of the neck possibly the world all three landed in the rubble and lay there panting you neednt have done that muttered nijel i was just getting ready to really give him a seeingto how can i ever there was an explosion behind them and shafts of multicoloured fire screamed overhead striking sparks off the masonry then there was a sound like an enormous cork being pulled out of a small bottle and a peal of laughter that somehow wasnt very amusing the ground shook whats going on said conina magical war said rincewind is that good no but surely you want wizardry to triumph said nijel rincewind shrugged and ducked as something unseen and big whirred overhead making a noise like a partridge ive never seen wizards fight said nijel he started to scramble up the rubble and screamed as conina grabbed him by the leg i dont think that would be a good idea she said rincewind the wizard shook his head gloomily and picked up a pebble he tossed it up above the ruined wall where it turned into a small blue teapot it smashed when it hit the ground the spells react with one another he said theres no telling what theyll do but were safe behind this wall said conina rincewind brightened a bit are we he said i was asking you oh no i shouldnt think so its just ordinary stone the right spell and phooey phooey right shall we run away again its worth a try they made it to another upright wall a few seconds before a randomly spitting ball of yellow fire landed where they had been lying and turned the ground into something awful the whole area around the tower was a tornado of sparkling air we need a plan said nijel we could try running again said rincewind that doesnt solve anything solves most things said rincewind how far do we have to go to be safe said conina rincewind risked a look around the wall interesting philosophical question he said ive been a long way and ive never been safe conina sighed and stared at a pile of rubble nearby she stared at it again there was something odd there and she couldnt quite put her finger on it i could rush at them said nijel vaguely he stared yearningly at coninas back wouldnt work said rincewind nothing works against magic except stronger magic and then the only thing that beats stronger magic is even stronger magic and next thing you know phooey suggested nijel it happened before said rincewind went on for thousands of years until not a do you know whats odd about that heap of stone said conina rincewind glanced at it he screwed up his eyes what apart from the legs he said it took several minutes to dig the seriph out he was still clutching a wine bottle which was almost empty and blinked at them all in vague recognition powerful he said and then after some effort added stuff this vintage felt he continued as though the place fell on me it did said rincewind ah that would be it then creosote focused on conina after several attempts and rocked backwards my word he said the young lady again very impressive i say nijel began your hair said the seriph rocking slowly forward again is like is like a flock of goats that graze upon the side of mount gebra look here your breasts are like like the seriph swayed sideways a little and gave a brief sorrowful glance at the empty bottle are like the jewelled melons in the fabled gardens of dawn coninas eyes widened they are she said no said the seriph doubt about it i know jewelled melons when i see them as the white does in the meadows of the water margin are your thighs which erm excuse mesaid nijel clearing his throat with malice aforethought creosote swayed in his direction hmm he said where i come from said nijel stonily we dont talk to ladies like that conina sighed as nijel shuffled protectively in front of her it was she reflected absolutely true in fact he went on sticking out his jaw as far as possible which still made it appear like a dimple ive a jolly good mind open to debate said rincewind stepping forward er sir sire we need to get out i suppose you wouldnt know the way thousands of rooms said the seriph in here you know not been out in years he hiccuped decades ians never been out in fact his face glazed over in the act of composition the bird of time has but um a little way to walk and lo the bird is on its feet its a geas muttered rincewind creosote swayed at him abrim does all the ruling you see terrible hard work hes not said rincewind making a very good job of it just at present and wed sort of like to get away said conina who was still turning over the phrase about the goats and ive got this geas said nijel glaring at rincewind creosote patted him on the arm thats nice he said everyone should have a pet so if you happen to know if you own any stables or anything prompted rincewind hundreds said creosote i own some of the finest most finest horses in the world his brow wrinkled so they tell me but you wouldnt happen to know where they are not as such the seriph admitted a random spray of magic turned the nearby wall into arsenic meringue i think we might have been better off in the snake pit said rincewind turning away creosote took another sorrowful glance at his empty wine bottle i know where theres a magic carpet he said no said rincewind raising his hands protectively absolutely not dont even it belonged to my grandfather a real magic carpet said nijel listen said rincewind urgently i get vertigo just listening to tall stories oh quite the seriph burped gently genuine very pretty pattern he squinted at the bottle again and sighed it was a lovely blue colour he added and you wouldnt happen to know where it is said conina slowly in the manner of one creeping up very carefully to a wild animal that might take fright at any moment in the treasury i know the way there im extremely rich you know or so they tell me he lowered his voice and tried to wink at conina eventually managing it with both eyes we could sit on it he said breaking into a sweat and you could tell me a story rincewind tried to scream through gritted teeth his ankles were already beginning to sweat im not going to ride on a magic carpet he hissed im afraid of grounds you mean heights said conina and stop being silly i know what i mean its the grounds that kill you the battle of al khali was a hammerheaded cloud in whose roiling depths weird shapes could be heard and strange sounds were seen occasional misses seared across the city where they landed things were different for example a large part of the soak had turned into an impenetrable forest of giant yellow mushrooms noone knew what effect this had on its inhabitants although possibly they hadnt noticed the temple of offler the crocodile god patron deity of the city was now a rather ugly sugary thing constructed in five dimensions but this was no problem because it was being eaten by a herd of giant ants on the other hand not many people were left to appreciate this statement against uncontrolled civic alteration because most of them were running for their lives they fled across the fertile fields in a steady stream some had taken to boats but this method of escape had ceased when most of the harbour area turned into a swamp in which for no obvious reason a couple of small pink elephants were building a nest down below the panic on the roads the luggage paddled slowly up one of the reedlined drainage ditches a little way ahead of it a moving wave of small alligators rats and snapping turtles was pouring out of the water and scrambling frantically up the bank propelled by some vague but absolutely accurate animal instinct the luggages lid was set in an expression of grim determination it didnt want much out of the world except for the total extinction of every other lifeform but what it needed more than anything else now was its owner it was easy to see that the room was a treasury by its incredible emptiness doors hung off hooks barred alcoves had been smashed in lots of smashed chests lay around and this gave rincewind a pang of guilt and he wondered for about two seconds where the luggage had got to there was a respectful silence as there always is when large sums of money have just passed away nijel wandered off and prodded some of the chests in a forlorn search for secret drawers as per the instructions in chapter eleven conina reached down and picked up a small copper coin how horrible said rincewind eventually a treasury with no treasure in it the seriph stood and beamed not to worry he said but all your money has been stolen said conina the servants i expect said creosote very disloyal of them rincewind gave him an odd look doesnt it worry you not much i never really spent anything ive often wondered what being poor was like youre going to get a huge opportunity to find out will i need training it comes naturally said rincewind you pick it up as you go along there was a distant explosion and part of the ceiling turned to jelly erm excuse me said nijel this carpet yes said conina the carpet creosote gave them a benevolent slightly tipsy smile ah yes the carpet push the nose of the statue behind you peachbuttocked jewel of the desert dawn conina blushing performed this act of minor sacrilege on a large green statue of offler the crocodile god nothing happened secret compartments assiduously failed to open um try the left hand she gave it an experimental twist creosote scratched his head maybe it was the right hand i should try and remember if i were you said conina sharply when that didnt work either there arent many bits left that id care to pull whats that thing there said rincewind youre really going to hear about it if it isnt the tail said conina and gave it a kick there was a distant metallic groaning noise like a saucepan in pain the statue shuddered it was followed by a few heavy clonks somewhere inside the wall and offler the crocodile god grated ponderously aside there was a tunnel behind him my grandfather had this built for our more interesting treasure said creosote he was very he groped for a wordingenious if you think im setting foot in there rincewind began stand aside said nijel loftily i will go first there could be traps said conina doubtfully she shot the seriph a glance oh probably o gazelle of heaven he said i havent been in there since i was six there were some slabs you shouldnt tread on i think dont worry about that said nijel peering into the gloom of the tunnel i shouldnt think theres a booby trap that i couldnt spot had a lot of experience at this sort of thing have you said rincewind sourly well i know chapter fourteen off by heart it had illustrations said nijel and ducked into the shadows they waited for several minutes in what would have been a horrified hush if it wasnt for the muffled grunts and occasional thumping noises from the tunnel eventually nijels voice echoed back down to them from a distance theres absolutely nothing he said ive tried everything its as steady as a rock everything must have seized up or something rincewind and conina exchanged glances he doesnt know the first thing about traps she said when i was five my father made me walk all the way down a passage that hed rigged up just to teach me he got through didnt he said rincewind there was a noise like a damp finger dragged across glass but amplified a billion times and the floor shook anyway we havent got a lot of choice he added and ducked into the tunnel the others followed him many people who had got to know rincewind had come to treat him as a sort of twolegged miners canary and tended to assume that if rincewind was still upright and not actually running then some hope remained this is fun said creosote me robbing my own treasury if i catch myself i can have myself flung into the snake pit but you could throw yourself on your mercy said conina running a paranoid eye over the dusty stonework oh no i think i would have to teach me a lesson as an example to myself there was a little click above them a small slab slid aside and a rusty metal hook descended slowly and jerkily another bar creaked out of the wall and tapped rincewind on the shoulder as he swung around the first hook hung a yellowing notice on his back and retracted into the roof whatd it do whatd it do screamed rincewind trying to read his own shoulderblades it says kick me said conina a section of wall slid up beside the petrified wizard a large boot on the end of a complicated series of metal joints gave a halfhearted wobble and then the whole thing snapped at the knee the three of them looked at it in silence then conina said were dealing here with a warped brain i can tell rincewind gingerly unhooked the sign and let it drop conina pushed past him and stalked along the passage with an air of angry caution and when a metal hand extended itself on a spring and waggled in a friendly fashion she didnt shake it but instead traced its moulting wiring to a couple of corroded electrodes in a big glass jar your grandad was a man with a sense of humour she said oh yes always liked a chuckle said creosote oh good said conina she prodded gingerly at a flagstone which to rincewind looked no different to any of its fellows with a sad little springy noise a moulting feather duster wobbled out of the wall at armpit height i think i would have quite liked to meet the old seriph she said through gritted teeth although not to shake him by the hand youd better give me a leg up here wizard pardon conina pointed irritably to a halfopen stone doorway just ahead of them i want to look up there she said you just put your hands together for me to stand on right how do you manage to be so useless being useful always gets me into trouble muttered rincewind trying to ignore the warm flesh brushing against his nose he could hear her rooting around above the door i thought so she said what is it fiendishly sharp spears poised to drop no spiked grill ready to skewer its a bucket said conina flatly giving it a push what of scalding poisonous whitewash just a lot of old driedup whitewash conina jumped down thats grandfather for you said creosote never a dull moment well ive just about had enough conina said firmly and pointed to the far end of the tunnel come on you two they were about three feet from the far end when rincewind felt a movement in the air above him conina struck him in the small of the back shoving him forward into the room beyond he rolled when he hit the floor and something nicked his foot at the same time as a loud thump deafened him the entire roof a huge block of stone four feet thick had dropped into the tunnel rincewind crawled forward through the dust clouds and with a trembling finger traced the lettering on the side of the slab laugh this one off he said he sat back thats grandad said creosote happily always a he intercepted coninas gaze which had the force of a lead pipe and wisely shut up nijel emerged from the clouds coughing i say what happened he said is everyone all right it didnt do that when i went through rincewind sought for a reply and couldnt find anything better than didnt it light filtered into the deep room from tiny barred windows up near the roof there was no way out except by walking through the several hundred tons of stone that blocked the tunnel or to put it in another way which was the way rincewind put it they were undoubtedly trapped he relaxed a bit at least there was no mistaking the magic carpet it lay rolled up on a raised slab in the middle of the room next to it was a small sleek oil lamp and rincewind craned to see a small gold ring he groaned a faint octarine corona hung over all three items indicating that they were magical when conina unrolled the carpet a number of small objects tumbled on to the floor including a brass herring a wooden ear a few large square sequins and a lead box with a preserved soap bubble in it what on earth are they said nijel well said rincewind before they tried to eat that carpet they were probably moths gosh thats what you people never understand said rincewind wearily you think magic is just something you can pick up and use like a a parsnip said nijel wine bottle said the seriph something like that said rincewind cautiously but rallied somewhat and went on but the truth is is not like that more like a wine bottle said the seriph hopefully magic uses people said rincewind hurriedly it affects you as much as you affect it sort of thing you cant mess around with magical things without it affecting you i just thought id better warn you like a wine bottle said creosote that drinks you back said rincewind so you can put down that lamp and ring for a start and for goodness sake dont rub anything my grandfather built up the family fortunes with them said creosote wistfully his wicked uncle locked him in a cave you know he had to set himself up with what came to hand he had nothing in the whole world but a magic carpet a magic lamp a magic ring and a grottoful of assorted jewels came up the hard way did he said rincewind conina spread the carpet on the floor it had a complex pattern of golden dragons on a blue background they were extremely complicated dragons with long beards ears and wings and they seemed to be frozen in motion caught in transition from one state to another suggesting that the loom which wove them had rather more dimensions than the usual three but the worst thing about it was that if you looked at it long enough the pattern became blue dragons on a gold background and a terrible feeling stole over you that if you kept on trying to see both types of dragon at once your brains would trickle out of your ears rincewind tore his gaze away with some difficulty as another distant explosion rocked the building how does it work he said creosote shrugged ive never used it he said i suppose you just say up and down and things like that how about fly through the wall said rincewind all three of them looked up at the high dark and above all solid walls of the room we could try sitting on it and saying rise nijel volunteered and then before we hit the roof we could say well stop he considered this for a bit and then added if thats the word or drop said rincewind or descend dive fall sink or plunge plummet suggested conina gloomily of course said nijel with all this wild magic floating around you could try using some of it ah said rincewind and well youve got wizzard written on your hat said creosote anyone can write things on their hat said conina you dont want to believe everything you read now hold on a minute said rincewind hotly they held on a minute they held on for a further seventeen seconds look its a lot harder than you think he said what did i tell you said conina come on lets dig the mortar out with our fingernails rincewind waved her into silence removed his hat pointedly blew the dust off the star put the hat on again adjusted the brim rolled up his sleeves flexed his fingers and panicked in default of anything better to do he leaned against the stone it was vibrating it wasnt that it was being shaken it felt that the throbbing was coming from inside the wall it was very much the same sort of trembling he had felt back at the university just before the sourcerer arrived the stone was definitely very unhappy about something he sidled along the wall and put his ear to the next stone which was a smaller wedgeshaped stone cut to fit an angle of the wall not a big distinguished stone but a bantam stone patiently doing its bit for the greater good of the wall as a whole it was also shaking shh said conina i cant hear anything said nijel loudly nijel was one of those people who if you say dont look now would immediately swivel his head like an owl on a turntable these are the same people who when you point out say an unusual crocus just beside them turn round aimlessly and put their foot down with a sad little squashy noise if they were lost in a trackless desert you could find them by putting down somewhere on the sand something small and fragile like a valuable old mug that had been in your family for generations and then hurrying back as soon as you heard the crash anyway thats the point what happened to the war a little cascade of mortar poured down from the ceiling on to rincewinds hat somethings acting on the stones he said quietly theyre trying to break free were right underneath quite a lot of them observed creosote there was a grinding noise above them and a shaft of daylight lanced down to rincewinds surprise it wasnt accompanied by sudden death from crushing there was another silicon creak and the hole grew the stones were falling out and they were falling up i think he said that the carpet might be worth a try at this point the wall beside him shook itself like a dog and drifted apart its masonry giving rincewind several severe blows as it soared away the four of them landed on the blue and gold carpet in a storm of flying rock weve got to get out of here said nijel keeping up his reputation for acute observation hang on said rincewind ill say you wont snapped conina kneeling beside him ill say i dont trust you but youve shut up said conina she patted the carpet carpet rise she commanded there was a pause up perhaps it doesnt understand the language said nijel lift levitate fly or it could be say sensitive to one particular voice shut up you tried up said nijel try ascend or soar said creosote several tons of flagstone swooped past an inch from his head if it was going to answer to them it would have done wouldnt it said conina the air round her was thick with dust as the flying stones ground together she thumped the carpet take off you blasted mat arrgh a piece of cornice clipped her shoulder she rubbed the bruise irritably and turned to rincewind who was sitting with his knees under his chin and his hat pulled down over his head why doesnt it work she said youre not saying the right words he said it doesnt understand the language language hasnt got anything to do with it youve neglected something fundamental well well what sniffed rincewind look this isnt the time to stand on your dignity you keep on trying dont you mind me make it fly rincewind pulled his hat further over his ears please said conina the hat rose a bit wed all be terribly bucked said nijel hear hear said creosote the hat rose some more youre quite sure said rincewind yes rincewind cleared his throat down he commanded the carpet rose from the ground and hovered expectantly a few feet over the dust how did conina began but nijel interrupted her wizards are privy to arcane knowledge thats probably what it is he said probably the carpets got a geas on it to do the opposite of anything thats said can you make it go up further yes but im not going to said rincewind the carpet drifted slowly forward and as happens so often at times like this a rolling of masonry bounced right across the spot where it had lain a moment later they were out in the open air the storm of stone behind them the palace was pulling itself to pieces and the pieces were funnelling up into the air like a volcanic eruption in reverse the sourcerous tower had completely disappeared but the stones were dancing towards the spot where it had stood and theyre building another tower said nijel out of my palace too said creosote the hats won said rincewind thats why its building its own tower its a sort of reaction wizards always used to build a tower around themselves like those what do you call those things you find at the bottom of rivers frogs stones unsuccessful gangsters caddis flies is what i meant said rincewind when a wizard set out to fight the first thing he always did was build a tower its very big said nijel rincewind nodded glumly where are we going said conina rincewind shrugged away he said the outer palace wall drifted just below them as they passed over it began to shake and small bricks began to loop towards the storm of flying rock that buzzed around the new tower eventually conina said all right how did you get the carpet to fly does it really do the opposite of what you command no i just paid attention to certain fundamental details of laminar and spatial arrangements youve lost me there she admitted you want it in nonwizard talk yes you put it on the floor upside down said rincewind conina sat very still for a while then she said i must say this is very comfortable its the first time ive ever flown on a carpet its the first time ive ever flown one said rincewind vaguely you do it very well she said thank you you said you were frightened of heights terrified you dont show it im not thinking about it rincewind turned and looked at the tower behind them it had grown quite a lot in the last minute blossoming at the top into a complexity of turrets and battlements a swarm of tiles was hovering over it individual tiles swooping down and clinking into place like ceramic bees on a bombing run it was impossibly high the stones at the bottom would have been crushed if it wasnt for the magic that crackled through them well that was just about it as far as organised wizardry was concerned two thousand years of peaceful magic had gone down the drain the towers were going up again and with all this new raw magic floating around something was going to get very seriously hurt probably the universe too much magic could wrap time and space around itself and that wasnt good news for the kind of person who had grown used to things like effects following things like causes and of course it would be impossible to explain things to his companions they didnt seem to grasp ideas properly more particularly they didnt seem able to get the hang of doom they suffered from the terrible delusion that something could be done they seemed prepared to make the world the way they wanted it or die in the attempt and the trouble with dying in the attempt was that you died in the attempt the whole point about the old university organisation was that it kept a sort of peace between wizards who got along with one another about as easily as cats in a sack and now the gloves were off anyone who tried to interfere was going to end up severely scratched this wasnt the old gentle rather silly magic that the disc was used to this was magic war whitehot and searing rincewind wasnt very good at precognition in fact he could barely see into the present but he knew with weary certainty that at some point in the very near future like thirty seconds or so someone would say surely theres something we could do the desert passed below them lit by the low rays of the setting sun there dont seem to be many stars said nijel perhaps theyre scared to come out rincewind looked up there was a silver haze high in the air its raw magic settling out of the atmosphere he said its saturated twentyseven twentyeight twen surely theres conina began there isnt said rincewind flatly but with just the faintest twinge of satisfaction the wizards will fight each other until theres one victor there isnt anything anyone else can do i could do with a drink said creosote i suppose we couldnt stop somewhere where i could buy an inn what with said nijel youre poor remember poor i dont mind said the seriph its sobriety that is giving me difficulties conina prodded rincewind gently in the ribs are you steering this thing she said no then where is it going nijel peered downwards by the look of it he said its going hubwards towards the circle sea someone must be guiding it hallo said a friendly voice in rincewinds head youre not my conscience again are you thought rincewind im feeling really bad well im sorry rincewind thought but none of this is my fault im just a victim of circuses i dont see why i should take the blame yes but you could do something about it like what you could destroy the sourcerer all this would collapse then i wouldnt stand a chance then at least you could die in the attempt that might be preferable to letting magical war break out look just shut up will you said rincewind what said conina um said rincewind vaguely he looked down blankly at the blue and gold pattern underneath him and added youre flying this arent you through me thats sneaky what are you talking about oh sorry talking to myself i think said conina that wed better land they glided down towards a crescent of beach where the desert reached the sea in a normal light it would have been blinding white with a sand made up of billions of tiny shell fragments but at this time of day it was bloodred and primordial ranks of driftwood carved by the waves and bleached by the sun were piled up on the tideline like the bones of ancient fish or the biggest floral art accessory counter in the universe nothing stirred apart from the waves there were a few rocks around but they were firebrick hot and home to no mollusc or seaweed even the sea looked arid if any protoamphibian emerged on to a beach like this it would have given up there and then gone back into the water and told all its relatives to forget the legs it wasnt worth it the air felt as though it had been cooked in a sock even so nijel insisted that they light a fire its more friendly he said besides there could be monsters conina looked at the oily wavelets rolling up the beach in what appeared to be a halfhearted attempt to get out of the sea in that she said you never can tell rincewind mooched along the waterline distractedly picking up stones and throwing them in the sea one or two were thrown back after a while conina got a fire going and the bonedry saltsaturated wood sent blue and green flames roaring up under a fountain of sparks the wizard went and sat in the dancing shadows his back against a pile of whitened wood wrapped in a cloud of such impenetrable gloom that even creosote stopped complaining of thirst and shut up conina woke up after midnight there was a crescent moon on the horizon and a thin chilly mist covered the sand creosote was snoring on his back nijel who was theoretically on guard was sound asleep conina lay perfectly still every sense seeking out the thing that had awoken her finally she heard it again it was a tiny diffident clinking noise barely audible above the muted slurp of the sea she got up or rather she slid into the vertical as bonelessly as a jellyfish and flicked nijels sword out of his unresisting hand then she sidled through the mist without causing so much as an extra swirl the fire sank down further into its bed of ash after a while conina came back and shook the other two awake warrizit i think you ought to see this she hissed i think it could be important i just shut my eyes for a second nijel protested never mind about that come on creosote squinted around the impromptu campsite wheres the wizard fellow youll see and dont make a noisy it could be dangerous they stumbled after her kneedeep in vapour towards the sea eventually nijel said why dangerous shh did you hear it nijel listened like a sort of ringing noise watch rincewind walked jerkily up the beach carrying a large round rock in both hands he walked past them without a word his eyes staring straight ahead they followed him along the cold beach until he reached a bare area between the dunes where he stopped and still moving with all the grace of a clothes horse dropped the rock it made a clinking noise there was a wide circle of other stones very few of them had actually stayed on top of another one the three of them crouched down and watched him is he asleep said creosote conina nodded whats he trying to do i think hes trying to build a tower rincewind lurched back into the ring of stones and with great care placed another rock on empty air it fell down hes not very good at it is he said nijel it is very sad said creosote maybe we ought to wake him up said conina only i heard that if you wake up sleepwalkers their legs fall off or something what do you think could be risky with wizards said nijel they tried to make themselves comfortable on the chilly sand its rather pathetic isnt it said creosote its not as if hes really a proper wizard conina and nijel tried to avoid one anothers gaze finally the boy coughed and said im not exactly a barbarian hero you know you may have noticed they watched the toiling figure of rincewind for a while and then conina said if it comes to that i think i lack a certain something when it comes to hairdressing they both stared fixedly at the sleepwalker busy with their own thoughts and red with mutual embarrassment creosote cleared his throat if it makes anyone feel better he said i sometimes perceive that my poetry leaves a lot to be desired rincewind carefully tried to balance a large rock on a small pebble it fell off but he appeared to be happy with the result speaking as a poet said conina carefully what would you say about this situation creosote shifted uneasily funny old thing life he said pretty apt nijel lay back and looked up at the hazy stars then he sat bolt upright did you see that he demanded what it was a sort of flash a kind of the hubward horizon exploded into a silent flower of colour which expanded rapidly through all the hues of the conventional spectrum before flashing into brilliant octarine it etched itself on their eyeballs before fading away after a while there was a distant rumble some sort of magical weapon said conina blinking a gust of warm wind picked up the mist and streamed it past them blow this said nijel getting to his feet im going to wake him up even if it means we end up carrying him he reached out for rincewinds shoulder just as something went past very high overhead making a noise like a flock of geese on nitrous oxide it disappeared into the desert behind them then there was a sound that would have set false teeth on edge a flash of green light and a thump ill wake him up said conina you get the carpet she clambered over the ring of rocks and took the sleeping wizard gently by the arm and this would have been a textbook way of waking a somnambulist if rincewind hadnt dropped the rock he was carrying on his foot he opened his eyes where am i he said on the beach youve been er dreaming rincewind blinked at the mist the sky the circle of stones conina the circle of stones again and finally back at the sky whats been happening he said some sort of magical fireworks oh its started then he lurched unsteadily out of the circle in a way that suggested to conina that perhaps he wasnt quite awake yet and staggered back towards the remains of the fire he walked a few steps and then appeared to remember something he looked down at his foot and said ow hed almost reached the fire when the blast from the last spell reached them it had been aimed at the tower in al khali which was twenty miles away and by now the wavefront was extremely diffuse it was hardly affecting the nature of things as it surged over the dunes with a faint sucking noise the fire burned red and green for a second one of nijels sandals turned into a small and irritated badger and a pigeon flew out of the seriphs turban then it was past and boiling out over the sea what was that said nijel he kicked the badger who was sniffing at his foot hmm said rincewind that oh that said rincewind just the backwash of a spell they probably hit the tower in al khali it must have been pretty big to affect us here it probably was hey that was my palace said creosote weakly i mean i know it was a lot but it was all i had sorry but there were people in the city theyre probably all right said rincewind good whatever they are what conina grabbed his arm dont shout at him she said hes not himself ah said creosote dourly an improvement i say thats a bit unfair nijel protested i mean he got me out of the snake pit and well he knows a lot yes wizards are good at getting you out of the sort of trouble that only wizards can get you into said creosote then they expect you to thank them oh i think its got to be said said creosote waving his hands irritably he was briefly illuminated by the passage of another spell across the tormented sky look at that he snapped oh he means well they all mean well they probably all think the disc would be a better place if they were in charge take it from me theres nothing more terrible than someone out to do the world a favour wizards when alls said and done what good are they i mean can you name me something worthwhile any wizards done i think thats a bit cruel said conina but with an edge in her voice that suggested that she could be open to persuasion on the subject well they make me sick muttered creosote who was feeling acutely sober and didnt like it much i think well all feel better if we try to get a bit more sleep said nijel diplomatically things always look better by daylight nearly always anyway my mouth feels all horrible too muttered creosote determined to cling on to the remnant of his anger conina turned back to the fire and became aware of a gap in the scenery it was rincewindshaped hes gone in fact rincewind was already half a mile out over the dark sea squatting on the carpet like an angry buddha his mind a soup of rage humiliation and fury with a side order of outrage he hadnt wanted much ever hed stuck with wizardry even though he wasnt any good at it hed always done his best and now the whole world was conspiring against him well hed show them precisely who they were and what they were going to be shown was merely a matter of detail he reached up and touched his hat for reassurance even as it lost its last few sequins in the slipstream the luggage was having problems of its own the area around the tower of al khali under the relentless magical bombardment was already drifting beyond that reality horizon where time space and matter lose their separate identities and start wearing one anothers clothes it was quite impossible to describe here is what it looked like it looked like a piano sounds shortly after being dropped down a well it tasted yellow and felt paisley it smelled like a total eclipse of the moon of course nearer to the tower it got really weird expecting anything unprotected to survive in that would be like expecting snow on a supernova fortunately the luggage didnt know this and slid through the maelstrom with raw magic crystallising on its lid and hinges it was in a foul mood but again there was nothing very unusual about this except that the crackling fury earthing itself spectacularly all over the luggage in a multicoloured corona gave it the appearance of an early and very angry amphibian crawling out of a burning swamp it was hot and stuffy inside the tower there were no internal floors just a series of walkways around the walls they were lined with wizards and the central space was a column of octarine light that creaked loudly as they poured their power into it at its base stood abrim the octarine gems on the hat blazing so brightly that they looked more like holes cut through into a different universe where in defiance of probability they had come out inside a sun the vizier stood with his hands out fingers splayed eyes shut mouth a thin line of concentration balancing the forces usually a wizard could control power only to the extent of his own physical capability but abrim was learning fast you made yourself the pinch in the hourglass the fulcrum on the balance the roll around the sausage do it right and you were the power it was part of you and you were capable of has it been pointed out that his feet were several inches off the ground his feet were several inches off the ground abrim was pulling together the potency for a spell that would soar away into the sky and beset the ankh tower with a thousand screaming demons when there came a thunderous knock at the door there is a mantra to be said on these occasions it doesnt matter if the door is a tent flap a scrap of hide on a windblown yurt three inches of solid oak with great iron nails in or a rectangle of chipboard with mahogany veneer a small light over it made of horrible bits of coloured glass and a bellpush that plays a choice of twenty popular melodies that no music lover would want to listen to even after five years sensory deprivation one wizard turned to another and duly said i wonder who that can be at this time of night there was another series of thumps on the woodwork there cant be anyone alive out there said the other wizard and he said it nervously because if you ruled out the possibility of it being anyone alive that always left the suspicion that perhaps it was someone dead this time the banging rattled the hinges one of us had better go out said the first wizard good man ah oh right he set off slowly down the short arched passage ill just go and see who it is then he said first class it was a strange figure that made its hesitant way to the door ordinary robes werent sufficient protection in the highenergy field inside tower and over his brocade and velvet the wizard wore a thick padded overall stuffed with rowan shavings and embroidered with industrialgrade sigils hed affixed a smoked glass visor to his pointy hat and his gauntlets which were extremely big suggested that he was a wicket keeper in a game of cricket played at supersonic speeds the actinic flashes and pulsations from the great work in the main hall cast harsh shadows around him as he fumbled for the bolts he pulled down the visor and opened the door a fraction we dont want any he began and ought to have chosen his words better because they were his epitaph it was sometime before his colleague noticed his continued absence and wandered down the passage to find him the door had been thrown wide open the thaumatic inferno outside roaring against the web of spells that held it in check in fact the door hadnt been pushed completely back he pulled it aside to see why and gave a little whimper there was a noise behind him he turned around wha he began which is a pretty poor syllable on which to end a life high over the circle sea rincewind was feeling a bit of an idiot this happens to everyone sooner or later for example in a tavern someone jogs your elbow and you turn around quickly and give a mouthful of abuse to you become slowly aware the belt buckle of a man who it turns out was probably hewn rather than born or a little car runs into the back of yours and you rush out to show a bunch of fives to the driver who it becomes apparent as he goes on unfolding more body like some horrible conjuring trick must have been sitting on the back seat or you might be leading your mutinous colleagues to the captains cabin and you hammer on the door and he sticks his great head out with a cutlass in either hand and you say were taking over the ship you scum and the lads are right with me and he says what lads and you suddenly feel a great emptiness behind you and you say um in other words its the familiar hot sinking feeling experienced by everyone who has let the waves of their own anger throw them far up on the beach of retribution leaving them in the poetic language of the everyday up shit creek rincewind was still angry and humiliated and so forth but these emotions had died down a bit and something of his normal character had reasserted itself it was not very pleased to find itself on a few threads of blue and gold wool high above the phosphorescent waves hed been heading for ankhmorpork he tried to remember why of course it was where it had all started perhaps it was the presence of the university which was so heavy with magic it lay like a cannonball on the incontinence blanket of the universe stretching reality very thin ankh was where things started and finished it was also his home such as it was and it called to him it has already been indicated that rincewind appeared to have a certain amount of rodent in his ancestry and in times of stress he felt an overpowering urge to make a run for his burrow he let the carpet drift for a while on the air currents while dawn which creosote would probably have referred to as pinkfingered made a ring of fire around the edge of the disc it spread its lazy light over a world that was subtly different rincewind blinked there was a weird light no now he came to think about it not weird but wyrd which was much weirder it was like looking at the world through a heat haze but a haze that had a sort of life of its own it danced and stretched and gave more than a hint that it wasnt just an optical illusion but that it was reality itself that was being tensed and distended like a rubber balloon trying to contain too much gas the wavering was greatest in the direction of ankhmorpork where flashes and fountains of tortured air indicated that the struggle hadnt abated a similar column hung over al khali and then rincewind realised that it wasnt the only one wasnt that a tower over in quirm where the circle sea opened on to the great rim ocean and there were others it had all gone critical wizardry was breaking up goodbye to the university the levels the orders deep in his heart every wizard knew that the natural unit of wizardry was one wizard the towers would multiply and fight until there was one tower left and then the wizards would fight until there was one wizard by then hed probably fight himself the whole edifice that operated as the balance wheel of magic was falling to bits rincewind resented that deeply hed never been any good at magic but that wasnt the point he knew where he fitted it was right at the bottom but at least he fitted he could look up and see the whole delicate machine ticking away gently browsing off the natural magic generated by the turning of the disc all he had was nothing but that was something and now it had been taken away rincewind turned the carpet until it was facing the distant gleam that was ankhmorpork which was a brilliant speck in the early morning light and a part of his mind that wasnt doing anything else wondered why it was so bright there also seemed to be a full moon and even rincewind whose grasp of natural philosophy was pretty vague was sure there had been one of those only the other day well it didnt matter hed had enough he wasnt going to try to understand anything any more he was going home except that wizards can never go home this is one of the ancient and deeply meaningful sayings about wizards and it says something about most of them that they have never been able to work out what it means wizards arent allowed to have wives but they are allowed to have parents and many of them go back to the old home town for hogswatch night or soul cake thursday for a bit of a singsong and the heartwarming sight of all their boyhood bullies hurriedly avoiding them in the street its rather like the other saying theyve never been able to understand which is that you cant cross the same river twice experiments with a longlegged wizard and a small river say you can cross the same river thirty thirtyfive times a minute wizards dont like philosophy very much as far as they are concerned one hand clapping makes a noise like cl in this particular case though rincewind couldnt go home because it actually wasnt there any more there was a city straddling the river ankh but it wasnt one hed ever seen before it was white and clean and didnt smell like a privy full of dead herrings he landed in what had once been the plaza of broken moons and also in a state of some shock there were fountains there had been fountains before of course but they had oozed rather than played and they had looked like thin soup there were milky flagstones underfoot with little glittery bits in and although the sun was sitting on the horizon like half a breakfast grapefruit there was hardly anyone around normally ankh was permanently crowded the actual shade of the sky being a mere background detail smoke drifted over the city in long greasy coils from the crown of boiling air above the university it was the only movement apart from the fountains rincewind had always been rather proud of the fact that he always felt alone even in the teeming city but it was even worse being alone when he was by himself he rolled up the carpet and slung it over one shoulder and padded through the haunted streets towards the university the gates hung open to the wind most of the building looked half ruined by misses and ricochets the tower of sourcery far too high to be real seemed to be unscathed not so the old tower of art half the magic aimed at the tower next door seemed to have rebounded on it parts of it had melted and started to run some parts glowed some parts had crystallised a few parts seemed to have twisted partly out of the normal three dimensions it made you feel sorry even for stone that it should have to undergo such treatment in fact nearly everything had happened to the tower except actual collapse it looked so beaten that possibly even gravity had given up on it rincewind sighed and padded around the base of the tower towards the library towards where the library had been there was the arch of the doorway and most of the walls were still standing but a lot of the roof had fallen in and everything was blackened by soot rincewind stood and stared for a long time then he dropped the carpet and ran stumbling and sliding through the rubble that halfblocked the doorway the stones were still warm underfoot here and there the wreckage of a bookcase still smouldered anyone watching would have seen rincewind dart backwards and forwards across the shimmering heaps scrabbling desperately among them throwing aside charred furniture pulling aside lumps of fallen roof with less than superhuman strength they would have seen him pause once or twice to get his breath back then dive in again cutting his hands on shards of halfmolten glass from the dome of the roof they would have noticed that he seemed to be sobbing eventually his questing fingers touched something warm and soft the frantic wizard heaved a charred roof beam aside scrabbled through a drift of fallen tiles and peered down there half squashed by the beam and baked brown by the fire was a large bunch of overripe squashy bananas he picked one up very carefully and sat and watched it for sometime until the end fell off then he ate it we shouldnt have let him go like that said conina how could we have stopped him oh beauteous doeeyed eaglet but he may do something stupid i should think that is very likely said creosote primly while we do something clever and sit on a baking beach with nothing to eat or drink is that it you could tell me a story said creosote trembling slightly shut up the seriph ran his tongue over his lips i suppose a quick anecdote is out of the question he croaked conina sighed theres more to life than narrative you know sorry i lost control a little there now that the sun was well up the crushedshell beach glowed like a salt flat the sea didnt look any better by daylight it moved like thin oil away on either side the beach stretched in long excruciatingly flat curves supporting nothing but a few clumps of withered dune grass which lived off the moisture in the spray there was no sign of any shade the way i see it said conina this is a beach and that means sooner or later well come to a river so all we have to do is keep walking in one direction and yet delightful snow on the slopes of mount eritor we do not know which one nijel sighed and reached into his bag erm he said excuse me would this be any good i stole it sorry he held out the lamp that had been in the treasury its magic isnt it he said hopefully ive heard about them isnt it worth a try creosote shook his head but you said your grandfather used it to make his fortune said conina a lamp said the seriph he used a lamp not this lamp no the real lamp was a battered old thing and one day this wicked pedlar came round offering new lamps for old and my greatgrandmother gave it to him for this one the family kept it in the vault as a sort of memorial to her a truly stupid woman it doesnt work of course you tried it no but he wouldnt have given it away if it was any good would he give it a rub said conina it cant do any harm i wouldnt warned creosote nijel held the lamp gingerly it had a strangely sleek look as if someone had set out to make a lamp that could go fast he rubbed it the effects were curiously unimpressive there was a halfhearted pop and a puff of wispy smoke near nijels feet a line appeared in the beach several feet away from the smoke it spread quickly to outline a square of sand which vanished a figure barrelled out of the beach jerked to a stop and groaned it was wearing a turban an expensive tan a small gold medallion shiny shorts and advanced running shoes with curly toes it said i want to get this absolutely straight where am i conina recovered first its a beach she said yah said the genie what i mean was which lamp what world dont you know the creature took the lamp out of nijels unresisting grasp oh this old thing he said im on time share two weeks every august but of course usually one can never get away got a lot of lamps have you said nijel i am somewhat overcommitted on lamps the genie agreed in fact i am thinking of diversifying into rings rings are looking big at the moment theres a lot of movement in rings sorry people what can i do you for the last phrase was turned in that special voice which people use for humorous selfparody in the mistaken hope that it will make them sound less like a prat we conina began i want a drink snapped creosote and you are supposed to say that my wish is your command oh absolutely noone says that sort of thing any more said the genie and produced a glass out of nowhere he treated creosote to a brilliant smile lasting a small percentage of one second we want you to take us across the sea to ankhmorpork said conina firmly the genie looked blank then he pulled a very thick book from the empty air and consulted it it sounds a really neat concept he said eventually lets do lunch next tuesday okay do what im a little energetic right now youre a little conina began great said the genie sincerely and glanced at his wrist hey is that the time he vanished the three of them looked at the lamp in thoughtful silence and then nijel said whatever happened to you know the fat guys with the baggy trousers and i hear and obey o master creosote snarled hed just drunk his drink it had turned out to be water with bubbles in it and a taste like warm flatirons im bloody well not standing for it snarled conina she snatched the lamp from his hand and rubbed it as if she was sorry she wasnt holding a handful of emery cloth the genie reappeared at a different spot which still managed to be several feet away from the weak explosion and obligatory cloud of smoke he was now holding something curved and shiny to his ear and listening intently he looked hurriedly at coninas angry face and contrived to suggest by waggling his eyebrows and waving his free hand urgently that he was currently and inconveniently tied up by irksome matters which regretfully prevented him giving her his full attention as of now but as soon as he had disentangled himself from this importunate person she could rest assured that her wish which was certainly a wish of tone and brilliance would be his command i shall smash the lamp she said quietly the genie flashed her a smile and spoke hastily into the thing he was cradling between his chin and his shoulder fine he said great its a slice believe me have your people call my people stay beyond okay bye he lowered the instrument bastard he said vaguely i really shall smash the lamp said conina which lamp is this said the genie hurriedly how many have you got said nijel i always thought genies had just the one the genie explained wearily that in fact he had several lamps there was a small but wellappointed lamp where he lived during the week another rather unique lamp in the country a carefully restored peasant rushlight in an unspoilt winegrowing district near quirm and just recently a set of derelict lamps in the docks area of ankhmorpork that had great potential once the smart crowd got there to become the occult equivalent of a suite of offices and a wine bar they listened in awe like fish who had inadvertently swum into a lecture on how to fly who are your people the other people have got to call said nijel who was impressed although he didnt know why or by what actually i dont have any people yet said the genie and gave a grimace that was definitely upwardlymobile at the corners but i will everyone shut up said conina firmly and you take us to ankhmorpork i should if i were you said creosote when the young ladys mouth looks like a letter box its best to do what she says the genie hesitated im not very deep on transport he said learn said conina she was tossing the lamp from hand to hand teleportation is a major headache said the genie looking desperate why dont we do lun right thats it said conina now i just need a couple of big flat rocks okay okay just hold hands will you ill give it my best shot but this could be one big mistake the astrophilosophers of krull once succeeded in proving conclusively that all places are one place and that the distance between them is an illusion and this news was an embarrassment to all thinking philosophers because it did not explain among other things signposts after years of wrangling the whole thing was then turned over to ly tin wheedle arguably the discs greatest philosopher who after some thought proclaimed that although it was indeed true that all places were one place that place was very large and so psychic order was restored distance is however an entirely subjective phenomenon and creatures of magic can adjust it to suit themselves they are not necessarily very good at it rincewind sat dejectedly in the blackened ruins of the library trying to put his finger on what was wrong with them well everything for a start it was unthinkable that the library should be burned it was the largest accumulation of magic on the disc it underpinned wizardry every spell ever used was written down in it somewhere burning them was was was there werent any ashes plenty of wood ashes lots of chains lots of blackened stone lots of mess but thousands of books dont burn easily they would leave bits of cover and piles of feathery ash and there wasnt any rincewind stirred the rubble with his toe there was only the one door into the library then there were the cellars he could see the stairs down to them choked with garbage but you couldnt hide all the books down there you couldnt teleport them out either they would be resistant to such magic anyone who tried something like that would end up wearing his brains outside his hat there was an explosion overhead a ring of orange fire formed about halfway up the tower of sourcery ascended quickly and soared off towards quirm rincewind slid around on his makeshift seat and stared up at the tower of art he got the distinct impression that it was looking back at him it was totally without windows but for a moment he thought he saw a movement up among the crumbling turrets he wondered how old the tower really was older than the university certainly older than the city which had formed about it like scree around a mountain maybe older than geography there had been a time when the continents were different rincewind understood and then theyd sort of shuffled more comfortably together like puppies in a basket perhaps the tower had been washed up on the waves of rock from somewhere else maybe it had been there before the disc itself but rincewind didnt like to consider that because it raised uncomfortable questions about who built it and what for he examined his conscience it said im out of options please yourself rincewind stood up and brushed the dust and ash off his robe removing quite a lot of the moulting red plush as well he removed his hat made a preoccupied attempt at straightening the point and replaced it on his head then he walked unsteadily towards the tower of art there was a very old and quite small door at the base he wasnt at all surprised when it opened as he approached strange place said nijel funny curve to the walls where are we said conina and is there any alcohol said creosote probably not he added and why is it rocking said conina ive never been anywhere with metal walls before she sniffed can you smell oil she added suspiciously the genie reappeared although this time without the smoke and erratic trapdoor effects it was noticeable that he tried to keep as far away from conina as politely possible everyone okay he said is this ankh she said only when we wanted to go there we rather hoped youd put us somewhere with a door youre on your way said the genie in what something about the way in which the spirit hesitated caused nijels mind to leap a tall conclusion from a standing start he looked down at the lamp in his hands he gave it an experimental jerk the floor shook oh no he said its physically impossible were in the lamp said conina the room trembled again as nijel tried to look down the spout dont worry about it said the genie in fact dont think about it if possible he explained although explained is probably too positive a word and in this case really means failed to explain but at some length that it was perfectly possible to travel across the world in a small lamp being carried by one of the party the lamp itself moving because it was being carried by one of the people inside it because of a the fractal nature of reality which meant that everything could be thought of as being inside everything else and b creative public relations the trick relied on the laws of physics failing to spot the flaw until the journey was complete in the circumstances it is best not to think about it yuh said the genie like not thinking about pink rhinoceroses said nijel and gave an embarrassed laugh as they stared at him it was a sort of game we had he said you had to avoid thinking of pink rhinoceroses he coughed i didnt say it was a particularly good game he squinted down the spout again no said conina not very uh said the genie would anyone like coffee some sounds a quick game of significant quest drink said creosote white wine foul muck the genie looked shocked red is bad for it began but any port in a storm said creosote hurriedly or sauterne even but no umbrella in it it dawned on the seriph that this wasnt the way to talk to the genie he pulled himself together a bit no umbrella by the five moons of nasreem or bits of fruit salad or olives or curly straws or ornamental monkeys i command thee by the seventeen siderites of sarudin im not an umbrella person said the genie sulkily its pretty sparse in here said conina why dont you furnish it what i dont understand said nijel is if were all in the lamp im holding then the me in the lamp is holding a smaller lamp and in that lamp the genie waved his hands urgently dont talk about it he commanded please nijels honest brow wrinkled yes but he said is there a lot of me or what its all cyclic but stop drawing attention to it yuh oh shit there was the subtle unpleasant sound of the universe suddenly catching on it was dark in the tower a solid core of antique darkness that had been there since the dawn of time and resented the intrusion of the upstart daylight that nipped in around rincewind he felt the air move as the door shut behind him and the dark poured back filling up the space where the light had been so neatly that you couldnt have seen the join even if the light had still been there the interior of the tower smelled of antiquity with a slight suspicion of raven droppings it took a great deal of courage to stand there in that dark rincewind didnt have that much but stood there anyway something started to snuffle around his feet and rincewind stood very still the only reason he didnt move was for fear of treading on something worse then a hand like an old leather glove touched his very gently and a voice said oook rincewind looked up the dark yielded just once to a vivid flash of light and rincewind saw the whole tower was lined with books they were squeezed on every step of the rotting spiral staircase that wound up inside they were piled up on the floor although something about the way in which they were piled suggested that the word huddled would be more appropriate they had lodged all right they had perched on every crumbling ledge they were observing him in some covert way that had nothing to do with the normal six senses books are pretty good at conveying meaning not necessarily their own personal meanings of course and rincewind grasped the fact that they were trying to tell him something there was another flash he realised that it was magic from the sourcerers tower reflected down from the distant hole that led on to the roof at least it enabled him to identify wuffles who was wheezing at his right foot that was a bit of a relief now if he could just put a name to the soft repetitive slithering noise near his left ear there was a further obliging flash which found him looking directly into the little yellow eyes of the patrician who was clawing patiently at the side of his glass jar it was a gentle mindless scrabbling as if the little lizard wasnt particularly trying to get out but was just vaguely interested in seeing how long it would take to wear the glass away rincewind looked down at the pearshaped bulk of the librarian theres thousands of them he whispered his voice being sucked away and silenced by the massed ranks of books how did you get them all in here oook oook they what oook repeated the librarian making vigorous flapping motions with his bald elbows fly oook can they do that oook nodded the librarian that must have been pretty impressive id like to see that one day oook not every book had made it most of the important grimoires had got out but a sevenvolume herbal had lost its index to the flames and many a trilogy was mourning for its lost volume quite a few books had scorch marks on their bindings some had lost their covers and trailed their stitching unpleasantly on the floor a match flared and pages rippled uneasily around the walls but it was only the librarian who lit a candle and shambled across the floor at the base of a menacing shadow big enough to climb skyscrapers he had set up a rough table against one wall and it was covered with arcane tools pots of rare adhesives and a bookbinders vice which was already holding a stricken folio a few weak lines of magic fire crawled across it the ape pushed the candlestick into rincewinds hand picked up a scalpel and a pair of tweezers and bent low over the trembling book rincewind went pale um he said er do you mind if i go away i faint at the sight of glue the librarian shook his head and jerked a preoccupied thumb towards a tray of tools oook he commanded rincewind nodded miserably and obediently handed him a pair of longnosed scissors the wizard winced as a couple of damaged pages were snipped free and dropped to the floor what are you doing to it he managed oook an appendectomy oh the ape jerked his thumb again without looking up rincewind fished a needle and thread out of the ranks on the tray and handed them over there was silence broken only by the scritching sound of thread being pulled through paper until the librarian straightened up and said oook rincewind pulled out his handkerchief and mopped the apes brow oook dont mention it is it going to be all right the librarian nodded there was also a general almost inaudible sigh of relief from the tier of books above them rincewind sat down the books were frightened in fact they were terrified the presence of the sourcerer made their spines creep and the pressure of their attention closed in around him like a vice all right he mumbled but what can i do about it oook the librarian gave rincewind a look that would have been exactly like a quizzical look over the top of a pair of halfmoon spectacles if he had been wearing any and reached for another broken book i mean you know im no good at magic oook the sourcery thats about now its terrible stuff i mean its the original stuff from right back in the dawn of time or around breakfast at any rate oook itll destroy everything eventually wont it oook its about time someone put a stop to this sourcery right oook only it cant be me you see when i came here i thought i could do something but that tower its so big it must be proof against all magic if really powerful wizards wont do anything about it how can i oook agreed the librarian sewing a ruptured spine so you see i think someone else can save the world this time im no good at it the ape nodded reached across and lifted rincewinds hat from his head hey the librarian ignored him picked up a pair of shears look thats my hat if you dont mind dont you dare do that to my he leapt across the floor and was rewarded with a thump across the side of the head which would have astonished him if hed had time to think about it the librarian might shuffle around the place like a goodnatured wobbly balloon but underneath that oversized skin was a framework of superblycantilevered bone and muscle that could drive a fistful of calloused knuckles through a thick oak plank running into the librarians arm was like hitting a hairy iron bar wuffles started to bounce up and down yelping with excitement rincewind screamed a hoarse untranslatable yell of fury bounced off the wall snatched up a fallen rock as a crude club kicked forward and stopped dead the librarian was crouched in the centre of the floor with the shears touchingbut not yet cuttingthe hat and he was grinning at rincewind they stood like a frozen tableau for some seconds then the ape dropped the shears flicked several imaginary flecks of dust off the hat straightened the point and placed it on rincewinds head a few shocked moments after this rincewind realised that he was holding up at arms length a very large and extremely heavy rock he managed to force it away on one side before it recovered from the shock and remembered to fall on him i see he said sinking back against the wall and rubbing his elbows and all thats supposed to tell me something is it a moral lesson let rincewind confront his true self let him work out what hes really prepared to fight for eh well it was a very cheap trick and ive news for you if you think it worked he snatched the hat brim if you think it worked if you think ive youve got another thought listen its if you think his voice stuttered into silence then he shrugged all right but when you get down to it what can i actually do the librarian replied with an expansive gesture that indicated as clearly as if he had said oook that rincewind was a wizard with a hat a library of magical books and a tower this could be regarded as everything a magical practitioner could need an ape a small terrier with halitosis and a lizard in a jar were optional extras rincewind felt a slight pressure on his foot wuffles who was extremely slow on the uptake had fastened his toothless gums on the toe of rincewinds boot and was giving it a vicious suck he picked the little dog up by the scruff of its neck and the bristly stub that for the want of a better word it called its tail and gently lifted it sideways okay he said youd better tell me whats been happening here from the carrack mountains overlooking the vast cold sto plain in the middle of which ankhmorpork sprawled like a bag of dropped groceries the view was particularly impressive mishits and ricochets from the magical battle were expanding outwards and upwards in a bowlshaped cloud of curdled air at the heart of which strange lights flashed and sparkled the roads leading away from it were packed with refugees and every inn and wayside tavern was crowded out or nearly every one noone seemed to want to stop at the rather pleasant little pub nestling among trees just off the road to quirm it wasnt that they were frightened to go inside it was just that for the moment they werent being allowed to notice it there was a disturbance in the air about half a mile away and three figures dropped out of nowhere into a thicket of lavender they lay supine in the sunshine among the broken fragrant branches until their sanity came back then creosote said where are we do you suppose it smells like someones underwear drawer said conina not mine said nijel firmly he eased himself up gently and added has anyone seen the lamp forget it its probably been sold to build a winebar said conina nijel scrabbled around among the lavender stems until his hands found something small and metallic got it he declared dont rub it said the other two in harmony they were too late anyway but that didnt much matter because all that happened when nijel gave it a cautious buff was the appearance of some small smoking red letters in midair hi nijel read aloud do not put down the lamp because your custom is important to us please leave a wish after the tone and very shortly it will be our command in the meantime have a nice eternity he added you know i think hes a bit overcommitted conina said nothing she was staring out across the plains to the broiling storm of magic occasionally some of it would detach and soar away to some distant tower she shivered despite the growing heat of the day we ought to get down there as soon as possible she said its very important why said creosote one glass of wine hadnt really restored him to his former easygoing nature conina opened her mouth and quite unusually for her shut it again there was no way to explain that every gene in her body was dragging her onwards telling her that she should get involved visions of swords and spiky balls on chains kept invading the hairdressing salons of her consciousness nijel on the other hand felt no such pounding all he had to drive him onwards was imagination but he did have enough of that to float a mediumsized war galley he looked towards the city with what would have been but for his lack of chin an expression of setjawed determination creosote realised that he was outnumbered do they have any drink down there he said lots said nijel that might do for a start the seriph conceded all right lead on o peachbreasted daughter of and no poetry they untangled themselves from the thicket and walked down the hillside until they reached the road which before very long went past the aforementioned tavern or as creosote persisted in calling it caravanserai they hesitated about going in it didnt seem to welcome visitors but conina who by breeding and upbringing tended to skulk around the back of buildings found four horses tethered in the yard they considered them carefully it would be stealing said nijel slowly conina opened her mouth to agree and the words why not slid past her lips she shrugged perhaps we should leave some money nijel suggested dont look at me said creosote or maybe write a note and leave it under the bridle or something dont you think by way of an answer conina vaulted up on to the largest horse which by the look of it belonged to a soldier weaponry was slung all over it creosote hoisted himself uneasily on to the second horse a rather skittish bay and sighed shes got that letterbox look he said i should do what she says nijel regarded the other two horses suspiciously one of them was very large and extremely white not the offwhite which was all that most horses could manage but a translucent ivory white tone which nijel felt an unconscious urge to describe as shroud it also gave him a distinct impression that it was more intelligent than he was he selected the other one it was a bit thin but docile and he managed to get on after only two tries they set off the sound of their hoofbeats barely penetrated the gloom inside the tavern the innkeeper moved like someone in a dream he knew he had customers hed even spoken to them he could even see them sitting round a table by the fire but if asked to describe who hed talked to and what he had seen hed have been at a loss this is because the human brain is remarkably good at shutting out things it doesnt want to know his could currently have shielded a bank vault and the drinks most of them hed never heard of but strange bottles kept appearing on the shelves above the beer barrels the trouble was that whenever he tried to think about it his thoughts just slid away the figures around the table looked up from their cards one of them raised a hand its stuck on the end of his arm and its got five fingers the innkeepers mind said it must be a hand one thing the innkeepers brain couldnt shut out was the sound of the voices this one sounded as though someone was hitting a rock with a roll of sheet lead bar person the innkeeper groaned faintly the thermic lances of horror were melting their way steadily through the steel door of his mind let me see now thats a what was it again a bloody mary this voice made a simple drinks order sound like the opening of hostilities oh yes and mine was a small egg none said pestilence an egg now with a cherry in it good lied the heavy voice and thatll be a small port wine for me and the speaker glanced across the table at the fourth member of the quartet and sighed youd better bring another bowl of peanuts about three hundred yards down the road the horse thieves were trying to come to terms with a new experience certainly a smooth ride nijel managed eventually and a lovely a lovely view said creosote his voice lost in the slipstream but i wonder said nijel if we have done exactly the right thing were moving arent we demanded conina dont be petty its just that well looking at cumulus clouds from above is shut up sorry anyway theyre stratus cumulus at most right said nijel miserably does it make any difference said creosote who was lying flat on his horses neck with his eyes shut about a thousand feet oh could be seven hundred and fifty conceded conina ah the tower of sourcery trembled coloured smoke rolled through its vaulted rooms and shining corridors in the big room at the very tip where the air was thick and greasy and tasted of burning tin many wizards had passed out with the sheer mental effort of the battle but enough remained they sat in a wide circle locked in concentration it was just possible to see the shimmering in the air as the raw sourcery swirled out of the staff in coins hand and into the centre of the octogram outlandish shapes appeared for a brief instant and vanished the very fabric of reality was being put through the wringer in there carding shuddered and turned away in case he saw anything he really couldnt ignore the surviving senior wizards had a simulacrum of the disc hovering in front of them as carding looked at it again the little red glow over the city of quirm flared and went out the air creaked there goes quirm murmured carding that just leaves al khali said one of the others theres some clever power there carding nodded glumly hed quite liked quirm which was a had been a pleasant little city overlooking the rim ocean he dimly recalled being taken there once when he was small for a moment he gazed sadly into the past it had wild geraniums he recalled filling the sloping cobbled streets with their musky fragrance growing out of the walls he said out loud pink they were pink the other wizards looked at him oddly one or two of a particularly paranoid frame of mind even for wizards glanced suspiciously at the walls are you all right said one of them um said carding oh yes sorry miles away he turned back to look at coin who was sitting off to one side of the circle with the staff across his knees the boy appeared to be asleep perhaps he was but carding knew in the tormented pit of his soul that the staff didnt sleep it was watching him testing his mind it knew it even knew about the pink geraniums i never wanted it to be like this he said softly all we really wanted was a bit of respect are you sure youre all right carding nodded vaguely as his colleagues resumed their concentration he glanced sideways at them somehow all his old friends had gone well not friends a wizard never had friends at least not friends who were wizards it needed a different word ah yes that was it enemies but a very decent class of enemies gentlemen the cream of their profession not like these people for all that they seemed to have risen in the craft since the sourcerer had arrived other things besides the cream floated to the top he reflected sourly he turned his attention to al khali probing with his mind knowing that the wizards there were almost certainly doing the same seeking constantly for a point of weakness he thought am i a point of weakness spelter tried to tell me something it was about the staff a man should lean on his staff not the other way around its steering him leading him i wish id listened to spelter this is wrong im a point of weakness he tried again riding the surges of power letting them carry his mind into the enemy tower even abrim was making use of sourcery and carding let himself modulate the wave insinuating himself past the defences erected against him the image of the interior of the al khali tower appeared focused the luggage trundled along the glowing corridors it was exceedingly angry now it had been awoken from hibernation it had been scorned it had been briefly attacked by a variety of mythological and now extinct lifeforms it had a headache and now as it entered the great hall it detected the hat the horrible hat the cause of everything it was currently suffering it advanced purposefully carding testing the resistance of abrims mind felt the mans attention waver for a moment he saw through the enemys eyes saw the squat oblong cantering across the stone for a moment abrim attempted to shift his concentration and then no more able to help himself than is a cat when it sees something small and squeaky run across the floor carding struck not much it didnt need much abrims mind was attempting to balance and channel huge forces and it needed hardly any pressure to topple it from its position abrim extended his hands to blast the luggage gave the merest beginnings of a scream and imploded the wizards around him thought they saw him grow impossibly small in a fraction of a second and vanish leaving a black afterimage the more intelligent of them started to run and the magic he had been controlling surged back out and flooded free in one great randomised burst that blew the hat to bits took out the entire lower levels of the tower and quite a large part of what remained of the city so many wizards in ankh had been concentrating on the hall that the sympathetic resonance blew them across the room carding ended up on his back his hat over his eyes they hauled him out and dusted him off and carried him to coin and the staff amid cheers although some of the older wizards forbore to cheer but he didnt seem to pay any attention he stared sightlessly down at the boy and then slowly raised his hands to his ears cant you hear them he said the wizards fell silent carding still had power and the tone of his voice would have quelled a thunderstorm coins eyes glowed i hear nothing he said carding turned to the rest of the wizards cant you hear them they shook their heads one of them said hear what brother carding smiled and it was a wide mad smile even coin took a step backwards youll hear them soon enough he said youve made a beacon youll all hear them but you wont hear them for long he pushed aside the younger wizards who were holding his arms and advanced on coin youre pouring sourcery into the world and other things are coming with it he said others have given them a pathway but youve given them an avenue he sprang forward and snatched the black staff out of coins hands and swung it up in the air to smash it against the wall carding went rigid as the staff struck back then his skin began to blister most of the wizards managed to turn their heads away a few and there are always a few like that watched in obscene fascination coin watched too his eyes widened in wonder one hand went to his mouth he tried to back away he couldnt theyre cumulus marvellous said nijel weakly weight doesnt come into it my steed has carried armies my steed has carried cities yea he hath carried all things in their due time said death but hes not going to carry you three why not its a matter of the look of the thing its going to look pretty good then isnt it said war testily the one horseman and three pedestrians of the apocralypse perhaps you could ask them to wait for us said pestilence his voice sounding like something dripping out of the bottom of a coffin i have things to attend to said death he made a little clicking noise with his teeth im sure youll manage you normally do war watched the retreating horse sometimes he really gets on my nerves why is he always so keen to have the last word he said force of habit l suppose they turned back to the tavern neither spoke for some time and then war said wheres famine went to find the kitchen oh war scuffed one armoured foot in the dust and thought about the distance to ankh it was a very hot afternoon the apocralypse could jolly well wait one for the road he suggested should we said pestilence doubtfully i thought we were expected l mean l wouldnt like to disappoint people weve got time for a quick one im sure war insisted pub clocks are never right weve got bags of time all the time in the world carding slumped forward and thudded on the shining white floor the staff rolled out of his hands and upended itself coin prodded the limp body with his foot i did warn him he said i told him what would happen if he touched it again what did he mean them there was an outbreak of coughing and a considerable inspection of fingernails what did he mean coin demanded ovin hakardly lecturer in lore once again found that the wizards around him were parting like morning mist without moving he appeared to have stepped forward his eyes swivelled backwards and forwards like trapped animals er he said he waved his thin hands vaguely the world you see that is the reality in which we live in fact it can be thought of as in a manner of speaking a rubber sheet he hesitated aware that the sentence was not going to appear in anyones book of quotable quotes in that he added hurriedly it is distorted uh distended by the presence of magic in any degree and if i may make a point here too much magical potentiality if foregathered in one spot forces our reality um downwards although of course one should not take the term literally and it has been postulated that a sufficient exercise of magic can shall we say um break through the actuality at its lowest point and offer perhaps a pathway to the inhabitants or if i may use a more correct term denizens of the lower plane who because perhaps of the difference in energy levels are naturally attracted to the brightness of this world our world there was the typical long pause which usually followed hakardlys speeches while everybody mentally inserted commas and stitched the fractured clauses together coins lips moved silently for a while do you mean magic attracts these creatures he said eventually his voice was quite different now it lacked its former edge the staff hung in the air above the prone body of carding rotating slowly the eyes of every wizard in the place were on it so it appears said hakardly students of such things say their presence is heralded by a coarse susurration coin looked uncertain they buzz said one of the other wizards helpfully the boy knelt down and peered closely at carding hes very still he said cautiously is anything bad happening to him it may be said hakardly guardedly hes dead i wish he wasnt it is a view i suspect which he shares but i can help him said coin he held out his hands and the staff glided into them if it had a face it would have smirked when he spoke next his voice once again had the cold distant tones of someone speaking in a steel room if failure had no penalty success would not be a prize he said sorry said hakardly youve lost me there coin turned on his heel and strode back to his chair we can fear nothing he said and it sounded more like a command what of these dungeon dimensions if they should trouble us away with them a true wizard will fear nothing nothing he jerked to his feet again and strode to the simulacrum of the world the image was perfect in every detail down to a ghost of great atuin paddling slowly through the interstellar deeps a few inches above the floor coin waved his hand through it disdainfully ours is a world of magic he said and what can be found in it that can stand against us hakardly thought that something was expected of him absolutely noone he said except for the gods of course there was a dead silence the gods said coin quietly well yes certainly we dont challenge the gods they do their job we do ours no sense in who rules the disc wizards or gods hakardly thought quickly oh wizards of course but as it were under the gods when one accidentally puts one boot in a swamp it is quite unpleasant but not as unpleasant as pushing down with the other boot and hearing that too disappear with a soft sucking noise hakardly pressed on you see wizardry is more are we not more powerful than the gods then said coin some of the wizards at the back of the crowd began to shuffle their feet well yes and no said hakardly up to his knees in it now the truth was that wizards tended to be somewhat nervous about the gods the beings who dwelt on cori celesti had never made their feelings plain on the subject of ceremonial magic which after all had a certain godness about it and wizards tended to avoid the whole subject the trouble with gods was that if they didnt like something they didnt just drop hints so common sense suggested that it was unwise to put the gods in a position where they had to decide there seems to be some uncertainty said coin if i may counsel hakardly began coin waved a hand the walls vanished the wizards stood at the top of the tower of sourcery and as one man their eyes turned to the distant pinnacle of cori celesti home of the gods when youve beaten everyone else theres only the gods left to fight said coin have any of you seen the gods there was a chorus of hesitant denials i will show them to you youve got room for another one in there old son said war pestilence swayed unsteadily im sure we should be getting along he muttered without much conviction oh go on just a half then and then we really must be going war slapped him on the back and glared at famine and wed better have another fifteen bags of peanuts he added oook the librarian concluded oh said rincewind its the staff thats the problem then oook hasnt anyone tried to take it away from him oook what happened to them then eeek rincewind groaned the librarian had put his candle out because the presence of the naked flame was unsettling the books but now that rincewind had grown accustomed to the dark he realised it wasnt dark at all the soft octarine glow from the books filled the inside of the tower with something that while it wasnt exactly light was a blackness you could see by now and again the ruffle of stiff pages floated down from the gloom so basically theres no way our magic could defeat him isnt that right the librarian cooked disconsolate agreement and continued to spin around gently on his bottom pretty pointless then it may have struck you that i am not exactly gifted in the magical department i mean any duel is going to go on the lines of hallo im rincewind closely followed by bazaam oook basically what youre saying is that im on my own oook thanks by their own faint glow rincewind regarded the books that had stacked themselves around the inner walls of the ancient tower he sighed and marched briskly to the door but slowed down noticeably as he reached it ill be off then he said oook to face who knows what dreadful perils rincewind added to lay down my life in the service of mankind eeek all right bipeds woof and quadrapeds all right he glanced at the patricians jamjar a beaten man and lizards he added can i go now a gale was howling down out of a clear sky as rincewind toiled towards the tower of sourcery its high white doors were shut so tightly it was barely possible to see their outline in the milky surface of the stone he hammered on it for a bit but nothing much happened the doors seemed to absorb the sound fine thing he muttered to himself and remembered the carpet it was lying where he had left it which was another sign that ankh had changed in the thieving days before the sourcerer nothing stayed for long where you left it nothing printable anyway he rolled it out on the cobbles so that the golden dragons writhed against the blue ground unless of course the blue dragons were flying against a golden sky he sat down he stood up he sat down again and hitched up his robe and with some effort unrolled one of his socks then he replaced his boot and wandered around for a bit until he found among the rubble a halfbrick he inserted the halfbrick into the sock and gave the sock a few thoughtful swings rincewind had grown up in morpork what a morpork citizen liked to have on his side in a fight was odds of about twenty to one but failing that a sockful of halfbrick and a dark alley to lurk in was generally considered a better bet than any two magic swords you cared to name he sat down again up he commanded the carpet did not respond rincewind peered at the pattern then lifted a corner of the carpet and tried to make out if the underside was any better all right he conceded down very very carefully down sheep slurred war it was sheep his helmeted head hit the bar with a clang he raised it again sheep nonono said famine raising a thin finger unsteadily some other domess dummist tame animal like pig heifer kitten like that not sheep bees said pestilence and slid gently out of his seat okay said war ignoring him right once again then from the top he rapped the side of his glass for the note we are poor little unidentified domesticated animals that have lost our way he quavered baabaabaa muttered pestilence from the floor war shook his head it isnt the same you know he said not without him he used to come in beautifully on the bass baabaabaa pestilence repeated oh shut up said war and reached uncertainly for a bottle the gale buffeted the top of the tower a hot unpleasant wind that whispered with strange voices and rubbed the skin like fine sandpaper in the centre of it coin stood with the staff over his head as dust filled the air the wizards saw the lines of magic force pouring from it they curved up to form a vast bubble that expanded until it must have been larger than the city and shapes appeared in it they were shifting and indistinct wavering horribly like visions in a distorting mirror no more substantial than smoke rings or pictures in the clouds but they were dreadfully familiar there for a moment was the fanged snout of offler there clear for an instant in the writhing storm was blind lo chief of the gods with his orbiting eyes coin muttered soundlessly and the bubble began to contract it bulged and jerked obscenely as the things inside fought to get out but they could not stop the contraction now it was bigger than the university grounds now it was taller than the tower now it was twice the height of a man and smoke grey now it was an iridescent pearl the size of well the size of a large pearl the gale had gone replaced by a heavy silent calm the very air groaned with the strain most of the wizards were flat on the floor pressed there by the unleashed forces that thickened the air and deadened sound like a universe of feathers but every one of them could hear his own heart beating loud enough to smash the tower look at me coin commanded they turned their eyes upwards there was no way they could disobey he held the glistening thing in one hand the other held the staff which had smoke pouring from its ends the gods he said imprisoned in a thought and perhaps they were never more than a dream his voice become older deeper wizards of unseen university it said have i not given you absolute dominion behind them the carpet rose slowly over the side of the tower with rincewind trying hard to keep his balance his eyes were wide with the sort of terror that comes naturally to anyone standing on a few threads and several hundred feet of empty air he lurched off the hovering thing and on to the tower swinging the loaded sock around his head in wide dangerous sweeps coin saw him reflected in the astonished stares of the assembled wizards he turned carefully and watched the wizard stagger erratically towards him who are you he said i have come said rincewind thickly to challenge the sourcerer which one is he he surveyed the prostrate wizardry hefting the halfbrick in one hand hakardly risked a glance upwards and made frantic eyebrow movements at rincewind who even at the best of times wasnt much good at interpreting nonverbal communication this wasnt the best of times with a sock said coin what good is a sock the arm holding the staff rose coin looked down at it in mild astonishment no stop he said i want to talk to this man he stared at rincewind who was swaying back and forth under the influence of sleeplessness horror and the aftereffects of an adrenaline overdose is it magical he said curiously perhaps it is the sock of an archchancellor a sock of force rincewind focused on it i dont think so he said i think i bought it in a shop or something um ive got another one somewhere but in the end it has something heavy um yes said rincewind he added its a halfbrick but it has great power er you can hold things up with it if you had another one youd have a brick rincewind spoke slowly he was assimilating the situation by a kind of awful osmosis and watching the staff turn ominously in the boys hand so it is a brick of ordinariness within a sock the whole becoming a weapon um yes how does it work um you swing it and then you hit something with it or sometimes the back of your hand sometimes and then perhaps it destroys a whole city said coin rincewind stared into coins golden eyes and then at his sock he had pulled it on and off several times a year for years it had darns hed grown to know and lowell know some of them had whole families of darns of their own there were a number of descriptions that could be applied to the sock but slayerofcities wasnt among them not really he said at last it sort of kills people but leaves buildings standing rincewinds mind was operating at the speed of continental drift parts of it were telling him that he was confronting the sourcerer but they were in direct conflict with other parts rincewind had heard quite a lot about the power of the sourcerer the staff of the sourcerer the wickedness of the sourcerer and so on the only thing noone had mentioned was the age of the sourcerer he glanced towards the staff and what does that do he said slowly and the staff said you must kill this man the wizards who had been cautiously struggling upright flung themselves flat again the voice of the hat had been bad enough but the voice of the staff was metallic and precise it didnt sound as though it was offering advice but simply stating the way the future had to be it sounded quite impossible to ignore coin halfraised his arm and hesitated why he said you do not disobey me you dont have to said rincewind hurriedly its only a thing i do not see why i should hurt him said coin he looks so harmless like an angry rabbit he defies us not me said rincewind thrusting the arm with the sock behind his back and trying to ignore the bit about the rabbit why should i do everything you tell me said coin to the staff i always do everything you tell me and it doesnt help people at all people must fear you have i taught you nothing but he looks so funny hes got a sock said coin he screamed and his arm jerked oddly rincewinds hair stood on end you will do as you are commanded i wont you know what happens to boys who are bad there was a crackle and a smell of scorched flesh coin dropped to his knees here hang on a minute rincewind began coin opened his eyes they were gold still but flecked with brown rincewind swung his sock around in a wide humming arc that connected with the staff halfway along its length there was a brief explosion of brick dust and burnt wool and the staff spun out of the boys hand wizards scattered as it tumbled end over end across the floor it reached the parapet bounced upwards and shot over the edge but instead of falling it steadied itself in the air spun in its own length and sped back again trailing octarine sparks and making a noise like a buzzsaw rincewind pushed the stunned boy behind him threw away the ravaged sock and whipped his hat off flailing wildly as the staff bored towards him it caught him on the side of the head delivering a shock that almost welded his teeth together and toppled him like a thin and ragged tree the staff turned again in midair glowing redhot now and swept back for another and quite definitely final run rincewind struggled up on his elbows and watched in horrified fascination as it swooped through the chilly air which for some reason he didnt understand seemed to be full of snowflakes and became tinged with purple blotched with blue time slowed and ground to a halt like an underwound phonograph rincewind looked up at the tall black figure that had appeared a few feet away it was of course death he turned his glowing eyesockets towards rincewind and said in a voice like the collapse of undersea chasms good afternoon he turned away as if he had completed all necessary business for the time being stared at the horizon for a while and started to tap one foot idly it sounded like a bagful of maracas er said rincewind death appeared to remember him im sorry he said politely i always wondered how it was going to be said rincewind death took an hourglass out from the mysterious folds of his ebon robes and peered at it did you he said vaguely i suppose i cant complain said rincewind virtuously ive had a good life well quite good he hesitated well not all that good i suppose most people would call it pretty awful he considered it further i would he added half to himself what are you talking about man rincewind was nonplussed dont you make an appearance when a wizard is about to die of course and i must say you people are giving me a busy day how do you manage to be in so many places at the same time good organisation time returned the staff which had been hanging in the air a few feet away from rincewind started to scream forward again and there was a metallic thud as coin caught it onehandedly in midflight the staff uttered a noise like a thousand fingernails dragging across glass it thrashed wildly up and down flailing at the arm that held it and bloomed into evil green flame along its entire length so at the last you fail me coin groaned but held on as the metal under his fingertips went red then white he thrust the arm out in front of him and the force streaming from the staff roared past him and drew sparks from his hair and whipped his robe up into weird and unpleasant shapes he screamed and whirled the staff round and smashed it on the parapet leaving a long bubbling line in the stone then he threw it away it clattered against the stones and rolled to a halt wizards scattering out of its path coin sagged to his knees shaking i dont like killing people he said im sure it cant be right hold on to that thought said rincewind fervently what happens to people after theyre dead said coin rincewind glanced up at death i think this ones for you he said he cannot see or hear me said death until he wants to there was a little clinking noise the staff was rolling back towards coin who looked down at it in horror pick me up you dont have to said rincewind again you cannot resist me you cannot defeat yourself said the staff coin reached out very slowly and picked it up rincewind glanced at his sock it was a stub of burnt wool its brief career as a weapon of war having sent it beyond the help of any darning needle now kill him rincewind held his breath the watching wizards held their breath even death who had nothing to hold but his scythe held it tensely no said coin you know what happens to boys who are bad rincewind saw the sourcerers face go pale the staffs voice changed now it wheedled without me who would there be to tell you what to do that is true said coin slowly see what you have achieved coin stared slowly around at the frightened faces i am seeing he said i taught you everything i know i am thinking said coin that you do not know enough ingrate who gave you your destiny you did said the boy he raised his head i realise that i was wrong he added quietly good i did not throw you far enough coin got to his feet in one movement and swung the staff over his head he stood still as a statue his hand lost in a ball of light that was the colour of molten copper it turned green ascended through shades of blue hovered in the violet and then seared into pure octarine rincewind shaded his eyes against the glare and saw coins hand still whole still gripping tight with beads of molten metal glittering between his fingers he slithered away and bumped into hakardly the old wizard was standing like a statue with his mouth open whatll happen said rincewind hell never beat it said hakardly hoarsely its his its as strong as him hes got the power but it knows how to channel it you mean theyll cancel each other out hopefully the battle was hidden in its own infernal glow then the floor began to tremble theyre drawing on everything magical said hakardly wed better leave the tower why i imagine it will vanish soon enough and indeed the white flagstones around the glow looked as though they were unravelling and disappearing into it rincewind hesitated arent we going to help him he said hakardly stared at him and then at the iridescent tableau his mouth opened and shut once or twice im sorry he said yes but just a bit of help on his side youve seen what that thing is like im sorry he helped you rincewind turned on the other wizards who were scurrying away all of you he gave you what you wanted didnt he we may never forgive him said hakardly rincewind groaned what will be left when its all over he said what will be left hakardly looked down im sorry he repeated the octarine light had grown brighter and was beginning to turn black around the edge it wasnt the black that is merely the opposite of light though it was the grainy shifting blackness that glows beyond the glare and has no business in any decent reality and it buzzed rincewind did a little dance of uncertainty as his feet legs instincts and incredibly welldeveloped sense of selfpreservation overloaded his nervous system to the point where just as it was on the point of fusing his conscience finally got its way he leapt into the fire and reached the staff the wizards fled several of them levitated down from the tower they were a lot more perspicacious than those that used the stairs because about thirty seconds later the tower vanished the snow continued to fall around a column of blackness which buzzed and the surviving wizards who dared to look back saw tumbling slowly down the sky a small object trailing flames behind it it crashed into the cobbles where it smouldered for a bit before the thickening snow put it out pretty soon it became just a small mound a little while later a squat figure swung itself across the courtyard on its knuckles scrabbled in the snow and hauled the thing out it was or rather it had been a hat life had not been kind to it a large part of the wide brim had been burned off the point was entirely gone and the tarnished silver letters were almost unreadable some of them had been torn off in any case those that were left spelled out wizd the librarian turned around slowly he was entirely alone except for the towering column of burning blackness and the steadily falling flakes the ravaged campus was empty there were a few other pointy hats that had been trampled by terrified feet and no other sign that people had been there all the wizards were wazards war wazzat wasnt there pestilence groped for his glass something wazzat we ought to be theres something we ought to be doing said famine sright got an appointment the pestilence gazed reflectively into his drink thingy they stared gloomily at the bar counter the innkeeper had long ago fled there were several bottles still unopened okra said famine eventually that was it nah the apos the apostrophe said war vaguely they shook their heads there was a lengthy pause what does apocrustic mean said pestilence gazing intently into some inner world astringent said war i think its not that then shouldnt think so said famine glumly there was another long embarrassed silence better have nother drink said war pulling himself together sright about fifty miles away and several thousand feet up conina at last managed to control her stolen horse and brought it to a gentle trot on the empty air displaying some of the most determined nonchalance the disc had ever seen snow she said clouds were roaring soundlessly from the direction of the hub they were fat and heavy and shouldnt be moving so fast blizzards trailed beneath them covering the landscape like a sheet it didnt look like the kind of snow that whispers down gently in the pit of the night and in the morning turns the landscape into a glittering wonderland of uncommon and ethereal beauty it looked like the kind of snow that intends to make the world as bloody cold as possible bit late in the year said nijel he glanced downwards and then immediately closed his eyes creosote watched in delighted astonishment is that how it happens he said ive only heard about it in stories i thought it sprouted out of the ground somehow bit like mushrooms i thought those clouds arent right said conina do you mind if we go down now said nijel weakly somehow it didnt look so bad when we were moving conina ignored this try the lamp she commanded i want to know about this nijel fumbled in his pack and produced the lamp the voice of the genie sounded rather tinny and far off and said if you would care to relax a little trying to connect you there then followed some tinkly little music the kind that perhaps a swiss chalet would make if you could play it before a trapdoor outlined itself in the air and the genie himself appeared he looked around him and then at them oh wow he said somethings happening to the weather said conina why you mean you dont know said the genie were asking you arent we well im no judge but it rather looks like the apocralypse yuh what the genie shrugged the gods have vanished okay he said and according to you know legend that means the ice giants said nijel in a horrified whisper speak up said creosote the ice giants nijel repeated loudly with a trace of irritation the gods keep them imprisoned see at the hub but at the end of the world theyll break free at last and ride out on their dreadful glaciers and regain their ancient domination crushing out the flames of civilisation until the world lies naked and frozen under the terrible cold stars until time itself freezes over or something like that apparently but it isnt time for the apocralypse said conina desperately i mean a dreadful ruler has to arise there must be a terrible war the four dreadful horsemen have to ride and then the dungeon dimensions will break into the worldshe stopped her face nearly as white as the snow being buried under a thousandfoot ice sheet sounds awfully like it anyway said the genie he reached forward and snatched his lamp out of nijels hands mucho apologies he said but its time to liquidise my assets in this reality see you around or something he vanished up to the waist and then with a faint last cry of shame about lunch disappeared entirely the three riders peered through the veils of driving snow towards the hub it may be my imagination said creosote but can either of you hear a sort of creaking and groaning shut up said conina distractedly creosote leaned over and patted her hand cheer up he said its not the end of the world he thought about this statement for a bit and then added sorry just a figure of speech what are we going to do she wailed nijel drew himself up i think he said that we should go and explain they turned towards him with the kind of expression normally reserved for messiahs or extreme idiots yes he said with a shade more confidence we should explain explain to the ice giants said conina yes sorry said conina have i got this right you think we should go and find the terrifying ice giants and sort of tell them that there are a lot of warm people out here who would rather they didnt sweep across the world crushing everyone under mountains of ice and could they sort of reconsider things is that what you think we should do yes thats right youve got it exactly conina and creosote exchanged glances nijel remained sitting proudly in the saddle a faint smile on his face is your geese giving you trouble said the seriph geas said nijel calmly its not giving me trouble its just that i must do something brave before i die thats it though said creosote thats the whole rather sad point youll do something brave and then youll die what alternative have we got said nijel they considered this i dont think im much good at explaining said conina in a small voice i am said nijel firmly im always having to explain the scattered particles of what had been rincewinds mind pulled themselves together and drifted up through the layers of dark unconsciousness like a threeday corpse rising to the surface it probed its most recent memories in much the same way that one might scratch a fresh scab he could recall something about a staff and a pain so intense that it appeared to insert a chisel between every cell in his body and hammer on it repeatedly he remembered the staff fleeing dragging him after it and then there had been that dreadful bit where death had appeared and reached past him and the staff had twisted and become suddenly alive and death had said ipslore the red i have you now and now there was this by the feel of it rincewind was lying on sand it was very cold he took the risk of seeing something horrible and opened his eyes the first thing he saw was his left arm and surprisingly his hand it was its normal grubby self he had expected to see a stump it seemed to be nighttime the beach or whatever it was stretched on towards a line of distant low mountains under night sky frosted with a million white stars a little closer to him there was a rough line in the silvery sand he lifted his head slightly and saw the scatter of molten droplets they were octiron a metal so intrinsically magical that no forge on the disc could even warm it up oh he said we won then he flopped down again after a while his right hand came up automatically and patted the top of his head then it patted the sides of his head then it began to grope with increasing urgency in the sand around him eventually it must have communicated its concern to the rest of rincewind because he pulled himself upright and said oh bugger there seemed to be no hat anywhere but he could see a small white shape lying very still in the sand a little way away and further off a column of daylight it hummed and swayed in the air a threedimensional hole into somewhere else occasional flurries of snow blew out of it he could see skewed images in the light that might be buildings or landscapes warped by the weird curvature but he couldnt see them very clearly because of the tall brooding shadows that surrounded it the human mind is an astonishing thing it can operate on several levels at once and in fact while rincewind had been wasting his intellect in groaning and looking for his hat an inner part of his brain had been observing assessing analysing and comparing now it crept up to his cerebellum tapped it on the shoulder thrust a message into its hand and ran for it the message ran something like this i hope i find me well the last trial of magic has been too much for the tortured fabric of reality it has opened a hole i am in the dungeon dimensions and the things in front of me are the things it has been nice knowing me the particular thing nearest rincewind was at least twenty feet high it looked like a dead horse that had been dug up after three months and then introduced to a range of new experiences at least one of which had included an octopus it hadnt noticed rincewind it was too busy concentrating on the light rincewind crawled back to the still body of coin and nudged it gently are you alive he said if youre not id prefer it if you didnt answer coin rolled over and stared up at him with puzzled eyes after a while he said i remember best not to said rincewind the boys hand groped vaguely in the sand beside him it isnt here any more said rincewind quietly the hand stopped its searching rincewind helped coin to sit up he looked blankly at the cold silver sand then at the sky then at the distant things and then at rincewind i dont know what to do he said no harm in that ive never known what to do said rincewind with hollow cheerfulness been completely at a loss my whole life he hesitated i think its called being human or something but ive always known what to do rincewind opened his mouth to say that hed seen some of it but changed his mind instead he said chin up look on the bright side it could be worse coin took another look around in what respect exactly he said his voice a shade more normal um what is this place its a sort of other dimension the magic broke through and we went with it i think and those things they regarded the things i think theyre things theyre trying to get back through the hole said rincewind it isnt easy energy levels or something i remember we had a lecture on them once er coin nodded and reached out a thin pale hand towards rincewinds forehead do you mind he began rincewind shuddered at the touch mind what he said if i have a look in your head aargh its rather a mess in here no wonder you cant find things ergh you ought to have a clear out oogh ah rincewind felt the presence retreat coin frowned we cant let them get through he announced they have horrible powers theyre trying to will the hole bigger and they can do it theyve been waiting to break into our world for he frowned ians aeons said rincewind coin opened his other hand which had been tightly clenched and showed rincewind the small grey pearl do you know what this is he said no what is it icant remember but we should put it back okay just use sourcery blow them to bits and lets go home no they live on magic itd only make them worse i cant use magic are you sure said rincewind im afraid your memory was very clear on the subject then what shall we do i dont know rincewind thought about this and then with an air of finality started to take off his last sock no halfbricks he said to noone in particular have to use sand youre going to attack them with a sockful of sand no im going to run away from them the sockful of sand is for when they follow people were returning to al khali where the ruined tower was a smoking heap of stones a few brave souls turned their attention to the wreckage on the basis that there might be survivors who could be rescued or looted or both and among the rubble the following conversation might have been heard theres something moving under here under that by the two beards of imtal you are mishearing it must weigh a ton over here brothers and then sounds of much heaving would have been heard and then its a box it could be treasure do you think its growing legs by the seven moons of nasreem five moons whered it go whered it go never mind about that its not important lets get this straight according to the legend it was five moons in klatch they take their mythology seriously its only real life they dont believe the three horsepersons sensed the change as they descended through the heavy snowclouds at the hub end of the sto plain there was a sharp scent in the air cant you smell it said nijel i remember it when i was a boy when you lay in bed on that first morning in winter and you could sort of taste it in the air and the clouds parted below them and there filling the high plains country from end to end were the herds of the ice giants they stretched for miles in every direction and the thunder of their stampede filled the air the bull glaciers were in the lead bellowing their vast creaky calls and throwing up great sheets of earth as they ploughed relentlessly forward behind them pressed the great mass of cows and their calves skimming over land already ground down to the bedrock by the leaders they bore as much resemblance to the familiar glaciers the world thought it knew as a lion dozing in the shade bears to three hundred pounds of wickedly coordinated muscle bounding towards you with its mouth open and and when you went to the window nijels mouth lacking any further input from his brain ran down moving jostling ice packed the plain roaring forward under a great cloud of clammy steam the ground shook as the leaders passed below and it was obvious to the onlookers that whoever was going to stop this would need more than a couple of pounds of rock salt and a shovel go on then said conina explain i think youd better shout nijel looked distractedly at the herd i think i can see some figures said creosote helpfully look on top of the leading things nijel peered through the snow there were indeed beings moving around on the backs of the glaciers they were human or humanoid or at least humanish they didnt look very big that turned out to be because the glaciers themselves were very big and nijel wasnt very good at perspective as the horses flew lower over the leading glacier a huge bull heavily crevassed and scarred by moraine it became apparent that one reason why the ice giants were known as the ice giants was because they were well giants the other was that they were made of ice a figure the size of a large house was crouched at the crest of the bull urging it to greater efforts by means of a spike on a long pole it was craggy in fact it was more nearly faceted and glinted green and blue in the light there was a thin band of silver in its snowy locks and its eyes were tiny and black and deep set like lumps of coal there was a splintering crash ahead as the leading glaciers smacked into a forest birds rattled up in panic snow and splinters rained down around nijel as he galloped on the air alongside the giant he cleared his throat erm he said excuse me ahead of the boiling surf of earth snow and smashed timber a herd of caribou was running in blind panic their rear hooves a few feet from the tumbling mess nijel tried again i say he shouted the giants head turned towards him vot you want it said go avay hot person sorry but is this really necessary the giant looked at him in frozen astonishment it turned around slowly and regarded the rest of the herd which seemed to stretch all the way to the hub it looked at nijel again yarss it said i tink so otherwise why ve do it only theres a lot of people out there who would prefer you not to you see said nijel desperately a rock spire loomed briefly ahead of the glacier rocked for a second and then vanished he added also children and small furry animals they vill suffer in the cause of progress now is the time ve reclaim the world rumbled the giant whole vorld of ice according to inevitability of history and triumph of thermodynamics yes but you dont have to said nijel ve vant to said the giant the gods are gone ve throw off shackles of outmoded superstition freezing the whole world solid doesnt sound very progressive to me said nijel ve like it yes yes said nijel in the maniacally glazed tones of one who is trying to see all sides of the issue and is certain that a solution will be found if people of goodwill will only sit around a table and discuss things rationally like sensible human beings but is this the right time is the world ready for the triumph of ice it bloody veil better be said the giant and swung his glacier prod at nijel it missed the horse but caught him full in the chest lifting him clean out of the saddle and flicking him on to the glacier itself he spun spreadeagled down its freezing flanks was carried some way by the boil of debris and rolled into the slush of ice and mud between the speeding walls he staggered to his feet and peered hopelessly into the freezing fog another glacier bore down directly on him so did conina she leaned over as her horse swept down out of the fog caught nijel by his leather barbarian harness and swung him up in front of her as they rose again he wheezed coldhearted bastard i really thought i was getting somewhere for a moment there you just cant talk to some people the herd breasted another hill scraping off quite a lot of it and the sto plain studded with cities lay helpless before it rincewind sidled towards the nearest thing holding coin with one hand and swinging the loaded sock in the other no magic right he said yes said the boy whatever happens you musnt use magic thats it not here they havent got much power here if you dont use magic once they break through though his voice trailed away pretty awful rincewind nodded terrible said coin rincewind sighed he wished he still had his hat hed just have to do without it all right he said when i shout you make a run for the light do you understand no looking back or anything no matter what happens no matter what said coin uncertainly no matter what rincewind gave a brave little smile especially no matter what you hear he was vaguely cheered to see coins mouth become an o of terror and then he continued when you get back to the other side what shall i do rincewind hesitated i dont know he said anything you can as much magic as you like anything just stop them and um yes rincewind gazed up at the thing which was still staring into the light if it you know if anyone gets out of this you know and everything is all right after all sort of thing id like you to sort of tell people i sort of stayed here perhaps they could sort of write it down somewhere i mean i wouldnt want a statue or anything he added virtuously after a while he added i think you ought to blow your nose coin did so on the hem of his robe and then shook rincewinds hand solemnly if ever you he began that is youre the first its been a great you see i never really his voice trailed off and then he said i just wanted you to know that there was something else i was trying to say said rincewind letting go of the hand he looked blank for a moment and then added oh yes its vital to remember who you really are its very important it isnt a good idea to rely on other people or things to do it for you you see they always get it wrong ill try and remember said coin its very important rincewind repeated almost to himself and now i think youd better run rincewind crept closer to the thing this particular one had chicken legs but most of the rest of it was mercifully hidden in what looked like folded wings it was he thought time for a few last words what he said now was likely to be very important perhaps they would be words that would be remembered and handed down and maybe even carved deeply in slabs of granite words without too many curly letters in therefore i really wish i wasnt here he muttered he hefted the sock whirled it once or twice and smashed the thing on what he hoped was its kneecap it gave a shrill buzz spun wildly with its wings creaking open lunged vaguely at rincewind with its vulture head and got another sockful of sand on the upswing rincewind looked around desperately as the thing staggered back and saw coin still standing where he had left him to his horror he saw the boy begin to walk towards him hands raised instinctively to fire the magic which here would doom both of them run away you idiot he screamed as the thing began to gather itself for a counterattack from out of nowhere he found the words you know what happens to boys who are bad coin went pale turned and ran towards the light he moved as though through treacle fighting against the entropy slope the distorted image of the world turned inside out hovered a few feet away then inches wavering uncertainly a tentacle curled around his leg tumbling him forward he flung his hands out as he fell and one of them touched snow it was immediately grabbed by something else that felt like a warm soft leather glove but under the gentle touch was a grip as tough as tempered steel and it tugged him forward also dragging whatever it was that had caught him light and grainy dark flicked around him and suddenly he was sliding over cobbles slicked with ice the librarian let go his hold and stood over coin with a length of heavy wooden beam in his hand for a moment the ape reared against the darkness the shoulder elbow and wrist of his right arm unfolding in a poem of applied leverage and in a movement as unstoppable as the dawn of intelligence brought it down very heavily there was a squashy noise and an offended screech and the burning pressure on coins leg vanished the dark column wavered there were squeals and thumps coming from it distorted by distance coin struggled to his feet and started to run back into the dark but this time the librarians arm blocked his path we cant just leave him in there the ape shrugged there was another crackle from the dark and then a moment of almost complete silence but only almost complete both of them thought they heard a long way off but very distinct the sound of running feet fading into the distance they found an echo in the outside world the ape glanced around and then pushed coin hurriedly to one side as something squat and battered and with hundreds of little legs barrelled across the stricken courtyard and without so much as pausing in its stride leapt into the disappearing darkness which flickered for one last time and vanished there was a sudden flurry of snow across the air where it had been coin wrenched free of the librarians grip and ran into the circle which was already turning white his feet scuffed up a sprinkle of fine sand he didnt come out he said oook said the librarian in a philosophic manner i thought hed come out you know just at the last minute oook coin looked closely at the cobbles as if by mere concentration he could change what he saw is he dead gook observed the librarian contriving to imply that rincewind was in a region where even things like time and space were a bit iffy and that it was probably not very useful to speculate as to his exact state at this point in time if indeed he was at any point in time at all and that all in all he might even turn up tomorrow or for that matter yesterday and finally that if there was any chance at all of surviving then rincewind almost certainly would oh said coin he watched the librarian shuffle around and head back for the tower of art and a desperate loneliness overcame him i say he yelled gook what should i do now gook coin waved vaguely at the desolation you know perhaps i could do something about all this he said in a voice tilting on the edge of terror do you think that would be a good idea i mean i could help people im sure youd like to be human again wouldnt you the librarians everlasting smile hoisted itself a little further up his face just enough to reveal his teeth okay perhaps not said coin hurriedly but theres other things i could do isnt there the librarian gazed at him for some time then dropped his eyes to the boys hand coin gave a guilty start and opened his fingers the ape caught the little silver ball neatly before it hit the ground and held it up to one eye he sniffed it shook it gently and listened to it for a while then he wound up his arm and flung it away as hard as possible what coin began and landed full length in the snow when the librarian pushed him over and dived on top of him the ball curved over at the top of its arc and tumbled down its perfect path interrupted suddenly by the ground there was a sound like a harp string breaking a brief babble of incomprehensible voices a rush of hot wind and the gods of the disc were free they were very angry there is nothing we can do is there said creosote no said conina the ice is going to win isnt it said creosote yes said conina no said nijel he was trembling with rage or possibly with cold and was nearly as pale as the glaciers that rumbled past below them conina sighed well just how do you think she began take me down somewhere a few minutes ahead of them said nijel i really dont see how that would help i wasnt asking your opinion said nijel quietly just do it put me down a little way ahead of them so ive got a while to get sorted out get what sorted out nijel didnt answer i said said conina get what shut up i dont see why look said nijel with the patience that lies just short of axemurdering the ice is going to cover the whole world right everyones going to die okay except for us for a little while i suppose until these horses want their their their oats or the lavatory or whatever which isnt much use to us except maybe creosote will just about have time to write a sonnet or something about how cold it is all of a sudden and the whole of human history is about to be scraped up and in these circumstances i would like very much to make it completely clear that i am not about to be argued with is that absolutely understood he paused for breath trembling like a harpstring conina hesitated her mouth opened and shut a few times as though she was considering arguing and then she thought better of it they found a small clearing in a pine forest a mile or two ahead of the herd although the sound of it was clearly audible and there was a line of steam above the trees and the ground was dancing like a drumtop nijel strolled to the middle of the clearing and made a few practice swings with his sword the others watched him thoughtfully if you dont mind whispered creosote to conina ill be off its at times like this that sobriety loses its attractions and im sure the end of the world will look a lot better through the bottom of a glass if its all the same to you do you believe in paradise o peachcheeked blossom not as such no oh said creosote well in that case we probably wont be seeing each other again he sighed what a waste all this was just because of a geas um of course if by some unthinkable chance goodbye said conina creosote nodded miserably wheeled the horse and disappeared over the treetops snow was shaking down from the branches around the clearing the thunder of the approaching glaciers filled the air nijel started when she tapped him on the shoulder and dropped his sword what are you doing here he snapped fumbling desperately in the snow look im not prying or anything said conina meekly but what exactly do you have in mind she could see a rolling heap of bulldozed snow and soil bearing down on them through the forest the mindnumbing sound of the leading glaciers now overlaid with the rhythmic snapping of tree trunks and advancing implacably above the treeline so high that the eye mistook them at first for sky the bluegreen prows nothing said nijel nothing at all weve just got to resist them thats all there is to it thats what were here for but it wont make any difference she said it will to me if were going to die anyway iii rather die like this heroically is it heroic to die like this said conina i think it is he said and when it comes to dying theres only one opinion that matters oh a couple of deer blundered into the clearing ignored the humans in their blind panic and rocketed away you dont have to stay said nijel ive got this geas you see conina looked at the backs of her hands i think i should she said and added you know i thought maybe you know if we could just get to know one another better mr and mrs harebut was that what you had in mind he said bluntly her eyes widened well she began which one did you intend to be he said the leading glacier smashed into the clearing just behind its bow wave its top lost in a cloud of its own creation at exactly the same time the trees opposite it bent low as a hot wind blew from the rim it was loaded with voices petulant bickering voices and tore into the clouds like a hot iron into water conina and nijel threw themselves down into snow which turned to warm slush under them something like a thunderstorm crashed overhead filled with shouting and what they at first thought were screams although thinking about them later they seemed more like angry arguments it went on for a long time and then began to fade in the direction of the hub warm water flooded down the front of nijels vest he lifted himself cautiously and then nudged conina together they scrambled through the slush and mud to the top of the slope climbed through a logjam of smashed timber and boulders and stared at the scene the glaciers were retreating under a cloud stuffed with lightning behind them the landscape was a network of lakes and pools did we do that said conina it would be nice to think so wouldnt it said nijel yes but did she began probably not who knows lets just find a horse he said the apogee said war or something im pretty sure they had staggered out of the inn and were sitting on a bench in the afternoon sunshine even war had been persuaded to take off some of his armour dunno said famine dont think so pestilence shut his crusted eyes and leaned back against the warm stones i think he said it was something about the end of the world war sat and thoughtfully scratched his chin he hiccuped what the whole world he said i reckon war gave this some further consideration i reckon were well out of it then he said people were returning to ankhmorpork which was no longer a city of empty marble but was once again its old self sprawling as randomly and colourfully as a pool of vomit outside the allnight takeaway of history and the university had been rebuilt or had rebuilt itself or in some strange way had never been unbuilt every strand of ivy every rotting casement was back in place the sourcerer had offered to replace everything as good as new all wood sparkling all stone unstained but the librarian had been very firm on the subject he wanted everything replaced as good as old the wizards came creeping back with the dawn in ones or twos scuttling for their old rooms trying to avoid one anothers gaze trying to remember a recent past that was already becoming unreal and dreamlike conina and nijel arrived around breakfast time and out of kindness found a livery stable for wars horse it was conina who insisted that they look for rincewind at the university and who therefore first saw the books they were flying out of the tower of art spiralling around the university buildings and swooping through the door of the reincarnated library one or two of the more impudent grimoires were chasing sparrows or hovering hawklike over the quad the librarian was leaning against the doorway watching his charges with a benevolent eye he waggled his eyebrows at conina the nearest he ever got to a conventional greeting is rincewind here she said oook sorry the ape didnt answer but took them both by the hand and walking between them like a sack between two poles led them across the cobbles to the tower there were a few candles alight inside and they saw coin seated on a stool the librarian bowed them into his presence like an ancient retainer in the oldest family of all and withdrew coin nodded at them he knows when people dont understand him he said remarkable isnt he who are you said conina coin said coin are you a student here im learning quite a lot i think nijel was wandering around the walls giving them the occasional prod there had to be some good reason why they didnt fall down but if there was it didnt lie in the realms of civil engineering are you looking for rincewind said coin conina frowned how did you guess that he told me some people would come looking for him conina relaxed sorry she said weve had a bit of a trying time i thought perhaps it was magic or something hes all right isnt he i mean whats been happening did he fight the sourcerer oh yes and he won it was very interesting i saw it all but then he had to go said coin as though reciting what just like that said nijel yes i dont believe it said conina she was beginning to crouch her knuckles whitening it is true said coin everything i say is true it has to be i want to conina began and coin stood up extended a hand and said stop she froze nijel stiffened in midfrown you will leave said coin in a pleasant level voice and you will ask no more questions you will be totally satisfied you have all your answers you will live happily ever after you will forget hearing these words you will go now they turned slowly and woodenly like puppets and trooped to the door the librarian opened it for them ushered them through and shut it behind them then he stared at coin who sagged back on to the stool all right all right said the boy but it was only a little magic i had to you said yourself people had to forget oook i cant help it its too easy to change things he clutched his head ive only got to think of something i cant stay everything i touch goes wrong its like trying to sleep on a heap of eggs this world is too thin please tell me what to do the librarian spun around on his bottom a few times a sure sign of deep thought exactly what he said is not recorded but coin smiled nodded shook the librarians hand and opened his own hands and drew them up and around him and stepped into another world it had a lake in and some distant mountains and a few pheasants watching him suspiciously from under the trees it was the magic all sourcerers learned eventually sourcerers never become part of the world they merely wear it for a while he looked back halfway across the turf and waved at the librarian the ape gave him an encouraging nod and then the bubble shrank inside itself and the last sourcerer vanished from this world and into a world of his own although it has nothing much to do with the story it is an interesting fact that about five hundred miles away a small flock or rather in this case a herd of birds were picking their way cautiously through the trees they had heads like a flamingo bodies like a turkey and legs like a sumo wrestler they walked in a jerky bobbing fashion as though their heads were attached to their feet by elastic bands they belonged to a species unique even among disc fauna in that their prime means of defence was to cause a predator to laugh so much that they could run away before it recovered rincewind would have been vaguely satisfied to know that they were geas custom was slow in the mended drum the troll chained to the doorpost sat in the shade and reflectively picked someone out of his teeth creosote was singing softly to himself he had discovered beer and wasnt having to pay for it because the coinage of compliments rarely employed by the swains of ankh was having an astonishing effect on the landlords daughter she was a large goodnatured girl with a figure that was the colour and not to put too fine a point on it the same shape as unbaked bread she was intrigued noone had ever referred to her breasts as jewelled melons before absolutely said the seriph sliding peacefully off his bench no doubt about it either the big yellow sort or the small green ones with huge warty veins he told himself virtuously and what was that about my hair she said encouragingly hauling him back and refilling his glass oh the seriphs brow wrinkled like a goat of flocks that grazes on the slopes of mount wossname and no mistake and as for your ears he added quickly no pinkhued shells that grace the seakissed sands of exactly how like a flock of goats she said the seriph hesitated hed always considered it one of his best lines now it was meeting ankhmorporks famous literalmindedness headon for the first time strangely enough he felt rather impressed i mean in size shape or smell she went on i think said the seriph that perhaps the phrase i had in mind was exactly not like a flog of gits ah the girl pulled the flagon towards her and i think perhaps i would like another drink he said indistinctly and then and then he looked sideways at the girl and took the plunge are you much of a raconteur what he licked his suddenly dry lips i mean do you know many stories he croaked oh yes lots lots whispered creosote most of his concubines only knew the same old one or two hundreds why do you want to hear one what now if you like its not very busy in here perhaps i did die creosote thought perhaps this is paradise he took her hands you know he said its ages since ive had a good narrative but i wouldnt want you to do anything you dont want to she patted his arm what a nice old gentleman she thought compared to some we get in here theres one my granny used to tell me i know it backwards she said creosote sipped his beer and watched the wall in a warm glow hundreds he thought and she knows some of them backwards she cleared her throat and said in a singsong voice that made creosotes pulse fuse there was a man and he had eight sons the patrician sat by his window writing his mind was full of fluff as far as the last week or two was concerned and he didnt like that much a servant had lit a lamp to dispel the twilight and a few early evening moths were orbiting it the patrician watched them carefully for some reason he felt very uneasy in the presence of glass but that as he stared fixedly at the insects wasnt what bothered him most what bothered him was that he was fighting a terrible urge to catch them with his tongue and wuffles lay on his back at his masters feet and barked in his dreams lights were going on all over the city but the last few strands of sunset illuminated the gargoyles as they helped one another up the long climb to the roof the librarian watched them from the open door while giving himself a philosophic scratch then he turned and shut out the night it was warm in the library it was always warm in the library because the scatter of magic that produced the glow also gently cooked the air the librarian looked at his charges approvingly made his last rounds of the slumbering shelves and then dragged his blanket underneath his desk ate a goodnight banana and fell asleep silence gradually reclaimed the library silence drifted around the remains of a hat heavily battered and frayed and charred around the edges that had been placed with some ceremony in a niche in the wall no matter how far a wizard goes he will always come back for his hat silence filled the university in the same way that air fills a hole night spread across the disk like plum jam or possibly blackberry preserve but there would be a morning there would always be another morning the end like rhinestones but different river when it comes to glittering objects wizards have all the taste and selfcontrol of a deranged magpie a magical accident in the library which as has already been indicated is not a place for your average rubberstampanddeweydecimal employment had some time ago turned the librarian into an orangutan he had since resisted all efforts to turn him back he liked the handy long arms the prehensile toes and the right to scratch himself in public but most of all he liked the way all the big questions of existence had suddenly resolved themselves into a vague interest in where his next banana was coming from it wasnt that he was unaware of the despair and nobility of the human condition it was just that as far as he was concerned you could stuff it the furrow left by the fleeing gargoyles caused the universitys head gardener to bite through his rake and led to the famous quotation how do you get a lawn like this you mows it and you rolls it for five hundred years and then a bunch of bastards walks across it in most old libraries the books are chained to the shelves to prevent them being damaged by people in the library of unseen university of course its more or less the other way about at least by anyone who wanted to wake up the same shape or even the same species as they went to bed the vermine is a small black and white relative of the lemming found in the cold hublandish regions its skin is rare and highly valued especially by the vermine itself the selfish little bastard will do anything rather than let go of it this was because gritoller had swallowed the jewels for safe keeping the ankhmorpork merchants guild publication wellcome to ankhmorporke citie of one thousand surprises describes the area of old morpork known as the shades as a folklorique network of old alleys and picturesque streets wherre exitment and romans lurkes arounde everry corner and much may be heard the traditinal street cries of old time also the laughing visages of the denuizens as they goe about their business private in other words you have been warned the study of genetics on the disc had failed at an early stage when wizards tried the experimental crossing of such well known subjects as fruit flies and sweet peas unfortunately they didnt quite grasp the fundamentals and the resultant offspring a sort of green bean thing that buzzed led a short sad life before being eaten by a passing spider the overwhelming majority of citizens being defined in this case as everyone not currently hanging upside down over a scorpion pit wizards tastes in the matter of puns are about the same as their taste in glittery objects of course ankhmorporks citizens had always claimed that the river water was incredibly pure in any case any water that had passed through so many kidneys they reasoned had to be very pure indeed noone ever had the courage to ask him what he did there or up or obliquely the layout of the library of unseen university was a topographical nightmare the sheer presence of so much stored magic twisting dimensions and gravity into the kind of spaghetti that would make m c escher go for a good lie down or possibly sideways the hashishim who derived their name from the vast quantities of hashish they consumed were unique among vicious killers in being both deadly and at the same time inclined to giggle groove to interesting patterns of light and shade on their terrible knife blades and in extreme cases fall over although possibly quicker and only licensed to carry fourteen people in a truly magical universe everything has its opposite for example theres antilight thats not the same as darkness because darkness is merely the absence of light antilight is what you get if you pass through darkness and out the other side on the same basis a state of knurdness isnt like sobriety by comparison sobriety is like having a bath in cotton wool knurdness strips away all illlusion all the comforting pink fog in which people normally spend their lives and lets them see and think clearly for the first time ever then after theyve screamed a bit they make sure they never get knurd again for a description of the chimera we shall turn to broomfogs famous bestiary anima unnaturale it have thee legges of an mermade the hair of an tortoise the teeth of an fowel and the winges of an snake of course i have only my worde for it the beast having the breathe of an furnace and the temperament of an rubber balloon in a hurricane of course wizards often killed one another by ordinary nonmagical means but this was perfectly allowable and death by assassination was considered natural causes for a wizard all right but youve got the general idea it was a fullomyth an invaluable aid for all whose business is with the arcane and hermetic it contained lists of things that didnt exist and in a very significant way werent important some of its pages could only be read after midnight or by strange and improbable illuminations there were descriptions of underground constellations and wines as yet unfermented for the really uptotheepoch occultist who could afford the version bound in spider skin there was even an insert showing the london underground with the three stations they never dare show on the public maps he always argued that he was very popular among gods demigods daemons and other supernatural creatures who feel at home with questions like what is it all about and where will it all end although this was the only way in which they resembled the idols built in response to ancient and unacknowledged memories by children in snowy weather it was extremely unlikely that this ice giant would be a small mound of grubby ice with a carrot in it by the morning which wisely decided not to fly again was never claimed and lived out the rest of its days as the carriage horse of an elderly lady what war did about this is unrecorded it is pretty certain that he got another one
