all the good sciencefiction editors i knew when i was trying to learn the trade spent a lot of their time thinking of tricks devices and subtle manipulations designed to get writers to write stories for them that might not otherwise have got written you might think they didnt have to do that after all writers are in the business of writing why not just let them get on with it and take what comes as it comes because they might be spending their time writing something unsuitable for one reason because they might be writing it for someone else is the other so john campbell horace gold bob lowndes don wollheimand iwould pass out story ideas mail off xeroxes of covers that needed stories written around them dream up theme issuesanything at all that would prod a lazy writer into producing a story instead of whatever else he had planned to do with his time that day the art has not been lost ellen datlow fiction editor of omni wasnt even born when john campbell began practicing that art but she has thought of devices even the master never knew not long ago for instance she called up half a dozen of her favorite writers to announce that she was going to publish a special fiction issue containing a story by each of them all limited to a maximum of five hundred words five hundred words it takes me five hundred words to answer the phone however these little behaviormodification tricks do work their magic and so i sat down to try i tried at least half a dozen story ideas without luck because after the first page and a half each one of them convinced me that it wanted to be a fullsized story if not indeed a three volume novel sequence then my son fred the fourth out of the kindness of his heart gave me an opening sentence and the other words followed easily after i guess just as with the kennedy assassination everybody can remember exactly where he was and what he was doing on the day the space people brought jesus back to earth i was aboard air force one with the presidentim secret serviceand when major manley radioed the unbelievable message from the orbiting space shuttle we turned right around and headed straight for california beat the shuttle down and waited parked at the end of the landing strip watching tv of course business had stopped all over the world everybody was watching the pictures from the big telescope on mauna keawhat a brute that spaceship was half a mile longand listening to replays of manleys message well the shuttle made its turn and came down and they got the crew out and into air force one while the ground people were still purging the fuel vapors you sure its jesus the president demanded thats what they say mr president i took a picture of himsee for yourself and he passed over a polaroid the president winced i didnt think hed look like that well hes jewish you know no i mean hes so young its been nearly two thousand years major manley explained they were traveling at light speed almost all this timeyou know time dilatation after they rolled away the stone and took him out of the cave they kidnapped jesus they dont look at it that way mr president he was not in very good shape they figured we were through with him so they took him to their planet where they have a place to keep specimens of life forms from all over the galaxy they put jesus in a zoo manley shrugged whats he doing now the president asked they say hes watching tv mostly doesnt much like what he sees they say but i didnt talk to him myselfi dont speak aramaic anyway i was glad to get out of there because that ships pretty scary you just wouldnt believe all the nasty kinds of weapons theyve got the presidents eyes gleamed and the secretary of defense exulted new weapons what a bargaining chip the president glanced around the room and the expressions of delight were unanimous there remained only one thing to do he crooked a finger and his secretary turned on her recorder take a decree mabel i the president and so on do hereby proclaim that jesus christ is come again anduh and hes ours the secretary finished and then raptly thank god it looked pretty good there of course the other countries were screeching their heads off pravda raged the chicoms canceled a trip by their soccer team and the israeli ambassador practically had a heart attack trying to argue that he was after all one of their nationals by birth that didnt matter we were first and nasa cleared the canaveral runways for his landing but he requested all three networks to provide thirty minutes for a primetime telecast and that was when it all went sour never mind he didnt look right never mind he spoke in aramaic which practically nobody understood it was what he said that was the bad partthat and the fact that before we got the translation there was a priority call from the mauna kea telescope people to say the ship was breaking out of orbit and heading back out into space but what did he say moaned the president and the translator sweating shook his head something about he doesnt like the way weve spoiled his planet he croaked says he told us what to do and we havent done itweve messed everything up hell shouted the president we can fix that up call him back we can make a deal well give him his own tv station so he can preach to the multitudes let pilgrims come visit himanything he wants but the translator was shaking his head again he doesnt want that he says hes going back with the space people theyve got a betterclass zoo
