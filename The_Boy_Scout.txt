the boy scout by richard harding davis illustration jimmie dropped the valise forced his cramped fingers into straight lines and saluted page new york charles scribners sons copyright by charles scribners sons published may illustration the boy scout a rule of the boy scouts is every day to do some one a good turn not because the copybooks tell you it deserves another but in spite of that pleasing possibility if you are a true scout until you have performed your act of kindness your day is dark you are as unhappy as is the grownup who has begun his day without shaving or reading the new york sun but as soon as you have proved yourself you may with a clear conscience look the world in the face and untie the knot in your kerchief jimmie reeder untied the accusing knot in his scarf at just ten minutes past eight on a hot august morning after he had given one dime to his sister sadie with that she could either witness the firstrun films at the palace or by dividing her fortune patronize two of the nickel shows on lenox avenue the choice jimmie left to her he was setting out for the annual encampment of the boy scouts at hunters island and in the excitement of that adventure even the movies ceased to thrill but sadie also could be unselfish with a heroism of a campfire maiden she made a gesture which might have been interpreted to mean she was returning the money i cant jimmie she gasped i cant take it off you you saved it and you ought to get the fun of it i havent saved it yet said jimmie im going to cut it out of the railroad fare im going to get off at city island instead of at pelham manor and walk the difference thats ten cents cheaper sadie exclaimed with admiration an you carryin that heavy grip aw thats nothin said the man of the family goodby mother so long sadie to ward off further expressions of gratitude he hurriedly advised sadie to take in the curse of cain rather than the mohawks last stand and fled down the front steps he wore his khaki uniform on his shoulders was his knapsack from his hands swung his suitcase and between his heavy stockings and his shorts his kneecaps unkissed by the sun as yet unscathed by blackberry vines showed as white and fragile as the wrists of a girl as he moved toward the l station at the corner sadie and his mother waved to him in the street boys too small to be scouts hailed him enviously even the policeman glancing over the newspapers on the newsstand nodded approval you a scout jimmie he asked no retorted jimmie for was not he also in uniform im santa claus out filling christmas stockings the patrolman also possessed a ready wit then get yourself a pair he advised if a dog was to see your legs jimmie escaped the insult by fleeing up the steps of the elevated an hour later with his valise in one hand and staff in the other he was tramping up the boston post road and breathing heavily the day was cruelly hot before his eyes over an interminable stretch of asphalt the heat waves danced and flickered already the knapsack on his shoulders pressed upon him like an old man of the sea the linen in the valise had turned to pig iron his pipestem legs were wabbling his eyes smarted with salt sweat and the fingers supporting the valise belonged to some other boy and were giving that boy much pain but as the motorcars flashed past with raucous warnings or that those who rode might better see the boy with bare knees passed at half speed jimmie stiffened his shoulders and stepped jauntily forward even when the joyriders mocked with oh you scout he smiled at them he was willing to admit to those who rode that the laugh was on the one who walked and he regretted oh so bitterly having left the train he was indignant that for his one good turn a day he had not selected one less strenuous that for instance he had not assisted a frightened old lady through the traffic to refuse the dime she might have offered as all true scouts refuse all tips would have been easier than to earn it by walking five miles with the sun at ninetynine degrees and carrying excess baggage twenty times james shifted the valise to the other hand twenty times he let it drop and sat upon it and then as again he took up his burden the good samaritan drew near he drew near in a low gray racingcar at the rate of forty miles an hour and within a hundred feet of jimmie suddenly stopped and backed toward him the good samaritan was a young man with white hair he wore a suit of blue a golf cap the hands that held the wheel were disguised in large yellow gloves he brought the car to a halt and surveyed the dripping figure in the road with tired and uncurious eyes you a boy scout he asked with alacrity for the twentyfirst time jimmie dropped the valise forced his cramped fingers into straight lines and saluted the young man in the car nodded toward the seat beside him get in he commanded when james sat panting happily at his elbow the old young man to jimmies disappointment did not continue to shatter the speed limit instead he seemed inclined for conversation and the car growling indignantly crawled i never saw a boy scout before announced the old young man tell me about it first tell me what you do when youre not scouting jimmie explained volubly when not in uniform he was an officeboy and from pedlers and beggars guarded the gates of carroll and hastings stockbrokers he spoke the names of his employers with awe it was a firm distinguished conservative and longestablished the whitehaired young man seemed to nod in assent do you know them demanded jimmie suspiciously are you a customer of ours i know them said the young man they are customers of mine jimmie wondered in what way carroll and hastings were customers of the whitehaired young man judging him by his outer garments jimmie guessed he was a fifth avenue tailor he might be even a haberdasher jimmie continued he lived he explained with his mother at one hundred and fortysixth street sadie his sister attended the public school he helped support them both and he now was about to enjoy a wellearned vacation camping out on hunters island where he would cook his own meals and if the mosquitoes permitted sleep in a tent and you like that demanded the young man you call that fun sure protested jimmie dont you go camping out i go camping out said the good samaritan whenever i leave new york jimmie had not for three years lived in wall street not to understand that the young man spoke in metaphor you dont look objected the young man critically as though you were built for the strenuous life jimmie glanced guiltily at his white knees you ought ter see me two weeks from now he protested i get all sunburnt and hard hard as anything the young man was incredulous you were near getting sunstroke when i picked you up he laughed if youre going to hunters island why didnt you take the third avenue to pelham manor thats right assented jimmie eagerly but i wanted to save the ten cents sos to send sadie to the movies so i walked the young man looked his embarrassment i beg your pardon he murmured but jimmie did not hear him from the back of the car he was dragging excitedly at the hated suitcase stop he commanded i got ter get out i got ter walk the young man showed his surprise walk he exclaimed what is it a bet jimmie dropped the valise and followed it into the roadway it took some time to explain to the young man first he had to be told about the scout law and the one good turn a day and that it must involve some personal sacrifice and as jimmie pointed out changing from a slow suburban train to a racingcar could not be listed as a sacrifice he had not earned the money jimmie argued he had only avoided paying it to the railroad if he did not walk he would be obtaining the gratitude of sadie by a falsehood therefore he must walk not at all protested the young man youve got it wrong what good will it do your sister to have you sunstruck i think you are sunstruck youre crazy with the heat you get in here and well talk it over as we go along hastily jimmie backed away id rather walk he said the young man shifted his legs irritably then howll this suit you he called well declare that first one good turn a failure and start afresh do me a good turn jimmie halted in his tracks and looked back suspiciously im going to hunters island inn called the young man and ive lost my way you get in here and guide me thatll be doing me a good turn on either side of the road blotting out the landscape giant hands picked out in electriclight bulbs pointed the way to hunters island inn jimmie grinned and nodded toward them much obliged he called i got ter walk turning his back upon temptation he wabbled forward into the flickering heat waves the young man did not attempt to pursue at the side of the road under the shade of a giant elm he had brought the car to a halt and with his arms crossed upon the wheel sat motionless following with frowning eyes the retreating figure of jimmie but the narrowchested and knockkneed boy staggering over the sunbaked asphalt no longer concerned him it was not jimmie but the code preached by jimmie and not only preached but before his eyes put into practice that interested him the young man with white hair had been running away from temptation at forty miles an hour he had been running away from the temptation to do a fellow mortal a good turn that morning to the appeal of a drowning c–∂sar to help me cassius or i sink he had answered sink that answer he had no wish to reconsider that he might not reconsider he had sought to escape it was his experience that a sixtyhorsepower racingmachine is a jealous mistress for retrospective sentimental or philanthropic thoughts she grants no leave of absence but he had not escaped jimmie had halted him tripped him by the heels and set him again to thinking within the halfhour that followed those who rolled past saw at the side of the road a car with her engine running and leaning upon the wheel as unconscious of his surroundings as though he sat at his own fireplace a young man who frowned and stared at nothing the halfhour passed and the young man swung his car back toward the city but at the first roadhouse that showed a blueandwhite telephone sign he left it and into the iron box at the end of the bar dropped a nickel he wished to communicate with mr carroll of carroll and hastings and when he learned mr carroll had just issued orders that he must not be disturbed the young man gave his name the effect upon the barkeeper was instantaneous with the aggrieved air of one who feels he is the victim of a jest he laughed scornfully what are you putting over he demanded the young man smiled reassuringly he had begun to speak and though apparently engaged with the beerglass he was polishing the barkeeper listened down in wall street the senior member of carroll and hastings also listened he was alone in the most private of all his private offices and when interrupted had been engaged in what of all undertakings is the most momentous on the desk before him lay letters to his lawyer to the coroner to his wife and hidden by a mass of papers but within reach of his hand an automatic pistol the promise it offered of swift release had made the writing of the letters simple had given him a feeling of complete detachment had released him at least in thought from all responsibilities and when at his elbow the telephone coughed discreetly it was as though some one had called him from a world from which already he had made his exit mechanically through mere habit he lifted the receiver the voice over the telephone came in brisk staccato sentences that letter i sent this morning forget it tear it up ive been thinking and im going to take a chance ive decided to back you boys and i know youll make good im speaking from a roadhouse in the bronx going straight from here to the bank so you can begin to draw against us within an hour and hello will three millions see you through from wall street there came no answer but from the hands of the barkeeper a glass crashed to the floor the young man regarded the barkeeper with puzzled eyes he doesnt answer he exclaimed he must have hung up he must have fainted said the barkeeper the whitehaired one pushed a bill across the counter to pay for breakage he said and disappeared down pelham parkway throughout the day with the bill for evidence pasted against the mirror the barkeeper told and retold the wondrous tale he stood just where youre standing now he related blowing in milliondollar bills like youd blow suds off a beer if id knowed it was him id have hit him once and hid him in the cellar for the reward whod i think he was i thought he was a wiretapper working a con game mr carroll had not hung up but when in the bronx the beerglass crashed in wall street the receiver had slipped from the hand of the man who held it and the man himself had fallen forward his desk hit him in the face and woke him woke him to the wonderful fact that he still lived that at forty he had been born again that before him stretched many more years in which as the young man with the white hair had pointed out he still could make good the afternoon was far advanced when the staff of carroll and hastings were allowed to depart and even late as was the hour two of them were asked to remain into the most private of the private offices carroll invited gaskell the head clerk in the main office hastings had asked young thorne the bond clerk to be seated until the senior partner has finished with gaskell young thorne must remain seated gaskell said mr carroll if we had listened to you if wed run this place as it was when father was alive this never would have happened it hasnt happened but weve had our lesson and after this were going slow and going straight and we dont need you to tell us how to do that we want you to go away on a months vacation when i thought we were going under i planned to send the children on a seavoyage with the governess so they wouldnt see the newspapers but now that i can look them in the eye again i need them i cant let them go so if youd like to take your wife on an ocean trip to nova scotia and quebec here are the cabins i reserved for the kids they call it the royal suite whatever that is and the trip lasts a month the boat sails tomorrow morning dont sleep too late or you may miss her the head clerk was secreting the tickets in the inside pocket of his waistcoat his fingers trembled and when he laughed his voice trembled miss the boat the head clerk exclaimed if she gets away from millie and me shes got to start now well go on board tonight a halfhour later millie was on her knees packing a trunk and her husband was telephoning to the drugstore for a sponge bag and a cure for seasickness owing to the joy in her heart and to the fact that she was on her knees millie was alternately weeping into the trunktray and offering up incoherent prayers of thanksgiving suddenly she sank back upon the floor john she cried doesnt it seem sinful to sail away in a royal suite and leave this beautiful flat empty over the telephone john was having trouble with the drug clerk no he explained im not seasick now the medicine i want is to be taken later i know im speaking from the pavonia but the pavonia isnt a ship its an apartmenthouse he turned to millie we cant be in two places at the same time he suggested but think insisted millie of all the poor people stifling tonight in this heat trying to sleep on the roofs and fireescapes and our flat so cool and big and pretty and no one in it john nodded his head proudly i know its big he said but it isnt big enough to hold all the people who are sleeping tonight on the roofs and in the parks i was thinking of your brother and grace said millie theyve been married only two weeks now and theyre in a stuffy hall bedroom and eating with all the other boarders think what our flat would mean to them to be by themselves with eight rooms and their own kitchen and bath and our new refrigerator and the gramophone it would be heaven it would be a real honeymoon abandoning the drug clerk john lifted millie in his arms and kissed her for next to his wife nearest his heart was the younger brother the younger brother and grace were sitting on the stoop of the boardinghouse on the upper steps in their shirtsleeves were the other boarders so the bride and bridegroom spoke in whispers the air of the cross street was stale and stagnant from it rose exhalations of rotting fruit the gases of an open subway the smoke of passing taxicabs but between the street and the hall bedroom with its odors of a gasstove and a kitchen the choice was difficult weve got to cool off somehow the young husband was saying or you wont sleep shall we treat ourselves to icecream sodas or a trip on the weehawken ferryboat the ferryboat begged the girl where we can get away from all these people a taxicab with a trunk in front whirled into the street kicked itself to a stop and the head clerk and millie spilled out upon the pavement they talked so fast and the younger brother and grace talked so fast that the boarders although they listened intently could make nothing of it they distinguished only the concluding sentences why dont you drive down to the wharf with us they heard the elder brother ask and see our royal suite but the younger brother laughed him to scorn whats your royal suite he mocked to our royal palace an hour later had the boarders listened outside the flat of the head clerk they would have heard issuing from his bathroom the cooling murmur of running water and from his gramophone the jubilant notes of alexanders ragtime band when in his private office carroll was making a present of the royal suite to the head clerk in the main office hastings the junior partner was addressing champ thorne the bond clerk he addressed him familiarly and affectionately as champ this was due partly to the fact that twentysix years before thorne had been christened champneys and to the coincidence that he had captained the football eleven of one of the big three to the championship champ said mr hastings last month when you asked me to raise your salary the reason i didnt do it was not because you didnt deserve it but because i believed if we gave you a raise youd immediately get married the shoulders of the exfootball captain rose aggressively he snorted with indignation and why should i not get married he demanded youre a fine one to talk youre the most offensively happy married man i ever met perhaps i know i am happy better than you do reproved the junior partner but i know also that it takes money to support a wife you raise me to a hundred a week urged champ and ill make it support a wife whether it supports me or not a month ago continued hastings we could have promised you a hundred but we didnt know how long we could pay it we didnt want you to rush off and marry some fine girl some fine girl muttered mr thorne the finest girl the finer the girl hastings pointed out the harder it would have been for you if we had failed and you had lost your job the eyes of the young man opened with sympathy and concern is it as bad as that he murmured hastings sighed happily it was he said but this morning the young man of wall street did us a good turn saved us saved our creditors saved our homes saved our honor were going to start fresh and pay our debts and we agreed the first debt we paid would be the small one we owe you youve brought us more than weve given and if youll stay with us were going to see your fifty and raise it a hundred what do you say young mr thorne leaped to his feet what he said was wheren hells my hat but by the time he had found the hat and the door he mended his manners i say thank you a thousand times he shouted over his shoulder excuse me but ive got to go ive got to break the news to he did not explain to whom he was going to break the news but hastings must have guessed for again he sighed happily and then a little hysterically laughed aloud several months had passed since he had laughed aloud in his anxiety to break the news champ thorne almost broke his neck in his excitement he could not remember whether the red flash meant the elevator was going down or coming up and sooner than wait to find out he started to race down eighteen flights of stairs when fortunately the elevatordoor swung open you get five dollars he announced to the elevator man if you drop to the street without a stop beat the speed limit act like the building is on fire and youre trying to save me before the roof falls senator barnes and his entire family which was his daughter barbara were at the ritzcarlton they were in town in august because there was a meeting of the directors of the brazil and cuyaba rubber company of which company senator barnes was president it was a secret meeting those directors who were keeping cool at the edge of the ocean had been summoned by telegraph those who were steaming across the ocean by wireless up from the equator had drifted the threat of a scandal sickening grim terrible as yet it burned beneath the surface giving out only an odor but an odor as rank as burning rubber itself at any moment it might break into flame for the directors was it the better wisdom to let the scandal smoulder and take a chance or to be the first to give the alarm the first to lead the way to the horror and stamp it out it was to decide this that in the heat of august the directors and the president had foregathered champ thorne knew nothing of this he knew only that by a miracle barbara barnes was in town that at last he was in a position to ask her to marry him that she would certainly say she would that was all he cared to know a year before he had issued his declaration of independence before he could marry he told her he must be able to support a wife on what he earned without her having to accept money from her father and until he received a minimum wage of five thousand dollars they must wait what is the matter with my fathers money barbara had demanded thorne had evaded the direct question there is too much of it he said do you object to the way he makes it insisted barbara because rubber is most useful you put it in golf balls and auto tires and galoches there is nothing so perfectly respectable as galoches and what is there tainted about a raincoat thorne shook his head unhappily its not the finished product to which i refer he stammered its the way they get the raw material they get it out of trees said barbara then she exclaimed with enlightenment oh she cried you are thinking of the congo there it is terrible that is slavery but there are no slaves on the amazon the natives are free and the work is easy they just tap the trees the way the farmers gather sugar in vermont father has told me about it often thorne had made no comment he could abuse a friend if the friend were among those present but denouncing any one he disliked as heartily as he disliked senator barnes was a public service he preferred to leave to others and he knew besides that if the father she loved and the man she loved distrusted each other barbara would not rest until she learned the reason why one day in a newspaper barbara read of the puju mayo atrocities of the indian slaves in the jungles and back waters of the amazon who are offered up as sacrifices to red rubber she carried the paper to her father what it said her father told her was untrue and if it were true it was the first he had heard of it senator barnes loved the good things of life but the thing he loved most was his daughter the thing he valued the highest was her good opinion so when for the first time she looked at him in doubt he assured her he at once would order an investigation but of course he added it will be many months before our agents can report on the amazon news travels very slowly in the eyes of his daughter the doubt still lingered i am afraid she said that that is true that was six months before the directors of the brazil and cuyaba rubber company were summoned to meet their president at his rooms in the ritzcarlton they were due to arrive in half an hour and while senator barnes awaited their coming barbara came to him in her eyes was a light that helped to tell the great news it gave him a sharp jealous pang he wanted at once to play a part in her happiness to make her grateful to him not alone to this stranger who was taking her away so fearful was he that she would shut him out of her life that had she asked for half his kingdom he would have parted with it and besides giving my consent said the rubber king for which no one seems to have asked what can i give my little girl to make her remember her old father some diamonds to put on her head or pearls to hang around her neck or does she want a vacant lot on fifth avenue the lovely hands of barbara rested upon his shoulders her lovely face was raised to his her lovely eyes were appealing and a little frightened what would one of those things cost asked barbara the question was eminently practical it came within the scope of the senators understanding after all he was not to be cast into outer darkness his smile was complacent he answered airily anything you like he said a million dollars the fingers closed upon his shoulders the eyes still frightened still searched his in appeal then for my weddingpresent said the girl i want you to take that million dollars and send an expedition to the amazon and i will choose the men men unafraid men not afraid of fever or sudden death not afraid to tell the truth even to you and all the world will know and they i mean you will set those people free senator barnes received the directors with an embarrassment which he concealed under a manner of just indignation my mind is made up he told them existing conditions cannot continue and to that end at my own expense i am sending an expedition across south america it will investigate punish and establish reforms i suggest on account of this damned heat we do now adjourn that night over on long island carroll told his wife all or nearly all he did not tell her about the automatic pistol and together on tiptoe they crept to the nursery and looked down at their sleeping children when she rose from her knees the mother said but how can i thank him by him she meant the young man of wall street you never can thank him said carroll thats the worst of it but after a long silence the mother said i will send him a photograph of the children do you think he will understand down at seabright hastings and his wife walked in the sunken garden the moon was so bright that the roses still held their color i would like to thank him said the young wife she meant the young man of wall street but for him we would have lost this her eyes caressed the garden the fruittrees the house with wide hospitable verandas tomorrow i will send him some of these roses said the young wife will he understand that they mean our home at a scandalously late hour in a scandalous spirit of independence champ thorne and barbara were driving around central park in a taxicab how strangely the lord moves his wonders to perform misquoted barbara had not the young man of wall street saved mr hastings mr hastings could not have raised your salary you would not have asked me to marry you and had you not asked me to marry you father would not have given me a weddingpresent and and said champ taking up the tale thousands of slaves would still be buried in the jungles hidden away from their wives and children and the light of the sun and their fellow men they still would be dying of fever starvation tortures he took her hand in both of his and held her fingertips against his lips and they will never know he whispered when their freedom comes that they owe it all to you on hunters island jimmie reeder and his bunkie sam sturges each on his canvas cot tossed and twisted the heat the moonlight and the mosquitoes would not let them even think of sleep that was bully said jimmie what you did today about saving that dog if it hadnt been for you hed ha drownded he would not said sammy with punctilious regard for the truth it wasnt deep enough well the scoutmaster ought to know argued jimmie he said it was the best one good turn of the day modestly sam shifted the limelight so that it fell upon his bunkie ill bet he declared loyally your one good turn was a better one jimmie yawned and then laughed scornfully me he scoffed i didnt do nothing i sent my sister to the movies
