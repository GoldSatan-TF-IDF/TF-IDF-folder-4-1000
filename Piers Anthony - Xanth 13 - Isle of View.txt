chapter chexs challenge chex was desperate her darling foal che was lost and she feared the worst he was only five years old and though he had her lightening magic his wings were not yet developed enough for flight so he contented himself with extraordinary leaps and was a happy little centaur now inexplicably gone how could it have happened she had been inside their cottage stall using rushes to close the crevices that let the draft in they were near the region of the element of air and often there was some leakage of wind from it that was fine on hot days but chill at night so she used the rushes but she had to work quickly and pay close attention because they were always in such a hurry they would wedge into any place not waiting for the right one so she had concentrated and gotten the job done and somehow hadnt checked on che for a while now he was nowhere to be found she had called to him and flown all around the glade searching with increasing alarm there was no doubt he was not here cheiron was away at a winged monster convention and wouldnt be home for another two days she was almost relieved how could she face her mate with the news that she had lost their foal of course she couldnt do that she simply had to find che soon she circled the region several times peering down intently but all she saw was forest around the glade she had liked this region because it was private with the trees hiding most of what went on but now they were hiding her foal from her she had to get under the canopy of foliage she glided down and landed near the cottage then she trotted in a complete circle around the glade looking for signs the ground was pretty well scuffed in the center where che had been prancing but the grass remained green at the fringe he must have wandered out into the forest though he knew he was supposed to stay in view of the cottage she made another circuit this time walking at the verge of the trees suddenly she spied a little hoofprint she saw that it was headed out into the forest he had come this way but why che knew the rule and had always been a good little centaur he knew that there were dangers out in the deep forest of xanth such as dragons and tangle trees and hypnogourds he shouldnt have walked out this way yet evidently he had she searched out the prints they seemed hesitant at first as if he had been looking for something then they became purposeful and moved straight toward the thickest section of the forest chex followed her alarm increasing she had hoped that che had merely wandered and was somewhere close by perhaps caught in a bramble and unable to extricate himself but now she feared something worse he had gone somewhere and that could only be because something had lured him there was unlikely to be any good purpose in that in a moment her worst suspicion was confirmed there were signs of an ambush something had been lurking here waiting for che and had captured him there was a bit of cut vine evidently used to tie up the foal and the ground was scuffed but something had gone over the ground with a brush from a nearby brush bush and wiped out all the tracks she couldnt tell who or what had kidnapped her foal all she knew was that it had been accomplished quickly and silently she searched all around but there were no tracks of any kind leading from the ambush area yet this was not a spot for flying by any creature large enough to carry a little centaur the vines were tangled in with the foliage of the trees with several hangmans nooses just waiting for some unwary dragon or griffin to make their day it was as if kidnapper and foal had vanished at this spot chex shuddered that meant magic che must have been conjured to some other part of xanth but why she could understand a predator crunching its prey awful as that concept was in this case but to lure che into a trap and conjure him away what use could anyone have for a winged centaur foal who couldnt yet fly at least it meant he was alive she had suppressed her fear of the worst because it was unbearable but how long would he remain alive maybe his captor didnt realize that he couldnt fly and when it found out she had to get help che had to be found before anything worse happened to him she trotted back to the glade then spread her wings flicked herself hard with her tail and took off she could make anything light by flicking it with her tail that was how she got rid of biting flies the moment her tail touched them they became too light to remain sitting and were launched into the air where they had to buzz for some time to get things under control again when she wanted to make herself light enough to fly she used her tail on her body and then it was easy for her wings to carry the reduced weight when the effect faded and she began to get heavy she just flicked herself again but she tried not to do that near the end of a flight because it could be hard to stay on the ground if a gust of wind came along she flew high above the forest and turned south soon she was passing over the great gap chasm where princess ivys friend stanley steamer had gone for patrol duty she knew the kidnapper wouldnt have taken che in there because stanley knew che and would have steamed anyone who tried to harm him but where had che been taken that was the awful mystery she continued south heading for castle roogna that was where king dor was and if anyone could help he could he was able to talk to inanimate things so nothing was secret from him she spied the castle with its pretty stonework and turrets and glided down for a landing in the orchard there was a young woman there gathering fruit and chex knew who that would be chex the girl called waving violently she had freckles and light brown hair in two braids and seemed younger than she was because she acted younger she looked fifteen electra chex responded as her feet touched the turf then she braced herself sure enough electra came charging in for a hug she collided with chex her impact shoving the light centaur back it was awkward but exuberance was electras second nature maybe even her first nature she was prince dolphs betrothee and a wonderful girl but wheres che electra asked her freckled face concerned for an instant chex had almost forgotten her misery now it returned with force hes gone she said something kidnapped him i must get help to find him before here she found herself unable to continue thats terrible electra exclaimed you must tell the king as if that wasnt the reason chex had come here yes i must chex said they walked on up to the castle oh i forgot electra exclaimed her braids flinging about her head as she turned to face chex king dors away away chex asked alarmed where ceremonial call on king nabob of the naga oh whats the ceremony well they are allies and maybe soon therell be reason for getting together nada you know suddenly chex appreciated the girls diffidence nada naga was prince dolphs other betrothee and in her human form a truly lovely young lady it had been a political liaison but everyone knew that dolph preferred the princess nada to electra the time was approaching when dolph would have to make his choice between the two and it did not look good for electra she was a wonderful girl but nada was a beautiful princess unfortunately electra was under an enchantment not only did she love dolph who had rescued her from a very long sleep she would die if she didnt marry him no one wanted that there was a further irony nada did not love dolph she was five years older than he and regarded him as a juvenile but she had given her word and intended to carry through in the manner required of a princess it was obvious to everyone that dolph could make both girls happy by marrying electrabut that would not make dolph happy and he was not adult enough to do what he didnt like it was a difficult situation however chex had a pressing problem of her own at the moment then queen irene she went with him she wanted to meet king nabob and nadas handsome big brother naldo then princess ivy shes off with grey murphy at the good magicians castle there must be somebody in charge chex exclaimed exasperated oh sure magician murphy then id better see him chex wasnt quite satisfied with this as she had never completely trusted murphy but she couldnt wait for one of the others to return to the palace magician murphy was a graying but otherwise ordinary older man yes i can help you centaur he said first i will organize a search for your missing foal second i will set my curse on the party responsible for the abduction so that that effort will foul up in devious ways that should provide additional time for the searchers to complete their mission this was more than chex had expected of this man but she reminded herself that on occasion evil magicians did become good ones king emeritus trent was the most notable example murphy had sworn to uphold the current order and if king dor trusted him she could do no less thank you magician she said murphy spoke to a magic mirror now hear this he said this is king protern murphy speaking chex centaurs foal has been abducted by a party unknown and must be found and rescued asap all personnel not otherwise occupied get your butts to the castle pronto for organization into search parties that is all chex listened with a certain surprise evidently murphy had picked up some mundanish terms during his exile however his general meaning came through they walked to the front of the castle from every direction folk were coming shoe tree farmers milkweed maids p and q nut growers and even a young ogre who was evidently tired of twisting trees into pretzels some were coming from the castle too prince dolph nada naga grundy golem and a ghost or two there was even a puff of steam from the direction of the gap chasm stanley steamer was coming in it seemed that everyone wanted to help very well murphy said when a suitable group had assembled we have no idea where che may have been taken but we have reason to believe that nothing bad will happen to him for a while our best course is to cover as much of xanth as we can in the next few hours because it is not safe for folk to go alone into the jungle he paused for the ogre was looking perplexed ogres excepted of course he said and the ogres confusion eased most parties will consist of two or more folk at least one of whom should be able to defend them until help can come here are magic whistles from the castle armory these can be heard far and wide so each person will carry one and use it if threatened he passed out the whistles the ogre being typically stupid blew his immediately but there was no sound startled the ogre looked up me blow hear no thats because you arent far or wide yet murphy explained we are all standing close and narrow which is out of range try it from far the ogre charged to the horizon knocking down a stray tree accidentally he blew again this time the sound was piercing soon the parties were organized and heading out in every direction grundy will go with you chex murphy said you can act as liaison between the search parties so that you will be the first to know if your foal is found grundy will help you by questioning any plants or creatures as needed first think you should question the plants in the vicinity of the abduction they must have seen something yes chex said feeling foolish because she hadnt thought of that herself murphy was doing a great job grundy scrambled up on her back he was a tiny man easy to carry even without lightening he had been a real golem originally made of rag and string and wood but now he was a real man though still the original size one other thing had not changed he still had a big mouth and made enemies with an ease that left others awestruck chex flicked herself spread her wings and took off she was glad to have such an efficient search proceeding if anything could find che this would wheres rapunzel she inquired as they flew north for grundy had finally found in her a woman to his taste or maybe it was the other way around rapunzel could assume any size she wished being descended from both human and elven stock but preferred small she was a lovely lady withoh yesmagically long hair chex didnt envy her the chore of brushing it normally grundy and rapunzel were together shes seeing about a new house he said oh i thought you were satisfied with that birdhouse you converted i am but she says its too small too small but you havent changed and she can be any size she wants grundy shrugged i dont understand women do you chex laughed no but then she got a faint notion and began to understand the two of them might remain small but if the family changed sizes she glided down to the glade it had been her home for several years because she hadnt wanted to risk having che fall off the edge of a mountain before he was able to fly now it seemed alien because it had turned out to be unsafe in another way whoever or whatever had kidnapped her foalwould it have been possible had che lived in a mountain retreat just how smart had she been to avoid the mountain she trotted into the forest where che had been lost here she said coming to a halt at the place grundy talked to the plants in the vicinity chex heard only a faint rustling but in a moment he had his report there was an awful smell as of pastry baking and thats not awful she protested che loved fresh pastry whats it made from the golem asked why fresh flour from sea oats and oh for of course plants like oats would not like the smell of their brethren being baked breadfruit trees and pie trees did not mind giving up their wares but when grains were stripped from the plants it was another matter an awful smell she agreed the foal sniffed it and followed it right here grundy said but here there was only a bit of cloud an evil fog the smell came from that the foal went in and there was the sound of a struggle and then the fog lifted and nothing remained the plants didnt see what happened only that che went in and didnt come out magic chex exclaimed other centaurs often didnt like magic she had thought them oldfashioned and unrealistic but now she was beginning to appreciate their view magic had taken her foal from her must have been and that fog sounds like fracto hes always interested in doing something nasty fracto she cried remembering the worst of clouds it was true wherever there was mischief to be done there was fracto we should search him out and make him talk we might find him but even if we spoke his language he probably wouldnt tell grundy pointed out he was right there was no point in giving fracto the satisfaction they would have to find some other way to investigate this was evidently a pretty sophisticated abduction it had been set up so that it could not readily be traced why such an effortfor one flightless little centaur it didnt seem to make a lot of sense they left the forest and took off from the glade chex was mystified and dispirited the early shock of the loss was wearing off and being replaced by the grim certainty that there would be no easy resolution she still had no idea where che had been taken we had better see how the others are doing grundy said sounding dispirited himself che has to be somewhere he was trying to cheer her and successfully failing but it was good advice anyway she was supposed to be the liaison between the teams closest is the ogre grundy announced it seemed that he had a list of the assignments checking the goblinate of the golden horde the golden horde chex exclaimed horrified those terrible goblins theyre your closest evil neighbors to the west he pointed out they certainly were they liked to catch creatures and torture them before cooking mem they lived around a hate spring which perhaps accounted for their extreme meanness if che had fallen into their grubby hands it was good that the ogre was going there an ogre knew how to handle goblins it was said that goblins who attacked an ogre would find some of their number orbiting the moonand those were the lucky ones still if they had che the foal could get bashed right along with the goblins because ogres were justifiably proud of their stupidity she angled west soon she observed a path of trees being knocked down as the ogre traveled the only way he knew howstraight ahead bashing any obstacles out of the way the average tree didnt like the average ogre much but didnt have much choice about contact if the ogre came its way some trees however did fight back like the tanglers it was said that an ogretangler battle was worth watching from a distance she flew on past the ogre to the goblin camp the goblins spied her and shook their little fists at her but there was no sign of che that was reassuring unless they cooked him already grundy remarked chex almost fell out of the sky what a genius the golem had for the wrong thought but they dont have a pot going grundy continued they couldnt have done it in his time maybe it was the right thought after all he was right there was no smoke no fire so either che had not been cooked or he wasnt here at all she wasnt sure which to hope for she flew back to the ogre theyre right ahead she called keep an eye out for the foal me goal save foal he agreed well he had the right attitude but she felt better now that it seemed unlikely that the foal was there next group is human checking the centaur village north of the gap grundy said chex knew why no centaurs were participating in the search they did not accept her as one of them indeed they considered her a monstrosity a degenerate crossbreed she had been welcomed by the winged monsters but not by her own kind but she tried not to dwell on that there was nothing to be gained by it in time there might be an established species of winged centaurs needing no affiliations with the groundbound centaurs just as the winged dragons survived nicely independent of the land dragons but not if che was lost the human party consisted of three milkweed maids they must have been given some kind of speedup spell because they could not have gotten this far mis fast otherwise they were crossing the invisible bridge seeming to be in midair and giggling as they teased each other about what monster below might be seeing up whose skirt there was no monster below the gap dragon had joined the search effort but milkweed maids tended to be silly anyway it was said to be one of the features that made them attractive to men chex did not quite understand that but of course she wasnt human she swooped low have you seen anything she called just trees one called but we havent started looking yet because our assignment is the centaur village someone else is checking the forest south of the gap good luck chex said but she didnt think che would be at the centaur village because though the centaurs did not approve of winged crossbreeds they were honorable folk who would not interfere they would not have cared to use so much magic either or to conceal their activity for pride was a centaurs nature they continued their check of the various parties they were all searching diligently but without any success to stave off her developing gloom chex pondered her relationship with che it had all started with her wedding really she had met cheiron the only other winged centaur in xanth and probably would have fallen in love with him even if he hadnt been handsome and strong and smart and experienced they had agreed to matethe human folk called it marriageand the simurgh herself had flown in to officiate the simurgh was the largest and oldest of birds who had seen the destruction and regeneration of the universe three times and was probably good for one or two more times she had handled things competently of course and made one passing reference that astonished chex and cheiron from this union she had said in her powerful mental projection will come one whose life will change the course of the history of xanth then she had required all the attending winged monsters and even prince dolph who had managed to sneak in by assuming the form of a dragonfly to make an oath to protect that one from harm it had become clear why the simurgh had come to ensure die safety of the future foal in due course che had arrived the stork had not delivered him and he hadnt turned up under a cabbage leaf the centaurs being realistic about natural functions of all kinds had more direct if uncomfortable means of acquiring their offspring after all storks were notoriously myopic and sometimes misdelivered babies maybe that was all right for human folk but no centaur would care to risk it che was beautiful from the start with his dark brown pelt and soft little wings the winged monsters had looked out for him so that no griffin dragon roc or anything else that flew right down through harpies to little dragonflies was any threat in fact young flying dragons had flown in to play with him though he could not yet fly himself and they had spread die word to die landbound dragons the land dragons were not bound by the oath but many of them had vestigial wings and identified with their flying cousins so they were careful of che also their family had led an almost idyllic life here in the glade when she and cheiron wanted to go somewhere alone or to help some of their friends they never lacked for foalsitters even draco dragon the terror of northcentral xanth had come in once and not just because of the oath he had a special debt to the skeleton marrow bones who had saved his nestful of pretty stones and marrow was chexs friend dragons had a keen sense of loyalty to those they respected though fortunately there were not many of these so che had never lacked for company and was a happy little centaur what was it that die simurgh saw in ches future how could he change the history of xanth though chex loved him overwhelmingly she knew somewhere in the nonparental reaches of her mind that he was after all only a winged centaur tike his parents the regular centaurs would not acknowledge him at all and the human folk thought him a mere curiosity there was no indication that he was destined for greatnessor even at this moment for survival yet the simurgh would not have made a mistake she was the keeper of the seeds and there was little if anything about die tides of life she did not understand then chex had a horrible thought suppose che wasnt the one the simurgh meant he was die result of chexs union with cheiron to be sure but perhaps not die only one also it wasnt clear exactly how he was to change the history of xanth could it be by getting himself abducted and killed and setting off the winged monsters in some sort of rampage no she couldnt accept such notions she had to believe mat che would survive to grow into an adult flying centaur and that in that state he would accomplish something undreamed of in the philosophies of those who presently ignored him she had to see mat he was cared for and educated in the ways that he needed so that when the time for greatness came upon him he would be ready and surely she would do that for the simurgh would have known if che were destined for an untimely end someone had kidnapped himtechnically kidnapping applied to little goats but it remained the best wordbut would not kill him and they would rescue him and the prophecy of his greatness would be back on track that was the way it had to be reassured for what she realized might not be a fully objective reason chex flew on her round checking the search parties that were radiating from castle roogna grundy knew where all of them were approximately and when they werent quite where he expected the neighborhood plants were glad to give him reports they came to a party consisting of two pretty young women nada and electra they were going to the good magicians castle to ask him where che was chex was ashamed to admit that she hadnt thought of that obvious method the good magician traditionally knew everything and told it for the price of a years service of course the original good magician humfrey wasnt there now but his apprentice grey murphy was and he was trying hard to fill the post the princess ivy was there to enhance him when he needed it and that helped could he answer chex hoped so she went on back north of the gap where prince dolph was checking the elements the elements were five special regions in north central xanth air earth fire water and the void each was dangerous in its own way as chex knew well from her nearness to air but dolph could assume any living form that meant he could become a creature that could handle any element he entered so that he could explore it safely she didnt see him which was probably good it meant he was in some other form deep in an element and if che had been taken there dolph would find him and probably rescue him she had completed the circuit all the search parties were busy but none had found che she would have to stop at her cabin and rest and eat before going out on another circuit she would keep doing this until she had risen to this horrible challenge mat of finding and rescuing her foal as she came down she saw something in the clearing was it che her heart leaped which caused her body to rise and almost made her overshoot her landing but it was not it was only a little elf girl her heart sank which caused her to drop and almost undershoot her landing she came down solidly on all fours and folded her wings then she approached the elf who was staring at her as if astonished who are you she inquired what are you doing so far from your elm the elf scuffled her feet she was young a child really yet was unusually large for the elves chex had seen a normal elf stood a quarter the height of a normal human being while this one was half human height she had a turnedup nose a few freckles spattered across her cheeks and ragged brown hair that couldnt quite make up its mind between chestnut and butter her eyes were brown and seemed nearsighted that reminded chex of amolde centaur and good magician humfrey who used spectacles to correct their visionwhich was even odder because shed never met either of them my cat the elf child said but elves dont have cats chex protested in fact nobody does there are no straight cats in xanth only punnish variants like the catoninetails xanth the girl asked seeming perplexed chex was tired and in a hurry but she realized that something was wrong here yes xanth where we all live dont try to tell me youre from mundania no im from the world of two moons my cat i told you there are no then chex saw the cat he was an orange fluff ball that did seem to have an elven cast to his features he was lying stretched out on the ground tail extended behind looking like nothing so much as a speed bump a hump in the trail designed to trip up speeding centaurs how she asked somewhat at a loss something strange here grundy murmured there are no elf elms close by she should be too weak to stand and look at the size of her shes as big as a goblin sammy can find anything except home the elf said only usually i never know what hes looking for so he gets lost i have to keep up with him so i can bring him back after he finds it she paused looking at the cat i mink he was looking for a feather this time indeed the cat had a feather between his tawny paws thats not just a feather chex said thats a firstmolt wing feather from my foal che there are very few like it anywhere i guess he wanted a special feather then the elf said then seemingly with an effort she raised her face to look at chex if you dont mind please could you tell me what are you chex was taken aback i am a flying centaur of course a winged monster technically havent you ever seen a centaur before the girl shook her head no your elm must be far from civilization whats an elm a tree of course we dont have many trees in the world of two moons at least not ones i can see well she looked around blinking are those trees yes of course its alt forested here but how can you not have an elm all elves i dont have an elm not even a wolf friend though i think one day i will be with lone wolf so right now i just have a cat the girl said who finds things but gets lost which is how i met him because there arent any others like him in our worldand this time i think im lost too because this is a very strange place but all elves are associated with elms chex protested where did you say you were from my holt is at your what my holt its chex realized that something was not merely odd it was decidedly strange just as grundy had said i think we had better start over lets introduce ourselves you are jenny of the world of two moons and i am chex centaur of xanth now i think we should she broke off because she had noticed something even stranger are those your ears the child touched her left ear yes is something wrong its pointed jenny was perplexed arent yours no cant you see your head is sort of fuzzy from here so it was true the elf could not see well at a distance my dear we must get you some spectacles chex said it was as if she had to mother someone while her foal was missing we have a spectacle bush here and we havent harvested any of its fruit so there are plenty she led the elf to it they correct vision and fit magically of course here try this pair she picked it and set it on jennys face carefully it was rather big for her but the side pieces closed around her head and hooked behind her phenomenally pointed ears her hair had masked the effect somewhat before but now there was no doubt there were no ears in xanth like that not on humanoid folk jennys eyes grew even bigger than they naturally were magnified by the spectacles i can see everything she exclaimed amazed well of course thats what spectacles do they enable you to see every spectacle in sight im surprised you didnt have a pair before there are none at home jenny said lifting a hand to touch the amazing device chex was surprised yet again your handyoure missing a finger jenny looked at her hand no im not all four are there but other elves have five fingers chex protested all humanoids do see i have five she held forth her hand jenny stared how odd youre really not from xanth chex said realizing why the girl was confusedyou look like an elf but youre quite different in detail jenny shrugged i guess you can call me an elf if you want she said im just a person really yes of course but here in xanth you are considered an elf how did you get here i didnt see which made sense how could she have seen where she was going if she could not make out details of the landscape as she passed them she was as lost as che i think you will have to stay here until we find out what happened chex decided you are here looking for a feather and i am looking for the one that feather came from my lost foal che now perhaps we should but she broke off because at that point the little cat came alive and bolted for the forest sammy jenny cried running after him wait for me youll get lost again jenny chex cried in turn youll both get lost that forests dangerous but cat and elf were already disappearing into the jungle heedless of the danger chex realized that they must have come through it somehow escaping the predators wed better find her grundy said maybe its coincidence that she appeared right when che disappeared but maybe not chex hadnt thought of that could her foal have been turned into no impossible but it was true that this was a remarkably strange business she trotted to the center of the glade spread her wings and leaped into the air as she smacked her body with her tail in a moment she was climbing up past the trees she mew over them in the direction the elf girl had gone but the canopy was too thick and she could see neither the ground nor anything on it they were gone we can alert the others about the elf grundy said if she really is from elsewhere she cant stay hidden long chex agreed but remained disquieted why should a strange elf girl show up here right at this time she looped about and glided back to the glade she had better things to do than loop helplessly around the forest she had to find che and could not afford to waste her time or energy pursuing strangers but it was certainly a curious encounter chapter jennys journey jenny ran after the cat wait for me youll get lost again but of course sammy didnt listen he never did he wasnt trying to run away from her he just got so caught up in whatever he was chasing that he tost track of everything else and often got himself into trouble she couldnt let that happen they were already in a very strange region and if it got any stranger they might never find their way out sammy plunged into the thickest foliage of the jungle jenny had no choice but to plunge in after him though the brush threatened to ruin whatever remained of her clothing it was bad enough getting her hair all tangled in a knot from burrs and things in her desperate effort to keep up if she ever lost sight of him she might never catch him again she heard the centaur lady calling after her that forests dangerous that was the strangest looking creature jenny had ever seen like an animaland a bird and a woman all jammed together but she seemed nice she had a foal she had said which meant she was somebodys mother and that was a good sign mothers were a class unto themselves a good class it had been very nice of her to find the magic spectacles jenny had never known such things existed they made all the difference in this strange world but she just couldnt stay and talk when sammy was taking off she tore through the brush and in a moment spied sammy ahead of her running up a slope dodging around bushes that grew pretty colored pillows pillows that was crazy pillows didnt grow on bushes they had to be made of bird down and cloth sewn together and all when the hunters and their wolf friends brought back birds for eating they always saved the feathers nothing was wasted but those certainly did look like pillows growing sammy ran on over a ridge and down the other side here there were cornlike plants with their ears getting ripe jenny brushed by one and it exploded sending bits of puffed corn out it was popcorn she snatched some out of the air and stuffed it in her mouth because she was hungry after chasing sammy this far now the cat got on a nice little path through the jungle leading to a giant tree with hanging tentacles no sammy jenny cried in alarm she had seen one of those trees before the tentacles had tried to grab her and she had been lucky to escape them in fact she had lost her knife in the process which upset her considerably don t go near that tree at least now she could recognize it from a distance instead of blundering into it she would have to thank chex for the spectacles once sammy stopped and they could go back sammy jumped off the path and scrambled back through the thick brush for once jenny was glad for that she didnt want him getting caught by that dreadful thing they came to a region of larger but more peaceful trees and it was easier going here because the thick leaf cover above shaded the ground and there wasnt much brush sammy slowed to a fast walk but didnt stop moving she could keep up but not catch him she would just have to follow until he found what he was looking for this time and then see what to do next she was tired but still had no choice she just couldnt let sammy get even worse lost alone as she hurried along she thought about how she had come to this weird region she was just an ordinary girl of her holt nothing special at all in fact she was unspecial because she just couldnt see well without sending she would have been in constant trouble she liked to paint and weave and make jewelry and was learning how to decorate pottery those hearthside skills did not suffer from her myopia she hoped to grow up to be a good weaver making rugs of special beauty with designs and pictures that every elf would want she also liked to make berry pie mainly because she liked to eat it so much the main problem there was all the time it took to pick the berries because the berry patches close to the village were all picked out and she had to range fairly far afield and that was hard because she was lost the moment she strayed from the main paths she couldnt count the times she had had to call for help mentally just to find the path again when she got a wolf friend she would be able to go out farther more safely for now she had her cat friend instead and she could do her hearthside practicing her fingers were long and nimble but she still had a lot of skill to develop while she practiced with these things alone she liked to sing to herself she always stopped when any other elf was near enough to hear of course but sammy liked it and that was most of what counted she had gone out looking for berries in the cool morning with sammy the cat had seemed bored the truth was he wasnt much interested in berries if i had a feather id tickle your whiskers jenny said teasingly then the cat had taken off and she had known she had to follow no matter what because when he got into one of his moods and set out in pursuit of something he didnt stop until he found it she had no idea how far the chase was to take him this time he had cut through a section of the forest she was unfamiliar with it was said to be haunted but she doubted it spirits normally didnt waste time with simple trees mainly she was afraid of poisonous serpents or other hungry wild things that would be lurking to gobble sammy or her yet she had to keep going lest sammy be lost she ran and ran her vision blurring as she struggled to keep up all she saw was sammys fleeting tail and bits of scenery whizzing by she was better at seeing motion than things otherwise she wouldnt have had a chance to stay near sammy then suddenly the cat went over a ridge and she followed and discovered that there was no other side to it she flailed in air for a moment too scared to scream then her feet touched ground again it had only been a slight drop shrouded by fog she ran on still barely keeping the cat in sight but now the scenery was strange she didnt have time to stop and examine it closely but she knew this wasnt like anything she had seen before she would have to come to this forest some time when she wasnt chasing her cat to see just what there was about it that was so different sammy skirted an odd green tree jenny ran by itand the tentacles snapped up and tried to grab her one hung on to her flaring dress and as she tried to pull free others grabbed her but she drew her knife and sliced the awful green things and was able to pull free unfortunately her knife got caught in the last tentacle and she lost it that was her first experience with the aggressive tree and the confirmation that she had wandered into a very strange region then sammy scampered into a clearing in the forest and stopped he had finally found what he was looking for a big white feather you dragged me all the way here for a stupid feather she demanded not really angry with him but having to exclaim about something to someone before she burst the truth was that she was frightened by the strangeness of this region and still shaken by the way that tree had grabbed for her she had never even heard of a kind of tree that did that but now she realized that mis business had started with her because she had teased sammy about tickling him with a feather he had oriented on feather and gone in search of oneand what a feather he had found a shadow had descended and the amazing animalbirdlady came down she seemed almost as surprised to see jenny as jenny was to see her she said she was a checked centaur or something and talked about elms jenny learned that an elm was a tree she wasnt sure why the centaur thought she should have something to do with it the centaur lady was looking for her lost foal called chay but jenny hadnt learned any more because sammy had suddenly taken off again and she had had to follow she hoped it wasnt going to get even stranger because she wasnt at all sure she could find their way back as it was now sammy slowed maybe he was approaching what he sought maybe it was another feather and she could carry it for him and they could go home no not another feather because he never looked for the same thing twice in a row maybe a jenny paused amazed there ahead of them was a little winged centaur that must be the foal the centaur lady had said she was looking for it and sammy had taken off to find it just like that but the poor thing hadnt just wandered away he was a captive there was a rope around his neck and his hands were tied behind his back and his legs were hobbled so that he could hardly stand he was fluttering his wings helplessly and he looked very unhappy that was all jenny needed to see she knew she had to help chay get back to his mother however there were mean creatures around the foal they looked a bit like people and were her own size but their heads hands and feet were larger and knobby they were dark and their scowls were darker there were three of them evidently guarding the foal they werent doing anything to him but it was obvious that they would if he made any real effort to escape jenny put her hand on sammys back he had paused satisfied not to go farther now that he had spotted what he had come for we have to rescue chay from those mean folk she whispered i could untie him so he could run but theyd only tie me up too i wish i had something to make them go away just long enough sammy took off no she whispercried i didnt mean for you to but of course it was too late as it always was with sammy when would she learn not to speak carelessly when he was listening well there was no help for it she had to follow him though it delayed whatever action she might take to free the foal maybe that wasnt too much of a loss because she had no idea how to free him still she hardly needed distractions right now sammy led her to a tree it had bright green leaves and bright red berries berries no those were cherries it was a cherry tree but she was in no mood to eat right now what possessed you to come here when i said i needed something to make the mean little men go away she asked the cat knowing he couldnt answer he merely stood by the tree ignoring it now that he had found it his joy was in the search once he found whatever he sought he usually did ignore it perplexed she reached up to pluck a cherry it was round and red but evidently not ripe because its skin was hard not soft she touched her teeth to it but could not dent it the thing was like a wooden ball she plucked another it was just as bad these couldnt be real cherries maybe they were there just to fool hungry peopleand she was a hungry person even though she didnt want to eat at the moment suddenly she was angry not only did she not want to eat these cherries would be no good if she did want to she hurled the two as far away from her as she could they arced past the trees and came to the ground boom boom jenny stared the two cherries hadnt bounced or rolled they had exploded there were two small craters in the ground where they had hit and dirt and leaves were scattered around amazed she looked at the tree cherries that exploded and she had tried to bite into one suppose it had exploded when then something clicked in her head sammy had led her here and maybe this was why what would happen if she threw a cherry at the mean men jenny smiled she did not regard herself as a mean person but she thought maybe she could be mean for just a short time if she tried she gathered a number of cherries and put them carefullyvery carefullyin her pockets she carried two in her hands too then she walked quietly back to where she had seen the mean men she hoped they hadnt heard the two explosions the cherry tree was some distance away so maybe they hadnt she was in luck the party remained exactly as it had been before the mean men seemed to be waiting for something and of course the foal couldnt do anything now she had to plan this carefully she had to drive off the men then run down and untie the foal so he could run away his mother had talked to her so probably he could too she would tell him what she was doing with luck he would get away before the mean men knew what happened jenny was scared but that didnt stop her she just had to rescue that foal she nerved herself clenched her teeth and hurled a cherry bomb down toward the party she had a pretty good arm and now she could really see where she was throwing she aimed it so that the cherry wouldnt actually hit anyone just land nearby it worked perfectly the bomb exploded right behind one of the mean men he jumped right off the ground his stubby legs running while he was still in the air he thought somebody was attacking himwhich was the general idea jenny threw another bomb this one detonated behind one of the other men and he ran off too it was such a joy to see what she was doing the foal was also alarmed but he couldnt run because of the hobble so he just stood there looking scared jenny dug a bomb out of her pocket and threw it behind the third mean man he was already running away and this made him run faster in a moment all three were gone jenny ran down to the foal dont be frightened chay she called im here to help you of course he was frightened but maybe this made him less so she reached him panting let me untie your hands she gasped i dont know how much time we have she worked on the knot but it was very tight she was good with knots but knots were ornery things and it just wasnt possible to rush it slowly it came undone but that was only the hands she still needed to do the hobbles on his legs oh i wish i had a knife to cut these she exclaimed as she wrestled with the second ornery knot sammy took off but he stopped in a moment by something on the ground jenny looked it was a knife dropped by one of the fleeing men she hurried over to get it and used it to saw through first one hobble rope and then the other but then a mean man returned whats this he cried no it wasnt a mean man the voice was too high it was a mean woman she was a lot prettier than the men with head and hands and feet much smaller but of the same species maybe run chay jenny cried the little centaur took an unsteady step it was hard for him to move well after being hobbled ill help you jenny said she put her arms around his body where it changed from colt to boy trying to steady him and urge him forward an elf the mean woman exclaimed swirling her great dark tresses about in a nononsense manner well well put a stop to this she waved a wand and suddenly the foal and jenny were lifted into the air eeeek jenny screamed totally startled its her magic wand the foal said we cant escape for a moment jenny was startled back into a normal state you can talk well im five years old but you look less than one year old she said peering more closely at him we centaurs age at the human rate or maybe faster for the winged ones because of our avian heritage i think im about your age in relative terms three hands but youre not even half grown yet hands jenny showed her spread four fingers three times each finger a year she explained oh thats right youre an elf i mistook you for full human then after a pause four fingered hands jenny looked down this is interesting and we really must talk some more but right now we have to get away from that mean woman thats godiva goblin we cant get away from her as long as she has the magic wand magic wand jenny was beginning to understand the problem below sammy heard and walked toward the woman his tail twitching ominously no jenny cried afraid of what would happen to the cat if he attacked this mean creature dont tell me no godiva said i will keep you suspended until you tell me what the elves have to do with his wheres your elm as she spoke she lowered the wand and jenny and the foal came down to float just barely out of reach of the ground i dont know anything about an elm jenny protested then sammy leaped he caught die wand in his mouth and tore it out of the womans grasp jenny and the foal dropped abruptly to the ground come back with that the woman exclaimed angrily her long hair swirled around her body as she turned sammy had snatched the wand after jenny mentioned it and now the lady goblin couldnt use it against them find somewhere safe jenny called to the cat run follow that cat she cried to the foal the little centaur moved faster than before the kinks working out of his legs he began to trot jenny ran alongside her eyes on sammy it wouldnt do them much good if sammy found somewhere safe but they couldnt find him now the male goblins were returning moron idiot imbecile the woman screamed catch them get the wand back but the cat was moving swiftly and the centaur was gaining speed they got a lead before the goblins got organized sammy with something new to find forgot the wand it dropped from his mouth jenny saw it and swooped it up maybe this will stop them she said turning to wave it at the goblins nothing happened you cant use it the centaur said its attuned to lady godiva and wont work for anyone else well ill keep it anyway so she cant use it against us jenny said and ran on they plowed through more jungle running as fast as they could but the goblins kept after them every time the mean men slowed the mean woman screamed at them and made them speed up again jennys breath was rasping she was used to walking a lot and to hurrying after sammy but this was headlong running and she had already been tired from the prior chases she couldnt keep this up much longer then they came to a river it wasnt the biggest river jenny had ever heard of but it wasnt the smallest either it was a good stretch across it she knew how to swim but she wasnt sure about the foal and she was so tired that she really didnt want to try it but sammy came up to a square log raft tied beside the river what a relief sammy jumped onto the raft jenny jumped on after him and the foal after her quickly she untied the rope then lifted the pole and shoved the raft out into the water the goblins burst upon them but stopped at the waterline jenny poled frantically but the raft moved with agonizing slowness oh they can swim right across to us she gasped dismayed no they cant the centaur said but its only a little distance he pointed to a ripple in the water suddenly a slipper bobbed to the surface water moccasins he said but that looks like a shoe she pointed out it is a shoebut it bites the toes of any footed creature it catches now she saw that inside the moccasin where the toes would fit there were sharp white teeth the tongue curled slurping around the edge she wouldnt want to put her foot in that the goblins seemed just as reluctant to trust their feet to the water several water moccasins were waiting licking their rims this was after all a safe place in its dangerous way the current took the raft moving it downstream jenny relaxed not having to pole anymore what river is this she asked do you happen to know i believe it is the withacookee river the centaur said i heard the goblins say they wanted to avoid it with a cookie she asked what an odd name why would anyone call a river something like that it might be because of the cookies he replied pointing she looked and saw toadstools growing on the bank but as the raft drifted closer she saw that they were indeed cookies or something with a very similar appearance she reached out and took one fearing that it would be no more edible than the cherries had been but it turned out to be what she called a sandie sugary and crisp she sat on the raft and ate the rest of it savoring it the centaur picked one himself and tasted it very sweet he commented thats probably because of the sugar sand the what the sugar sand it is found throughout much of xanth and is excellent for growing sweets sometimes i eat it straight but my dam doesnt like that but sand isnt sweet she protested he glanced at her surprised you an elf do not know of sugar sand there is no such thing chay his brow furrowed are you addressing me jenny borrowed a notion from the foals mother i think we had better start over lets introduce ourselves you are che centaur of the winged monsters of xanth he replied promptly che i thought it was chay im sorry quite all right and you are jenny of the world of two moons where i come from the sand is made of crushed rock or something we cant eat it crushed sugar crystal he said from the big rock candy mountains i believe i gather you are not a local elf where is your elm whats all this business about elms she demanded i never saw an elm but all elves are associated with elf elms he said they never stray far from them because their vitality is inversely proportional to their distance from their home elm if you are far from yours you must be feeling quite weak now im not associated with any elm she said no elves i know are im tired yes but not weak because of any tree he pondered i assumed your land of two moons was merely one that my dam had not yet educated me about do you mean to say it is beyond xanth in another land where there are doubled moons yes my world is nothing like this one i never heard of xanth before and i find it impossibly strange all these magic things like cherries that explode and mananimals that fly she paused oh no offense none taken centaurs derive from the stock of the human folk and the horse folkand of course my kind derives also from bird folk ultimately my grandsire was a hippogryph a what you would call it a horse with the head of a bird jenny shook her head if i werent right here talking to you i think i wouldnt believe any of this but i did see your mother fly yes my dam makes herself light by flicking her body with her tail then she can fly but my wings are as yet insufficiently formed for that so i have to content myself with leaps when necessary you can make yourself light she asked surprised i can make anything light he said but of course i dont do it indiscriminately that would not be polite i wish you could make me light she said then maybe i wouldnt be so tired as you wish che flicked her shoulder with the tip of his tail immediately jenny felt quite light she got upand almost sailed off the raft i really am light she exclaimed certainly but be careful because i cannot make you heavy again my magic is oneway but the effect slowly fades jenny felt her mind spinning and not because her head was light there really was magic here practiced by ordinary folk instead of high ones and it worked on her that explained a great deal i remain unclear how you came to xanth if you are from a foreign region che said im unclear on that myself i was following sammy and when he found what he was looking forwhich was one of your featherswe were here oh that explains it sammys a magic creature no he just has an uncanny ability to find whatever he looks for isnt that magic jenny reconsidered i suppose it is certainly it is now because hes finding things much faster and better than he used to do you have a magic talent of your own me she laughed i can hardly do regular things let alone magic ones im fortunate just to see straight thanks to these nice spectacles your mother gave me do you mean to say you have not tried jenny was intrigued you mean you really think i might have some magic like making things light or heavy or something it seems possible human folk all have talents and some other creatures have them too if they have human lineage elves as a general class seem to be content with their tribal magic associated with their elms but if you are not of that type perhaps you conform to the human mode i wonder what mine could be for the first time she had found a really positive reason to be here in this weird world ohi forgot mundanes dont have magic only folk made in xanth whats a mundane a person or animal originating in the dreary nonmagic realm beyond xanth my dam does not like to speak of it but im not from there does mundania have two moons i dont think so just one moon like ours only its green cheese has calcified into inedible rock a moon made of green cheese and honey on the other side my sire and dam went to the honey moon where they conceived me perhaps that is where i obtained my taste for sweets so if im not from xanth or mundania then we dont know whether i have magic jenny concluded but if sammy has magic maybe i do too perhaps it is true che said doubtfully why did the goblins kidnap you i assume they wished to eat me eat you she exclaimed horrified but that would be mean cruel and awful true that is the nature of goblins yet i confess to bewilderment that they did not slaughter me immediately they seem to be saving me for some future occasion they certainly had you all tied up she agreed they seemed to be taking me somewhere the men are brutes of course but godiva kept them from mistreating me goblin women are much nicer than goblin men of course the fact that she was put in charge of the party suggests that something other than incidental mayhem is involved it is quite odd how did they get you didnt you know to stay away from goblins certainly i knew but they tempted me with the smell of baking pastry and i couldnt help myself if you think sugar sandies are good you should taste fresh pastry then a horrible fog surrounded me and suddenly i was all trussed up and the captive of goblins i think they had a oneway path a oneway path but all paths go both ways by no means magic paths typically are unidirectional and some can be used only once i suspect that the goblins used theirs to convey me a distance from my home glade so that my dam would not be able to follow my tracks now they have exhausted their path spell and must proceed in more ordinary fashion but they seem not to be local goblins for they do not know the local terrain godiva was exploring the region ahead when you came upon me jenny decided not to argue about the directions of paths when she saw a oneway path then she would believe it not before its funny that they ran into such trouble i would have thought they would just take you straight back where they came from that was my conjecture but apparently something malfunctioned because when they stepped off the magic path they seemed bewildered they were supposed to be on the east side of the elements and instead they were on the west side but a path cant just change where it goes ordinarily they dont but that is by no means fixed because this was a speed path the scenery around it was blurred they must have assumed that they were going in the right direction we walked for perhaps half an hour before coming to the end and then of course we had to get off and it was gone when godiva saw where we were she said something almost unladylike which is unusual for a gobliness she didnt sound ladylike to me jenny said stoutly i heard her calling the men stupid and worse no she was addressing them by their names moron idiot and imbecile stupid did not come on this mission goblins have funny names jenny said laughing he smiled i understand they consider our names to be odd too then he glanced up oh i fear trouble jenny looked but thats just a little cloud we have nothing to fear from that on the contrary that looks very much like cumulo fracto nimbus the very worst of clouds he brings mischief to all good folk and even some evil folk a cloud oh pooh but che looked extremely worried i hope you do not receive more of an education than you desire jenny elf perhaps fracto is merely passing by but the cloud was not passing by it loomed in close becoming darker and larger it seemed almost to have a nebulous face on it with two big eyes and a bigger mouth then the mouth opened and the cloud biewand a cold wind rocked the raft waves formed and they advanced on the raft and rocked it the cloud swelled up denser and uglier and thunder rumbled within it the wind whipped the foliage of the trees and the first big raindrops spattered against the raft maybe we had better pole in to shore jenny said worried i dont want to get washed off the raft with those water moccasins waiting perhaps that is best che agreed jenny lifted the pole but she remained light while it remained heavy now it seemed heavier than she was which made poling awkward but that was readily solved che flicked the pole with his tail and it became light she shoved them toward the shore but as she did evil little faces appeared the goblins hastily she shoved the raft back away the goblins stood and waved their stubby fists some of them had stones but they did not throw them there were more than there had been beforesix at least that she saw they must have gotten reinforcements we cant go ashore she said i fear we cant stay in midstream either che said maybe its safe on the other side she poled across but the water got deeper in the center making the poling increasingly difficult the storm intensified so that the waves washed over the raft sammy was not keen on involuntary baths and jumped up to jennys shoulder to hiss at the water the raft spun around jenny lost her footing and felt herself sliding off she screamedbut che caught her arm and prevented her from landing in the water his four feet gave him a better anchorage he had his hooves braced against the ridges of the raft still the storm raged jenny knew now that che was right this was no ordinary cloud but a magically malign demon of a cloud out to get them she couldnt guess why it hated them so but it was doing its utmost to dump them in the river she had not believed in the deliberate malignancy of weather but now she did a gust of wind caught the raft and shoved it to the bank jenny was trying to leave she tried to stop it with the pole but the thing caught in the bottom muck and was twisted out of her grasp she was after all no big human man she was a little elf girl not used to this sort of thing the waves gathered for one concluding effort they lifted the raft and tilted it so sharply that elf cat and centaur slid off it and into the shallow water jenny screamed as she splashed but the water moccasins did not clamp onto their toes it seemed that the storm had scared them too and they were either stunned or elsewhere the goblins charged in and grabbed jenny and che in a moment both were hopelessly tied up find help sammy jenny cried desperately though she feared there was no help to be had sammy jumped past the goblins and disappeared maybe he would find helpbut how would the help find them for she knew the goblins wouldnt just leave her by the bank of the withacookee river what had she accomplished in her effort to save the foal nothing but a delay she feared now she was in just as much trouble as he chapter electros exam electra watched chex fly away with grundy golem she hoped che was found soon but she had a bad feeling about it all the foal had been kidnapped and that meant that someone was trying to hide him away he would not turn up innocently wandering through the forest who could want to do such an awful thing che was the only winged centaur foal in xanth if something happened to him it would cut off the childhood of that entire species that was even worse than an ordinary kidnapping bad as that was she wasnt sure that anything like that had happened in xanth before nada looked grim she was such a lovely young woman in her human form that she looked terrific even that way electra envied her and had no trouble understanding why prince dolph liked her better than electra electra liked nada better than electra she was a princess and a really nice person too if electra could have chosen any woman to compete against nada would have been at the very bottom of her list but for friends the top of the list wed better get moving nada said she became a giant serpent electra got on the serpents back nada moved sinuously gathering speed there was a certain similarity to the way she walked in the human form but then it had more effect on the eyeballs of any men in the vicinity they practically popped out of their sockets as a matter of fact the golems eyes had bulged similarly just now perhaps because nada was not wearing her clothing grundy had a perfectly lovely wife rapunzel but like all males of any size he liked to stare at whatever else was in sight he had not given electra a second glance and not just because she was clothed no man gave her a second glance when she was with nada as she usually was she was used to it it was too bad that nada did not love dolph the way he loved her but of course she was five years older than he now twenty to his fifteen nada was a poised young woman while dolphwell even electra had to admit that he was sort of unpolished electra loved him anyway she couldnt help it because of the enchantment she had fallen into she had to love and marry the prince who had kissed her awake after her thousand year sleep she had not been the one who was supposed to make that sleep and she was certainly no princess but evil magician murphys curse had fouled everything up and she had somehow bitten the apple and fallen into the special coffin and now she was here actually murphy wasnt all that bad now that he had renounced his claim to the throne of xanth he had used his magic to help his son grey get out of his horrible obligation to the evil machine cornpewter maybe eight hundred years in the brain corals pool pickled in brine had mellowed murphy and twenty more years in mundania had finished the job electra had forgiven him what he had done to her with his curse she had sort of had to because if that hadnt happened she would have been long since dead and forgotten such things made a difference still it wasnt any great situation she was in now in love with a prince who loved her best friend instead in fact she was coming to a crisis the good magician had done some research in the book of answers and discovered that there was a time limit to her enchantment if she didnt marry the prince by the time she was eighteen years old she would die anyway betrothal could hold her only until she came of age then she had to perform if she did not marry him and consummate the marriage before she was eighteen she would die on the stroke of her birthday it was tricky judging exactly how old she was because of her mostofamillennium sleep but they had figured it out only her normal life counted so her aging had halted the moment she fell into the enchanted sleep and resumed when she woke from it by that reckoning she would be eighteen next week dolph would have to choose he couldnt avoid it because if he did nothing she would die leaving only nada for him to marry his parents had laid down the word he could not do it by default he had to decide and then marry the one he chose and it would be done one way or the other in a way it was good to have this distraction of ches kidnapping because it took her mind from her own problem or at least made her remember that she wasnt the only one in xanth with something to worry about many folk had problems after all she knew she was lucky to have come here and lived these past six years in castle roogna with good friends and her great love even if it was magical in origin and hopeless it was still a great wonderful thing in her heart she wiped the tears from her face with the back of her hand why should she be crying really travel was swift down the magic path and before long they were there electra dismounted and nada resumed her human form and donned her dress panties and slippers which electra had carried in her knapsack the dress and slippers didnt matter but it was essential that no male eye see the panties they were exciting pink while electras were dull white but no males were supposed to know that what would xanth come to if anything like that happened nada turned to her as they stood outside the castle moat i wish he would marry you she said i know but they both knew that their preferences didnt count only dolphs counted he would choose and the one he chose would marry him that had been understood from the outset ever since queen irene had declared that he could not marry both one man with two wives it just wasnt proper for some reason they gazed at the castle it looked ordinary but the drawbridge was up that meant that they couldnt just go in they exchanged most of a glance good magician humfrey wasnt here now but grey murphy was doing his best to substitute in the interim he had the book of answers and all the collections of vials and spells and things and ivy to enhance him when he needed it he had done well enough all things considered these past three years though electra understood he sometimes had to scramble for a difficult answer he had set up the same rules humfrey had maintained any applicant had to pass three challenges to get into the castle and then to give one years service or the equivalent that was to weed out those who werent really serious even so there were quite a number of folk with questions several were sitting by the bank of the moat now evidently trying to make up their minds whether their questions were really important enough to warrant the price required for the answers that explained why the drawbridge was up otherwise those folk might simply have walked on in nada nodded and her graybrown tresses bobbed prettily electras tresses were brown too but somehow they never bobbed they just hung there listlessly no matter how she tried to fix them i think grey cant afford to play favorites she said electra agreed no favorites nadas other best friend was ivy and even ivy got a trifle nervous when nada got too close to her fiancй grey why ivy and grey were affianced while dolph nada and electra were betrothed was a question none of them had ever quite worked out so grey couldnt afford to let nada in without challenge while others watched maybe i can go in alone electra suggested alone nadas browngray eyes were beautifully perplexed electras eyes were forgettable whether perplexed or excited even she could not remember their color if they had any no one will notice if i go in lectra are you going into another inferiority tizzy nada demanded severely well electra said guiltily i wont have it youre a great friend and a great girl and only an idiot wouldnt notice you how about dolph electra asked wryly he is an idiot then they both laughed appreciating the painful truth of that anyway nada said after a moment its not you or me its that the drawbridge is up and we cant ask favors so well just have to forge in any way we can just like anyone else we do have a question after all not the one id like to ask maybe we can get dolph to ask it wed have to dose him with a love potion first nada paused now i wonder forget it even if he loved me hed still love you too and youre everything im not so now stop it lectra physical appearance isnt everything right theres also the matter of royalty versus peasant and niceness versus youre nice lectra youre as nice as anyone and and i have freckles too oh youre hopeless nada exclaimed in exasperation she was lovely when exasperated as electra wasnt thats what ive been trying to tell you nada changed the subject so well both go in together as soon as we figure out how electra contemplated the moat she didnt see any moat monsters but they were surely lurking somewhere it would not be safe to swim unless nada became a bigger monster suppose you become a giant water serpent and my thought exactly get on nada shrugged out of her clothes handed them over and became the serpent electra stuffed the clothes in her knapsack and bestrode her as she had when they traveled the magic path nada slid into the water and started across electras feet and dress were getting wet but she wasnt going to let that stop her they would dry in due course there was a stir at the far shore electra peered forward all i see is shells she reported then she laughed she saw sea shells by the sea shore only its a moat shore there was a bang and something flew toward them duck electra cried nada ducked and electra got dunked but the object missed plunking into the water behind them nada surfaced lifting her head for a hiss i dont know electra said it looked like a flying shell with the number point twentytwo painted on it nada shook her head unable to make much sense of this electra understood her confusion since when did shells fly they normally lay on the beach or under water then there was a bigger bang and a larger shell came flying this one had the number on it down electra screamed they dived again and the shell missed after a moment they resumed motionand an even larger shell marked came flying at them another electra cried throwing herself aside when she came up something clicked in her head its a challenge she gasped those shells are the first line of defense nada looped around and they headed back for the outer shore when they got there nada changed to woman form and climbed out a man farther around the moat fell over evidently he had gotten too much of an eyeful and was stunned electra was sure it wasnt her own bedraggled wetclothinged body that had done it i never heard of flying shells nada said how can we get past when they keep getting bigger electra concentrated i almost remember something maybe from when i visited mundania some folkthey like to throw shells at targets i think or at bulls something like that the eyesit sounds so mean bullseyes nada exclaimed ive heard of that they arent really animals but big painted circles maybe if we make one of those the shells will go for it it seemed worth trying they scrounged around and found a giant white pillow from a pillow bush and a patch of indian paint brushes they used one of these to paint indian designsit wouldnt paint anything elsein a big circle that looked somewhat like an eye then they floated this in the moat the eye looking up sure enough the shells went for it and while the shells were distracted by the target nada and electra quietly swam across and emerged on the castle side the only one to see was another man beyond the moat and he promptly went rigid and keeled over the way the first had nada did have that effect on men even without her pink panties nada dressed electras knapsack was watertight so nadas dress was nice and dry and fresh while electra looked like a damp zombie but she knew that even if her clothes had been fresh and nadas sodden nada would have been a sight for sore eyes while electra would have been a sight to make eyes sore but hardly were they through when the next challenge was upon them a swarm of flying red objects charged them each was roughly heartshaped but not properly symmetrical there were ugly tubes protruding from the tops and great swollen veins around their bodies each pulsed horrendously oh nada cried daintily as one of the grotesque things whammed into her shoulder even when under attack she was ladylike yuck electra grunted in unladylike fashion as another sailed at her face what are they nada asked trying to avoid another that was threatening to splatter her nice dress with juice exactly the color of blood monsters of the next challenge electra replied as the thing missed nada and scored on her own dress bright gore dribbled down it and dripped to her feet nada became a big snake and reared up at the next red blob her dress hanging awkwardly on her new body in a moment she slithered out of it she opened her mouth showing formidable fangs and hissed the blob veered to the sidebut another splatted her from behind her head whirled to snap at that onewhereupon the one in front splatted its gore on her there are too many of them electra cried wecant fight them well just get hopelessly gored we have to figure out the key to this challenge the snake slithered down into the moat to wash off the splat that left electra as the main focus of attention a huge blob smashed into her chest trying to knock her down she grabbed it and lifted it up ready to hurl it into the moat but she knew it would just loop around and attack her again the thing was slimy with leaking blood and worse it was warm and pulsing just as if a living heart had been ripped from aaarrghhhr she groaned with heartfelt horror it is a heart the snake became nada in her natural form a naga with the body of a serpent and the head of a woman a heart attack she exclaimed ive heard of them but i never thought it would happen to me no one ever does electra agreed heartily she ducked as a bold heart came at her head and was caught in the rear by another she still held the big heart that had hit her chest it was oddly passive now though she wasnt holding it hard she realized that her electrical nature might be affecting it that heartened her because it might offer a solution to this challenge her magic talent was electricity she was constantly building up a charge and could discharge it all at once by delivering a hefty shock to some monster or gradually as when she made an electrolytic environment for the heaven cent she had heard that hearts used electric pulses to time their beats or something maybe these wild hearts were just out of control and so were attacking anything in the vicinity if she could put her hands on them and use her electricity to get their pulses even maybe that would tame them she let the big heart go it floated away passive beating steadily seeming at peace with the world she watched for the next and when it zoomed in she grabbed it the thing tried to slip out of her grasp but she clutched it to her it was hot and it almost burned her but she knew it was only heartburn in a moment as her hands retained contact the heart became passive then she let it go and it floated peacefully away it was working what are you doing lectra nada called from the moat im making a better pace for these hearts electra replied theyre wild because theyre out of control youre a good pacemaker nada agreed watching the orderly hearts floating away dont break any we dont want any broken hearts electra agreed as she caught another she doubted she could ever be a heartbreaker finally every heart was tamed electra was a little sad to see the last one drift contentedly off but she knew it was only heartache she had surmounted the second challenge she went to the moat and washed off the blood she hoped the tame hearts found good bodies to occupy because they seemed very warm and friendly and would probably do good service if treated well she couldnt blame them for being wild when they were cast out into the world alone they emerged from the moat and walked on nadas dress was now as wet as electras because she had had to wash it but it still looked ten times as good on her as anything electra had ever worn had ever looked on her they came to an arched gate and went through it into the castle there was a long narrow hall ahead but there was something oozing from the far gate it looked lumpy and red and sticky as if a thousand wild hearts had been squished and dumped in a sodden mass was this where the hearts had come from no wonder they had been wild nada sniffed then she reached down and put a finger to the mess and tasted it i thought so strawberry you mean its edible electra asked amazed were supposed to eat our way through it i hope not strawberry jam is horribly fattening that wouldnt stop me i cant put on weight no matter how much i eat thats my problem thats not your problem nada flared youre beautifully slender id trade my figure for yours anytime if i eat any of that jam you wont want my figure nada said id be so fat i could roll without pulling in my arms or legs electra tried to picture that and found it hilarious but it didnt come out as a healthy laugh or even a girlish giggle just a foolish titter she dipped a finger and tasted the jam no this isnt strawberry quite its too metallic not hayberry either and lookthose arent exactly berries theyre moving around nada peered youre right some are bigger than others and theyre sort of square they keep nudging up to each other and stopping until something else gets out of the way electra added only things seem to be much better at getting into the way than out of it and the total effect is one of absolute gooey crawl nada said not one berry can get where its going before all the others do so they are all made maddeningly slow i think i tasted something like this once hundreds of years ago electra said it was a kind of berry growing in a circle aa traffic circle the berries just kept rolling around and around it until they wore out those must have been crazy berries traffic berries theyre always moving around except when they get stuck in traffic jam nada concluded and this is one big mess of jam yes its awful how can we get by it they watched the jam ooze its way onward theres no help for it nada said reluctantly well just have to slog through it i hope i can take a bath at the other end electra sighed ill go first i have less to lose no you dont you have more to win nada stepped into the jam immediately she slowed to a crawl she tried to move her feet but there was always something in the way the jam wouldnt give her any chance to get anywhere this is no good nada gasped i cant move electra reached out to take her hand ill pull you out but though she did pull nada remained stuck in the traffic jam there has to be a better way nada said im just getting caught worse change into a small snake so i can lift you out electra suggested nada did so she became a garter snake whose garters had nothing to attach to electra closed her hand carefully about the body and pulled but the snakes tail was hopelessly caught she just couldnt get free finally she changed back to human form so that she could stand on her own without getting in deeper electra put her hands to her head and ran some current through it making her brain strain this enabled her to force out an idea maybe if we could get the jam to go somewhere else she said and leave us here but thats the problem nada objected it cant move anywhere very fast the traffic berries in it cant move fast electra said but maybe the whole thing canif it wants to but what could make it want to electra fished in her knapsack i saw something in my calendar about a festival or something she pulled out a battered copy of a xanth calendar and leafed through it yes here it is a jamboree the traffic jam quivered but isnt that nada started yes it will occur in the gap chasm the jam began to move it slid slowly then more swiftly out of the hall carrying nada along with it soon it was going at a respectable speed electra grabbed onto nada again and hung on and the jam moved onward so rapidly that it lost cohesion and let her feet go a moment later they watched the jam sliding on across the moat there was no question it was headed for that jamboree electra had guessed right no jam could resist something like that didnt you make a teeny fib nada asked theres no party at the gap electra showed her the calendar i didnt say it was a party i said it was a jamboree and here it is she pointed to it the month of jamboree nada said but right here in the calendar electra agreed it occurs in the gap just as it does everywhere else in xanth at the same time the traffic jam is sure to find it in due course nada shook her head i suppose that jam wasnt going anywhere else fast anyway she said resigned but we arequick while the passage is clear she hauled nada along into the castle the naga woman let herself be towed deciding it wasnt worth further protest the passage ended in steps that led to a door and beyond the door was ivy she was in a yellow dress that complemented her pale green hair she was nadas age but not as luscious in that respect she fell more or less between nada and electra oh how wonderful to see you two again she exclaimed hugging each in turn why didnt you tell us you were coming both nada and electra stared at her caught between astonishment and outrage then ivys mouth quirked and in a moment all three were lost in girlish laughter well come on ivy said as they subsided i think greys had time to research the answer now electra nodded there was reason for the challenges not only did they discourage those who werent really serious they gave the magician time to get the necessary information few folk knew this but nada and electra were ivys closest friends and were privy to some pretty formidable secrets grey murphy was in the upstairs chamber with the book of answers there were those who claimed there was no such book but that was just because they hadnt seen it it had answers to every question the only problem was figuring out how to read them and understand them grey had been working on it for three years now and was getting better but he still had to scramble at times well dispense with the year of service grey said with a smile ivy says her friends are exempt or else we thought as much nada agreed with an answering smile are you ready for our question i think so but im afraid you wont much like the answer are you sure you want to ask yes electra said we dont have much time very well ask where is che centaur grey stared at her what she said where is che centaur nada said you know chexs foal but grey looked baffled nada frowned managing to look beautiful at the same time whats the matterdid we ask the wrong question i just researched the problem of your betrothals grey exclaimed it was nada and electras turn to stare then both burst into laughter we never thought of that electra cried thats next weeks problem nada added grey brushed his haircolored hair back and looked sheepish it was a fairly easy expression for him i guess i was too busy with technicalities i just assumed he shrugged this presents a problem you mean you dont know where che is electra asked because you were checking into our triangle problem i guess thats a problem all right maybe the mirror knows he said most magic mirrors were fairly transparent but some were brighter than others he rummaged in a drawer and brought out a hand mirror the problem withthis one is that it has to be questioned in rhyme and the formats limited and it isnt always quite current he pondered for a moment then addressed it mirror mirror in the desk is che centaur picturesque that query is grotesque the mirror responded matching the rhyme but a scene showed on it of the little centaur tied hobbled and guarded by goblins nada electra and ivy stifled similar exclamations of horror he had been stolen by goblins but there are several goblin tribes nada said therere the goblins of mount etamin that my folk war against and the goblins east of the element of earth electra added and the goblinate of the golden horde ivy said with a shudder there are goblins all over xanth grey said there are references to them in many of magician humfreys papers most of them live well underground but the mirror showed a surface scene that limits it somewhat can you ask the mirror to be more specific electra asked no it will only answer a given question once also this could be from several hours ago im afraid ill have to research it in the book of answers he looked glum how long will that take electra asked concerned probably several more hours its not the sort of answer im good at finding yet but ches in danger now we cant wait several more hours nada leaned toward him her wet dress clinging and heaving in the way that no dress ever did on electra isnt there some other way grey she breathed find a way ivy said quickly her mouth was momentarily grim one might almost have thought she didnt want nada having to ask him any more questions what grey seemed distracted for a moment nadas dresses tended to have that effect on men even when dry it was a good thing her pink panties werent showing electra thought or he would have been unable to speak at all oh yes maybe the ghost writer who electra asked hes a ghost doing his years service for an answer ivy explained but hes very shy and doesnt speak or show himself to others so when he has to communicate he writes but how would a ghost know about something like this isnt he tied to his place of death no this one is able to travel grey said because hes not associated with any one locale he can operate anywhere he moves very quickly so may be foggy on details but he should be able to give us a general notion well ask him then electra said impatiently grey frowned he may not answer but if hes doing service hes nervous about goblins grey said it seems that the goblinate of the golden horde caught him and cooked him in a pot thats how he died he hasnt been the same since he says it was a bad review writers dont like bad reviews electra was able to appreciate that she wouldnt have cared to get potted like that herself so we dont like to push him where goblins are concerned ivy said electra looked helplessly at nada what were they to do but nada had a notion is he here now in the castle yes grey said i can call him but tell him ill let him kiss me if he can tell me where che is she said and give him a good view i mean review she had been right the first time electra thought nadas dress clung to her tightly except where it was forced to jump the gap across her heaving bosom if the ghost floated close enough to kiss her he would get the best view available in xanth that might encourage him grey said he looked into blank air ghorge he paused evidently waiting for the ghost we would like to know which goblins have captured che centaur nada naga the woman with the he hesitated his eyes traveling across wet assets and valleyhurdling cloth until ivy made a frowning ahem the amazing uh dress she er will let you kiss her if you answer actually electras dress was wet too but it didnt have to strain to cross her front and nobodys eyes got hung up on it and the promise of kissing her would not have excited a living man let alone a ghost she might have been resentful if nada hadnt been such a good friend and fellow betrothee after a moment grey lifted a sheet of paper from the desk very well was written on it in ornate script nada walked to the center of the chamber put her hands behind her back lifted her chin pursed her lips closed her eyes and inhaled her decolletage went into terminal strain ivy crossed quickly to grey and put her hands over his eyes just as the last event was starting that was probably just as well electra thought because those eyes had been in danger of popping loose after a moment electra saw something writing was appearing on the sheet of paper written by an invisible hand it said go find che with a cookee ghorges given the answer electra exclaimed jumping with excitement she could afford to do that even in a wet dress with nada it would have been dangerous nada opened her eyes hes really cool she said well he is dead ivy reminded her but i think that is a good review more writing appeared never a cleavage like that short of the gap chasml electra didnt bother to call attention to that message it didnt seem relevant but what kind of cookie do we need to find che she asked grey looked at the message i think he means the withacookee river that must be where he saw che already electra asked but he hasnt had time to travel around oh he has he has ivy said hes very fast being unlimited by mortal considerations now nada lets get some dry clothing on you you too lectra they went with ivy and got changed and snatched a bite to eat by that time the day was getting late we have to be on our way electra said we can get you there ivy said grey has been researching the gourd while we were eating the gourd electra asked alarmed we dont want to get caught in that ivy laughed dont worry you wont the night stallion needed an answer and he paid for it by giving us a few big gourds we use them for emergency transport all you have to do is step in the one here and follow the path to the one near the withacookee river and step out that will get you there almost immediately she paused looking concerned but its pretty rough country there and the goblins can be bad maybe we should give you some extra magic to handle things electra considered nada can handle just about anything in serpent form but maybe we could use something to signal for help in case we do get in trouble we have a whistle but if the goblins are listening they might come before our friends and make things worse we happen to have some sparkleberries ivy said a branch of them should do nicely she went to a cupboard and brought out a small branch with round green leaves and little black berries she picked several berries and handed them to electra you activate them electrically that will be easy for you just hold one and run a charge through it and throw it up and it will sparkle enough to alert anyone in the area especially at night thank you electra said well set one off when we find che if we need help in getting him away from the goblins ivy led them to the cellar grey was there standing before a huge hypnogourd this doesnt take just your mind it takes your body he said i have nulled its magic for safekeeping but ill free it long enough for you to enter hold hands as you step in so you dont get separated you must follow the right path or you will get lost since you are going to the withacookee river outlet watch for a cookie or a symbol of one that will show you the correct path when there is any choice of paths you will arrive in just a few minutes if you keep moving dont tell anyone about the gourd we prefer to keep this system private electra was impressed i should think so you must be able to get anywhere in xanth in a hurry pretty much grey agreed wherever we have big gourds placed anyway now are you ready electra and nada nodded dont be surprised by anything you see in the gourd ivy said remember its the realm of dreams just stay on the cookie path and youll have no problem dont let any of the dreams tempt you away from that path we wont electra promised then grey released the magic the gourd seemed to glow faintly the two girls stepped into the peephole chapter dolphs dilemma dolph pondered briefly as he approached the element of air what form would be best for this he was in young man form at the moment having used it to take a stick and poke a suitable hole in the flypaper surrounding the kingdom of the flies but he doubted that would do for air he knew there would be air currents of all kinds here including fierce storms he could become a squat turtle and let it all blow safely over him but it would take him forever to explore it he needed to check it quickly because if che centaur were here he could be in serious trouble and time would be of the essence but if dolph assumed a flying form he could get blown everywhere else but wherever che was and that was no good either he came to the border on one side were green plants and manure and rotting things suitable for the delight of flies on the other was a turmoil of wind he decided that a flying form was best but not one that could be blown about so he assumed the form of a ghost he wasnt a true ghost of course because he wasnt dead he just looked like one and acted like one and the wind couldnt touch him because he wasnt solid enough he floated through the border the wind tried to take him and hurl him about but it couldnt get a grip on him it howled with exasperation this might once have been a nice region but the wind had scoured the soil from the land and the clouds from the sky probably it had also blown away the stars of the night but he wasnt here to appreciate the view he had to find che if he were here and to be sure he was somewhere else if he werent here he floated around just inside the border picking up speed he would spiral in toward the center of air looking at everything he didnt dare miss one spot lest that be the one where a poor injured foal lay waiting for rescue actually since che had been foalnapped he probably wasnt alone but captive of some other creature still that creature or creatures could be holding him here so it was best to look for a house or shelter too and inspect any he spied this was a dull region once he allowed for the violence of the wind there was no vegetation at all just sand and the wind was constantly whipping it up into sandstorms if anyone sat on the ground long he would be buried in sand a captor shouldnt take che here for that then dolph had another bad thought suppose someone were mad at chex or cheiron and wanted to make them suffer he could steal their foal away and dump him here and they would certainly suffer he wouldnt care that the foal could not survive in all the wind and sand that would be the point did he really want to find che if that was the case a dead foal buried under sand no mat was too horrible nobody would want to do that to the winged centaurs the regular centaurs didnt like them because centaurs had very strict notions about species purity but all centaurs were creatures of honor who would not stoop to any such malice the other winged monsters certainly wouldnt because all of them were sworn to protect their own dolph had crashed chexs wedding ceremony and knew how the simurgh had impressed this on them and on dolph too of course the land monsters werent bound but most of them lacked the wit to foalknap him they would simply eat him and be done with it so the chances were that this was a more organized effort and that the foal wouldnt be left in a place like this little dust devils sported among the moving sand dunes being watched by their parent tornadoes they had fun sucking up the sand and throwing it around this was one big sandlot for them but there was no sign of che or any other living thing dolph was glad then a dust devil swung in toward him he veered to the side to avoid it but it veered too he moved the other way and it matched him it was following him well it couldnt hurt him whaaat doo yooo waaant he called in ghost accent realizing that this was something more than a freak of nature the whirling cone was replaced by another ghost so you are an intruder it said with no ghostly distortion who are you im prince dolph of the human folk he replied who are you the ghost swirled and became devastatingly female well now a living man this is most intriguing you didnt answer my question he said i am the demoness metria she said i have had some limited dealings with your benevolent my what he asked blankly your compassionate gentle humane she said crossly oh you mean my kind he said catching on whatever what are you doing here prince im looking for che centaur who was foalnapped by a party unknown then it occurred to him that the demons could be responsible maybe he had said too much oh that she said disinterested hes not here he isnt no the goblins took him i suppose they want him for food and to feed the little goblins too feed the little goblin stew dolph asked horrified why else would goblins want horsemeat horsemeat he exclaimed hes a winged centaur a unique species well you dont think they want him for his proclivity do you his what his bent disposition inclination penchant propensity she said annoyed dolph concentrated and after a bit it came to him his mind whatever what would a goblin care about that nothing he said precisely so you might as well be on your way wait a minute demoness how can i believe you maybe you stole che and youre trying to distract me she focused her ghostly eyes on him listen vacuumhead if i wanted to distract you i wouldnt bother with words i have easier ways yeah like what how old are you prince fifteen going on sixteen what does that have to do with it and im a hundred and fifteen going on a decade or two more i lose count but my age doesnt matter its yours that is critical do you know how to summon the stork no no one will tell me not even my betrothee your what my fiancee girlfriend promised engagee oh you mean your prospective ball and chain whatever why do you ask because its more fun to pester innocents human folk are pretty dull creatures but ignorant young men are subject to amusing temptations maybe ill keep you with me for a while so i can entertain myself its been a decade or so since ive toyed with a mortal man oh who was that i forget an ogre i think only he looked like a man aristocrat what patrician gentleman esquire oh you mean esk ogre whatever why did you ask dolph opened his ghost mouth but discovered that he had forgotten whatever they had been talking about enough of this i have to find che centaur but i told you hes not here now he remembered that was how all this had started youre of the demon folk i cant trust you so im going to keep looking do you mind if i tag along on your futile search yes go away great ill stay right with you oops he had made the mistake of admitting that her presence bothered him ill ignore you suppose i tell you how to summon the stork he stopped in the air you will of course not dont you know about the adult conspiracy but youre a demoness you dont honor that stuff of course i do she said indignantly its the best torment yet devised for children im not a child you are until you figure out the secret she had him there so you wont tell me you mare go away im a what ewe doe hen sow lioness he broke off oh now youve got me doing it female wolfi cant think of the word ha youre young and innocent you dont know the word she had nailed him again and you wont tell me so go away and let me finish my search but she lingered her shape becoming even more shapely i wont tell you the secret about the stork but i might show you she had his interest again but he still didnt trust her whats the catch you have to resume manform nuhuh not until i finish searching the elements metria frowned prettily youre being unreasonable dolph im the one who is supposed to be difficult why dont you give up this hopeless search and let me show you the storks secret because i dont trust you not only will you stop me from finding che youll fade out without showing me anything and leave me twice as frustrated as before she nodded youre getting smarter but you know there is something more important you should be doing now again foolishly he paid attention what could be more important than finding che plugging the hole he couldnt make sense of this are you referring to the stork again she laughed so hard she dissolved into fragments of smoke and it took her a while to resume her shapely shape i could have been but i wasnt what an entendre what never mind its not in the dictionary anyway the muses are way behind the times no i mean the hole in xanth where the foreign elf and her foreign cat come through what foreign elf the one whos with che now helping him flee the goblins how do you think she got here otherwise dolph knew she was trying to confuse him but he didnt want to admit how well she was succeeding why should the hole be plugged because alien monsters may come through it the elf is harmless but what else follows her is not all xanth could be threatened thats not just a hole between two worlds its between a squintillion worlds and the simurgh only knows what connection may be next why didnt you plug it then she shrugged it would be tedious but ill show you where it is if you wish but if it threatens xanth it threatens you too you wouldnt just let it be youre just trying to distract me again she nodded that too i dont understand you well youre only human she said condescendingly worse youre only male so im just going to ignore you and go on with my search lotsa luck obtuse what acute right oblique reflex angleno wait i mean dull uninformed slowwitted blunt dense stupid thank you she floated forward and kissed him on the forehead stupid somehow dolph was not completely satisfied but he realized that it was pointless to keep talking with her he resumed his search for che soon he completed his spiral around the region of air having found nothing he approached the region of earth and drifted through the border between them this section was just as violent but in a different way the air cleared and the sandstorm died out but now it was the land in motion it trembled quivered and even went so far as to shake to the north was a giant volcano spewing out red liquid thats boiling lava the demoness said beside him i dont think you want to put your feet in that it wont hurt ghost feet but the hot gases may dissolve you dolph thought she was just teasing him but wasnt quite sure he had never tried his ghost formor any other formin volcanic gas so he steered well clear of the nasty mountain he could see farther here because the air was clearer so could move more rapidly without missing anything important yet as he moved he wondered was it possible that the demoness was telling the truth that che had already been found if so he was wasting his time here but if that was true then what about the business of the hole in xanth if a foreign elf had come through with her cat what else was likely to follow he really shouldnt ignore that youre cute when your ghostly brow furrows like that metria remarked go jump in a hypnogourd youre even cuter when you try to be clever does your future matethe one who wont tell you about stork summoningappreciate your cleverness no he replied shortly why not because she doesnt love me he said before remembering not to talk to the demoness oh well the infernal creature had probably already caught on to that i thought you human folk didnt marry without love foolish as that may be we dont its complicated i love complexity how did it happen what was the use she would keep pestering him anyway and maybe she would have an answer for his dilemma i needed help from the naga folk he said they are serpents with the heads of human folk their king said i would have to marry his daughter nada naga so that my folk would help their folk against the goblins but i was too young so i was betrothed to her instead she could assume serpent form or human form because the naga have ancestry in both but i can take other forms too including serpent and naga i liked her and then i loved her but she was doing it just because she had to she never loved me what an animal girl failed to love a handsome human prince how could she dolph realized that she was being sarcastic demonfashion but he ignored it it helped him just to describe the situation she was beautiful herself and a princess too and half human but she is five years older to her i was just a child so she couldnt love me thats easy to solve just have her drink from a love spring in your presence yes when i marry her next week shell do that but theres something else you are full of surprises prince but the edge of her sarcasm was not as sharp she was curious they completed the region of earth and floated into the next the region of fire which was surrounded by a tall wall of fire within the region flames reached hungrily for the sky but no matter how hard they tried they couldnt bum up the sky quite but the trees below were having a difficult time of it this search too was dull so when the demoness floating beside him through the flames inquired about the something else he answered i have a second betrothee now that i believe is unusual for your kind we demons have no limits about such thingsin fact we have no betrothals or marriages we just do what comes unnaturally but i never heard of a human man marrying two women she considered in xanth i mean they do it in mundania though usually one at a time but that doesnt count mundanes are crazy i dont know grey murphys mundane and hes not crazy hes not in mundania now either he must have straightened out when he entered xanth that must explain it he agreed it did make sense anyway she had been fouled up by magician murphys spell long ago and was sleeping in a coffin on the isle of view i love you too prince metria said because you are a cylinder of laughs but what a drum round container barrel but i mean i thought demonesses didnt love so how we love to torment folk and you are nicely tormentable but you said it first i did not i was telling about the coffin onoops yes thats where out of nowhere you said you loved me if thats what you did with that sleeping girl i can see how you got in trouble its the island of view he said spelling it he had learned to spell from his mother who had absolutely refused to let his father teach him for some reason irene was funny about such things as spelling and panties and marriages thats its name metria made a moue you mean you dont love me thats right i love nada and only her too bad its much easier to torment one who loves you well maybe youll love me when i show you how to summon the stork its been known to happen you mean the stork has something to do with love he asked amazed she eyed him slantwise oh you will be fun to educate no i hate education he said stoutly we shall see go on with your history disgruntled for no special reason he resumed where he thought he had left off so electra was sleeping because she had gotten fouled up in the spell intended for the princess and took a bite of the apple according to the enchantment she would sleep for a thousand years or until a prince kissed her awake whichever came first and i was the prince who came and kissed her so naturally she was instantly in love with me and wanted to marry me i really couldnt tell her no why not the demoness asked mischievously all you had to do was say read my lips freckles go back to sleep then you could slam the lid down and get out of there dotph opened his mouth in an o of horror then he realized that she was teasing him in her demoniac fashion he decided to plow on regardless she was already out of the coffin she will die if she doesnt marry me shes been on hold during the betrothal i guess the enchantment understands about my being underage after all so is she but in a week she will be eighteen and if she isnt married to me by then she will die anyway so i sort of have to decide but arent you still underage metria inquired alertly or will you have your sixteenth birthday this week no not for a few months yet but my sister made grey murphy research that and he found that its the age of the girl that counts in xanth she has to be at least sixteen before she marries it doesnt say about the boy we think that whoever made mat rule just assumed that the boy would be older so i can marry now if i marry a girl who is of age and both my betrothees are so i have to choose soon my mother wont let me marry both of them for some reason what does your father say he keeps his mouth shut i think its not in his department it isnt then what is in his department they had covered the region of fire and now were entering the region of water it seemed to be one big lake but dolph knew there were some islands and shores in it and the foal might be on one of them he handles die big things like kingly policy she handles the little things like everything else metria finished now i understand its a true matriarchy all right as it should be ill bet you arent allowed to look at panties either how did you know he asked surprised its female policy no unmarried or underage men can see such forbidden things it would zonk out their feeble minds so which one are you going to marry i dont know he said there was the substance of his dilemma he still could not make up his mind id really like to marry nada and see her panties but dont want lectra to die doesnt electra have panties too yes i guess so he said surprised i never thought of that but i dont love her and i do love nada so marry for love and let the other croak it became easier to argue the other side when the demoness summed things up but nada would be unhappy and lectra would die i dont want those things to happen either then boot nada and marry electra and take a love potion with her but i dont want to love lectra he protested and nada doesnt want to love you well she wants to but not that way we think its better if its natural lectras love for me is because of the enchantment id rather she took a potion to null it but thats not the point she has to many me whether she loves me or not or die metria nodded do you want objective advice from someone who doesnt care about any of you he peered at her that depends what kind of advice would it be marry electra no i dont want that advice then youll have to survive without it i wouldnt proffer it if i thought youd take it of course i much prefer seeing you make fools of all three of you dolph had the sinking feeling that he would oblige her in that he knew it would make everyone else happy including both nada and electra if he married electra but she was like a pale glimmering starfish while nada was like a brightly blazing sun fish electra was great for playing tag with or pillow fights or gettingsickeatingcandy binges but nada ah nada what a dream he had never liked kissing or any of that mushy stuff until he knew nada now he could do it all day with her except that she preferred to be off doing things with ivy fortunately ivy did not feel easy about having nada too near her fiance grey for some reason so it was mostly electra she was with whenever something interesting came up like the sound of the invisible giants footsteps the two betrothees would head out and nada would try to discourage dolph from coming along while electra would encourage him if only it could be the other way around theres an isle metria said wed better land on it and explore it physically distracted by his chain of thought dolph didnt argue he floated down ready to change to solid human form when his feet were in reach of the sand this water region was really pretty nice when between tsunamis nada would marry him if he chose because it was a political bargain and a princess never reneged on her word she would do her best to make him happy and that would be no trouble at all because he would be happy just being with her electra would bid him farewell and go away to die by herself so as not to bother anyone with the sight electra was really a very nice person he had never doubted that but it would not make any more sense for him to marry electra than it would for nada to marry him the love just wasnt there maybe a love potion would do it but that seemed like cheating youre very quiet dolph he jumped that was nadas voice he lookedand there was nada standing beside him at the shore of a tiny island he had not been paying attention where he was going and had just sort of followed the demoness how he asked agog i thought i would stop by to see how you were doing nada said dulcetly she stepped in close to kiss him perhaps since we are here alone we should settle down to some serious romancing her arms went around him drawing him close her graybrown hair fell down around her face and tumbled about her shoulders as her browngray eyes gazed into his she had been taller than he when he first knew her when she was in her normal human form that was no longer the case she was the loveliest creature he could imagine then something percolated through the unwilling recesses of his mind how could nada be here she couldnt fly she would have had to assume snake form and swim and before that she would have had to get through the region of fire it seemed unlikely meanwhile what had happened to the demoness i dont think he started half mesmerized by her beauty she frowned prettily well if you prefer her features fuzzed then coalesced and it was electra in his arms she wore the same dress but it was loose on her where it had been tight on nada i can do it too you know she said maybe not as lusciously but metria he exclaimed i should have known you should have she agreed her features becoming those of the demoness she remained embracing him and her dress was tight again im ready to show you about the stork now but perhaps it will be better without clothes the dress dissolved into smoke and drifted away its done without clothes he asked somehow he wasnt really surprised usually so let me get yours off her hands began to work on his buttons he looked down her body was completely bare she wasnt wearing any panties rats the demoness had been too canny to ignore them she had dissolved them away with the rest of her clothing he had hoped for a moment that she would forget and he would finally catch a glimpse of the forbidden article even on a demoness it could have been quite a sight no such luck but that decided him he knew she wouldnt really show him the storks secret she would just tease him with faint suggestions of it until he burst from unrequited curiosity then she would laugh herself into smoke and drift away she had already teased him with the panties which she had never intended to show him there was no trusting a demoness no he said determined not to give her the satisfaction of making him burst im going on with the search but the foals not here she exclaimed i told you hes at the withacookee river with the goblins you also told me theres a hole in xanth he reminded her i dont believe you he was pretty sure she hadnt told him about the river but he didnt want to get into another dialogue with her she sighed and her clothing reappeared for a moment it was faintly translucent but when he tried to see through it to catch a glimpse of her panties it turned opaque and he saw nothing she was still teasing him he resumed ghost form and floated across the isle but there was no foal there could the demoness be telling the truth about this that che centaur was in goblin clutches if so he shouldnt dally here he should hurry right down to the river to help rescue the foal but he couldnt afford to believe the demoness because the moment he did it would turn out to be a lie the same was true for her story about the hole in xanth he would just have to complete his search of the elements they completed water and approached the void the pleasant water ended abruptly and beyond was nothing metria drew up just shy of the line look dolph youre a ghost and im a demoness but this is no ordinary region its not safe for even us to enter this is the event horizon the what finis kaput the point of no return you mean theres no crossing back whatever she agreed irritated but what if che centaur is in there then hell never come out you know that so its no good us going in there and getting trapped too why dont you do the expedient thing and believe me so we dont get into trouble that hole in xanth still needs to be plugged dolph looked at the void he knew he shouldnt believe her but what she said did seem to make sense he couldnt help che by getting lost himself still if che was in there you fool she exclaimed youre still thinking about stepping across that line well she became canny if you agree to go the other way i might forget to keep my panties hidden he was sure she was lying she probably never wore any panties anyway but the notion was demonishly tempting regardless all right show me your hole she paused for just half a moment and he realized that she must have found something funny in what he said then she lifted from the ground its south they zoomed back through the four regions until they were just south of the region of air and west of the territory of the flies the demoness dropped down into the jungle there did seem to be an odd section between trees see a monster has come through already she said pointing indeed there was something there it looked a little like an ogre and less like a man it seemed to have been patched together from scraps of people with pegs holding the pieces fast at the joints and a couple more pegs holding the head together it was marching around in a wobbly circle dolph landed before the thing and assumed his natural form what are you he asked where are you from the jaw hinges cranked open im the monster it rasped im looking for my master frankenstein well hes not here dolph said he must be on the other side of the hole why dont you go back and look for him without further word the thing turned and marched into the hole this was a shimmering ragged circle just above the ground with flickering darkness inside from above it had looked like a line but from the ground it looked like a tear in the scenerywhich was probably what it was the demoness had been telling the truth maybe the thing disappeared beyond the hole as if it had never existed but metria was right they didnt want any more such things coming through how do we plug the hole he asked i wouldnt know but you brought me here for this what was the point if you cant tell me what to do about it i brought you here because youre interesting in your assorted naivetes and idiocies and it amuses me to watch you tackle things you know nothing about she said ill be as satisfied to show you the way of stork summoning because i know youll make fumbles and blunders never before dreamt of in your kinds philosophy and that will be more entertaining than anything else i could think of at the moment but you dont want to play so this is next best i dont much care which problem you care to tackle first she was baiting him again the question was how much was true and how much false was this really a hole in xanth or just some odd natural effect she was using to confuse him maybe i should go on over to the withacookee river and help rescue che he said hoping he could learn something from her response yes that might be best she agreed i understand its getting pretty messy there and your betrothees are headed right into trouble nada and lectra he asked alarmed who else she said carelessly they went and asked the good magician where che was and he she broke into a chuckle whats so funny about that i think it made sense to ask him in case the rest of us didnt find the foal but he thought they were going to ask a different question she said still jiggling with the mirth of it what question he demanded knowing that if she responded he wouldnt like the answer how to resolve the problem of your betrothals he stared at her of course grey would think that why else would the two young women come to him a week before electras eighteenth birthday this business with ches foalknapping had come up so suddenly that grey murphy had probably been working on something else and never heard about it the real good magician humfrey would not have been caught unawares like that but grey tacked age and experience also he had ivy pestering him all the time that would drive anyone crazy dolph knew that from long experience as her brother so how did he answer then he got an indentured ghost to check around and spy the foal metria said but he couldnt tell them exactly just approximately so theyre probably going to get captured by the goblins too thats a bad region you know thats where the goblinate of the golden horde hangs out dolph knew the horde liked to torture and cook captives he and ivy had once had a runin with them if they caught nada and electra ill get right over there arent you forgetting something prince the demoness inquired yes the hole in xanth but youre probably lying about that how do you know im not lying about your betrothees that brought him up short it was impossible to tell when she spoke truth if you are ill youll what she asked interested that was a problem she was a demoness he could not touch her unless she wanted to be touched and he could not even insult her unless she chose to be insulted what could be threaten her with that would make her take note the only thing he could think of seemed too dumb to work so he tried it ill refuse to play your game any more he said ill tune you out so that nothing you can do or say will have any effect youll expire of absolute boredom ha you threatened that before you cant do it the stakes were not as high before now i can do it he hoped he couldand hoped that if he could she would capitulate he was really worried about nada and electra but worried about the hole in xanth too if one of her statements was correct he needed to know which one in a hurry so he could do something about it he knew that if he guessed he would guess wrong he always did so he stood there and concentrated on ignoring her knowing that it was his only chance and not much of a chance at that suppose i do this she asked she solidified into her most lusciously luscious shape and approached him he reminded himself that it was nada he loved and that nadas shape was just as good as this one and a lot more honest he put his hand to his mouth and yawned suppose i do this she asked embracing him and kissing him on the mouth it was disgustingly pleasant she could kiss as well as nada could he stood there not reacting he was amazed that he could do it but he reminded himself that this was not nada but a mere pesky demoness who would laugh at him if he fell for it or this then it was the image and form and feel of nada embracing him shes only the demoness he thought ftut blast and somehow managed to not react well then i think ill just strip down to my panties she remarked stepping slightly away he hung on knowing that she was bluffing she didnt want to violate the adult conspiracy somehow he managed to lock his eyes in place and not look in nadas form yet she said i wonder what color her panties are that almost got him but he clung to the fading belief that metria didnt actually know what color nadas panties were so could not duplicate them he felt as if his eyes were yanking themselves out of his head being so eager to look just in case the demoness wasnt bluffing if he lost tins contest the real nada might be in deadly danger that kept him firm there was a pause very well dolph you win she said after a bit stop ignoring me and ill tell you the truth this one time demons honor was that to be trusted he suspected that if it wasnt hen nothing about her was he gambled okay which is the true threat they both are but the hole is more immediate and worse your betrothees are threatened with being cooked in maybe a few hours but if a monster comes through that hole all xanth will be threatened with worse but a monster might not come through that hole he argued then id be better off going to the girls right now i suspect that this is a significant trial of conscience for you dolph she said i am always interested in observing such things having no conscience myself you know you should marry electra but probably wont you know you should do what is good for xanth but probably will go seek your girls instead with luck you might time it so that the goblins have captured them but not yet eaten them they might be in the process of stripping them down for the pot and you could see nadas panties just before you rescued her youre tormenting me again he accused her you promised to react if i told you the truth well this is the truth isnt it he had to admit it was he knew that his secret motives were unbecoming but they were there so what should i do he asked lamely you should plug the hole but then if i did the right thing and married electra i might never get to see nadas panties true prince oh fudge he exclaimed wishing he knew a fouler word but somehow all the centaur education he had received had not added anything to his childhood vocabulary in certain respects some men could turn the air blue with their language and a harpy could make a painted surface blister with a single fowlmouthed expletive but the best he could do was bring the trace of a smile to a ladys lips he couldnt even get rid of a curse burr without changing to a form with scales that the burrs couldnt cling to youre so cute when you struggle with right and wrong metria remarked would it help you to do the right thing and remain here to plug the hole if i assumed nadas likeness and donned panties hey yes forget it prince id rather see you struggle somehow he had known she would say that she would not help him at all except to encourage him to do something he would regret whatever that might be she delighted in seeing his dilemma but maybe there was a way out of it there was no obvious way to plug the hole so maybe he couldnt do much here anyway he could assume roc form fly to the good magicians castle and tell them about the hole then he could fly to the withacookee river and rescue the girls that way he could do the right thing and still maybe catch a glimpse of something showed at the hole it looked like a cross between a man and a demon but worse than either its arms looked like tentacles and its three huge eyes glared out with such malevolence that dolph was terrified the demoness had not been fooling this was a monster that could wreak havoc in xanth maybe youre right metria said its time to get out of here no way dolph said walking toward the monster but you could get hurt hereand worse so could i that thing is part demon then get out of here and stop distracting me dolph gritted what form would be best to tackle this thing maybe an ogre i dont understand you metria said suddenly without thinking at all youre doing the right thing of course you dont understand youre not human are you going to help me deal with this thing yes not because its the right thing to do but because i might learn more about the mysterious workings of the feeble human mind she became a grotesque horned demon with outsized claws and came at the monster from another side the monster swiveled one eye to orient on her while the other two focused on dolph metria froze in place while dolph felt a huge and awful chill the monster was monstrous in mind as well as body and was mesmerizing them both dolph couldnt move but he could still change forms he became a basilisk whose very gaze was deadly to mortal creatures that should set the monster back the two giant eyes blinked then a tentacle arm reached for dolph a toothy maw opened the thing was going to eat the basilisk metria meanwhile remained immobile that third eye held her fixed where she was dolph became a picklepuss with pickly green puss and brinemoist eyes anything it touched would be pickled and anything that tried to eat it would find it disgustingly bad tasting more tentacles came and wrapped around the picklepuss the monster was going to eat it anyway maybe it even liked being pickled dolph was hauled in to the maw he became a sphinx with the body of a lion and the head of a man sphinxes ordinarily were peaceful creatures not much for combat but they were very big the monsters mouth closed on something that was many times its own size the sphinx hide was too thick for the teeth to puncture they got stuck and the monster couldnt let go dolph sat down since the monsters mouth was fastened to his backside this meant that he sat on the monsters face his bulk spread out to cover all three eyes im free metria exclaimed moving at last you broke its eye contact go fetch some tangle vines dolph told her with his huge human mouth well tie it up and plug the hole with it she vanished would she do it she might decide that she had better folk to torment elsewhere he could hold the monster as long as he sat on it but he couldnt leave without freeing it he didnt want to sit forever then the demoness reappeared with a squirming mass of vines she used them to wrap around the monster some she put over its eyes their suckers fastening the eyes closed then she hammered the teeth that were embedded in dolph s posterior so that he could get up he assumed ogre form picked up the trussed monster and jammed it into the hole then the two of them used more vines to anchor it there so that it could neither enter nor exit xanth it had become the plug that was very brave and smart of you prince metria said i am amazed so am i he admitted but how did you manage to be so manly when you had been so boyly before dolph pondered im not sure i guess i just did what had to be done she shook her head you remain as much of a mystery as ever each time i think you are hopeless you evince a modicum of amplitude of what dimension magnitude scope largeness she said fretfully potential whatever i am disgusted you should be he said obscurely satisfied now i suppose you feel free to go rescue your betrothees and try to sneak a glimpse of someones panties right he said and assumed the form of a swift hawk he launched into the air and headed west toward the withacookee river he was pleased to see that the demoness did not follow chapter chexs checks chex was about to resume her circuit when a ghost appeared oh hello ghorge she said surprised what are you doing away from the good magicians castle the ghost opened his mouth but there was no sound he needs a sheet of paper grundy said hes a ghost writer remember oh mats right chex hurried to fetch the paper she set it on the table in a moment the handwriting appeared in ghorges fancy script the foal is at the withacookee river nada naga and electro are going there now oh i must go there right away chex exclaimed vastly relieved but the ghost hadnt finished his message more writing was appearing on the paper magician grey believes there may be danger if you go che is the captive of goblins and if the gobs see a winged centaur flying in grundy said faster than the ghost could write theyll know whose mother she is and if they are the goblins of the golden horde chex concluded grimly theyll cook first and argue later or dunk him in their hate spring grundy agreed they would find it very funny if you rescued him and he hated you very funny chex echoed hollowly greys warning was unfortunately well taken she dared not show herself there until che was out of their grubby hands certainly nada and electra would do their best one could assume the form of a deadly serpent and the other could shock anyone she touched but we can tell the other searchers grundy said at least we know that che is all right and that help is on the way yes she agreed a sinking feeling in her heart thank you ghorge for your message welcome the ghost wrote and was gone there was one remaining note on the paper in a corner evidently a doodle a crude sketch of a valley between mountains and the word cleavage maybe the ghost had been impressed by the gap chasm as he zipped over it chex picked grundy up set him on her back and trotted outside she flicked herself so hard it stung and launched into the air she was going to make this one fast circuit then she was going to fly to mount rushmost where cheiron was at the winged monster convention and tell him he would certainly want to be advised at this stage and anyway she needed the moral support the ogre was still crashing his way north the goblins do have him chex called hovering low somewhere near the withacookee river me no mind me find he replied cheerfully if he did the goblins would surely forget about che because the oncoming ogre would be bad news for them chex flew on somewhat reassured yet she wondered how the goblins could have the foal when there had been no sign of that before she was not about to question greys message she just wondered maybe che had fallen into their hands later but in that case who had abducted him disquieting questions remained she found the milkweed maids without trouble but didnt urge them to go to the river they were innocent girls who had no business near goblins chex moved on around the circuit advising the searchers then cut north was dolph still in the elements she hardly cared to go in there to tell him he would just have to wait for the news until he emerged none of them had really expected che to be in there anyway now she could head for mount rushmost she turned and flew south her wings were tiring because she had been flying a lot today but she was determined to reach cheiron only then could she relax slightly there were some scattered white clouds in the sky they were harmless and even friendly in their fashion then she spied one black one angling as if to cut her off she hoped that wasnt fracto grundy said should have known he must have seen the activity and wants to interfere cumulo fracto nimbus the worst of clouds the last thing she wanted to encounter at this stage there was little doubt now that he had spied her for he was swelling up like the gaseous toad he was and sending out ugly vapors he might not know why she was flying south but he intended to mess her up regardless the worst thing was that she was tired she doubted she had the strength to fly straight through him maybe go to ground and trot a while grundy suggested he didnt want to get blown out of the air any more than she did that will take too long she replied fretfully its deep jungle there not even any magic paths we could run afoul of ground monsters if dont dare fly because of the storm they could be a real problem as well as slowing us true he agreed i could ask the local plants for the best route but it would still be slow he pondered a while fortunately he was small so his pondering was short and just as bad trying to fly around fracto he said im afraid so he can expand at a great rate in fact hes doing it now then that leaves us only one route if youre up to it im up to anything that will get us safely through she said whats your notion fly over the cloud he may not have much strength up where the airs thin chex glanced up suddenly uncertain what about us where the airs thin it doesnt get that thin does it didnt you fly to the moon when you married cheiron the honey side of it she agreed remembering it with fondness but theres a channel there the air clusters around the moon especially when its low in the sky well its low now he said indeed the day was late and the moon was venturing out into daylight even if you didnt make it too high for the cloud you could land on the moon and rest for just long enough to get your wind back fracto wont hang around the moon much because he knows he cant blow it out of the sky and he doesnt like to look silly trying could be certainly no better prospect offered chex flicked herself again making her body so light that it just about floated up by itself and pumped her wings strongly she rose she hoped it would not be necessary to fly as high as the moon that route would be faster than the ground route but it would be best if she could make it though without stopping fracto saw her climbing he swelled up even more rapidly his cloud face forming eye patches and a frowning mouth region he blew out a wet gale trying to mess her up try that again cabbagebreath grundy called oh no the golem just couldnt resist hurling a good insult grundy had battled fracto before and they had a longstanding feud now the cloud would try even harder indeed fracto did bubblelike excrescences formed on his surface indicating the fury of his turbulence keep at it toadface grundy called encouragingly you going to wet on somebody next dont aggravate him chex gasped as she tried desperately to climb out of reach aw its better to work him up grundy said then he loses what little wit he has and is even easier to outsmart fracto evidently heard that because he sent out such a gust of sleetspeckled wind that chex almost did a somersault is that your best shot smogrear grundy demanded what made you think you could blow up anything more than a teakettle better go back for trainingor training pants grundy i wish you wouldnt chex started but she was cut off by the clouds furious blast of snow for a moment she was blinded and wasnt sure which way was up then her head emerged from it and she discovered that she was higher than before it lifted us she exclaimed thats the idea grundy said might as well use fractos energy instead of yours then to the cloud is that what you call a squall even a dumb anvil head can do better than that but fracto was finally catching on instead of blowing again he simply concentrated on building up his mass higher and higher the air was not thin but chex still couldnt get over the storm what a view grundy exclaimed chex looked down the panoply of xanth lay beneath them just like one of her dams maps chem centaurs magic talent was map projection and she had explored most of xanth in the course of perfecting her maps now the long coastal outline showed clearly except where fractos grotesque burgeoning mass blotted it out and the nebulous region to the north where it was possible to cross into mundania not that any sensible person would want to do a thing like that the sea extended out featureless except for the bits of cloud floating above it part of the great gap chasm showed and it did resemble cleavage just as the ghost writer had noted the overall scene was beautiful she should have done this before just to enjoy the view but of course she had remained mostly landbound because che couldnt yet fly what an experience awaited him when his wings formed well enough for the heights i guess well have to stop at the moon grundy said sounding not too regretful well ive always wanted to visit the big cheese chex had had no intention of visiting the moonnot without cheiron but she seemed to be stuck for it she was getting dangerously fatigued and had to rest she doubted she could even get down to the ground without fracto blowing her into the sea so she angled to the side and flew straight toward it fortunately she was now higher than the moon so the effort of reaching it was not great fracto saw what she was doing and tried to stop her but he couldnt grow fast enough to block both mount rushmost and the moon and knew that she would zip past him and fly south if he gave her the chance so he could only blow snow at her there was a crack of thunder then a lightning bolt zapped past her oopsfracto had more than snow to hurl you missed sizzlesnoot the golem cried gleefully grundy chex hissed dont worry old diaperbottom couldnt hit anything smaller than xanth itself and half the time he misses that too the golem said reassuringly then a bolt zapped just past his head singeing his hair lucky shot vaporbrain he yelled but his confidence seemed slightly shaken he kept quiet while chex winged on toward the moon the moon was somewhat larger than it appeared from the ground because of the special inanimate magic called perspective each object and part of the landscape liked to think it was larger than it was so it pretended that everything else was smaller and the farther away anything was the smaller it could safely be considered thus some quite large objects were made to seem quite small by those far enough away to get away with such belittling the moon was at a serious disadvantage in this respect because it was far away from everything else so had no supporters it got even by pretending that the whole of xanth was small the moon was actually big enough to walk and run on and a number of flying centaurs could camp on itif there only had been more than two to do it but in time there would be che chex had a horrible thought when che got old enough to mate who would there be certainly he could not do it with a sister before chex there had been only cheiron and chex herself derived from mixed ancestry well maybe mere could be another mixed mating to produce another winged centaur but it seemed doubtful because chem had been unusually liberal for her kind and perhaps no other centaur would consider crossbreeding unless one happened to run afoul of a love spring watch it mare grundy cried chex realized that she was about to land in a big dish of thoroughly moldy semiliquid cheese the smell was terrible she pumped her leaden wings and lurched up but came down almost immediately in another dish of cheese this one wasnt moldy but the smell was if anything worse it couldnt be helped she landed squarely on all four hooves and slid to a gooky stop ugh grundy said did you have to pick limburger he was right she saw the slimy little limbs embedded in it chex folded her wings and stepped ahead each foot came out with a slurp and a belch of awful odor those must have been zombie limbs used to prepare this batch what a mess she had had no idea that the near side of the moon was this bad she wanted to hold her breath but was still breathing hard from her exertion a horse appeared it was midnight black and not glossy it was hard to see at all it trotted toward them purposefully suddenly chex was dreaming in her dream a jetblack centaur mare appeared what are you doing here in my retreat she demanded astonished chex could only answer who are you i am mare nectaris and this is the sea of nectar where i relax between deliveries you are tracking it up youre a night mare chex exclaimed of course and you are out of your pasture arent you im chex centaur and i was trying to fly to mount rushmost but fracto the evil cloud blocked my way and i had to detour fracto no wonder my cheese is all gooky from the last time he rained on it and the moon is supposed to be dry he has no respect at all thats right chex agreed i have an urgent mission and he very well i can see its not your fault come over here to my fountain and wash off your hooves then chex snapped awake and saw the black mare leading the way to a much smaller disk where water squirted up relieved she followed the fountain was big enough so that chex was able to stand in it and get her feet entirely clean beyond was a region where the cheese was dry and hard probably sunbaked cheddar so she could walk on it without getting gunked thank you so much mare nectaris she said i really am sorry i landed in your cheese i need to move on as quickly as i can she looked up one of the odd things about the moon was that it made xanth seem up instead of down probably that was more of the magic of perspective but there was fracto staying right between her and mount rushmost he wasnt going to let her get through without a hassle the dream reappeared we dont like fracto the black centaur lady said he tries to interfere with our delivery of bad dreams he cant touch us physically of course but he fogs everything up so its hard for us to see where were going that puts us behind schedule so that the dreams may be delivered late in the night and sometimes folk even wake up and remember them that is bad form and we get the blame i suppose theres nothing you can do about it chex said worrying about how long it would be before she could get through to cheiron if only fracto hadnt picked this occasion to get difficult that was his magic to appear at the very worst time for anyone else how absolutely maddening it was to be stuck here like this unable to get around the evil cloud i wish you could give him a bad dream mare nectaris was so surprised that the dream dissolved but in a moment it reappeared i wonder if we could that would be a dream come true if you will pardon the expression chex had made the remark in an offhoof manner not taking it seriously herself now she reconsidered well are your dreams limited to living folk fracto is a demon as i understand who assumed cloud form and crowned himself king of the clouds i suppose the real clouds are too fleecygentle to make an issue of the matter but if youi mean do demons dream demons dont dream nectaris said but fracto is no longer exactly a demon because of all the natural cloud substance he has clothed himself with maybe that would make him mortal enough to dream let me ask the night stallion she trotted to a gourd she had at the edge of her sea of cheese she disappearedand the dream ended chex was standing alone except for grundy who didnt count so this is where the night mares spend their time off the golem exclaimed i never dreamed it i suppose it makes sense chex said they cant work all the time and they do have the seas of the moon named after them and this gives them a chance to peek at xanth by day im surprised i was able to see nectaris they must relax their invisibility here as they do in the gourd im glad to meet one when shes off duty she doesnt seem at all frightening but of course mare imbri isnt frightening either well shes a day mare shes not supposed to scare folk but she once was a night mare i wonder who has her moon sea now mare nectaris reappeared it was evident that the gourds served as a handy direct route to the realm of dreams no matter where they were the dream reformed the stallion says to try it the centaur mare exclaimed he doesnt like fracto either great grundy cried it seemed that he received the dream just as chex did give him a mental hotfoot get him out of there and we can go on to mount rushmost that was exactly what chex wanted but she was sensibly cautious how long will it take to fashion a suitable bad dream for fracto oh not more than a few days the mare replied we want this to be a truly effective dream fracto has a lot to answer for that was what she had feared but i need to get past that evil cloud now or at least very soon but a dream cant be crafted in a hurry nectaris protested the workers in the gourd are craftsmen no inferior bad dream receives the stallions stamp of approval chex stamped her own hoof in frustration i cant wait more than a few hours my foal is the captive of goblins and i must tell cheiron who will know what to do that is not our concern the black centaur replied we have no onus against you but we cannot compromise our standards of dreamsmanship the night stallion maybe i had better talk to the night stallion chex said desperately i have to make him understand ixnay grundy murmured at her ear i dont care how fearsome he may be to others chex continued heedlessly my foals in awful danger and i must get through there are some big gourds mat can be used for transport the black centaur said but none on the moon you would have to get down to the ground first chex gazed at xanth fracto waited uglier than ever she spread her wings tentatively the cloud rumbled i can translate that grundy said he says make my day clodhead chex could have survived without that translation not only that her wings were still too tired for more than the merest coasting she needed more time to rest them and she needed fracto gone yes i must talk to the stallion chex decided we need a dream crafted in the next two hours and i dont care what it takes ouch grundy murmured youve done it now wingsforbrains the night stallion is trouble with a capital offense there was a shimmer before them this resolved itself into the statue of a giant stallion mounted on a pedestal this was trojan the horse of another color what brings you here quarterbreed the statue demanded without moving its mouth this was a stronger dream they now seemed to be in a fancy pavilion fracto the evil cloud blocks my way and i had to land here to rest chex said bravely though daunted by the dread apparition i want to drive fracto away with a bad dream so i can continue my flight to mount rush most so cheiron can help me save our foal i dont give one dropping about your foal the statue said you have no business on this side of the moon now were in for it grundy muttered and you golem the stallion said did you not advise her against this trespass leave him out of this chex said we had no choice all i want is a fast dream do i have to craft it myself the stallion glowed slightly with ire it will cost you half your two souls just to get free of here do you wish to lose the other halves as well half my soul chex exclaimed shocked i told you grundy moaned he doesnt fool around this is outrageous chex fumed all i want is the chance to rescue che but she remembered now that was the price of getting out of the world of the gourd in certain circumstances she hadnt realized that landing on this side of the moon would be so expensive the stallion blinked his eyelids did not move the whole statue flickered who che my foal the goblins have him and i must get help to rescue him if i have to throw away my soul in the process then so be it but i have to get on my way soon the chosen of the simurgh the stallion said i had not realized we must facilitate your progress without penalty what a break grundy whispered his relief about twice as big as he was we keep our souls if i can just rest a little and then fly on to mount rushmost chex said thats all the facilitation i need but if it takes a bad dream to move fracto off it takes time to craft a proper bad dream the stallion said the mares do not make the dreams they only carry them though at times they must add dreams from the common pool if the effect is not sufficient an inferior dream would not properly disturb fracto who is bound to be a tough client two days is the minimum we can do it chex saw that he was being candid now she realized that routine dreams f toothy dragons or ugly spooks would not do the job it would require something very special to bother a cloud it was a real problem if she wanted fast service she would have to figure out a way to craft an effective dream in a hurry then she had a notion so bright that the bulb shattered over her head mare nectaris flinched fractohes not like other creatures chex said he hates good things he hates happiness yes the stallion agreed that is why a phenomenally horrendous dream must be crafted it will require the most terrible elements we can muster integrated so as to leave no ray of hope of pleasure no it wont she exclaimed it will take a happy dream youre crazy featherface grundy said if fractos happy hell stay forever not so chex said the happier it is the worse fracto will feel because thats his nemesis the joy of others if he is faced with a happy scene he cant rain out he will flee in high dudgeon the stallion was amazed mare i think you are correct reverse psychology but we are not equipped to make a happy dream maybe i can think of one chex said i am a happy person normally and the sets the stallion continued every scene has to be recorded with the proper background with talented models we dont have happy ones but you must have scraps and snippets cut from prior dreams that werent nasty enough for your purpose she said eagerly if those were collected together there might be an almostnice effect you could use up all those wasted bits perhaps he agreed uncertainly but the time it shouldnt take much time just to assemble them she argued theyve already been made they just need to be tied together the real challenge is the main sequence something so sickeningly sweet that fracto will be revolted our models could not manage anything like that the stallion said it would make them be revolted but could they pantomime she asked if grundy and i spoke the words say the golem said getting interested possibly the stallion agreed reluctantly very well collect your sets and models and ill try to come up with a suitable narrative the stallion seemed bemused do it he said to mare nectaris and shimmered out of view the dream sequence abruptly ended and chex found herself standing with grundy otherwise alone by the lake of cheese the minions of the night were doing their part now she had to come through with her part what kind of a dream could she make which she and grundy could narrate that the horrendous actors of the gourd could pantomime her mind was blank grundy you must have a notion she said youve talked with creatures all over xanth whats the most sickeningly sweet story you ever heard that was your courtship of cheiron centaur he said promptly she refrained from flicking him hard with her tail they were not as heavy here on the moon for some magical reason and she was afraid that if she made him lighter he would fly into the air and she would have to take off after him and fracto would get them both that wasnt worth the effort especially since it was now getting dark and it would be hard to see their way anyway it was probably his notion of a compliment aside from that she said probably the tale of the princess and the dragon he said the bird that told me that one swore he had seen it happen himself but im not sure why not she asked innocently because he was a lyrebird this time she did flick him fortunately he hung on to her mane and did not fly off into fractos waiting storm tell me the tale she said grimly she knew that she could not afford to be overly choosy at this point there was a lovely princess who met a strange handsome foreign prince he began she listened attentively until the conclusion and so they lived happily ever after i think youre right she said at the end thats so nice a tale it will drive fracto right up the wall and into distraction but well have to fit him into it so that he identifies but hell just rain on it the golem protested no the beauty of a dream is that a person has to dream it its way not his own way otherwise no one would even tolerate a bad dream he will be there but unable to rain on the proceedings grundy nodded appreciatively you have a diseased mind thank you now we must rehearse our parts so that when the night stallion gets his act together we are ready to animate the dream i will take the female parts and you the male parts remember dont overact what we want is verisimilitude what plausibility i thought you knew all words in all languages i do i wasnt sure you did again she refrained from flicking him all centaurs had competent vocabulary as he knew perhaps you confused me with a certain demoness who has trouble getting her words straight no youre not as pretty as d metria what an effort to keep her tail still and not half as mischievous either she agreed now remember this will be a narrated play in essence the stallion will provide the actors but we must speak their parts because there is no time for rehearsal and we dont want to have to do it more than once some dreams are like that so there is precedent we can adlib but we have to stay with the general story line can you play it straight for once look chex can do it if i want to he said annoyed i know you have to do this to get to cheiron and save your foal i may have an offspring of my own some day yes of course she agreed quickly i apologize grundy thank you he seemed surprised evidently he did not receive many apologies now lets see just how good a dream we can do and they worked on the details waiting for the stallions return in due course the stallion arrived and with him a troupe of denizens of the gourd bearing assorted props soon the region was littered with painted scenes of pleasant glades and beaches and little containers of dream fragments a larger pavilion was erected shrouded by cheesecloth so that fracto would not be able to see what was being done here just how is a dream recorded or animated chex asked we have camcorders the stallion explained showing a creature with a lenslike snoot they note all details of a scene and the mares take the finished dreams to their recipients when you are ready to record a scene just say take one and when you want to end it say cut they will do it chex wasnt sure about this but had to assume that the stallion knew his business first we want some nice background scenes of a lovely castle and mountain with flowers can this be done so that it looks alive i mean not like a picture certainly hows this the stallion wiggled an ear and a mare stepped forward suddenly there was a dream it was of an omate mountain with a path spiraling up it and castle roogna perched at the very top that wasnt exactly what chex had had in mind but it would do there were flowers at the base of the mountain at least and a separate scene chex said as the dreamlet ended an escarpment or barren rocky place where a dragon might live after a moment there was another dream scene of just such a place it was by a raging sea and evidently intended for a fearofdrowning dream but the overall scene was perhaps too pretty to inspire proper fear thus it was a reject and perfect for her purpose now the actors she said we need a lovely princess a sinisterly handsome man a dragon and a pair of unicorns as well as some bit parts they were available but not naked chex said human folk are funny about such things they are almost always clothed the man must have a functional but obviously highclass suit and the woman a quality dress with a revealing dйcolletage what the stallion asked a low neckline chex drew a finger across her breasts to indicate where the line crossed the upper swell of them human folk pay a good deal of attention to that line as they do to the bottom line ah yes we have a financial stress section where we fashion dreams for export to mundania wrong bottom lines are i meant the hem of the skirt the higher it is the more intriguing it seems to be to human folk yeah grundy breathed you ever look at nada nagas top and bottom lines when shes in human form this is an odd business exploring human desires instead of human fears the stallion grumbled but he rousted up the clothing and in due course the naked actors were suitably clothed chex had the princess and man stand near the castle said take one and started the narration it did not go perfectly and they did have to do a take two for some of it but overall chex was satisfied with the session in the course of two hours they had the dream in the can as the stallion put it they ran the whole thing through one time to be sure that it was satisfactory all of them watched sharing what was perhaps the most positive dream the proprietors of bad dreams had made the princess appeared at the base of the mountain picking nice flowers suddenly the handsome sinister prince appeared oh she exclaimed in chexs voice you startled me fear not lovely creature the prince said in grundys voice i have not come to hurt you but to love you for you are the most delicious princess i have seen the princess turned her big shining eyes on him flattered others have not found me so indeed i am riot married and i am almost twentyone i do not regard that as regrettable the prince said come we must get to know each other better soon they knew each other better for the weather was fair the only cloud in the scene was so white and fluffy that it would not have been able to rain on anything no matter how hard it tried indeed faced with such excellent weather they fell in love i must tell you something the prince said gravely and ask you something which i fear you will not like oh i hope it is not that you are not a prince she exclaimed horrified or that you do not love me no it is neither of these things he reassured her i am indeed a prince and i do love you but i fear your love for me will suffer when you hear what i have to say and ask the princess thought that he would say that he was from an enemy kingdom and that he wished to marry her since she was frankly bored with the local scene and found the daily return climb up the mountain to be arduous she expected to express only token dismay at the prospect even if her father the king were miffed tell me and ask me my love she breathed she was very good at breathing and this had been so ever since she turned fourteen and donned an adult offtheshoulder dress i am not a man he said i am a dragon i assumed human form only to cause you to love me it is one of three transformations i am able to make but you told me you were a prince she exclaimed dismayed lam a prince he replied a prince of dragons once i attain my majority i will be the king of dragons for my sire was recently chomped by a hostile poisonous sea serpent and is indisposed the princess considered i really had not anticipated this development she confessed but i suppose a prince is a prince what is it you wish to ask me for it seemed to her that it was better to marry a dragon than a commoner i must undergo a rite of passage in order to attain my majority and become king he said must resume my natural form and consume a lovely innocent princess this is a thing required of all royal dragons will you come to be eaten the princess experienced a somewhat greater dismay than before she had not anticipated this development either she had rather hoped for a different type of question i will really have to go and ask my father she demurred by all means the dragon prince agreed it isnt wise to make a decision as important as this without consultation i will depart and await you one week hence at the escarpment by the sea if you decide not to come i will understand he kissed her and departed the princess made the arduous climb to the castle at the top of the mountain she went to the king and explained the situation i met this wonderful prince o sagacious father she said breathlessly for she remained exercised from the climb but he is a dragon prince and wishes to consume me should i go to him at the escarpment by the sea next week for that well that depends o innocent daughter the king replied do you love him yes father do you love him enough to die for him she considered for it was not an easy question she really would have preferred an easier question yes father i suppose i do then i suppose you must go to him the king said evincing a certain regret but i fear we shall miss you perhaps you should consult with your mother the queen that had not occurred to her so the princess thanked him for the suggestion and repaired to the queen what the queen demanded the princess repeated the statement thank you the queen said i didnt hear you before but im not sure i approve what are the credentials of this dragon is he really a prince the princess assured her that he was the queen considered i am afraid still dont approve i can not forbid you this thing being only a woman but if you insist on it dont think to return to my region of the castle thereafter the princess was saddened by her mothers disapproval but realized that she was unlikely to have much occasion to return to the castle after her tryst with the dragon prince when the appointed day came the princess garbed herself in her finest raiment wearing a dress whose dйcolletage was so low and whose hem was so high that the dragon should have little difficulty seeing the most delectable parts of her to bite first after all she loved him and wanted him to be pleased with her she brushed out her marvelously silken tresses and set a ruby tiara on her head its color suggestive of the blood she proposed to shed for her beloved she touched a bit of red rose perfume behind her ears and in die hollow of her cleavage its odor also suggestive of that color all in all she thought she had done a creditable job for the occasion she set out afoot for though it was a fair walk her father had informed her that he did not care to risk a fine horse too near the dragon after all those creatures are notorious he said once they get the taste of blood they are apt to attack anything in view she had had to concede the validity of this caution in due course tired and dusty but still bravely beautiful the princess reached the escarpment the dragon prince had not yet arrived for she had allowed sufficient travel tune and was a few minutes ahead of schedule so she paused to repowder her face and wipe the dust from her slippers so as to be as presentable as was feasible she wanted her beloveds last sight of her to be a pleasant one something caught her eye in the mirror as she touched up her nose there was something off to the side behind the escarpmentsomething that had made a glint in the morning sunlight she peered more closely at the reflection in the mirror for it would be unbecoming to turn her head and stare directly she saw that it was the shiny helmet of a mercenary soldier curious for there seemed to be no purpose in a mercenary deployment at this site she used her mirror to check farther soon she was assured there was an entire troop of mercenaries armed with swords and shields this deepened the mystery what could they want here then the dragon appeared in the distant sky winging his way toward the escarpment suddenly it occurred to the princess that this could be an ambush sent by her father to slay the dragon it was she now recalled the way his cunning mind worked it was quite possible that the queen had importuned him to do something and though of course the princess had no idea what sort of encouragement a woman could offer a man to do her will she had on occasion seen her father change his mind after a night with the queen she had hoped some day to ascertain how such persuasion was accomplished but that hope seemed academic now at any rate it did seem that the dragon prince was likely to be in trouble if he landed here she ran to the very brink of the escarpment frantically waving her arms o prince dragon she screamed though it was not considered truly princessly to scream do not land there is an ambush the dragon prince heard her and shied off he made a loop above the landing field evidently in doubt how to proceed he would not be able to complete his rite of passage if he did not land yet it seemed distinctly awkward to do so curses the leader of the mercenaries cursed the tart has given us away therell be lucifer to pay if the dragon gets away well at least we can have our sport with the woman a mercenary remarked with a certain enthusiasm the mercenaries marched toward the princess alarmed she retreated but they cut her off they looked hungry though they surely had eaten well before the ambush the nearest one reached for her the princess screamed and fell helplessly to the ground the dragon prince evidently disturbed by this spectacle abruptly made up his mind he wheeled and came directly in on a strafing run he sent out a blast of flame that singed the princesss lovely tresses as it passed over her but bathed the standing mercenaries in fire in a moment they were roasted as it were in the shells of their armor the princess perturbed by the smell got up and tried to leave the scene but the smoking bodies were all around her so she leaped off the escarpment catch me o my beloved she cried as she fell toward the churning sea below my hair is burnt but my flesh is not i remain excellent eating im sure and if not then you can drop me in the heaving sea and seek another princess the dragon maneuvered expertly and swooped down to catch her in his great jaws but he did not crunch her in half perhaps because at least one of the pieces would have fallen into the water he carried her unharmed into the sky there was a small dark cloud present but the wind was wrong and the storm was unable to present any difficulties the cloud seemed oddly perturbed at that he bore her away to a distant isle and there he landed and set her gently down i am glad they did not get you she said for i love you whatever your form and would not have you suffer i cannot eat you now the dragon prince said with a certain regret but why not o my love she inquired because you have lost your innocence i must consume an innocent maiden princess to complete my rite of passage but what did i do she cried distraught you betrayed your fathers ambush but they would have hurt you she protested undoubtedly but a true innocent would not have betrayed them to an enemy she hung her head ashamed you must be right for i feel dirtied yet i fear i would do it again given opportunity for my love for you will not be denied i am sorry i failed you in this i had wanted so much to be pristine for you perhaps it is for the best he said philosophically for i had already come to the conclusion that i could not eat you and in that i betrayed my own trust you could not why because i love you as you love me now i dare not show my snoot back in dragonland for i have shown myself to be unworthy of my calling im so sorry she said sympathetically now we both are in trouble for surely i can not return to my kingdom after this whatever shall we do i think there is no help for it but that we marry and settle down to live happily ever after he said with regret but i can not marry you in that form she protested also i would not enjoy living on this isle without benefit of castle and servants are you sure you dont want to return you to your castle he asked there at least you will have the princessly things to which you are accustomed no for my father the king would be most wroth with me for betraying his ambush and my mother the queen told me not to return the dragon pondered i do have two remaining transformation spells he said after a moment i could use them to transform us to similar creatures would you like to be a dragoness and eat people i prefer not what about a more benign form such as a unicorn you are enamored of unicorns he asked surprised naturally all innocent young women are then i shall make us both unicorns he said that way we shall be recognized by neither of our kingdoms and will be able to range here on the isle of view i love you too she agreed then he invoked the spells and he became a fine handsome unicorn stallion who looked rather like the night stallion with a horn and she became a lovely unicorn mare who resembled the night mare nectaris they lived happily ever after and it never stormed there for their love made all clouds fleecy and all rains gentle no matter how ardently those clouds might wish to be otherwise what do you think chex inquired as the sweet dream ended will that horrify fracto the stallion shook his head we have no experience with this sort of thing you would have to ask the day mares i dont think so she said we are dealing with reverse psychology here fracto hates being balked grundy said and he hates sweetness it should infuriate him lets hope so chex said we shall just have to try it i thank you gourd folk for your effort even if it does not prove effective the stallion glanced at mare nectans take that dream to fracto he said we shall watch its effect mare nectaris touched the dream capsule with her nose it vanished then she leaped through the roof of the pavilion and galloped through the air toward the monstrous cloud the pavilion faded out it was light on the surface of the moon but there seemed to be a spell to make the group of them invisible so fracto would not know chex was interested to see that moonlight did not bother the night mares but she realized that this was logical as they had always gone abroad at night whether the moon was in sight or hiding the mare disappeared into the darkness surrounding the malignant cloud but fracto himself remained visible he was snoozing which meant he was just right for delivery of the dream chex suffered increasing doubts could this wild notion succeed a sweet dream to a mean cloud fracto flickered the dream was starting something flickered at the side chex looked and saw the dream playing on the surface of a hardcheese rock as if it were a hypnogourd she could monitor what fracto was experiencing that was nice the princess was meeting the prince the weather was nice fracto watching from the vantage of a dark cloud was trying desperately to get over there and drench their encounter they would not find each other nearly so attractive if her hair were plastered across her face and his suit was shrinking rapidly out of fit but fracto couldnt move he seemed to be boxed in by adverse winds unable either to get into the action or to float away from the scene when the princess made her arduous climb up the mountain to the castle fracto strove to get above her and dump a bucket of water down her dcolletage that sort of thing really made princesses angry but his motion was like molasses and by the time he got there she was inside the castle he was so frustrated he hurled a thunderbolt at the castle but it only bounced off harmlessly now close to the castle he couldnt get away and had to listen to the princesss dumb dialogues with her father and mother he rumbled in rage but no one paid attention which made him madder than ever then the princess walked to the escarpment what an opportunity to soak her down but somehow he was able only to follow his raindrops pattering harmlessly behind her the princess got hot not wet and didnt even hear his ominous rumbling then she saw the dragon and warned him away from the ambush fracto tried to drown out her cries in thunder so that her warning would not be heard but he was frustratingly muted the dragon heard her and used his fire to scorch the soldiers which was a fun scene but what fracto really wanted to do was blow the beast out of the sky and he couldnt the princess leaped off the cliff the dragon caught her and the two flew away over the horizon while fracto followed helplessly even when they landed on the isle he couldnt blow them away because it was protected by enchantment he was so frustrated that he was ready to explode then they became two stupid unicorns and lived happily ever after munching the sweet grass and he still couldnt touch them not with a lightning bolt not with a frigid blast of air not even with a stinging hailstone it was too much fracto detonated his vapors spattered across the landscape and he was nothing but foul mist ugh what an awful dream chex peered into the darkness all she saw was stars and the lights of houses in xanth the evil cloud had dissipated it worked she cried the dream broke him up so it was a bad dream the night stallion said gratified i admit to having been concerned chex was now well rested by her hours on the moon i thank you stallion and mares she said now i must be on my way she spread her wings night flying wasnt her favorite mode but she could not afford to lose any more time many ill returns grundy called as they took off the flight was easy enough because it was mostly gliding in due course she spied the landing lights of mount rushmost and called out to the fireflies so that she was given clearance grundy knowing that no nonmonsters were allowed here hid himself in her mane and kept his mouth shut that was a relief in itself it occurred to her belatedly that magician murphys curse probably accounted for che being near the withacookee river instead of in the heart of the goblm camp whatever could go wrong with the goblin effort was going wrong still several wrongs did not necessarily make a right she had to get some positive action soon she was with cheiron telling him everything then at last she could relax knowing that he would know what to do it had been quite a day chapter jennys jeopardy jenny and che were tied up but not hobbled for the goblins didnt want to have to carry them their hands were bound and each had a rope around the neck when one slowed or stumbled a goblin would jerk cruelly on the rope hauling them along jenny was soaking muddy wet because of her dunking in the river and her new spectacles were spattered with dirty drops but they remained on her face and they helped her vision enormously she realized that her feeling was foolish for she was in horrible trouble but it gratified her to be able to see things so much better than ever before but even in her distress about being captured she found something odd these werent the same goblins as before where was godiva che she murmured as they stumbled through the jungle are no these are not the ones who foalknapped me the centaur replied i very much fear these are worse worse arent they all just as bad as anything no some tribes are less worse than others godiva did not treat me cruelly in fact she was looking for a more comfortable trail north when you rescued me these goblins are brutal and going south then where is the other group i suspect they are hiding goblins do not necessarily get along well with one another perhaps the others will suffer the same fate as we do if they are captured you mean i rescued you and only got you in worse trouble she asked chagrined that would be an unfair assertion you tried to help me and suffered misfortune i never realized she exclaimed the goblin holding her rope jerked it making her lurch to the side no talking in the ranks he snapped jenny could only hope that sammy had found help and that the help could find her and che before they got wherever these cruel creatures were taking them the goblins soon found a wellbeaten trail and hustled them rapidly along it it was as if they were a bit out of their territory and felt insecure that coupled with ches statement that these werent the ones who had captured him before made her wonder just what was going on she knew just about nothing about goblins but had somehow assumed that they were all the same elfsized monsters certainly godivas party had seemed evil if these were worse her legs grew tired with the constant walking she had been on them too much before any of this started it was also getting dark now but she had no choice she had to keep walking lest she be dragged along by her neck che seemed no better off he had four legs but more weight finally late at night they came to the goblin camp it was beside a dark lake with crude earth and rock huts in a semicircle the goblins pounded a wooden stake into the packed dirt and knotted the ropes that bound jenny and che to it they were tethered now jenny saw something in the sky it was huge and greenish white whats that she asked amazed che glanced up oh thats just the moon its almost full now the moon but its so big and wheres the other his brow furrowed the other what the other moon the small one there is no other moon this is the only one it comes out only at night except when its biggest and fattest when it has the courage to show itself at the edge of day it is made of green cheese which would spoil if it gotheated too much the sun in contrast is afraid of the dark so never comes out at night the only other items in the sky are the stars which are too small to accomplish much and of course the clouds i really am on another world jenny breathed dismayed she had known it before but somehow this confirmation made it worse how would she ever get home again even if they got away from these horrible goblins meanwhile other goblins were piling brush in a small fire pit the snoozing coals discovered the food and licked hungrily up through it soon there was a ferocious blaze that made the entire camp bright i wish i had been tutored more thoroughly in geography che said gazing at the great fire why jenny asked because this seemed irrelevant because then i would know exactly what goblin tribe this is and what its specialty of mischief is would that help us escape probably not but at least we would know what to expect then the goblins hauled a huge black pot to the fire and set it on a metal grate so that the flames licked up around it they brought buckets of water and dumped them into the pot the thing looked big enough to hold an elf girl and a small centaur i think we can guess jenny said feeling a chill despite the heat of the fire she wanted to scream and run but knew that it was pointless so she just sat there can you untie yourself che inquired jenny tested the rope that bound her hands behind her no they are good at knots perhaps i can untie you he said if you put your hands where mine can reach them what good would that do we are completely surrounded by goblins and im so tired i couldnt run very fast anyway if i can untie your hands then you can untie the rope at your neck then i can flick you with my tail and make you light enough to float then you can jump and sail away from here jenny realized that her weight had gradually returned after he had made her light on the raft that was one reason she was so tired now it was the weight but that lightness had enabled her to walk far faster and farther than she could have managed otherwise the same must have been true for che his magic didnt show to the goblins but it had saved the two of them from getting cruelly dragged still she had questions what about you if i could untie me i could untie you too but you said you cant fly yet true you should be able to grab on to the branch of a tree and hurl yourself further up and away escaping them but i would be unbearably clumsy and my body would get tangled in the branches and they would soon catch me again so i must remain here but i cant go without you she protested theyll cook you yes i suspect they will but at least you will be free one escape is better than none but i dont know my way around here she said i dont even know where sammy is surely he is finding help and if you remain clear of the goblins long enough that help will reach you that made sense also she realized that if she got free she might be able to do something to get him free too maybe there was another cherry tree nearby well we can try maybe we can both escape she turned and put her hands back and he reached down to work on the knot but in a moment he desisted i should have known its a magic knot only the goblins can untie it after what she had seen here jenny didnt doubt it somehow she wasnt all that surprised the goblins werent paying any attention to the two captives which meant they were either pretty stupid or pretty confident it seemed they werent stupid now the goblin chief tramped across to them well well what have we here he asked as if surprised to see them a funny little centaur and a funny little elf wench har har har well im chief grotesk goblin and i want you to know what kind of sport we mean to have with you jenny couldnt help looking at the huge pot on the fire we already know thank you she said tightly oh thats not for you two the chief said jenny perked up it isnt not this week would you deny us our sport we must see you bathe first it was true that jenny was good and dirty now but somehow she didnt trust this ill wait thanks to be sure har har har jenny was unable to see what grotesk thought was so funny but decided not to inquire she really didnt like the goblin chief very well i suspect we shall not like their sport che said jenny had already suspected that for herself but she didnt point that out fetch the nights entertainment grotesk exclaimed the goblins went to a hut unbarred the door and brought out two other creatures who had evidently been taken captive on a prior day one was a young woman with tightfitting clothing the other was a furry man whose feet ended in round bootsno hoofs both were bound but the goblins touched the knots and they loosened on their own they two stood substantially taller than the goblins which suggested that they were close to human size what are those jenny asked they appear to be a dirty nymph and a faun che said peering at them i know such creatures only by description but the features seem to match a what and a what they look like a woman in stretchy brown cloth and a man with shaggy trousers and funny feet a nymph and a faun he repeated i believe they are together and live in happy communities where the fauns chase the nymphs all day that is all know except that neither wears clothing what you see is his fur and the mud with which she is coated jenny looked down at her own muddy legs she understood how it could happen i guess the goblins are going to cook them tonight and save us for tomorrow she was surprised at her seeming calmness she knew she would be throwing a fit if she had any choice i fear it will be worse than that worse than getting boiled alive she asked doubtfully yes my dam refused to tell me what goblins do to their captives that means it is worse jenny would have shuddered if she hadnt been so tired she hoped sammy found help soon now heres the rule chief grotesk said to the nymph and faun faun if you catch her before she reaches the pond you go free and we cook her if you dont she goes free if she wants to and we cook you if you dont race we cook you both got that thats cruel jenny said making them sacrifice each other they will surely make us do the same tomorrow che said i shall be very sorry for you tried to rescue me and i like you weve just got to get rescued she said i know your mothers looking for you maybe shell find you in time i certainly hope so so we must make sure you win our contest because no one will rescue me anyway his head turned to her that is very generous of you jenny but since you would not be captive if you had not tried to help me i feel that you should be the one to maybe well both be rescued before the goblins get to us she said it seemed better to believe that than to let the dialogue continue the action was starting with the others the goblins released the nymph and she ran fleetly away then they let the faun go and he took off after her the nymph screamed fetchingly and ran faster they seemed equally swift but the nymph tried to run out of the goblin circle and the goblins wouldnt let her she had to dodge back and when she did the faun gained on her she screamed sweetly and ran off why doesnt she run to the pond jenny asked i am perplexed about that myself che said the nymph dodged again but not toward the pond she tried to get by the goblins a second time and was thrown back she fell and this time the faun almost caught her she screamed cutely and scrambled up just in time to avoid him but he was hot on her heels she had no choice but to go for the pond she did so with seeming reluctance she reached the end and leaped in the faun stopped at the edge disappointed he did not touch the water indeed he seemed afraid of it that was odd considering his likely fate why dont they both just wade across to the other side jenny asked there are no goblins guarding it there it is indeed a mystery the nymph thoroughly doused in the water stood now her body was clean and jenny could see that che had been right there were no clothes the nymph was a very pretty figure of a bare girl the nymph stared at the faun then her lovely face twisted into an unlovely expression she screamed again but this time it was not fetching sweet or cute it was hateful she surged out of the water chasing the faun the faun turned and fled the goblins laughed uproariously they obviously found this surprising reversal very funny it seemed that the nymph was angry with the faun for some reason and had forgotten that she could go free she just wanted to catch him i dont understand jenny said she could have gone on across the pond why did she turn back and why is she so angry now i think i understand che said with a shudder there are love springs in xanth it is reasonable to assume that there can also be hate springs you mean it but evidently it did the nymph had been in the water of hate and now hated the faun so much that she didnt care about anything except hurting him the two of them must have known this because they hadnt wanted to go in the water it was indeed a terrible thing the faun ran but now things were reversed the goblins would not let him through and he had to dodge back and when he did the nymph closed the gap her delicate hands were curved into claws and her pretty teeth were bared in an ugly snarl there was no doubt she intended to hurt him as much as she could she was ferocious finally the faun ran down to the water and plunged in then he too was transformed by hate he turned on the nymph in a moment they were fighting savagely each one trying to drown the other jenny looked away feeling sick she was hardly aware when the goblins hustled her and che into the hut that the nymph and faun had used she had never imagined that such mean creatures as the goblins could exist the hut was dark except for a bit of light from the distant fire leaking in around the edges of the door and a thin shaft of moonlight from a round vent at the top in a moment jennys eyes adjusted and she could see well enough the hut was empty except for them there was no furniture just the packed earth floor which smelled of urine and worse they remained tied evidently the goblins didnt care about their comfort there was nothing to do but settle down and rest as well as they could che lay down in the center of the hut as his body was not structured to do anything else jenny settled at the edge and leaned against the hard wall she was hungry but knew that this was the least of her problems she could eat after she was rescued and if she wasnt rescued it would hardly matter whether she ate she was tired and this she could do something about simply by resting and sleeping che leaned his human torso back against his animal torso fluffed out his wings a bit and closed his eyes he breathed evenly looking quite relaxed jenny envied him that ability she was unable to relax despite the sense it made her mind was too busy with the events of the past day how far away and long ago her normal life on the world of two moons seemed that business of the giant single moon she shook her head there was no sense dwelling on that once they escaped and she had sammy back and che was safe with his mother then she could see about returning to her normal and familiar world but all that was so far beyond her present situation of fatigue dirt and horror that she would do best to put it out of her mind the trouble with trying to put things out of her mind was that then they just came right back into it stronger than ever what were her folks thinking now surely they were wondering what had happened to her and worryingno she had to stop thinking about that unlessunless she could send to her holt and make her situation known sending was the mind contact between people of her kind that enabled them to find each other or to give warning of danger without shouting why hadnt she thought of that before she concentrated sending but there was no response she was out of range of her kind and the folk of xanth could neither send nor receive now she felt more truly alone than ever before she had only one remaining resource the one that was most private to her she could invoke it only when alone but she was alone now for che was asleep she began to hum and then to sing jenny never sang in company because it was just too complicated to try to explain what it meant to her but when she was alone or with her friends it was a great comfort her friends were sammy and the flowers and the colored stones around her holt or maybe just herself when she had some chore to do when she sang it made her surroundings seem brighter and warmer and nicer and though she knew it wasnt real that is that no one else would see it that wayit was always a comfort to her in her fancy as she sang there was a princess and a castle atop a mountain and a strange handsome prince and a dragon who was somehow the same as the prince jenny had never seen a dragon or known that any such creature existed yet she somehow understood the nature of this creature and respected it it was like a big winged snake with fire in its belly and the princess loved the princedragon but feet tramped up close to the door jennys song and fancy cut off instantly the door banged open food a goblin said in his harsh voice and dumped down a big leaf on which were two chunks of meat che lifted his head we cant eat if we remain tied he pointed out grudgingly the goblin touched his knot and ches hands came free then the goblin touched jennys knot and it relaxed and let her go but dont try anything dumb you dumbbells he warned as he backed out the door and slammed it shut they heard it being barred outside i cant eat that jenny exclaimed neither can i che agreed unless the leaf is edible oh you do not eat meat either she asked i would not eat this meat you do not recognize it jenny peered more closely she screamed its from the faun he finished and the nymph jenny tried to be sick but there wasnt enough in her stomach to come up she just heaved several times and stopped gasping i apologize che said i had thought you understood no i just dont like to eat meat or to hurt any animal jenny said her tears blurring her vision i should have realized she was interrupted by another attempted heave at least we are no longer tied che said i can make you light and you can try to climb out the roof vent and escape and leave you here to bebe she couldnt get past her choke no she managed after a moment i appreciate your generosity but it is foolish you should save yourself if you can i never claimed to be sensible jenny said unable to look in the direction of the door where the awful meat lay then perhaps we should rest again yes she hoped it was possible they were quiet for a time jenny did not relax at all the realization of that meat was haunting her and she could not shove the horror from her mind jenny che asked faintly you cant relax either she asked knowing the answer perhaps if you sang a wash of another kind of chagrin left her cold he had heard she had thought he was asleep oh i couldnt do that she protested feeling the flush on her face i apologize if i have transgressed he said she couldnt answer still feeling embarrassed after a time she heard a sniff and then another she looked at che in the gloom and saw that he had his hands up covering his face then she realized that he was trying to stifle tears she remembered that he was alone in much the way she was having been abducted and roughly treated she remembered that he was only five years old he spoke like an adult which was apparently the way with centaurs but he was only a child a foal she remembered that they both faced a horrible fate it was enough to numb her mind what was it doing to his mind im sorry che she said softly i sing only toto animals and things perhaps if you thought of me as an animal he said his voice muffled oh youre not an but what was he if not an animal a friend in this terrible time he needed comforting could she withhold from him what she would grant freely to her cat maybe i can sing to you she said doubtfully she tried it uncertain what would happen she had never before sung for anyone who understood what it was she wasnt sure it was possible flowers and animals were uncritical they never thought it was foolish or out of tune or whatever or tried to critique it to be more conventional they just accepted it as it was and that was the way she could do it che might be a foal but he had awareness beyond that of any animal or flower and that was likely to interfere certainly he had a critical mind the sound didnt come her throat was tight it just wouldnt let go she just couldnt sing in this kind of company still a fiveyearold foal she tried again just breathing in tune after a moment she was able to hum and then her voice came and she was singing as before she was back in the fancy of the princess and the castle and the dragon who looked like a prince there was a sound outside was a goblin coming ches head turned he heard it too but jenny kept singing hoping that the goblin was just passing by and wouldnt stop the sound faded whoever it was was going away jenny kept singing and her picture of the princess became clearer and nicer there were no mean things there just pretty flowers and a beautiful day the only dark cloud in sight was small and distant it looked a bit frustrated but then something horrible happened like awful meat appearing in the hut the dragon wanted to eat the princess he wanted her to come to him when he was in his natural form so he could eat her and be a king among his kind what was she to do jenny sang and the words came naturally as the fancy developed of its own accord it was almost as if someone were sending to her so that she wasnt making up the story but receiving it she was in it in a way as the princess and che was in it too as the dragon prince for both were winged monsters despite the horror of the situation she knew that the dragon loved the princess he had a funny way of showing it by her definition yet she saw also that the love was true by his definition dragons were violent creatures who lived to roast and eat others and the most perfect fulfillment of his nature was the eating of a pure and sweet princess so the princess decided to go to the dragon for she loved him and wanted him to be fulfilled even if that required some discomfort on her part just as a girl might sing her most private secret song for a friend who needed it when she had never done such a thing before then mean men and a mean cloud tried to hurt the dragon and the princess cried warning to him and he destroyed the mean men and carried her away to a distant and lovely isle because neither could go home again they used magic to change themselves to unicorns and lived happily ever after she had never seen a unicorn before either but somehow in her fancy it didnt matter she knew exactly what it was she had no trouble recognizing the cloud of course that was fracto whom she had met it was a lovely fancy and it made her feel warm all over and she knew that it had calmed che even if he didnt know exactly what was in it yet she thought he did know for he had been in it and she was glad he had turned out good and married the princess instead of eating her for all that none of it was real and they were only pretend parts she continued singing and humming finding it easy now that she had worked into it che listened and then he was asleep and then she was asleep she had done it despite the horror they were in steps approached the hut again jenny woke hearing them fearful this time they did not pass the door was jerked open and a goblin showed against the declining fire beyond what werent hungry the goblin demanded all the more for the rest of us he picked up the meat and took a big bite as he slammed the door shut again jenny relaxed she was glad to have the awful meat gone she had never eaten meat because she liked animals too well and she knew that it came from them but before she managed to sleep again there were more and heavier steps the door was yanked open and chief grotesk was there not eating huh he demanded well well just see about that come on out of there you malingerers well make you do your thing right now jennys heart sank down to her left foot it was still the middle of the night and they hadnt been rescued and now there would be no chance ail because they had left the awful meat untouched they were led out to the subsiding fire it seemed that some hours had passed because most of the brush had burned down and the monstrous cheese moon had traveled to another part of the sky the goblins must have used up all their fresh meat and now were ready for more we want you healthy so we can keep you a few days the chief said if you dont eat youll be too weak to run and you wont taste as good he must have thought this was a reasonable statement no thank you jenny said she hated being polite to this cruel goblin but there seemed nothing to be gained by being impolite now you have a choice grotesk told them with a grimace he must have thought was a smile eat your food or race right now he showed them the two pieces of meat one with a bite out of it jenny looked at che she knew she wasnt going to touch die stuff but he had to make his own choice he looked at the meat and at the pond a short distance away and at her sing to me he murmured jenny was astonished and chagrined i cant she protested yeah tell her to eat it grotesk said evidently mishearing so you wont have to race right now we want to save you for another day when we havent just eaten before we die che said there was his answer he wasnt going to eat so they would have to play the goblins cruel game and hate each other and be cooked che wanted to listen to her one more time before that happened could she say no but how could she sing before these horrible creatures it had been hard enough to sing to che alone come on come on make up your stupid mind grotesk snapped the circle of goblins standing around them grinned enjoying this she knew she had to do it she had to give the centaur foal what little comfort she could there would be no other chance at least they would have this memory of their friendship before the hate came she moved to che and took his head in her hands she wanted this to be just for him because she just couldnt sing it for the goblins she pretended that there was no one else here except the two of them she put her mouth to his ear closed her eyes and hummed in a moment she was able to hum louder her fancy began to form a picture in her mind of the lovely castle on the mountain and the flowers at the base and the princess picking the flowers and singing to them there was a goblin voice somewhere calling something well haul some more wood in from the forest then grotesk said we need to keep the kettle hot in case they dont eat jenny sang louder to squeeze out those awful words the fancy firmed and now the dragon was in it too in his real form but not being ferocious she knew that che had joined her picture and that he was the dragon hoping to carry her away to safety if only he could fly there was a nasty cloud nearby but even it didnt seem to want to make a storm it was just watching and perhaps would float away and rain somewhere else hey chief a goblin called arent we going to make them race the cloud jumped then there was a heavy hand on jennys shoulder that jolted her into silence the fancy faded away what are you trying to do you elven vixen the chief demanded he seemed shaken elves dont have that kind of magic magic che exclaimed thats it now for the race the other goblin said naw not right now grotesk said theres something funny about her shes got magic look at those ears the goblins clustered closer evidently they hadnt noticed jennys ears before she had never thought her ears would save her from hate and death they were hustled back into the hut as the door slammed shutting them in jenny turned to che you know i dont have any magic she said i dont even know what it is really where i live only the high ones have anything like that i think you do che said when you sang i was in your dream about the princess and the dragon with castle roogna only it was perched on top of a funny mountain instead of in the jungle where it really is then grotesk was in it too as the dark cloud you have dream magic no i dont she protested i wasnt asleep and neither were you and certainly the goblin chief wasnt i was just imagining it but she realized that it couldnt be as simple as that how could they share her daydream she had never told either of them what was in it and her song had not done it either it had been just madeup words yet she had known when che was there and when grotesk wasand they had known also night mares bring bad dreams to sleeping folk che said mare imbri and other day mares bring good dreams to waking folk maybe you have day mare magic i never heard of this well you havent been in xanth long he had a point these day dreamsdo several folk share them he frowned i dont think so also the mares dont sing but it must be something like that because grotesk felt it and now hes not sure he wants to cook us until he figures it out perhaps he likes to exploit any captives fully before he eats them but it didnt last she said otherwise i might have been able to keep singing and we could just have walked out of here that is an intriguing notion he agreed why didnt it last grotesk put his brute hand on me but if he was in the visionand he was as the black cloudwhy did he break it up that vision is pleasant i did not wish to leave it and i dont think he did i dont know i heard another goblin call hey chief and she paused remembering it the cloud jumped then he was out of it because someone disturbed him che said woke him from the dream in a manner that suggests that if that other goblin hadnt called grotesk would not have left it i suppose so its too bad the other goblin wasnt in it maybe he was out of range of your singing che said becoming excited maybe if you had sung louder we could have walked out of the camp jenny dreaded the thought of singing at all in such company let alone loudly but if it was that or their lives she had to consider it i supposei suppose we should find out if thats it because otherwise they may cook us anyway yes sing to me now and i will see whether i can break out of the vision if i can probably the goblins can but if i cant yes she was excited too for now they had a hope of escaping on their own she set herself then began to hum she just couldnt start singing cold her throat balked it was like plunging into cold water she had never been able to do that and always had to go in gradually but the humming got her in and soon she was singing it was easier than it had been outside because there was only che here che watched her alertly he did not go to sleep or even relax he stood waiting to see what would happen ready to break out of the vision when it came if he could her fancy formed the castle and the princess but mere was no dragon in it and no dark cloud just the princess picking her flowers it wasnt working che was not getting into the picture at all then there was a sound outside che was distracted by it probably afraid it was a goblin coming they did not want the goblins to know what they were doing jenny kept singing though ready to stop if it really was a goblin the dragon appeared now it was working then a small dark cloud appeared that she realized must be the goblin outside it must have come close enough to hear her singing now it was time for che to break out she did not stop singing because if she did the fancy would fade that didnt count they had to know whether others could break out while she maintained the fancy che did not break out he didnt even seem to be trying to finally worried that some other goblin might come and discover what they were doing she stopped letting the vision dissipate what happened she asked didnt you try to get out no che said abashed first i couldnt get in then suddenly i was in and i just never thought of getting out i just wanted to stay there and be part of it but you were supposed to try she said so wed know if this can hold the goblins i know somehow i just lost interest well well just have to try it again and this time make sure you try she said severely i certainly shall he agreed resolutely she hummed then sang again but again the fancy formed without him he was watching her paying close attention but it wasnt working then the cloud formed the goblin was back in but not che how could that be when the goblin surely didnt care and probably didnt even know about this then she realized what it was she stopped singing but i wasnt in che protested i know the goblin outside was but you were paying attention she said the goblin wasnt and beforeyou only got in when you were distracted when i was distracted he echoed i heard something and looked away and suddenly i was in the vision so maybe it only works when youre not paying attention she concluded and maybe you can get out only when you are paying attention that must be the case but how can i not pay attention when we are experimenting when you are distracted she said but that depends on chance events i think so but if thats the way it works we must find a way to use it yes we must try again to verify thisand to ascertain whether i can leave it when i am in she sang again he watched her at first then deliberately turned away he banged his hand against the wall hard enough to hurt shook itand the dragon appeared in the vision limping there was no doubt that it took a distraction to get in now could he get out jenny kept singing but the dragon seemed to have no interest in getting out neither did two goblin clouds nearby the peaceful nice scene continued as long as jenny sang jenny stopped again and the scene quietly departed che was abashed i know i was supposed to try to get out but i just couldnt bring myself to try it was so nice in your fancy but how can we find out if you dont i think we have the answer he said a person can not accomplish anything if he doesnt tryand the folk in your fancy dont try they just enjoy it but then how can i leave it she asked your situation is different you are not just in it you are generating it with your song you have to keep singing making your scene and if you dont the scene goes the others are passive while you are active so you have control jenny found that a little complicated to understand but she was coming to respect the centaurs power of reasoning so she accepted it so then the others cant leave it because they dont want tobut they can be jogged out of it but since we cant get them into it unless they are close enough to hear the song but arent paying attention to it it wont work on them when we need it to perhaps it will work grotesk was distracted when someone asked him about the wood and he joined the vision before another goblin jogged him out of it so if you are singing maybe youll catch the goblins anyway the moment they arent paying attention jenny thought about how hard it was to pay attention to something steadily even when it was important her mind was always drifting into other fancies and sometimes she had gotten in trouble for it goblins didnt seem any better than other creatures in this respect so maybe it would work except that if there were constant distractions there were also constant reminders grotesk had been distracted then reminded so his presence in the fancy hadnt lasted i dont think it will work well enough when there are many goblins she said some of them will always be paying attention che nodded that is true i wish we could do it when they are asleep then any who heard us departing would join the vision and any who did not hear us would continue sleeping why cant we she asked her hope rising because we cant get out of this hut the mud is too tough for us to break and the door is barred from outside her hope sank again to land with a silent thud on the floor he was right they would have to wait for a goblin to come to open the door and then it would probably be morning they pondered a while perhaps when the next goblin comes che said you can sing and lead me out for i will not be doing anything of my own volition if we are lucky the others will not be paying attention and we can escape before they realize its worth a try jenny agreed doubtfully she had nothing better to offer then she sang them to sleep they had learned a lot and saved themselves from hating and boiling now all they could do was catch up on their rest the sound of the bar being knocked out woke them in the morning jenny wiped the sleep from her eyes trying to orient where was she but all too quickly she remembered she was in trouble it was grotesk himself are you two going to eat now he asked waving a cold awful chunk of meat at them sing che said oh no you dont gamin the chief exclaimed he evidently thought she was a boy and she was not inclined to correct him no he had called her a wench before maybe he just didnt care gag her oops jenny tried to sing but it was so hard to start especially when the goblins were charging in and grabbing her before she could do anything there was a dirty cloth tied around her face blocking her mouth when i saw you had magic i knew it wasnt safe to let you be grotesk said so now you two will eat or youll run the centaur will eat first jenny knew that che wouldnt eat that meat they would have to race and the result wouldnt matter because the goblins would cook them anyway she couldnt sing but maybe she could hum she didnt know whether that would accomplish anything but it was all she could do while gagged she hummed starting faintly then getting louder she pictured the nice scene with the princess and her flowers it was there for her but could it extend to the others grotesk looked around whats that he asked unfortunately it wasnt a distraction he heard it was jennys humming that meant he was paying attention so he remained alert ha the chief said the elfs trying to sing well well stop that he drew back his huge gnarly fist che lurched forward and yanked jennys gag down suddenly she was singingbut grotesk was concentrating on her swinging his fist at her face jenny ducked and the fist sailed over her head but immediately the other goblins dived in grabbing her arms they hauled her up straight hold her grotesk said grimly this time i wont miss and jenny knew he wouldnt she opened her mouth trying desperately to sing but her throat was so tight that not even a scream could squeeze out look at that a goblin cried peering to the side dont bother me now the chief said wait till i punch in this elfs face but shes the goblin said amazed now others were looking there their ugly faces going slack i told you grotesk snapped finally glancing in that direction jenny seized her moment she forced the air through her throat and began to sing if she could catch the goblins during their moment of distraction maybe she and che could still try to escape it was she knew their last chance chapter nadas notion their hands linked the two girls stepped into the huge peephole of the huge gourd nada led for she had been in the gourd before actually so had electra but that wasnt the same electra had been asleep all those hundreds of years it awed nada to think of just how old electra was if her age were measured from the time of her birth so she generally didnt think of it she accepted electra as she was now which was just barely under eighteen though she looked fifteen in appearance she was a good match for prince dolph who really was fifteen going on sixteen it was too bad that she lacked the qualities that would turn such a teenager on such as a buxom torso and frecklefree face electra was a good girl without doubt but men of any age were more interested in appearances than in qualities maybe if nada worked with electra to make her more interesting her thought was interrupted by the scene inside the gourd they were in the middle of a villageno a townno a cityof plants plants rustled along the streets and climbed up steps to buildings while assorted animals and human folk stood decoratively in planters plant city electra said letting go her hand now that they were safely in the same scene what fun nada envied her that quality of delight in odd things nada would rather have been back at castle roogna reading one of the romance novels from the castle library one of the ghosts had shown zora zombie that section of it and zora had told her as they both liked such books there romance was always fresh and wonderful the men were always handsome strong and older than the women but electra hardly cared about reading she was always out and about doing things making new friends and in general being a buzz of innocent activity part of it was because she wasnt a princess so didnt have to uphold princessly standards she could wear blue jeans and pigtails and play tag with the moat monster and ride donkey centaur at an indelicate gallop through the orchard and use slang expressions and never get in trouble for it she could flop down in the dirt and make mud pies nada had to pretend she wasnt interested in such juvenilia but if she had ever had a secret place where no one would ever know what she did she would have made mud pies most important of all electra didnt have to be constantly on guard against anyone seeing her panties there was no risk in blue jeans and no one was interested anyway she had such a carefree life because of what she wasnt except that in another week she would die if she didnt get what nada would gladly give her marriage to prince dolph one would never know electras tragedy by looking at her or watching her constant activity but it was there and looming closer every day now nada wished she had had the courage to break her betrothal to dolph when given the chance to do so without hurting her folk but she hadnt realized that there was a time limit on electra she had thought something would happen eventually that would settle the matter now she knew it wouldnt dolph would have to choose between the two of them and neither of them trusted that if only there were some way to force the choice to take it out of his grubby hands but that seemed impossible while both of them lived while both of them lived suddenly nada had a notion theres a cookie electra exclaimed in her enthusiastic way she had been doing what nada should have looking all around to find their way see there by that greenback buck nada looked sure enough there was a big male sheep with green wool on its back standing in a planter and beside it was a sign with the picture of a chicolate chop cookie there was another thing nada didnt dare eat such a cookie because it was fattening while electra could eat anything she pleased and remain athletically slender consequently electra had far more joy of appetite than nada ever did they walked down the street in the direction of the buck so far this seemed all right there was no threat to them and no horrible sights were inflicting themselves on them but nada didnt trust this the realm of the gourd usually would not let strangers through without trying to get at them somehow something unpleasant or at least strange was bound to happen sometime nervously nada looked back at the buck as they passed it fearing it would act like its cousin the battering ram and charge them but the scene remained placid nothing had changed except except that the cookie picture was gone was this a oneway path if so they had better not deviate from it for once they lost it they would not be able to backtrack to pick it up again the plants ignored them perhaps from politeness or perhaps simply because plants noticed animate folk no more than animate folk usually noticed plants they were just there soon they came to an intersection where something with three round little windows hung the top window seemed red and the bottom one green and the middle one yellow as they reached it the red one brightened becoming a rose do you know what that means electra inquired brightly i have no idea nada said i think i have a notion when grey and ivy and i went to mundania there were similar boxes hanging above the roads they always flashed red as anyone came near and that meant that everyone had to stop after a while they would flash green and then it was all right to go maybe this works that way what happens if we go when it is red nada asked i dont know something awful i think because we always stopped and cursed at the red light nada pondered briefly and decided it was best not to risk it she hoped there wouldnt be trouble if she didnt curse that was another unprincessly thing after a minute the rose abruptly faded and a bright green lime flashed nada was ready to proceed but electra held her back we havent seen the cookie she explained i wonder sure enough after only a few seconds the yellow window brightened and it was a big vanilla cookie they hurried on before it could change its mind nada glanced back choosing her moment when electra was proceeding eagerly ahead for a notion was percolating through the reptilian aspect of her mind sure enough the next time the light flashed yellow it was no longer a vanilla cookie but a lemon the marker was gone this was a oneway trail or at least a oneuse trail the moment a marker was used it disappeared now they were on a spiraling path that nada somehow hadnt noticed before it squished as they walked in fact it felt swampy but there was nowhere else to walk so they followed it around and down squishing all the way its a corkscrew swamp electra exclaimed catching on she enjoyed squishing of course the thing seemed to continue interminably nadas royal slippers were getting horrendously soiled ive had enough of this she declared at last im changing she looked around to make sure no one was watching then quickly got out of her clothing and handed it to electra it would be devastating if any man were to catch a glimpse of princessly panties but electra would guard them with what was left of her life then nada assumed her natural form a serpent with her human head now she could slide along the muck without any problem i saw i saw someone cried just behind them it was a man in an eerie cloak with hair standing straight out from his head i saw your pan nada shifted to full serpent form and whipped her head back striking at the awful man but her jaws passed right through him her momentum carried her on over the edge of the spiraling swamp path and she started to fall nada electra cried diving to catch hold of nadas tail but too much of nadas body was over the edge and electra was hauled along with her as she fell you shouldnt have done that nada reproved her returning to her natural form now were both falling to whatever horrendous fate awaits us below but i couldnt let that stage fright do that to you electra protested especially when i know he didnt see your panties i was facing that way all the time and he wasnt there until he yelled thats a consolation nada said but what i meant was if something happened to me dolph would have to marry you but its no good if we both thats horrible electra protested i dont want you to die instead of me look nada said reasonably we cant both marry him and i dont even want to but its his choice not ours since we know hell make the wrong choice it behooves us to make the choice for him but were friends i couldnt think of your niceness is all too likely to cost you your life and me my happiness nada said it is time for desperate measures we have to eliminate one of us and we just had an easy way to do it but now we may have eliminated both of us and thats no good either maybe youre right electra said biting her lip in the way that wasnt permitted to princesses i guess i just wasnt thinking but oh nada i just had to try to save you i would have tried the same for you nada confessed still we have to get sensible sometime they were still falling but it seemed to nada that their descent was slower now she remembered that this was the gourd where things were not necessarily quite what they seemed was it possible that they were not both about to be dashed to pieces below electra peered down theres a river she said some of her brightness returning a very pretty one nada looked there was indeed a river which glistened in the sunshine at the moment nada wasnt inclined to question how there could be sunlight way down here below the corkscrew swamp path the river was beautiful in a crystalline way with many perfectlycut facets i agree they continued slowing until at last they came to rest on the river bank now the crystals of the river were large and bright sending lovely splays of light in a number of directions what a beautiful crystal river electra breathed but now we are off the cookie path nada reminded her getting practical we shall have to look for it for we dont want to be forever lost here in the gourd no matter how beautiful this part of it is yes of course electra agreed chastened but im sure the corkscrew is here somewhere they looked but there was no corkscrew swamp path evidently they had fallen beyond it and were lost we shall just have to look for a cookie sign nada decided you look upriver and ill look downriver that will double our chances of finding the correct path but we shouldnt separate electra protested we might never find each other again and if only one of us emerges from the gourd where does that leave us nada inquired softly but electra started flustered then she caught on you mean i mean it is one way to resolve our dilemma without prejudice to either of us oh nada i dont like this way electra cried make me this pact nada said firmly whichever one of us finds the cookie trail wilt follow it straight out so as to waste no time in rescuing che centaur the one who doesnt find it can backtrack and pick up the trail later but if we both make it through then who marries dolph the one he chooses of course as always electra looked troubled she evidently had a suspicion what nada intended to do but didnt want to accuse her of it openly i suppose very well its decided nada said briskly she slithered downriver she made it a point not to look back so that electra would have to do the right thing and explore upriver she hoped electra would be the one to find the cookie trail then the girl would follow it out and proceed on their mission alone the trail markers would be gone so nada would not be able to follow her electra would marry dolph and live and be happy dolph would be happy too for once he really paid attention to electraa thing he really had never donehe would discover that she was a far better match for him than nada was she was closer to his age which counted for a lot and seemed closer yet which counted for more she shared his juvenile enthusiasms she loved to eat and she could never refrain from laughing when someone blew on a stink horn making a foulsmelling noise that was something no princess could get away with but a prince could and an ordinary girl could most important of all electra lived to please dolph and that was a quality any man could come to appreciate in any woman once she got his attention so dolph would be happier with electra and everyone knew it except him he just needed a situation where he could realize it the crystal river wound its lovely way down to a strange sea it was red and it seemed to be groaning well not exactly groaning the sound was more like a whine she stopped at the beach which was in the shape of a great u in fact there were many little metal us on it instead of sand they were the kind of things that centaurs nailed to their feet to prevent wear they were called horseshoes because presumably horses could use them too the whole beach was made of diminishing horseshoes what bad dream was this supposed to be the setting for she went to the water curious about its color she looked around saw no human folk and changed to her human form then she stooped to dip out a handful of the water she saw eyes looking up at her from under the surface oops was someone there spying on her human nakedness no it was a shell with eyes a see shell of course she reached into the water took the edge of the shell lifted it turned it over and used it to dip out some of the whining red water she brought it to her mouth and tasted it sure enough it was a flavored alcoholic beverage red whine no doubt yet another prop for somebodys bad dream well nada didnt need it she walked on along the beach away from the crystal river wishing she had her clothes she had forgotten about mis detail when she separated from electra and now could not go back to get her clothing from her friend she would just have to make do perhaps it didnt matter as she would not be emerging to normal xanth for that was the gist of nadas notion she would fail to find her way out of the gourd and electra would marry dolph by default and live happily ever after nada could not renege on her betrothal directly but if she were lost here she wouldnt have to maybe she could find work in the dream realm the way girard giant had three years ago ivy had of course told her all about that how they had discovered a river of blood and traced it to its source which was the giants injury and managed to help girard recover and find his true love gina giantess girard had been one of the invisible giants but now he was a visible one working in the gourd so there was a precedent and nada was ready to work here if the night stallion had a use for her then she saw the cookie it was a deliciouslooking punwheel the kind that was horribly tempting to princesses though they invariably made folk turn around and groan ivy said she had loved them as a little girl and she still blushed and yielded to her desire to eat one every so often after all just how much could be expected of a princess there were limits nada knew her plan was in trouble she had thought that the cookie trail was upriver not down because they had fallen down to this region now she realized that the cookie trail could go wherever it wanted including downand it had done so so she was the one who had found it not electra her princessly sacrifice had been for nothing what was she to do now she still knew that electra was the proper one to marry dolph and that would never happen if electra didnt find her way out of the gourd certainly nada didnt want to leave electra here because then she would have no chance to marry dolph and would die within the week nada pondered and considered and thought changing forms for each activity and finally realized that there was a way out of this mess all she had to do was avoid the cookie trail so that it didnt vanish and hide in due course electra failing to find any cookies upstream would come downstream and find it here she would assume that nada had already taken it for she didnt know that it was a oneuse trail she would follow it out and the plan would be intact nada backed away from the cookie trusting it not to vanish she was right it remained in place because she had not passed it she assumed her serpent form and slid into the brush when she was welt hidden she became absolutely still she intended to watch to be sure that electra did come if she did not nada would have to go look for her for at least one of them did have to make it on through the gourd che centaur needed rescuing after all now that her notion was being implemented nada had a second thought how could poor little electra rescue che from the mean goblins she could shock one of them but where there was one goblin mere were always twenty more didnt nada know that from her fathers endless war against the encroaching goblins of mount etamin she was really deserting electra and mat made her feel increasingly guilty yet this was her chance to do the right thing by electra and by dolph too and she really had to follow through so she kept still and waited before long electra did come she hadnt found the cookie trail so was trying to catch up with nada who she thought must have found it nada watched as the girl ran by such vigor her light brown braids flounced busily and her freckles seemed to bounce off her face she had such joy of life no matter what she was doing she would be so good for dolph who had such little notion what life was about yet nada felt a tear flowing down across her snoot that was odd because as far as she knew serpents didnt cry this was the last time she would be seeing electra she hated what she was doing to her friend though she knew it was best for her electra would never understand what had happened and would be upset about taking advantage of the situation and marrying dolph electra was horribly sweet about things like that yet at the same time electra would be struggling to rescue che without help and that was almost as bad as the other part was good nadas emotions were getting so mixed up they were like scrambled spaghetti she watched electra spy the cookie she found it the girl exclaimed delighted one of the qualities of electra was the way she saw things she had not been glad for herself but for nada she was the best friend a girl could have but then electra paused but maybe i shouldnt follow she said it isnt as if i have a future anyway oh no electra was getting the same notion nada had she thought nada was headed out of the gourd so she wanted to remain in and solve the betrothee problem that wouldnt do but shell need my help handling those goblins electra decided and ran on past the cookie which vanished as she passed it nada relaxed but somehow she didnt feel much better electra had decided to go ahead because she wanted to help nada fight the goblins nada had thought of that with respect to electra but had decided against it that showed how much less caring she was she felt terrible she slithered forward tempted to follow the girl before she got out of sight but by the time she reached the spot where the cookie had been electra was already out of sight she moved so rapidly with her slender healthy body one would never catch electra languidly eating grapes on a couch she would eat the grapes while zipping all around the castle nada tried to see where the girl had gone but it was no use all directions were similarly unlikely so she gave it up as a bad job she would feel guilty no matter what she did either for not making it possible for electra to marry dolph or for deserting her in the struggle against the goblins or both she turned and slithered toward the crystal river she moved right out onto it not caring whether it was liquid or solid serpents could swim after all it turned out to be in between the crystals bobbed around when she touched them floating individually on the water they were cold though in fact they were ice crystals so she moved on through as quickly as she could her serpent body did not have a mechanism to maintain heat and she could slow until she froze if she didnt get away from the ice soon she made it to the far bank here there were no horseshoes just people shoes of all types and sizes their tongues slurping around this would be where the centaurs got their supplies for their game of people shoes but nada still didnt see how such things would make bad dreams but of course there was a lot she didnt know about dreams she would have to learn it though if she worked here first she would have to find the night stallion and ask for work in the dream realm she did not expect to enjoy making sleeping folk unhappy but she hoped to muddle through somehow now where would the stallion be she spied a city ahead it seemed to be in the shape of a cross maybe there would be a night mare there or someone else she could ask she reverted to her natural form which was the best one for both travel and dialogue it wouldnt be any good to turn human because she might be mistaken for a nymph without her clothes and anyway it just wasnt princessly to run around nude when she had been younger she had done it but her years at castle roogna had impressed on her the human way especially with respect to panties so her natural form was the one until someone told her otherwise as she slithered closer she saw that the citys buildings were all in the shape of crosses too they had crossshaped doors and windows and crossshaped chimneys she wondered whether this was the place for cross people maybe this was where all the cross actors lived for dreams where anger and meanness were required she hoped she didnt encounter any of those she smelled something delicious she was passing a patch of hot cross buns but she knew that if she tried to eat one it would either burn her mouth angrily or try to switch her posterior the intersections were crosses too nada decided to slither straight on through she would ask for information at some other place she entered the main intersection at the center of the cityand suddenly someone was charging toward her from the side nada hissed in surprise and drew back her head fearing what this denizen of cross city would do nada the other cried gladly electra nada exclaimed instantly recognizing her electra threw herself down and embraced nada not caring about either her form or the dirt of the street oh im so glad i finally caught up to you she exclaimed i was afraid something had happened to you nada opened her mouth but nothing came out for a moment electra didnt even realize what nada had done her innocence and goodwill was such that she had no suspicions of her friends nada was ashamed youre such a decent girl she said her tears flowing again no im not i almost didnt follow you because you werent following me nada said unwilling to have this lie between them any longer i didnt take the cookie trail it was just coincidence we met here but as she spoke she realized that it might not be this was cross city where all paths might cross including theirs but electra said round eyed i deserted you lectra i left you to face the goblins alone im so sorry nada could hardly see now because of her tears of remorse because you wanted me to be the only one to leave the gourd electra said so i could marry dolph that too nada confessed electra squeezed her tightly around her serpentine neck oh nada how could i marry dolph when you were lost you were so generous but im not worthy of it honest im not this isnt the way this isnt the way nada agreed relieved promise me not to do that again there was no help for it i promise then after a pause but you are worthy of it lectra electra shook that off as a kind overstatement now we can go after those goblins together she said enthusiastically her bright spirits returning as if never dimmed and if anything happens to one of us then nada nodded sweet innocent little electra did understand the underlying reality perhaps their problem could be honestly settled by chance goblins were mean creatures and only an ogre could go into an encounter with them with any equanimity and that was partly because ogres were so stupid they resumed their trek the trail of cookies led them to a great wall and to an alcove in it when they entered the alcove suddenly they were by another river and there were cookies growing all along its banks how can we find our way now electra asked dismayed there are so many nada was similarly baffled she turned around to check for the last vanished cookie in case mere was some misunderstanding but there was nothing but the peephole of a giant gourd she averted her gaze just in time to avoid being trapped in it then she made the connection lectra were out of the gourd this is the withacookee riverthe real one oh electra cried thrilled now we can rescue che first we have to find him nada reminded her and watch for the goblins we had better surprise them instead of having them surprise us electra suffered a flash of seriousness yes i can shock only one well need your jaws i can bite only one at a time what wed really better do is find them then blow the whistle to summon the others but wont the goblins hear the whistle too ulp i had forgotten about that we wont dare alert the goblins because they might dump him into the pot immediately maybe the sparkleberries electra said its pretty dark now so theyll be visible if the goblins dont realize what they are yes those will be fine so now we had better move because it is evident that che isnt here anymore the goblins must have taken him to their camp can you sniff out the trail in your serpent form i should be able to nada assumed full serpent form and flicked her tongue about immediately she picked up ches scentbut also the scents of many goblins and something else it was almost like elf but not quite she didnt think she had smelled that creature before she resumed naga form is there an elf elm near here she asked i suppose there could be electra said since we dont know exactly where we are but the elves wouldnt foalknap a centaur theres the smell of one elf almost nada said but no elm tree scent its almost as if this elf didnt come from an elm but thats impossible all elves live in elf elms and they get impossibly weak when they stray too far from them if one did stray his companions would bring him back elves dont desert their own yes thats why this is so odd a funny elf smell and no elm tree i must be misinterpreting nada returned to serpent form and explored further soon she was slithering along the goblins trail the evil little men had not even tried to conceal it they had simply charged along to one of their trails and then used that the centaur and oddelf smells continued closely associated it was almost as if both were captives then electra touched her back with a hand i see something she whispered nada lifted her head and peered around she had kept her head low before sniffing out the trail there was a faint light off to the side she put on her human head that must be the goblin camp well sneak up on it they did that moving quietly nada had no trouble in her serpent form but electra had to move very slowly in her human body they came to the edge of a little jungle glade there were four goblins and a weltdamped fire beside the fire was a little tent nada realized that che must be tied in the tent could she slither silently in behind and untie him without the goblins knowing it seemed worth a try she resumed naga form im going in that tent she whispered electra nodded she would wait here and spring in when her help was needed nada became a small snake and slithered around the glade toward the tent the goblins seemed to be eating their supper she hoped it wasnt boiled centaur she was relieved that the party was so small she could probably handle it alone in large serpent form one of them was female which made it that degree less formidable because lady goblins were much less nasty than males but it would be better to untie che first so that he could bolt free while nada kept the gobs at bay the funny thing was she didnt smell che or the odd elf the closer she got to the tent the less likely it seemed mat either creature was here what could mis mean she reached the tent and slithered under its back flap it was empty the only smell was that of the female goblin evidently she was in charge of this party and had the best facilities but why was this little party of goblins camping out here apart from the main mass and where was che the mysteries were deepening instead of fading nada slithered back out of the tent disappointed they would have to resume the trail they had been following before this was only a diversion then electra sneezed nada knew the sound the moment she heard it and hoped the goblins wouldnt no such luck what was that the gobliness exclaimed jumping up so quickly that her long hair swirled about her body it sounded like a human sneeze godiva one of the males replied i know that moron godiva snapped she pointed to the sound with a wand she had eeeek electra cried rising into the air nada saw her clearly in the moonlight flying without wings it seemed that the gobliness had magicin fact a magic wand nada had to act she assumed monster serpent form and launched herself at the goblins look out godiva a goblin cried godiva whirled she spied nada her wand whipped around in a moment nada was lifted into the air while electra dropped to the ground what have we here godiva asked keeping nada suspended in the air nada changed to human form still floating you have a naga she replied hoping that would set them back or at least take their attention off electra so she could do something this magic wand was another surprise look at that body a goblin exclaimed ogling her the other two males stared similarly oops in her confusion nada had forgotten her nakedness she would have used her natural form instead if she had taken more than half an instant to think about it idiot the gobliness cried imbecile grab that other girl two goblins yanked their eyeballs back into place turned and charged electra but she dodged past them in her athletic way and went for godiva electra being human was twice the size of the goblins which helped the charge caught the goblins by surprise they might have expected her to flee she touched the gobliness arm and shocked her godiva sank to the ground dropping the wand at the same time nada fell she managed to twist around so as to land on her human feet avoiding injury electra dived for the wand the goblins stunned again by the sight of nada were slow to think of that electra brought it up and pointed it at one now get back she cried or ill hoist you into the treetops the goblins amazingly laughed you cant use that one said advancing on her nada resumed serpent form and hissed at him he fell back but its true electra said dismayed it isnt working for me nada put on her human head keep it anyway she said that will stop them from using it now leis get out of here wait godiva called struggling to sit up dont take our only magic why not electra asked you mustve stolen it from someone else no its mine godiva said my mothers actually but im using it with her permission why did you attack us we didnt attack you nada responded indignantly we were just checking to see if you had the centaur foal then electra sneezed youre looking for che centaur godiva asked are you with the elf you know about the elf i smelled it but theres something odd about it godiva gazed at her a moment i think maybe we should talk she said talk we have to rescue the foal we may not be enemies godiva said not exactly anyway this was stranger yet do goblins honor a truce nada asked females do godiva turned to the three males moron idiot imbecilelay down your weapons and back off the three males did exactly that nada was impressed truce then she agreed while we talk while we talk godiva said let me explain at the outset that we are not the goblins who have the foal we want to rescue him before the goblinate of the golden horde boils him and his companion the elf girl elf girl nada explained she had assumed it was male but that did not account for the whole of the oddity who is that elf if shes not with you nada asked they settled down by the warm fire which was a pleasure nada did not fully trust the gobliness but as long as electra held the wand and the goblins didnt know that electras charge was gone perhaps it was all right it was evident that godiva had information they needed we know little of her and i will tell you what there is but first i must explain our interest in the foal godiva said have patience i will make this brief and i think the golden horde will not harm them until morning i hope not electra said we are from goblin mountain in the east godiva said some time back an ogre passed by with an entourage of seven females he was remarkably decent for his kind and suspiciously unstupid except with regard to women one of the females was goldy goblin daughter of gorbage chief of the north slope gap goblins she was seeking to trap a husband in the approved fashion the ogre managed to fathom the secret of the magic wand the tribe had stolen and he gave it to goldy who then had power to snare the son of the chief the ogre stomped on northward and was lost to history but goldy remained and married and the stork brought me i am so named because of an obscure legend associated with hair and taxes i need not bore you with that godiva tossed her hair and they saw that she wore little or no clothing beneath it the hair served as an effective cloak in due course i snagged my own chiefs son who seemed to appreciate my costume godiva continued in due course the stork brought us gwendolyn who was as lovely and nice as any female child but through a tragic mischance she was rendered lame and can walk only with difficulty since i will not suffer my daughter to be humbled by circumstance i determined to obtain a suitable steed for her to ride thus it was that i borrowed my mothers wand and used a tunnel spell and took the centaur foal but ches too young to ride electra protested he will grow godiva said meanwhile we shall tame him so that he is safe for gwendolyn on such a steed when she is grown she should be able to achieve my hope for her and our tradition will continue unfortunately our tunnel spell malfunctioned and when we emerged we were not back at goblin mountain but here on the wrong side of the elements that was the beginning of our problem murphys curse electra exclaimed it made the plot go wrong so there was hostile magic godiva said i suspected as much at any rate my point is that we mean no harm to the foal he will be well treated and my daughter will be as compatible a companion as he can find but here in this hostile region we knew we would have trouble with the goblinate of the golden horde so we were hurrying north to avoid it we hoped to cross the river and circle the elements and return to goblin mountain from the north but this strange elf appeared suddenly spooked my men with cherry bombs and stole the foal from us naturally we followed but they fled to a raft on the river and we could not reach them it is important that no harm come to the foal you see that limited our options but then the horde goblins got wind of the presence of the foal and advanced on the river and we had to fall back they are hundreds to our four and the magic wand will not prevail against such odds this is our present state we must save the foal from certain death at the hands of the horde but we lack the resources to attack only if i can use the wand to float the foal clear of them during the night can it be accomplished nada nodded soberly now things were falling into place she could not approve godivas abduction of che centaur but she had to trust her motive now if che died godiva lost just as did the centaurs friends but the elf girl electra said who is she why did she come where is she now apparently she is a friend of the foal godiva said she is a strange one with oddly pointed ears and missing fingers and she is twice the size of the elves we know the horde took her captive and seems to be treating her no better than the foal i suspect they mean to cook her also she is only a child and the oddest thing is that she does not seem to weaken away from her elm but all elves are tied to their elms nada said as i said she is a strange one i have never before seen her like she even wears spectacles and associates with an odd little animal of the feline persuasion chex centaur must have found her on some distant mount and brought her in for a companion to che electra said she must have followed you when you stole che and tried to rescue him she frowned but its funny chex didnt tell me about it i have played with che often and theres never been an elf there we are all mystified godiva said but there you have it i believe we should make common cause and try to rescue the foal from the horde thereafter we may settle our differences as to the foals disposition nada pondered not completely at ease with this she didnt trust goblins for one excellent reason they were untrustworthy it was true that godiva had no wish to harm che but the moment he was rescued she would probably try to spirit him away to goblin mountain still it was hardly likely that one naga and one human girl could rescue che alone we have a whistle to summon other search parties here she said maybe the goblins arent deaf godiva pointed out if they think others are coming they will simply move up their schedule and boil their captives now they dont know about us because we hid but they would know if they heard that whistle she had a point we also have sparkleberries to summon help from the good magician nada said the goblins arent blind either they have sentries posted that is why we did not dare camp closer to them we would have been spied and wiped out after we rescue the foal then you might summon your help she did seem to be making sense but how will we settle who gets che nada asked we dont want him captive at goblin mountain either we can settle that after we rescue him we can hold a contest or draw straws or something the loser bound to let the winner have him in either case he will be safe nada looked at electra what do you think can we trust these goblins i think we have to electra said evidently no better pleased than nada was she handed the wand back to the gobliness very well nada faced godiva well act together to rescue che and the elf girl once we have them safe from the horde well decide who keeps che but you have to understand that no matter what deal you make with the two of us ches parents will not rest until they have him back they are winged monsters and i think you could find the winged monsters laying siege to your mountain we had really hoped that no one would know where he was godiva confessed but i think that once it is clear how well we treat the foal the objections will fade i think you would rather see him with us than cooked and we would rather see him with you than cooked so lets deal with the present situation and leave the other till tomorrow she certainly was practical but so was nada even working together we cant match the power of the horde well need a ruse or some device to get him out without their knowing right away suppose i assume small snake form and sneak unobserved into their camp and untie him and lead him out if they spy us then you loft us high out of their reach with your wand i cant loft two at once godiva said not of your size was afraid of that then loft him alone and ill assume large serpent form and fight my way out of it as well as i can but you cant hope to electra protested then you will make the deal to free che from godiva nada said before you marry dolph maybe i could sneak in to untie him electra said no you cant change size or form but you can help by carrying me to the horde so that can rest and sleep and be at my best when i have to be electra looked unhappy but she had to agree that this was best still she had an objection that wand can keep him high only while godiva wields it the goblins will soon see her and if they catch her true godiva said just as the two of you overcame me i must concentrate on the wand when i am using it i will be pretty much helpless but i might hide in a tree and they would not see me my three henchmen could decoy them away awww one of the males protested quiet moron godiva snapped it isnt nice to call him that electra said thats his name godiva replied they are moron idiot and imbecileall stalwart examples of their kind oh electra was embarrassed but you can only loft che so far from one fixed place and those goblins of the horde will be all over godiva sighed i know it is not an idea situation but we must do what we can if it comes to nothing then you must signal your friends as there will by then be nothing to be lost by alerting the horde im not satisfied with it electra said if you can improve on it welcome the gobliness said i think now we should get started as i believe the horde is some distance away we must move as quietly as possible hoping to approach them undetected ill look for a pineapple plantation or something electra said there has to be something to cause some extra mischief for those mean things good idea godiva turned to the three males spread out look for anything like that and report to a female if you find it but wed rather use the path one protested thats the first place the horde will set an ambush imbecile imbecile dropped his protest but how will we find each other nada asked still just a bit uneasy about godivas intentions idiot can whistle like a bird the gobliness said idiot do the birdinhand call the male goblin pursed his ugly lips and whistled the sound was a trilling cadence that sounded almost like i got it i got it its mine nada was impressed but suppose theres a real bird here there may be it wouldnt make sense to use a call that the horde knew was foreign but a real bird will not remain for the rendezvous while idiot will nada nodded it was a good device they spread out into the forest electra might not like traveling alone through it at night but the moon was extra big and bright so she could see well enough arid she realized that the horde would have cleaned out most predators so it was probably reasonably safe if you have trouble wake me nada said then took her hand and changed to small snake form electra put her carefully in a breast pocket nada of course could not use breast pockets not only were they unprincessly there was no room in that region of her torso for anything like that nada coiled into a disk and let electras motion lull her to sleep it was comfortable here and actually when it came right down to it electra was far from flat chested in the right gown she could show off to a certain advantage it was just that she never bothered to preferring to look tomboyish maybe she was afraid that if she looked as feminine as she could queen irene would notice and make her stop dressing tike a boy and running unfettered around the grounds but that would come to a definite stop within a week if dolph didnt notice nada resolved to take electra in hand the moment they got back to castle roogna and put her in a lowcut gown of course that would still leave those freckles to deal with but maybe some vanishing cream would make them vanish there was a creamweed in the orchard with the milkweeds that might have some of the right variety the wrong variety would make electras whole face vanish so some care was in order lulled by the motion and her thoughts nada fell asleep she was fortunate that in her reptilian mode she had cold nerves and could relax despite her knowledge of the deadly danger of her coming mission a warmblooded creature would have worried about the horde if she helped rescue che but didnt make it out herself then electra would not need the gown and cream that seemed sensible nada woke because electra had stopped moving shehad become accustomed to the steady irregularity of the struggle through the jungle so this abrupt stillness was alarming she poked her head out of the pocket ahead was a gulf like that of the gap chasm no it only seemed so she had forgotten to allow for her small size it was actually a cleft a miniature gap too wide for a human being to hurdle and too deep to risk the trees grew up to within a reasonable distance of the brink but left a clear space at the edge as if not trusting their roots too close to that emptiness the moonlight wafted down brightening the ground but hesitating to plumb too deeply in the cleft electra was hesitating and nada knew her well enough to know that something was on her mind so she slithered out of the pocket electra felt the motion and put her hand up nada crawled onto it and electra set her on the ground then nada assumed woman form whats up she inquired this looks a lot like the gap electra said its too small the gap is a hundred times this big but could it be an offshoot of the gap a crack branching off i suppose there are a lot of them what about it then one end must go to the gap and the other just gets smaller until it quits of course whats your point it would be hard to cross toward the gap but easy toward the end nada was getting impatient so what lectra just walk along it until you find where you can cross but if we rescuewhen we rescue che the gobsll be chasing us so so we find a good crossing point first nada said now i get your notion very well ill check one direction you check the other and well return here and compare notes no electra said now look im not going to jump in nada said i promised remember snot that electra said nada shuddered she would have to get the girl to stop using such expressions even if she wasnt a princess it conjured a vision of a leaky nose isnt there time the moons still out so its not dawn yet snot that either ouch if theyre chasing us we dont want an easy crossing but we cant afford to be delayed if then nada understood the goblins to stop the goblins yes if we can get across and they cant well be safe or at least get a good head start i thought with godivas wand lectra thats brilliant nada exclaimed this cleft can be better than pineapple bombs so we need to find a good wide section they cant cross and then come to that but they probably know this cleft pretty well and maybe they have crossing places electra said so maybe we need to find those and get rid of them so they cant cross yes indeed very well well split up and explore and see what we find we have to move quickly though so we have time to get together with godiva right electra headed off along the cleft running though she must have been tired nada assumed the form of a black racer and zoomed in the other direction as it turned out she had the gap side before long the cleft joined another cleft and nada had to detour around that until she found a place narrow enough for her human form to hurdle then she snaked on down until she came to the gap itself she had observed no suitable crossings the goblins evidently didnt mess with this portion of it she zoomed back hoping she hadnt delayed electra she was heartened by this discovery she could lead che to this cleft and godiva could loft him across and the gobs would be stuck on the other side so would nada she pondered that as she sped along but then she realized that it should be no problem because no goblin could keep up with this racing form she could get clear in fact she might not need to she could assume small snake form and che could hold her in his hand and take her across with him then she remembered the elf girl the one who had tried to rescue che before and gotten captured herself what would happen to her maybe mere would be time to loft her across after che was safe nada hoped so because she wanted to know more about that elf but where would electra be at that point she couldnt change form and slither away soshe would have to remain on the other side of the cleft to help guide che while nada slithered around that would have another advantage if the gobliness turned out to be untrustworthy someone would be there to protect che reassured nada zipped on to her rendezvous with electra soon enough she made it somewhat to this side of their point of separation electra had evidently completed her survey and come back to find nada she slithered up and assumed girl form my end is the gap she said no crossing places you found one yesjust a little way up electra said breathlessly it gets very narrow and the gobs have made a log bridge a tree fallen across it i looked beyond but its a good long hike before it peters out so if we can take out that bridge good enough let me look at it they went to it and nada studied the situation it looked as if a person with a lever could wedge the log off the narrow place so it would drop into the cleft it would take the goblins a long time to get another log for the crossing it looked very good they might even be able to use the crossing themselves then push off the log before the goblins reached it they resumed their progress toward the horde camp now the first signs of dawn were just beginning to think about starting to show they were going to be late they must be ahead of us nada said maybe idiot is whistling and we can hear it they listened and after a moment heard the conservative cadence of the bird in hand they hurried toward that hoping it wasnt a real bird it wasnt idiot was hiding against the trunk of a tree and godiva was nearby i was afraid you werelost the gobliness said relieved or had run out on you nada inquired it is true i do not know you well and our relations with the naga folk are not ideal nada was getting to like godiva better the woman seemed to be playing things straight we found an offshoot from the gap chasm that we think will balk the goblins if we destroy their bridge after using it so if we can get that far without being captured or killed ourselves wonderful we found nothing the horde seems to have scoured the region clean we have been here for an hour observing fearing that you would not come we believe the horde has the foal and elf locked in a hut together there is a guard pacing near it there are other guards elsewhere in the camp if we took out one the others would hear the commotion and rouse the rest so we have been unable to act but we fear they mean to do their thing at dawn i can go in and free them nada said but it wont do any good if the whole camp is roused agreed so i think i had better distract them its a faint chance but all we have distract them electra asked with a dance how could a dance distract goblins electra asked but nada had a notion and gave her a letitbe signal when i do it you slither in quickly and rescue them godiva said perhaps you will get away but what happens to you nada asked oh they will no doubt have a great deal of fun with me before they kill me but once the foal is safe perhaps i can be rescued nada was chilled by her realism maybe we should summon our help now and set off the horde for sure no we had better try it this way if i dont make it you must bargain in good faith with my henchmen for the disposition of the foal nada sighed she feared disaster for them all but they seemed to be stuck with it she turned to electra if i dont make it you must be the one to bargain stay clear and lead the party to the crossing che will follow you if he sees you tightlipped electra nodded godiva turned to the three males if i am lost you support these two if you win the foal take him home the three nodded grimly dawn was encroaching but before nada could go in one who was evidently the goblin chief marched with a group of henchmen to the hut the rescue effort was too late well have to watch our chance nada said maybe this isnt the end they watched as the two captives were led out the gobliness was right that was the biggest elf nada had seen neither was tied but the elf seemed to be gagged that was curious does she have spoken magic nada asked not that i know of godiva replied the goblins clustered around the captives but it wasnt clear what they were doing then che reached out and yanked the elfs gag down immediately the chief drew back his fist and swung at her but the elf ducked she must have magic godiva exclaimed see most of the men are just standing around not helping their chief so we must not listen as she spoke she was stuffing hanks of hair into her ears to dull her own hearing ill distract them visually you get in there and get them out nada changed to small snake form and slithered toward the group she saw godiva step out into the camp clearing dancing and swirling her hair around her body she was good at it that hair was like a living cloak that allowed parts of her torso to flash into view briefly before disappearing a goblin spied godiva look at that he cried staring nada didnt look at that she concentrated on che and the elf girl she would slither right in close then assume human form and tell the two to run then she would assume large serpent form and bite any goblins who looked dangerous she might get killed just as godiva might but between them they might indeed give che his chance to escape an increasing number of the goblins were standing frozen and not all of them were looking in godivas direction could it be true that the elf had some kind of spoken magic if so that made nadas job easier she continued to concentrate on the two captives allowing nothing to distract her from her immediate mission the chief was still trying to punch the elf but she was ducking out of the way and the goblins who were holding her seemed to be in a daze it must be magic because normally goblins first interest was in hurting others nada reached the group she assumed woman form che she cried run for the forest then she became a monstrous hugefanged serpent and reared up before the chief if she took him out first the others might be disorganized but the chiefs face had also gone blank there was no point in biting him if he wasnt functioning she turned to look at the others and found them all standing slackly slight ungoblinish smiles on their ugly faces what was going on che and the elf girl ran and the elf seemed to be singing nada could not distinguish notes very well in her serpent form so judged by the girls open mouth well if that was doing it good for her che and the elf ran to the side where electra stepped out calling something they followed her into the forest godiva stopped dancing the goblins remained standing in place nada slithered after che and after a surprised moment godiva wrapped her hair around her and followed then the goblins came back to life but for a moment they were confused it was almost as if they had not seen the captives flee nada and godiva hurried into the forest in effect forming a rear guard the party kept moving evidently electra was showing them the way and che trusted electra and the elf trusted che good enough if they stayed ahead of the horde long enough they could cross the cleft dump die tree down and be safe while they signaled for help but now the goblins were getting organized godiva turned her head evidently hearing them and in a moment nada heard it too as a roaring noise they passed a narrow section of their path where two great trees encroached from the sides nada whipped to the side and curled around the tree climbing in a spiral while godiva ran on in a moment the first of the goblins charged up nada struck out from the tree hissing fiercely she knocked him back with her snout the goblin wasnt really hurt but he was terrified he screamed and scrambled backjust as the second one was arriving the two collided and tumbled in the pathjust in time for the next one to plow into them in a moment there was a sizable tangle of goblins satisfied nada assumed black racer form and shot along the trail gaining on the others she had bought them a little more time it seemed to be enough for the party made it to the log crossing before the horde goblins caught up again godivas henchmen were prying at the log and it was nudging over they paused seeing nada coming but the log was too far over it continued moving they jumped on it and ran across just before it fell nada pulled up at the brink too late behind her was the noise of the horde then she found herself floating in the air she wriggled violently afraid she was falling into the deep cleft then she saw godiva waving her wand the gobliness was bringing her across she floated over the cleft and landed softly she assumed her natural form with her human head on her serpent body thank you she said i could have gone around but it would have taken time you helped me by slowing the pursuit godiva said now the goblins of the horde charged up to the other side of the cleft moron idiot and imbecile stood at the edge and made faces at them while the rest of the party got organized maybe we had better exchange introductions nada said che i believe you know us all certainly the centaur foal said he looked somewhat worn unsurprisingly but retained his composure this is jenny elf from the world of two moons these are princess nada naga and electra i gather you and godiva have made each others acquaintance nada looked at jenny you are not from xanth no the elf said she held up a fourfingered hand see my fingers are different from yours and my ears but please have you seen sammy who her cat che said he finds things magically no we have seen no cat of any kind nada said look electra and i came to rescue you but we have learned that godiva did not mean to hurt you che she wants you to be her daughters companion we made a bargain to work together to rescue you from the horde now we have to settle where you are to go but you cant keep che from his mother jenny protested she was indeed the foals friend she was goblin size which was still only half human height we had to compromise nada said the alternative was to let the horde keep you che nodded i understand i must abide by your compromise but first we had better get away from here godiva said before the horde moves around the cleft indeed the horde goblins were already running to the side in the direction of the next available crossing it would take them a while but not long enough to be ignored then we had better travel down to the gap nada said thats in the direction each party is going im not sure of that godiva said see some of them are going that way too there must be a crossing you didnt see nada saw that it was true then north she said they formed a line and started north through the jungle they were all tired but it was no time to rest nada led the way in large serpent form because she was able to force a passage best then suddenly there was a roar ahead nada drew back alarmed it was a huge firebreathing dragon and it was bearing right down on them chapter dolphs direction dolph in nighthawk form flew west through the night toward the withacookee river unfortunately metria had not told him exactly where along the river his betrothees were that left him somewhat at a loss well all he could do was start at the source assume fish form and follow the river down until he found them there must be a goblin tribe along it somewhere then he could assume dragon form or ogre form and smash the gobs to smithers and rescue the damsels the notion had a certain appeal with his nighthawk eyes he could see clearly no matter how dark it was but not only did he not know exactly where the girls were he also did not know where the river was except that it was west of here he almost wished the demoness was along in case she could give him a better direction but she would probably just give him the wrong direction out of mischief in due course he spied the river at least he thought it was the river he flew down close and saw a clump of ginger cookies that snapped viciously at him one had to be careful of ginger snaps but this verified that it was the withacookee river flowing generally north and west maybe he could just fly over it along its length until he spied the girls and goblins no the jungle overhung it in places and was so dense that he could not see the ground he would be better off as a fisha big fierce one with sharp spines which an allidile wouldnt attack but first he had to find the rivers source so he didnt miss anything he followed it up until it reached a big messy morass he knew what this was the halfbaked bog that had not yet ripened into a fullfledged swamp when it did so the products that grew along the river would be adult breadfruit and butter instead of juvenile cookies and they would have to change its name he hoped it never grew up he came to land where the first trickle of river leaked from the bog the bog didnt like giving up its water but the river demanded it so this was where the issue was fought dolph knew that when it rained the bog sometimes wasnt quick enough to incorporate all the new water and the river managed to suck more of it away sometimes the river got so full of it that it swelled up over its banks that was the nature of juveniles they had no restraint dolph was sorry he would not be a juvenile much longer he assumed his human form for a moment so as to use his most familiar senses just in case the girts were near here it would be awful to miss them and swim down the entire length of the river while they got boiled by the goblins well look at this a raucous voice screeched a barebottomed young whippersnapper dolph whirled startled but it was only a harpy one of the dirtybodied dirtymouthed birds of the wilderness get out of here before you poison the water he said oh is that so stinkface she screeched flapping up close i have half a mind to poop on you son of a woman you have half a mind period he retorted stooping to pick up a stick are you threatening me prince she screeched outraged ill bury you in spit dolph swung the stick at her but she flapped out of the way clumsy clumsy she screeched harpily but then something percolated through his mind she had called him princebut he had never identified himself and certainly his costume did not give anything away other than his masculinity how did she know metria he exclaimed the harpy became the demoness oh heck i was just beginning to have fun she complained she certainly had been she hadnt even used any useful fowl words because she knew he was still technically a juvenile a real harpy would have delivered a barrage of obscenities that might have represented an intriguing education she had been teasing him on two levels as was her delight get out of here spook he yelled swinging the stick at her naturally it passed right through her torso without resistance but she obligingly disappeared what was the point in her remaining once he had discovered her identity he was no fun by her definition unless she was fooling him in some demonic way he turned back to the river what was the best fish form to assume here where it was so small he worried that a minnow might be snapped up by some unseen predator of course he would immediately change to some larger form and chomp the predator right back but still it was an inconvenience maybe he could be a small water snake and become a larger one as the river got larger meow dolph looked it was a cat an orange fluff ball lying on the ground what was it doing here xanth hardly had any straight catsjust odd variantsbut dolph recognized the type because he had seen pictures of the mundane breeds ohthe demoness was still having her sport trying to see if he could be fooled again quit with the games metria he snapped im not going to give you the satisfaction the cat merely looked at him not moving he knew it was the demoness but somehow he had just a bit of doubt so he called her bluff by assuming the form of another cat a big black one say something in cat talk he meowed suspecting that she couldnt he was a magician and could speak and understand the language of any form he assumed but she was a demoness who merely imitated the forms something the cat meowed clearly in cat talk swishing his cattail that surprised dolph but it occurred to him that metria might have learned just a few feline terms to fool him maybe she had just imitated his last word well he would require the cat to say something that wasnt that what is your name sammy dolph was impressed but still he had asked an obvious question so it could still be the demoness bluffing where are you from home you arent much for dialogue are you sammy merely shrugged hardly moving why are you here help youre here to help me no you want my help yes it seemed that the laconic animal refused to expend any more than the minimum energy on anything this was not metrias way dolph was becoming convinced that sammy was real but that only made a new mystery well i have to go help someone else right now so it will have to wait now the cat showed some agitation but jenny needs help who is jenny my person friend now dolph remembered something else metria had said mat a foreign elf and a foreign cat had come through the hole in xanth and that the elf was trying to help che is jenny an elf they called her that sammy said a bit defensively but shes really a person yet metria was the one who had told him so this was no verification still his belief was overwhelming his doubt and you two came through the hole i didnt notice why did you come through it for a feather metria hadnt told him that still he wasnt quite sure what feather a big one dolph resisted the urge to get annoyed knowing that the demoness would like it if he blew his top how did you know where it was i just knew but wasnt it hard to find a big feather no she was still testing him how did you know where to find me that should trap her into some giveaway response i just knew was he getting anywhere or just wasting timeexactly as the demoness wanted do you know who i am no then why did you look for me i didnt but you said you came to me to get my help yes how could you do that if you didnt know who i was jenny told me to find help so i found it you didnt know what you were finding just help yes dolph was stumped every time he thought he was getting somewhere he wound up nowhere he suspected that he should just leave the cat and head down the river but suppose the cat was legitimate metria appeared i cant stand watching you fumble any more she declared ill have to help you get on with it or well be here all night but im not sure whether hes you dolph protested forming his cat mouth into just enough of a human mouth to speak human words she stared at him are you trying to fool me into thinking youre even duller than you are dolph looked from her to the cat and back how could she be the cat when she was herself how would you proceed id ask him exactly how he finds things dolph looked at sammy but the cat just lay there without moving dumbbell metria snapped ask him but he heard you i didnt speak in feline talk i cant you have to translate oh sammy how do you find things i just do he just does dolph said to the demoness how does he just do it she asked sammy how do you just do it if im interested if hes interested metria looked as if she were controlling a monstrous aggravation it made dolphs heart glad how else how else sammy someone tells me to and i do it when someone tells him to dolph reported then tell him to find nada naga sammy go find nada naga suddenly the cat was in motion after him metria cried floating in that direction dolph started to run but immediately slipped in the mud and took a resounding spill youre such a grab metria called a what dolph asked as he hauled himself sloppily up hold snatch grip seize entangle embroil he asked no gear wheel engage limitedslip dolph had heard about something the mundanes used clutch yes youre such a clutch then she paused no im not sure you mean youre not going to insult me will you get moving dolt oh dolph assumed red racer form and slithered at top velocity after the disappearing cat he knew the demoness was annoyed because she had gotten his name wrong that was some satisfaction it turned out to be some distance sammy evidently tired soon slowed to a walk but remained intent on his objective and dolph was glad of that this was certainly a better way to find nada than swimming down the river would have been especially since they were going directly away from the river the cat must have had a difficult journey to find dolph and now was traveling again that was an interesting talent sammy had dolph had not known of many animals with magic talents it showed that just about anything was possible but this business of a foreign elf coming to xanththat was something he had never heard of before what business could she have here another thing bothered him they seemed to be heading for the territory of the goblinate of the golden horde dolph had encountered chief grotesk and his evil minions before if they had captured the girls he shoved that thought away and let it drift off behind him fortunately his thoughts seemed even tireder than he was so could not keep up with his body dolph was as tired as the cat looked by the time dawn approached they had been traveling most of the night but they must be getting closer to nada and with luck electra and che would be with her and dolph could rescue them all if the cats direction was right it had to be there were sounds ahead the dim uproar of angry goblins and some nearer crashing as of more goblins forging through the brush nada must be running from the horde dolph changed into firebreathing dragon form and summoned his last strength he leaped ahead of the cat to intercept the charging party he encountered a huge serpent behind it were several goblins this was worse than he had feared to hope but if nada was in danger he inhaled about to scorch the serpents head off its body dope metria screamed thats nada startled dolph choked back his fire and changed to serpent form matching the species of the other he felt backedup smoke sifting between his teeth he had changed form but it hadnt he coughed nada appeared in her natural form a serpent with her human head dolph she exclaimed gladly he changed again to his human form nada i almost she became human i know then they embraced somewhere in the background he heard a lesser dialogue sammy you found help meow dolph was no longer in feline form so could no longer understand cat talk but it wasnt hard to guess sammy never uttered two words where one would do then he became aware of several things the first was that they were both naked because their clothes didnt change with them the second was that nada was the most wonderful armful of woman he could imagine especially this way he had never before gotten to hug her like this for reasons that had to do with his mothers odd notions of propriety the third was that they were not alone he looked around he saw nine pairs of eyes focusing on him belonging to four goblins one betrothee one centaur foal one elf one demoness and one cat the eyes of the cat didnt bother him he knew sammy didnt care that leftwell he wasnt sure how many eyes math not being his strong point but he knew it was about eight pairs too many uh lets change to naga form he murmured in her ear nada glanced around her lovely lips pursed she turned naga he followed so that they were twined together but relatively sanitary uh whats going on here he asked still somewhat at a loss and not just because of the strangers he saw the adult conspiracy forbids an answer metria replied if she had had panties on we would have had to lock you up and swallow the key nadas head turned to cover the demoness and who is she uh shes metria dolph faltered demoness metria she i see for now the demoness had assumed a form even more luscious than nadas which was a feat only a supernatural creature could accomplish and she surely couldnt maintain it for long she just appeared he protested she said she needed i can guess oh come on nada electra said you know he loves only you nada was taken aback you mean i was getting jealous woe is me then she laughed dolph suspected that she was teasing him but he wasnt sure he also didnt know how to respond to electras remark because of course electra was the one who loved him so he got away from that subject as fast as his tongue could take him i mean who are these goblins one stepped forward i am godiva and these are my henchmen moron idiot and imbecile we abducted the centaur foal but also helped rescue him from the horde well i came to rescue che dolph said and i know nada and electra did too so you can go now because were taking him back to his dam youve got it mixed up electra said we made a deal with godiva the horde is after us all a deal he asked befuddled arrangement bargain pact pledge metria said i know that i mean just which side are these goblins on anyway ours now nada said we cant just take che home we have to settle with godiva but first we all have to get away from the horde i can become a roc and carry you all away dolph said except the goblins four extra is too many what deal did you make that we would work together to rescue che and the elf from the horde then decide who would get to take che what about jenny dolph asked who takes her how do you know my name the elf girt asked surprised sammy told me but sammy cant speak he cant speak human dolph told her i talked to him in feline he does that electra told jenny he can talk the languages of the animal forms he assumes but its a good question once we decide where che goes what about you are you going back where you came from che turned to the elf oh please dont do that yet jenny he protested you have been such a friend to me i do not want to lose you so soon she cant go home metria said we blocked the hole the hole electra asked the hole in xanth through which she came dolph said i had forgotten monsters were coming through so metria and i blocked it jenny cant go back because we closed it so i guess shell have to stay with us for a while jenny hugged che i didnt want to leave yet anyway she said we cant stand around talking godiva said the horde will catch us lets settle this fast nada said well decide where che goes and if we win you goblins help us take him to his mother and if you win well help you take him to goblin mountain now wait dolph protested we cant give him to the goblins we made a deal electra said we may not like it but godiva did help rescue him by distracting the horde yes she did che agreed i saw her dancing when she distracted them then jennys magic caught them and we were able to escape will go with whoever wins it is fair but these goblins abducted you dolph said true but they did not harm me we can work out those details later nada said right now we need a fast fair way to decide what do we do guess numbers but were all on one side or the other electra pointed out someone could cheat i know a goblin game godiva said i think it would do because its clear who wins dolph realized that they were determined to settle this before running from the approaching horde what game its called godo godiva said we make a little noose of string like this she brought out a length of string from somewhere in her long hair and nimbly twisted it into a loop then one person buries it in sand and others try to poke sticks through it the one who first succeeds wins dolph looked at the others does that seem fair i think so nada said but the one who buries it shouldnt play in fact the one who buries it shouldnt be present because he might signal a player ill bury it metria said because i dont care who wins i just like to be amused by the action shes right dolph said she doesnt care about any of us so who plays i will godiva said i will electra said give me the noose metria said godiva gave her the noose the demoness took it and turned into a dark small cloud there was a stir of dust then she reappeared its done choose she presented small sticks to godiva and electra there was a smooth patch of sand somewhere under it lay the noose wait dolph cried how do we know when someone pokes through it maybe shell win and not know it she just lifts the stick and the noose is on it godiva said making a gesture as of twisting and lifting i want something more certain than that dolph said i mean the noose could slip off or something sammy can find it jenny said dolph looked at the cat how ill tell him to find the noose with the stick through it he wont move until its there to find the roar of the approaching horde was getting louder they did not have time to waste okay i guess he said who tries first nada asked she does godiva said because i chose the game dolph was impressed not only was the gobliness a remarkably comely example of her kindhe wished he could see more of her but her hair somehow always managed to fall into the path of anything interesting obscuring itshe seemed both sensible and fair electra took her stick pondered the dirt briefly and poked it in she glanced at the cat but sammy seemed to be asleep so much for that aspect electra twisted her stick and brought up the end but there was no string on it the way she had done it she probably would have brought up the noose it she had speared it godiva stuck her stick in another place but came up similarly empty electra tried again and missed again so did the gobliness the smooth patch of dirt was getting messed up by the failed attempts but that did not necessarily make future prospects easier dolph realized the loop might be right alongside of a failed effort under the stirredup dirt as the game went on and the hullabaloo of the approaching horde grew dolph had a disreputable thought suppose metria was having her idea of fun with them suppose she had put the noose somewhere else so that it would never be found no matter how long they duguntil distracted by that they allowed themselves to be caught by the horde what a laugh yet the demoness knew that dolph alone could hold off the horde he had done so before by assuming the form of the gap dragon he could do it by becoming a huge sphinx threatening to step on them or an invisible giant whose mere stink would gag them or a salamander setting fire to them so the horde was no longer a real threat so it made no sense for metria to do that she would get more amusement from watching the party settle its conflict of interests in a civilized manner demons did not understand civilization having none themselves she would also be entertained if godiva won because then he would have to help take che to goblin mountain and he wouldnt like that at ail and she knew that how fascinating she found his trials of conscience could she have somehow rigged it so that godiva would win then dolph didnt see how so he just had to assume that she was playing it straight and hope electra came up with something she squealed with girlish excitementshe was sort of cute when she did that he noticed with mild surpriseand brought up her stick there was something hanging on it but it was a root play continued then godiva put in her stickand sammy the cat jumped it was so sudden that it startled them all he landed on the stick knocking it out of godivas hand the end flipped upand on it was the noose see jenny elf said he only looked asleep he doesnt move when he doesnt have to he found the stick with die noose he had indeed and godiva had won the game they couldnt even signal the other search parties because that would interfere with delivering che to the goblin home ah right dolph said heavily it was the deal well help you go to goblin mountain but that was just the deal nada and electra made with you ches mother didnt and shes going to be coming to rescue her foal no matter what that cant be helped the gobliness said i will worry about it when we get to the mountain right now i have to figure out the best route north metria said godiva glared at her what do you care demoness whats your motive to help us at all she finds it entertaining dolph said so far shes told the truth why go north when goblin mountain is east because the goblins of the horde are coming in from east and west and theres more of them to the south indeed the noise was now almost deafeningly loud north it is godiva said curtly but weve been up all night and on our feet we cant make good time i could carry some of you dolph said if i assumed roc form if i had clearance to fly but i cant take off in this jungle turn sphinx and well ride on your back nada said anything she asked him made immediate sense there were both winged and wingless sphinxes as there were with the dragons but the wingless ones were much larger he changed to monstrous landbound sphinx form and lay slowly down so that they could climb up on his back even so it was a struggle nada finally assumed her largest serpent form which was still much smaller than the sphinx and coiled in such a way as to form a series of tiers that the others could climb until they stepped off on his back che and jenny went first she carrying sammy followed by godiva and her three henchmen all of them stood about the same height though they were centaur elf and goblins then electra took hold of nadas head and held it while nada became a small snake in her hands they were all aboard just in time the first of the horde goblins burst into view screaming dolph could not change because he was carrying nine people counting sammy as a people he didnt want to dump them but it was no easy thing to get up suddenly either because he didnt want to cause them to slide off his back so he labored slowly and hoped that not too many goblins arrived too soon the first goblin charged right up to dolphs haunch theyre here he yelled riding a stinks thats sphinx dolph rumbled annoyed you heard me the first time bulgebottom the goblin said holding his nose then the goblin flew into the air waving his arms and legs what was happening godivas using her magic wand electra explained evidently catching on to his confusion she can loft folk here and there a magic wand that was interesting how did a goblin come to have something like that another goblin charged in in a moment this one too was flying faster and enjoying it less godiva had no mercy on her own kind but if she could handle only one at a time that wand wouldnt help much when the main body of the horde arrived that could explain how che had gotten taken by the horde in the first place dolph finally made it to his feet now he could do something about the goblins himself but he didnt want to step on them they would squish under his feet and be all messy so he simply forged forward shoving trees out of the way and left the goblins behind the horde did not give up the goblins followed more and more of them appearing as they came in from left and right dolph could see them back there when he turned his head but all they had was sticks and stones and there were not enough to break his bones so he moved slowly onward though to the goblins it was a swift pace now we can sleep electra said what a relief what a relief godiva echoed soon all of them were silent they were sleeping dolph had been up all night too but he couldnt sleep well maybe his turn would come later pretty dull eh it was metria for once he was glad of her company it would help keep him alert but he knew better than to let her know that are you still here he asked with simulated irritation everythings been decided so you might as well float off by yourself nothings been decided she asserted once you deliver the sacrificial foal to the gobs the real fun will begin just wait till the winged monsters arrive what winged monsters he asked looking nervously around a flying dragon could swoop low on a strafing run and toast his passengers that would be a problem the ones cheiron centaur is gathering to rescue his foal they wont equivocate around you know they wont what sidestep hedge weasel shuffle feline paws pussyfoot whatever they will demolish that goblin mountain tunnel by tunnel thats a show i wouldnt miss for anything she was probably right chex centaur was a relatively gentle creature seldom getting her tail in an uproar but her mate cheiron was a stallion and he brooked little if any interference in his business his foal was certainly his business there will be abyss to pay dolph muttered what to pay blazes underworld hades oh no you dont she said laughing you wont get me to tell you that bad word you want i know you dont know it darn he swore mend sew repair she asked solicitously will you go away youyou whatever of course not sweetie i love tormenting you i think ill drop in on your wedding night and watch you try to figure out how to summon the stork stork thats how you consummate a marriage innocent boy it doesnt really count until you contact the stork but i dont know how to do that thats why it should be rare entertainment dolph lumbered on no longer quite as satisfied with his success in making her stay how he wished he could pass that magic barrier and become adult so he could learn everything in the adult conspiracy then the demoness wouldnt be able to tease him so cruelly but first he would have to get married and that was worse oh he would like to marry nada but the thought of seeing electra die appalled him yet if he married her and lost nada his heart would break time was crunching on as determinedly as his big sphinx feet but he was no closer to an answer than he had been six years ago when he had first gotten betrothed to the two girls this news about having to summon the stork just made it worse nada knew the secret but not electra but he feared nada wouldnt tell him after all she hadnt told him until now why should she change her mind then assuming he found some way to get around the problem of electras situation it was solid day when he tromped up to the south bank of the withacookee river he was going to splash on through it but its bottom turned out to be the muckiest muck he could imagine probably dough left over from the halfbaked bog and he was afraid his legs would sink in like deep pilings and be permanently mired so he ground to a slow halt nada woke oh the river she said surprised what did you expect a desert metria asked in dolphs voice what nada asked surprised at hearing that tone from him that wasnt me dolph cried that is it wasnt what i meant to say the demoness said immediately using his voice again i meant to say that only the very most stupid hammer would stupid what nada asked vice clamp pliers grip wrench yes no not quite wench metria wench thats it only the very most stupid wench would confuse a river with a desert so you can justuhoh for the demoness had realized that nada had called her by name she departed in a puff of irritated smoke i knew it wasnt you dolph nada said i heard how she was teasing you before im glad dolph said relieved now i have to figure out how to cross the river the muck is too deep did you get any sleep last night nada asked solicitously no how nice it was to have her interested then i think you had better get some so why dont you become a whaleboat and drift down the river for a few hours i understand it flows generally northward from here so your direction will be right and we can all relax and still keep moving thats a great notion nada he exclaimed hang on he changed into whaleboat form slowly so as not to dislodge the others soon the new form was complete a giant flat fish with a hollow back that floated serenely on the placid water his side flippers and rear flukes enabled him to swim as rapidly as he wanted but he didnt have to because his nose was a hole in the back of his fiat head that would never sink under the water no matter how hard he slept youre welcome dolph nada said ill stay awake now and keep an eye on our course i got some sleep last night so im better off than the rest of you ill wake you if anything happens thanks nada how he loved her she was just the most lovely and sensible and princessly person he knew always knowing the right thing to do and doing it it had been a great day when he had gotten betrothed to her youre welcome dolph she said she sounded a little sad that reminded him that she didnt love him oh she would marry him if he chose her because she had given her word and a princess never broke her word but her heart would not be in it she was nice to him because that was the proper thing for a betrothee to be he knew he should do the decent thing and not marry her but he wasnt sure he could there was a clamor at the bank the goblins of the horde had arrived well too bad for them they could not reach him or his passengers out here in the middle of the river they could follow along the bank all they wanted it would do them no good satisfied he let himself drift off to sleep dolph drifted down the river guided occasionally by the delicious touch of nadas hand on his nose so that he did not get stuck in a culdesac culdesacs were nasty offshoots which ended in sacks once something floated into one the drawstring would pull it closed and it would eat whatever it had caught of course dolph could change into something else and escape it but then all the folk riding on him would get dunked it was better this way even apart from the simple delight of having nadas attention now and then he heard the clamor of the goblins as they raged at the shore the three male goblins with godiva took pleasure in standing halfway tall and making gestures at those on the shore dolph wafting in and out of his snooze picked up intriguing bits of dialogue what does that gesture mean moron jenny elf inquired it seemed that now that they were working together the elf and the centaur foal got along well enough with these four goblins dolph gathered that though the goblins had abducted che they had not really mistreated him only hobbled him so he couldnt get away he had been unhappy at the time but recognized that they were just doing a job gesture moron asked with the finger like this dolph hadnt realized that male goblins could blush but this one did for dolph felt morons big feet turn burning hot uh i dont know the goblin said but you made that gesture to the goblins on the land and they threw rocks at us the elf persisted im glad were out of reach of their rocks but that certainly must have been a magic gesture and i wonder if i could learn it i dont think so moron said girls dont use that magic oh you mean it doesnt work for girls at this point godiva crossed over to join them do you have a problem she inquired i just wanted to know how to do mis gesture jenny said innocently godiva must have paled or at least become lightheaded because dolph felt her weight diminish dont use that gesture she snapped at moron dont you know this girl is underage do you think things are different in her tribe just because they have pointed ears youre in violation of the adult conspiracy but they were doing it to us first moron protested we couldnt just let them get away with it then answer them with this gesture godiva said she faced out and made some kind of signal dolph couldnt see what she did but he saw the effect twenty fierce goblins at the shore stiffened and half of them fell face first into the water where shellfish shelled them the three male goblins on the whaleboat fainted i didnt see that jenny elf said what you werent meant to dear godiva replied but i certainly am curious what dolph was curious too whatever it was it had twenty times the effect of what the male goblins had been doing not unti you are adult the gobliness said firmly jenny sighed so did dolph the adult conspiracy was a terrible thing later they stopped at lake tsoda popka and the passengers dipped out cups of the fizzly sweet drink to go with the cookies they had picked dolph snaked out his tongue trying to latch on to a cookie from a plant by the bank but couldnt reach it so had to be satisfied with a drink of the pop then electra caught on and started dropping him cookies she was often thoughtful that way always being a good companion and friend he liked her a lot but of course she was hardly the shadow of the romantic figure nada was they drifted on lake tsoda popka turned out to be not so much a single body of pop but a poppedapart cluster of lakelets each a different flavor dolph made a mental note he wanted to return here some time after this adventure was over and royally oink out he knew nada wouldnt do it but electra would come with him and even get into a cookie fight with him cookie fights were one of those pleasures only the young really appreciated maybe if they brought bottles they could dip them full of tsoda shake them violently and squirt each other mercilessly oh what joy the three male goblins recovered enough to play same games of godo with che and jenny using leftover cookie crumbs in lieu of dirt nada and godiva got into a discussion about the proper care of hair that dolph tuned out he liked to look at their swirling tresses but its maintenance didnt interest him at all sammy cat snoozed throughout seeming to be dedicated to the proposition that speed killed and the less motion the better electra took the helm guiding him and he knew better than to object because she wasnt nada the demoness metria faded in and out observing and seeking to sow mischief in little ways but the others had caught on to her and generally couldnt be fooled overall it was a peaceful and pleasant voyage when the river began turning grandly to the west looking for the sea because all rivers had a death wish and sought to drown themselves in seas or lakes they had to leave it they would have to go north then around the top of the elements then south to goblin mountain that was beside the element of earth south of that beside the element of air was mount etamin where drago dragon livedand the naga folk too bad they werent going to that mountain for dolph would have loved to meet nagas folks again and she would have loved to be reunioned with them what rejoined rejunctioned remerged reunited whatever then he snapped out of it and realized that he had daydreamed a dialogue with metria he caught a glimpse of invisible mare imbri galloping away her pranks were always harmless and usually pleasant imbri had been a night mare but had lost the taste for it when she acquired half a soul and now was happier as a day mare dolph resumed sphinx form now rested and again trudged in his slow yet groundcovering way north with the others on his back two small dragons spied him and looped down to investigate perhaps thinking of entertaining themselves with some innocent strafing but godiva waved her wand at them and they almost fell out of the air it seemed that her wand could make anything fly and when directed against a creature who was already flying it messed things up dolph remembered how chex made herself light with flicks of her tail if she overdid it she could have trouble too light things didnt necessarily like to be made lighter they came in due course to the ogrefenogre fen which was pretty swampy but his huge feet were able to handle it he was moving much faster than he had in the night because he could see where he was going but still it was getting late in the day and they had a distance yet to go so he didnt stop if he moved right along they could reach goblin mountain by soon after nightfall maybe he wasnt keen on delivering che centaur there but a deal was a deal and he had to honor it so he might as well get it done as fast as possible but that reminded him of the other aspects of this situation what did the goblins want che for godiva had said something about using him as a companion for her daughter but that probably meant as a steed and che was way too young to be ridden his legs would be ruined so this did not sound good even if the goblins had no bad intent there was also the matter of the foal being away from his dam centaurs of any age were amazingly smart and competent they did indeed seem to be a superior species but dolph knew che and knew that he wasnt ready for such separation no matter how well he might be treated dolph also knew that there was no way ches sire would allow it so it would have been bettermuch betterif electra had won the game and they had been able to take the foal home as it was dolph didnt know what would happen also what about the elf girl she was nice enough but a strange one because of her pointed ears and fourfingered hands and her size what was to become of her she had tried to rescue che but the goblinate of the golden horde had been too much for her now she couldnt go home which meant she was stuck in xanth well maybe they could take her to castle roogna one thing about this adventure it was taking his mind off his problem of his two betrothees but he knew that as soon as this was done he would have to buckle down and make his decision he was stil no closer to it than he had been six years ago an ogre loomed before him dolph kept moving ogres were big but grown sphinxes were bigger he hoped to avoid trouble with the ogres here but if it came it came and he would just plow through the ogre fell back a stunned look on his stupid face what had happened dolph hadnt done anything that did it nada electra exclaimed oh nada had stood up in the ogres sight and inhaled that explained it ogres werent smart but no brain was necessary to appreciate nadas human qualities that ogre would be out for the duration smiling then a female ogre showed up oopsshe would be less impressed by nadas inhalation because ogresses were justifiably proud of their ugliness the perfect ogre was stronger uglier and stupider than any other creature of the jungle the males could be stunned by beauty because it was totally foreign to their experience but the females did have a glimmer of its nature and labored hard to eradicate it then the ogress sailed into the air godivas wand was in action again the ogress made an ugly somersault and landed on a rock on her face the rock cracked apart and the fragments shied away horrified but her face was unchanged it still looked like saton cornmeal mush the ogress began to realize that something was up thoughts traveled slowly through an ogre brain but in time some of them did get where they were going her skull heated and the fleas jumped off as their feet were scorched she was trying to think but in a moment she gave up on that futile effort and simply charged in the wand lofted her again higher and farther this time it dumped her headfirst in a mud puddle the mud petrified in the vicinity of her face and merely curdled farther out that made it difficult for her to get out she bellowed and the petrified mud exploded sending rocklike chunks far wide and deep the ogress got back to her feet and charged again once a thought got into an ogres head little short of an earthquake could dislodge it nobody in his right mind tangled with an ogreexcept another ogre fortunately she was charging in the wrong direction dolph plodded on trying to lessen the impacts of his great feet so that the ogress would not catch on to his location that wasnt hard because the impacts were more like squishes as he slogged through the slough dolph slogged south and soon came to the region of the birds most of them ignored him but a roc circled pondering the sphinx was the largest landbound creature and the roc was the largest flying creature except for the simurgh who did not generally involve herself in ordinary matters but she had when chex and cheiron got married dolph had been there and he had agreed with the others to safeguard their foal he was afraid he wasnt doing that very well now the roc decided to attack rocs tended to resent the size of sphinxes and this ones beak was evidently out of joint because a sphinx was invading the kingdom of the birds dolph did not like this at all should he change form dumping his passengers so as to avoid a confrontation che centaur climbed up on dolphs head and waved his arms get down che electra cried alarmed then the roc shied away with a deafening squawk dolph realized what had happened the roc had recognized che the rocs were winged monsters and all of them were sworn to protect che so when this one saw that the foal was here and all right it canceled its charge there would be no further trouble in the realm of the birds but what would happen when some of these same winged monsters came to rescue che from goblin mountain dolph wished again that the decision had gone the other way he came to the region of the griffins as dusk was falling every creature here was a winged monster sure enough in a moment three fierce griffins flew up to challenge the intruders che waved to them and so instead of attacking they formed an honor guard through the region they assumed mat the others riding the sphinx were serving ches interest they were in a way metria reappeared floating in her regular luscious demon form near one of his eyes it should get interesting soon she said encouragingly do you really believe those goblins are going to treat the foal well dolph could speak in this form but knew better than to answer her she was just trying to make him think about something he didnt want to think about of course once hes inside goblin mountain it will be impossible to get him out again she continued blithely because if anything attacked theyd simply dump him into the pot and have him cooked and eaten before the defenses were breached so hell be their hostage for sure dolph plodded on knowing she was right yet what could any of them have done in the situation electra had explained it to him godiva had played a key part in the rescue of che from the horde by doing a sexy dance to distract the enemy goblins long enough for the elfs magic to take effect godiva had risked her life to rescue che and nada and electra had to honor the deal they had made with her and it did seem that she didnt want to hurt che that counted for a lot but did it count for enough ill at ease dolph plodded on night fell without much of a crash as the sun just barely managed to escape getting caught by the darkness dolph wondered what would happen if the sun played it too close and got lost in the night it would probably have a nervous breakdown he tromped on through more muck and shallow waters this was where the loan sharks swam who were bright pretty colors but would take an arm and a leg if anyone let them the sphinx was far too big for them to bother though at last he approached goblin mountain he recognized it by the glimmering lights along its surface outlining it it had many little goblin caves and paths running between them so that it looked like a collection of anchored fireflies the mountain shook as the huge feet of the sphinx tramped to its base goblins erupted and swarmed down to meet the challenge bristling with sharp sticks dull clubs and guttering torches now the mountain looked like a lighted anthill godiva stood on dolphs head and swirled her hair provocatively tell goldy i have returned with the foal she called there was a stir a number of goblins charged up the nearest path and back into the mountain dolph waited not ready to trust such a mass of goblins until he had confirmation that his party was recognized a female goblin emerged she walked regally down the path until she stood before dolph loft me godiva she said then she rose into the air and came to land on dolphs back dolph turned his head enough to cast one eye on the proceedings the two goblin females embraced and dolph saw how much alike they looked except for age the newcomer was like an older version of godiva with shorter hair what kept you she asked i have brought the foal mother we had complications on the way so had to improvise that was because of murphys curse electra explained the woman frowned dolph now understood that she was goldy goblin who had first gained power here by the use of the wand he had seen her in the tapestry when he replayed the story of smash ogre but then she had been young and beautiful now she was old and grim i see what is the status of these others we made a deal to bring the foal here they will leave in peace very well loft me down then the foal and me jenny elf said now wait nada protested jenny shouldnt be made prisoner che is my friend jenny said i want to be with him godiva looked at che this was not part of the deal she is my friend che said i would much prefer to have her with me no one else looked particularly pleased but they understood that the elf belonged to none of their parties and could choose as she wished well have to let her go nada said at last and electra agreed well have to take her godiva said grimly she did enable us to save the foal goldy faced the elf do you understand that once you enter our mountain you may not be allowed to leave yes jenny said she was evidently quite nervous about the prospect but she wasnt going to leave che ill bring sammy too she picked up her cat then so be it goldy signaled godiva and abruptly was floating up across and down to the ground then che centaur floated similarly down followed by jenny elf and sammy cat then moron idiot and imbecile after that godiva threw the wand down to her mother who caught it neatly and used it to loft godiva herself down the party filed into goblin mountain walking between lines of armed goblins oh i dont like this nada exclaimed her eyes overflowing she spoke for all of them dolph backed away from the mountain then slowly walked around it proceeding on south there was nothing else to do chapter cheirons chaos cheiron walked along the rim of mount rushmost ill at ease the news chex had brought was horrendously disturbing but that was only the personal aspect the political aspect was just about as bad for he knew the moment he heard the news that this was no ordinary crime che would not have been abducted just by chance no this had the earmarks of goblin involvement and that suggested that the war between the monsters of the land and the monsters of the air was about to be resumed it had started centuries before even millennia before when the goblins and the harpies had their falling out because the harpy males were attracted by the goblin females legs before it was done the harpy males had almost disappeared leaving the harpy females severely out of countenance and the goblin males were as mean and ugly as the goblin females were nice and pretty their wars had involved their allies of land and air and had contributed to the decline of civilization in xanth today the centaurs and even the human folk were restoring xanthly standards while both harpies and goblins were scarce at least on land but the old alignments remained and there were ancient covenants that had never been vacated that was where the political element came in if the goblins had taken che hostage in order to wrest some advantage from the monsters of the air then cheiron would have to negotiate with them on that basis he had no intention of doing so it was night verging on dawn but he would not rest chex was sleeping secure in the knowledge that he cheiron would know what to do he did not care to inform her of his private doubts but perhaps it wasnt as bad as it looked he could find out before taking action he flicked his body and leaped off the rim in a moment he was flying powerfully to the lair of hardy harpy it happened that hardys goblin daughter gloha was visiting the harpies and she was the one cheiron wanted to see the romance between hardy and beautiful glory goblin had nearly ignited the war again only the discovery that goblins and harpies together had magic talents had eased that crisis but it could be that the goblins retained resentment so had taken captive another landair crossbreed gloha with her goblin connection might know he reached the harpy grove whatcha up to monster one of them screeched irritably disturbed from her sleep i come to see gloha monster cheiron replied using the same courtesy title she had greeted him with they were all monsters and proud of it she settled back satisfied as a rule the harpies hated goblins but gloha was different she was of course a goblin but she was also a winged monster he reached hardys tall tree gloha could not clamp her feet on a branch the way a harpy could so hardy had made for her a fine and private nest complete with a roof against die weather gloha he called hovering beside the nest in a moment the thatch door opened and a sleepy head poked out what it is cheiron i must talk with you oh of course i will fly to ground she was too polite to point out that it was still before dawn the very awfullest time to woke a maiden from her slumber she stepped out onto the branch pulling on her robe she was a lovely little lady goblin with birdlike wings now fifteen years old soon she would have to decide what kind of man to take up with unfortunately there were no other flying goblins they flew to the ground where cheiron could stand firmly che has been abducted by goblins he said abruptly do you know anything about it her dainty hand went to her mouth oh no cheiron are you sure i am sure he has been abducted and the operation has the goblin stigma we have search parties out of course but my concern is with the motive it occurred to me that there might be some residual animosity because of the liaison of your parents and that this is an expression of it i know nothing of this cheiron she said but i will certainly find out i will fly immediately to glorys village and ask thank you do you need a guard she considered ordinarily no but if this is the start of something serious perhaps it is better get on my back and i will take you mere she nodded she flew to his back and settled down as light as a bird then he leaped up and spread his great wings forging into the sky as dawn came they reached the goblin village gloha flew off to consult with the chief while cheiron planted his feet and waited alertly on guard against treachery if the war were being resumed his trip here could even be part of the plot to lure him down so that he too could be captured but he had no fear of goblins he could handle his bow and spear as well as any centaur could and that meant that fifty goblins would die before he had to retreat soon gloha returned with the goblin chief the man was gnarled and ugly in the manner of his kind but his approach was not menacing perhaps this was because of gloha who by the dawns early light was as gorgeous a goblin as this village was likely to see her wings folded formed a feather cloak covering her backside so that a stranger would have to look two and a half times to realize that she was a crossbreed instead of a rich gobliness even a goblin chief tended to behave halfway politely when in the company of a creature like this we know nothing of this abduction feathersnoot the chief said halfway politely gloha was at your mating ceremony six years ago and joined the pledge to protect your offspring we dont give a clod of dung for you horsefoot or your flighty mare but we dont want the simurgh down on us so were leaving all winged manfaced horserears alone i appreciate your sincerity clubfoot cheiron said in polite goblin protocol but what about other goblin tribes the chief scowled i can count on the fingers of one hand how many of them you can trust to leave your foal alone hoofnose he held up one dark fist but grandpa gorbage gloha protested you cant count thats not so the chief retorted gruffly i can count noneand thats how many tribes agreed cheiron said but there is no goblinwide conspiracy or you would know about it right tailbrain its probably the gobi in ate of the golden horde theyre closest to you and worst even we dont like them grandpa you dont like any other tribes gloha said right but we dont like the horde even more than we dont like the others theyre mean gobs cheiron knew of the horde they certainly were the worst gobs princess ivy had brushed with them more than once and dumped most of them into the gap chasm but they regenerated like weeds and made trouble again but though they were the most violent they werent the smartest of goblin tribes che had been abducted by smart goblins with special magic still the news that there was no conspiracy was gratifying that meant that it wasnt a landair war in the making but merely a foray by one tribe he could deal with one tribe thank you for your news chief he said im glad we have no present quarrel well if it wasnt for gloha and the simurgh wed have one sweatflank the chief said defensively to be sure cheiron agreed placating him perhaps some day that will change yeah the chief breathed forming his first smile byebye grandpa gloha said kissing him on the cheek the goblin glowered but could not quite hide his ungoblinish pleasure then gloha flew to cheirons back and he leaped into the air flicked himself and spread his wings the downdraft blasted a cloud of sand into the chiefs face cheiron pretended not to notice after all sandblasting would probably improve the gobs complexion dont take me home gloha said ill go with you to mount rushmost but you should not be involved in ugly business like this he protested yes i should if another goblin tribe did this you will need someone to negotiate who they wont attack right away but that would be risky for you gloha you know that regular centaurs dont like crossbreeds some goblins may not like them either that may be she argued but run a worse risk if i dont get out and meet folk a worse risk old maidism now more of her motive came clear she was fifteen and just about ready for romance her own tribe might be tolerant of a winged goblin but goblins were generally exogamous preferring to marry outside their home tribes this could serve as an excellent pretext to meet many males from many tribes and discover who was tolerant and who was not her decision to check the goblin tribes rather than the harpy flocks was sensible there were still so few male harpies that she would make vicious enemies just by trying very well if your father approves hell approve she said confidently no doubt like most teenage girls she could twist her father around her littlest finger just as she did with her grandfather on the goblin side cheiron had to admit that she could indeed be useful because most goblins were surly and guilty ones would be worse how surly would they be when they encountered her several rungs grades and degrees less than otherwise surely especially if there were young young males who were interested in pretty young females that was to say all of them they flew on to mount rushmost cheiron felt marginally better because the scope of the plot had been reduced but the matter was still desperately serious a harpy flew up as he landed news horsebird she screeched i saw your foal where cheiron asked excited trudging south with a funny big elf captive of the golden horde cheiron felt a terrible chill the horde are you sure sure im sure she screeched thats my home territory i snatch their leavings thats why i watch them when their spies reported fresh meat on the river they hustled up there and nabbed it with help from fracto the cloud ill bet theyre going to cook them both cheiron was seldom speechless but for some reason he was this time so gloha filled in for him thank you harpy we appreciate your information and will go there immediately to rescue che then she reconsidered did you say an elf yes an odd one the harpy screeched pointed ears and fourfingered hands a girl bigger than any other she must have gotten very weak so far from her elm she was tired but not weak the harpy screeched she was helping the foal when he stumbled they looked like friends she laughed raucously can you imagine friends she spread her wings and took off her backdraft smelling awful in the typical harpy way cheiron remembered something chex had said as she had babbled out her message she had briefly encountered an odd elf girl and her orange cat could this be the same elf how did this relate to the abduction of che and how could they be friends che had no elf friends the elves generally kept to their own business and there was no elm near the home glade they were good enough folk and a bulwark against goblins in their territory but che must have met her since the abduction friends che was more choosy than that but the elf was captive too evidently maybe she had been traveling alone and the goblins had captured her on the same foray so had lumped the two together that would not be friendship but common misery that made more sense nevertheless he could afford to take nothing for granted we shall have to rescue that elf too he said oh good gloha exclaimed id love to meet her i get along well with odd creatures he knew what she meant there were a number of oneofakind or fewofakind creatures often the results of crossbreeding in addition to the winged centaurs there was grundy the golem and his wife rapunzel who was a humanelven crossbreed who could change sizes and had the most marvelous hair in xanth there was gloha herself naturally she related well she knew what it was like to be unique in species but right now he had to take action with che the captive of the goblinate of the golden hordethe very worst place to behe had to take necessary steps immediately he did not acknowledge that it might already be too late that the goblins could have boiled the foal at dawn that simply was not a viable option he had to assume that the goblins would play with their victims a while torturing them psychologically before proceeding to physical mistreatment and finally the boiling he had to assume that he had at least this day to organize for the recovery for this was not a mission that could be simply accomplished the horde was vicious with its horrible hate spring and any illplanned effort would result in disaster oh the winged monsters would gladly exterminate the entire horde but that would be useless if che died in the process so cheiron schooled himself to do what was most difficult at the moment nothing he had to get more information before he acted and then act with extreme dispatch gloha may i ask a favor of you he asked of course cheiron she said i want to help go to dragon net and tell him i wish to organize a posse to rescue my foal he said but not only must it be capable of handling the goblins of the golden horde it must be highly disciplined and not strike until we are ready ask him to have it ready by days end if possible she considered evidently worried about the delay but deferred to his judgment i will tell him she said and flew away across the flat surface of the mountain cheiron walked across to where chex was sleeping with grundy golem on her back similarly asleep what a wonderful thing it had been when chex came into his life he had been the only winged centaur hi xanth then had heard of a young female but a centaur did not develop an association with another centaur merely because the other existed the situation and the other centaur had to be right the female was young and inexperienced and had not yet figured out how to fly she was a fine looking specimen healthy and resolute but inexperienced the fact that she was beautiful and winged was not enough did she have the character required of the species as he foresaw it he would have to test her and find out as it happened she tested well and later she learned to fly he had not told her how of course part of her proving of herself was in achieving this without help then they had married and the simurgh herself had overseen the ceremony and sworn all the monsters to safeguard their offspring that had been a surprise cheiron had in mind a stable new species but evidently there was more to it than that what was ches destiny it had to be considerable for never in known history had the simurgh left her perch in the tree of seeds to participate in such an event could that destiny be why che had been abducted was someone aware of the future and determined to change it by eliminating the centaur before he came of age to achieve that destiny if so this was worse than a conspiracy to resume the war between monsters this was an effort to change destiny itself cheiron would have found that chilling even if it hadnt been his beloved foal at stake chex detected his presence and woke she smiled what a lovely creature she was have you located che she asked yes there is a complication i am handling it oh good she said visibly relieved and relaxed back into sleep he had done the minimum he had to he had told her part of it he saw nothing to be gained by telling her exactly where che was that would only send her into as close an approach to being hysterical as she could manage he was indeed handling it and with luck the rescue mission would be organized and on its way before she caught up on her sleep and demanded further information he saw swift little dragonflies taking off for points north east west and south leaving tiny contrails dragon net was sending out his minions to summon the creatures of the posse the dragonflies would know where to find the fiercest yet most disciplined monsters and would bring them back here as fast as possible cheiron was satisfied he knew he could leave the organization of the posse to dragon net knowing that it would be competently done indeed already there was a mediumsmall dragon coming in how fast word spread but this dragon sought cheiron not net i have seen your foal he gasped his fire almost out he had evidently flown swiftly gaining on the clumsy harpy and had a significantly later report he was riding a sphinx in the company of girls and goblins and one of them had a magic wand they used the wand to twist my companion and me out of the sky but not before we could see that something strange was afoot cheiron was amazed che riding a sphinx sphinxes cared little for the affairs of other creatures girls what were they doing in this business goblins on a sphinx that was strangest of all he got the dragon to describe the other folk as well as it could and gradually he pieced it together one girl was stunningly beautiful that sounded like nada naga chex had said that a number of search parties had gone out and the two betrothees of prince dolph formed one party the dragon had also noted the pointed ears of the elf girl so the betrothees could have rescued che and the elf and then prince dolph could have come and assumed the form of a sphinx so as to carry them the goblins must be prisoners perhaps hostages so che had been saved but the dragon said the party was going north away from ches home that seemed to make no sense the sphinx could have crunched right through the goblin camp gone directly home and been there by now why was it going the wrong way you look puzzled centaur a voice said he looked but saw nothing who are you he demanded in no mood for mischief a form appeared vaguely human i am d metria a demon he exclaimed youre no winged monster you dont belong here yes i am the figure said sprouting wings and breasts yes i do i have come to impart olds that will interest you and cause you much perplexity impart what history information bulletin communication ancient or recent intelligence news whatever she flapped her wings in annoyance about your foal but if you arent interested she began slowly fading i am interested cheiron said quickly well you didnt act interested she faded further cheiron suspected that she was teasing him he did not appreciate it either impart your news or fade out entirely he snapped turning away what will you give me for it nothing because i do not trust demons he walked on ignoring her this evidently unsettled her do you have a creature who can verify truth let me talk to that one the zombie owl can do that he said shortly over there he pointed to the perch where the decrepit bird slept by day the demoness flew to the owl listen you rotter she said tell the centaur whether i speak truth the princes betrothees made a deal with godiva goblin of goblin mountain to work together to save the foal from the golden horde and then decide where he should go because neither side wanted the foal dead they saved the foal with the help of the foreign elf girl and then played a game of godo to decide godiva won so they had to help her take the foal to goblin mountain the owl opened one big rancid eye trhoo it squawked so it was true this complicated things further if a deal had been made to save che he could not in honor abrogate it goblin mountain was bad but not nearly as bad as the golden horde why north thats not the way to goblin mountain either they had to flee north until prince dolph caught up to them metriasaid then the horde had covered all points south so they had to plan a route the other way around the elements traveling together it seemed less risky if the girls had won the prince could have taken the smaller party directly through the air to the foals home trhoo the owl agreed so they are all traveling together cheiron concluded because all are bound to see che safely to his destination you got it centaur the demoness agreed doesnt that make your tail feathers squirm why does goblin mountain want che i wasnt interested enough to investigate that fhalse the owl said oh shut up you odd bird the demoness snapped then to cheiron i just think youll squirm more if heave something to your imagination trhoo cheiron knew he would not get any more useful information from her thank you demoness he said i will take it from here arent you going to go rescue your foal in due course if you hurry you can do it before they reach goblin mountain i am aware of that her demonic eyes glittered so so ill wait he said wishing she would go away but there was almost no way to make a demon depart short of an exorcism and he lacked that talent her eyes rounded in simulated surprise you mean you will let the nasty goblins get your innocent foal into their awful mountain from which little short of allout war will dislodge him yes but why centaur isnt that foolish even to your kind he knew she was baiting him and getting her demonic jollies therefrom but he had to answer no it is a question of honor a deal was made to save che and that deal has to be honored so we shall rescue che after that deal has been honored but that will require a battalion of the most ferocious monsters you can musterand then you have to dismantle the mountain level by level to reach the foal yes she shook her head that should be fun i shall be sure to watch the show she faded out some show but despite her cruel teasing she was right it would be one horrendous job to reduce that mountain and it would expose che to unconscionable risk but what he had not told the demoness was that he had another way in mind it would be a while yet before the posse was assembled now he could relax getting some necessary rest before the campaign began as he saw it the sphinx traveling at normal sphinx velocity would not arrive until evening the night would not be good for an attack by flying creatures so they had until the following morning to get there and get set up then they would see one thing was sure che centaur was not going to remain prisoner in goblin mountain cheiron slept on his feet beside chex waiting out the day periodically reports came in a roc arrived the hugest of birds and squawked in its deafening language grundy golem woke from his nap on chexs back and took the message for grundys talent was language he says the sphinx passed through the realm of the birds and che was there with the others and seemed healthy thank you cheiron said and grundy emitted a loud squawk translating actually cheiron could understand bird language pretty well himself from long association but he preferred to let the golem feel useful later a griffin arrived a handsome creature with the body of a lion and the head of an eagle whose hide was the color of shoe polish grundy translated again and so they learned that the party had passed through that region safely che still seemed well and friendly with the odd elf by this time chex was awake and cheiron updated her on developments so che is safe but we have to allow him to be taken to goblin mountain he concluded yes of course she agreed appreciating the necessity of honoring the deal that had enabled nada and electra to save the foal from the horrendous clutches of the goblinate of the golden horde then when the party goes on we must question that elf who is obviously the one i encountered i believe her cat located che but she was then made prisoner by the goblins along with che and they have been companions in adversity i suspect she has been a mainstay of support for him because he has evidently borne up surprisingly well this would not have been the case had he been alone cheiron agreed che was bright in the centaur way but emotionally remained a foal and could not have handled the horror of captivity by the horde by himself but with a companion to shield him from the full impact he could have survived and evidently had that spoke volumes for the elf girl perhaps she had no special virtues but she had been there at the critical time and that made all the difference in the afternoon dragon nets posse was ready it consisted of one flying sphinx two chimaerae three rocs four griffins five flying dragons and a flock of harpies there were hosts of tiny dragonflies and fireflies as a support group and a cockatrice for close work one of the dragons was draco of mount etamin immediately to the south of goblin mountain he was a firedrake not large for a dragon but versatile because he could traverse caves even when they extended under water he had attended cheirons nuptial ceremony bringing prince dolph who had assumed the form of a dragonfly for the occasion draco knew the region well and would serve as a guide for the members of the posse who were from farther afield cheiron was glad to see him there was no substitute for direct knowledge of the terrain before they took off cheiron briefed them my foal che will be the captive of the tribe of goblins residing at goblin mountain we do not know why they abducted him but the indication is that they do not plan to harm him there is no present evidence that they intend to use him politically apparently this is a private matter it is possible that it relates to ches identification by the supreme winged monster the simurgh as one whose life will change the course of the history of xanth the goblins may believe that by controlling him they control xanth we can not allow this either in terms of the history of xanth or as a personal matter as he is my foal he glanced around the group a moment before continuing all the members of the posse were grim as they received the information he was speaking in the human language which many of them did not understand perfectly so grundy golem was translating first the rocs and griffins listened to the squawks and ruffed out their feathers and flexed their claws then the dragons listened to the growls and puffed out slow jets of fire smoke or steam depending on their species i will not attack the mountain at the outset cheiron continued as the translations caught up i will deliver an ultimatum they will have a set time in which to deliver che to me unharmed if they do so we will depart in peace as the translations reached that point the creatures showed disappointment they preferred to fight it was not that they didnt want to save che it was that it was more glorious to wrest him by battle than to have him handed over without struggle if they do not do so we will attack cheiron said and at that point there were squawks of approval and fierce jets of fire smoke and steam we will take out their guards at the surface and smoke out the deeper denizens here the smokers exhaled for a moment disappearing in a cloud of smoke some folk thought that smoke was not as effective as fire but the fact was that in an enclosed space smoke was more deadly than fire those goblins would come out coughing but we shall do so in an orderly manner halting the moment they capitulate this is a rescue mission not a destruction mission but suppose they kill the foal the sphinx inquired cheiron saw chex flinch he wished that question had not been asked but he had to answer it then we destroy that tribe completely he said grimly they made suitable expressions of regret for the loss of the foal but were thrilled at the prospect of mayhem on this level it had been a long time since there had been a prospect like this cheiron was privately disgusted but knew that his posse had to have the capacity to reduce that mountain to rubble otherwise the goblins would laugh at me ultimatum they might laugh anyway until a demonstration of power was made we expect to arrive at night cheiron concluded we will rest until morning and then survey the situation while we negotiate remember we may make a show of force but we will not actually attack until they either refuse to yield the captive or show bad faith discipline is paramount they understood they did not enjoy discipline but it was the price of admission into the posse grundy golem joined gloha on cheirons back because he expected to use both of them in the negotiations gloha would talk to the goblins and grundy would translate for the benefit of the posse they took off the small creatures hitchhiked rides with the larger ones so dragon files kept company with full dragons and the cockatrice rode with a roc the harpies were relatively clumsy flyers so they too had to hitch rides promising not to befoul their steeds they flew in formation northnortheast the strongest flyers were the rocs so they stifled their pace and formed a wedge in front forging a channel for the others the posse made swift progress to the gap chasm and beyond as the day waned into dusk and then into night they skirted the kingdom of the flies and die element of air not wanting trouble on the way i dont think i know you gloha grundy said i know of you of course when your parents came together it almost made for a war but youve been among the winged monsters mostly and not at castle roogna well i am a winged monster she replied i never saw a prettier monster he exclaimed she grew hot evidently blushing cheiron didnt mean to snoop on their dialogue but there was little way to avoid it i wish there were a monster of my kind but im the only one im the only one of my kind too grundy said but i found it didnt matter when i met rapunzel the only one of her kind but youre not a winged monster she pointed out you dont have an obligation to establish a new species without sacrificing its best properties youve got a point grundy said the goblins and the harpies have been fighting so long that there hasnt been any interbreeding in centuries but i guess there used to be in the early days i wonder if there are any winged goblins in the brain corals pool the brain corals pool she exclaimed i never thought of that oh i wonder if it could be so maybe theres a man for me in there who knows grundy agreed maybe you should go and ask the good magician maybe i should after we rescue che you know che faces the same problem grundy said hes another winged monster with no other of his kind you might go together and maybe one question would answer you both maybe it would oh grundy youve given me something to look forward to the same applied to cheiron he had worried about the fate of his foal knowing that there were none for him to mate with even if there were one year a sisterfoal she would not do if the species was to become established they needed to find other winged centaursand as far as he knew there were none in xanth he had looked for years before chex appeared only if there were other crossbreedings would there be others and centaurs as a class were too conservative to permit that cheirons own genesis had been because of a chance meeting of a centaur and a winged horse both of whom had come unwittingly to drink at a love spring they had mated involuntarily then remained together long enough to see to the survival of the offspring the equine element had been retained and the other aspects had manifested so that a winged centaur had resulted the mare had suckled it until it could be weaned then departed forever the centaur had taught it in the centaur fashion until it could pursue its own further education and similarly departed thus cheiron had been alone more so than a normal orphan short of tricking centaurs and winged horses into drinking love potions together he saw no way to bring others of his kind into being chex was unique in that her parents had not taken love elixir but the normal centaurs shunned her and her mother for bearing her but if there had been similar breedings in past centuries as there well might have been and the foals had been hidden away in the brain corals poolthat was something that ought to be checked maybe that chaos that threatened the dawning species of winged centaur could be abated so cheiron flew on his thoughts drowning out the dialogue between the golem and the goblin rescuing che was the immediate thing but promoting the continuation of the species was the longrange thing how wonderful if a feasible way was found to do that draco took the lead in the darkness his head tail and the tips of his wings lighted by fireflies so that the others could readily follow him he brought them to the base of goblin mountain at the east fringe of the element of earth they landed safely in nearby forest avoiding the treacherous swamp where the loan sharks turked it was about midnight then fireflies brought a report prince dolph princess nada and electra were camped nearby they were coming in for a rendezvous soon cheiron and chex saw the huge sphinx loom out of the darkness the girls dismounted and dolph resumed human form there were satisfied greetings all around now at last they were able to get the full story there had indeed been a deal and it had been necessary to save che the surprise was the part the elf had played her magic talent was singing in such a way that anyone within hearing range but who was not paying attention got caught up in a communal daydream in the mind of the elf and lost interest in other things until that dream was interrupted or someone jogged he listeners attention back to reality it was a bit wee the hypnogourd only more pleasant and less compulsive and difficult to get into deliberately so the elf had made the goblins pause long enough to enable the captives to escape that was two favors the elf had done for che but where is that elf chex asked she went with che electra explained she said he was her friend and she wanted to stay with him so she went with sammy who her cat he oh yes chex said he finds things he sure does prince dolph said he found their party for me so i could carry them away before the horde got them again otherwise it could have taken me too long because that complaint metria was bugging me that what cheiron asked carp fuss gripe oh you mean bi wolfmate chex said knocking his fore hoof with one of her own he realized that dolph was still below the age of consent so was not supposed to know the proper term whatever dolph said evidently disgruntled i couldnt be sure when she was telling the truth agreed cheiron said metria came to tell me about your deal with the goblins of the mountain but i had a way to verify her accuracy he turned to chex i mink we owe even more to that elf than we thought she helped che in three ways counting the activity of her cat and chose to remain with him hi captivity that is one more way we shall have to rescue her too of course chex said and that cat so they will become part of the package he said the ultimatum will cover the three of them that decided they settled down to sleep for the remainder of the night in the morning as the creatures of the posse saw about foraging for food cheiron advanced with grundy and gloha to the main entry of goblin mountain send someone out here he called go soak your tail in sludge manrear a goblin guard yelled brandishing his spear gloha flew down to face the guard what was that she inquired sweetly few things could put a goblins loud mouth out of gear but the sudden sight of a beautiful winged gobliness turned out to be one of them get the chief he muttered to a lesser guard satisfied gloha flew back to cheiron it was evident that manrear simply did not fit her description in due course a fat middleaged goblin waddled out what the dung do you want crossbreed i am cheiron centaur who are you i am gouty goblin chief of goblin mountain now speak your piece furnose you have captives gouty what if i do charnel thats cheiron pouty grundy called what business is this of yours stringface the chief demanded im a friend to one of your captives bulgefoot and were here to roast you in spit if you dont give him back evidently deciding that it was a losing game to trade insults with the golem the chief addressed cheiron why dont you just state your business centaur cheiron was glad to oblige you have until noon to release your captives che centaur jenny elf and sammy cat if you do not i shall demolish your mountain and destroy your tribe yeah gouty demanded you and who else hoofhead cheiron raised his right hand immediately several winged monsters showed themselves eager to get to work they looked very close big and fierce ill think about it gouty turned around and waddled back up the path it was evident that his swollen legs were not good for walking i dont think you should have given him until noon grundy said as cheiron turned away it will just give him more time to work up mischief i want the monsters to be at full strength cheiron said they flew a long way here and rested and now they need to eat plenty noon is the earliest we can mount a truly effective attack oh that makes sense but suppose they summon allies then well do the same cheiron said im hoping that once gouty thinks about it he will realize that there is no profit in holding out and will deliver up the captives without a struggle this is after all our objective they waited gathering their strength the rocs carried in boulders to drop on the mountain the griffins sharpened their talons and the dragons ate prodigiously their bodies converting the food to internal fuel for their fire smoke and steam they were all hoping that the goblins would try to tough tt out noon came and the captives were not delivered instead the tunnel openings were abruptly closed by rocks and doors from within the goblins had chosen to tough it out cheirons heart sank how he had hoped it would not come to this it was not that his posse lacked the ability to demolish the mountain it was that this enormously increased the risk to the captives probably the goblin chief thought that the winged monsters would not dare to press their attack too hard because of that risk well there was no help for it now they would have to proceed to the first stage of the siege of goblin mountain the weird aspect of this was that he still did not know why the goblins had chosen to abduct his foal and what resources they thought they could call on to make it stick for they had to have known that it would come to this that unknown rendered cheirons confidence into chaos chapter jennys jam jenny followed che down into goblin mountain carrying sammy she had done what she felt she had to but there was no doubt it frightened her she was a creature of the woodland and of the holt she hated the forbidding depths of caves this was like a giant anthill with passages branching out everywhere all leading farther down at every intersection was another goblin guard glowering with his spear as if hed like nothing better than to poke a hole in someone to see how much he hurt before his blood welled out she felt as if she couldnt breathe but how could she have let poor che go in here alone she had known the foal only less than two days but already she understood that he hated captivity and would be horribly tormented if there were not someone to shield him from it so she had to remain with him so she could sing to him and make him feel better when his eyes started getting wild there just wasnt any other way the goblins carried guttering torches whose grudging flames seemed to issue more smoke than light the smoke bumbled up along the ceiling searching blindly for some way out jenny knew how it felt at last when it seemed they couldnt go any deeper they were rudely shoved into an empty chamber the door was slammed behind them they were alone at least they had light a goblin had jammed a torch into a notch in the wall otherwise it would have been pitch black for not only was it night there were no windows this was an ant nest where sight wasnt all that important to the denizens jenny wanted to collapse into a huddle of fear but she didnt dare do that because of che so she pretended to be unconcerned well at least we have a room to ourselves she said brightly she set sammy down and he promptly settled by die wall and went into an orange snooze if he was bothered by any recent developments he did not deign to show it lets see whats in it she walked around the room though she expected to find nothing she was surprised there was an alcove with shiny stone that served as a mirror and there was a crock full of clear water a basin and a sponge why this is a washing chamber she exclaimed we can get cleaned up and look nice she did not bring up the subject of the seeming pointlessness of washing in an awful covered pit like tills she poured some water into the basin and dipped the sponge into it would you like to be first che she asked i can sponge you off if you like your hide is pretty dirty yes thank you he said evidently distracted by her positive attitude it was hard to believe that anything was really wrong when a person was doing something as routine as cleaning up she sponged him off and indeed his hide was dirty through no fault of his own their trek through the jungle and that night in the horde village had coated them with layers of grime she had to rinse out the sponge repeatedly and the water in the basin turned brown then black before she was done in fact she had to empty it into the drain trench and fill it again with clean water from the crock after she had him pretty well clean she used the remaining water to sponge herself her clothing was a total loss so she got out of it and dumped it into the basin she couldnt get it all the way clean but it would be better than before she hung it up on snags on the wall hoping it would dry before she had to put it on again there was a sound at the door someone was unbarring it jenny having noted that the human and similar folk always were clothed was alarmed she didnt want to dive into her wet clothing but if she didnt she would be exposed so she hurried to stand behind che so that whoever came in would not see the central part of her body the door squeaked open a woman stood there outlined by the glow of the torch behind her she was lovely her slender body garbed in a perfect dress her face shrouded by the darkness she stepped inside and the door closed there was the sound of the plank falling into place the visitor was locked in with them was she another prisoner surely she was a princess for her raiment was elegant hello che the woman said hello jenny it was godiva i didnt recognize you jenny exclaimed are you prisoner too godiva laughed no dear i had them lock me in with you so we could be assured of absolute privacy i know you wish to rest but there is something i must explain to you which i could not before and a commitment i must have from you we honored the betrothees deal with you and came here che said i believe that expiates our obligation yes it does che she agreed indeed jenny had no obligation to me and she is here by her own choice now we must forge a new deal i honored the deal only because it was made by others on my behalf che said i am under no obligation to make a new one nevertheless one must be made the gobliness said grimly now that jenny is here she must become party to it she glanced across ches back to jenny but we must get you some clothing just one moment she went to the door and rapped on it with a knuckle bring one of gwendolyns outfits she called yes lady a goblin answered godiva returned to che i am prepared to offer commitments of my own in return for yours first a comfortable mode of life including the best food clothing and entertainment along with security in return for your commitment never to tell another person what i am about to tell you now jenny was astonished if you want to keep a secret dont tell us at all she said i dont think were your friends but she regretted that because godiva had impressed her during their journey here but i think we have seen enough of one another to know that we can trust one another godiva said if we give our words therefore we can deal this is true che said but i see no reason to give our words because if you dont i can not tell you why i abducted you godiva said evenly the entire mission will become pointless and that will profit none of us then perhaps you should let us go the centaur said i am not prepared to do that and i think that you will understand once i tell you why you are here i do not care to understand che said his little jaw setting godiva sighed centaur stubbornness is legendary but you do not need to agree to fulfill the role have in mind for you only to agree to listenand not to tell others this is not unreasonable you abducted me che said showing that stubbornness she had described you have no right to ask anything of me only to return me to my dam godiva considered suppose i tell jenny elf and then she can tell you whether to make the deal now wait jenny protested but che considered it jenny was not abducted by you she came here by her choice she may deal with you if she chooses then come with me jenny godiva said but i came here to be with che jenny said i dont want to leave him i promise to return you to him the moment our dialogue is done godiva said he will not cooperate with me until he hears what i have to say and until you return so i have no motive to keep you from him only to protect the privacy of my statement that seemed to make sense ill do it jenny said but i cant promise to tell che to do anything godiva rapped on the door again pass in that outfit she called the door was unbarred a goblin hand poked in holding a dress godiva took it then took a pair of slippers and other material the door closed again now che godiva said firmly face the door and close your eyes why because we are about to dress jenny elf and this is a process no male is allowed to witness but including panties that did it he knew about panties he faced the door and clamped his eyes absolutely shut godiva approached jenny and held out the panties they were pretty and pink much nicer than seemed likely for a goblin stronghold jenny put them on then another item of apparel that it seemed was even less mentionable about halfway between the panties and her head then the dress which was also pink and fit her almost perfectly and was quite the nicest one she had encountered finally the slippers which were made of stretchy stuff that expanded to fit her feet without pinching she looked at herself in the stone mirror and was amazed except for her tangly hair she looked almost like a princess wherehow did you get she started as she took the brush godiva presented her and worked on her hair it would never come within even the thought of a suggestion of anything like godivas own glorious hair but she might as well get it as unmessy as she could her hair had fallen to her waist before this adventure started but it had gotten so tangled that it might as well have been cut off the outfit belongs to my daughter gwendolyn godiva explained she is about your size evidently so and that explained the quality of this apparel because gwendolyn was a princess or the goblin equivalent the outfit had enabled jenny to be transformed much as godiva herself had been by her change of clothing jenny had thought that godiva always wore mainly swirling hair but apparently that was only outside the mountain now you may look godiva told che the foal opened his eyes turned and looked at jenny you are beautiful he remarked jenny blushed hard enough to obscure her freckles i am not she protested che turned away you should not have said that godiva murmured a centaur speaks only the literal truth you have hurt his feelings jenny was appalled oh che im sorry she cried dropping the brush i didnt mean toi misunderstood please forgive me of course he said brightening i should have realized i apologize she decided not to argue with that she just hugged him then she turned to godiva i am ready to go with you she glanced down at sammy who had not moved since entering the chamber sammy will keep you company che while i am gone he wont move or speak but he can understand you and if you lose something he can find it i think i have lost my confidence che said with a weak smile godiva rapped on the door again and it was unbarred it opened and they stepped out into the hall the goblins barred it again behind them godiva led the way along the passage soon she came to another chamber she opened the door and ushered jenny in this chamber was quite different from the last it had rugs on the floor and carpets on the walls and a painting of the sky on the ceiling it had softlooking chairs it was the kind of chamber that could make a person forget all her problems this will be yours to share with che if you wish godiva said if you get him to consider my proposal jenny had heard the demoness metria struggle to find a word she felt like that now there was surely a word that covered this situation but she didnt know it the gobliness was offering her something nice to do what she probably should not do but she had agreed to listen i will listen and not tell anyone else except che if i decide to she said that is all i promise that is enough i want che to be companion and steed for my daughter gwendolyn i knew he is not yet of age to be a steed for his bones are not yet grown but he can be her companion until they both are of age that will be some years how old are you jenny elf jenny saw no reason not to answer she showed three hands of four fingers each twelve by our reckoning that is gwendolyns age it is perhaps a fortunate coincidence that you match her so closely she is a child like you but will not remain so much longer she is my only offspring and the first heir to the chiefship it has not before passed to a woman but this time it shall for gwendolyn will have the magic wand jenny appreciated the difference that made she had seen that wand in action but why should she need a steed when she has that she is lame this is the first aspect of her situation but with a steed that need never be a problem i need her to have that steed by the time gouty passes which i fear will be sooner than might ordinarily be the case his illness is progressive and when he can no longer walk he will be deposed this i can not prevent it was evident that goblin politics were as fierce as their natures they required a fit and active leader jenny had seen what happened to her own folk when they became incapacitated they usually chose not to remain as burdens on the holt but this is perhaps the lesser of gwendolyns problems godiva continued she is also virtually blind jenny jumped you mean nearsighted like me these spectacles have made me see so much better maybe if you get her a pair we may not do that her deficiency must not be accommodated in this manner if others of the mountain discovered that her vision is impaired they would make her life a short one so she must conceal her liability she can see only general shapes but not well enough to recognize faces or the detail of tapestries i have kept her isolated so that the others are not aware of this but it will be far more difficult as she matures and is required to take greater part in the activities of the tribe the centaur can serve as her eyes too advising her of those things she needs to perceive but surely other goblins will help her jenny said beginning to feel for the goblin girl to be lame and nearly sightlesswhat an awful thing for a princess godiva frowned i see you do not understand the way of goblins she said well im not from here jenny admitted you call me an elf but where i come from im just a girl ive never been to xanth before and its strange seeing cookies growing on plants and having cherries explode so i guess i dont know much about anything here but you did see how it was in the golden horde jenny shuddered they are mean folk goblins generally are mean folk godiva said this dates from a long time ago when a curse was put on us so that the women preferred the worst of men this resulted in a degenerating species at least with respect to the male persuasion that curse was finally eliminated so that now we can choose good men but there is great inertia great what things are slow to change this is because there are so few good men of our kind that we are constrained to pick the marginally less bad it will be a long and frustrating climb back to decency and i suspect that some tribes will not make it like the horde jenny said understanding yes the goblins of the mountain are not that bad but remain bad enough my husband gouty does have certain qualities of leadership though he does his best to conceal them but he has done this tribe one signal favor though he does not see it that way he sired as his legitimate heir no male jennys brow furrowed you do not choose your chiefs according to who is best we do not the son of the chief will be the next chief that is one reason i married gouty he was the son of a chief my mother goldy married a lesser chief one high in the hierarchy but not the leader she was beautiful but it was the magic wand that gave her extra appeal because it enhanced the power of her husband she passed it on to me so that i could nab a full chief thus my son would have been the next chief only gouty dissipated his waning energy with mistresses and lost his ability to summon the stork before providing me with a son so gwendolyn is heir to the chiefship and has the chance to improve things greatly in this tribe because of course the goblin women have always been everything the goblin men are not intelligent attractive and decent jenny had seen the difference between godiva and the goblin males she had no argument so thats good then i see you still do not appreciate the difficulties perhaps there is no concept of infidelity among your people do you know what a mistress is a person who is in charge of something or very good in her work jenny said promptly godiva nodded sadly i do not like doing this but i must encroach on the tenets of the adult conspiracy in order to make something clear to you it is forbidden to tell a child how to summon the stork along with certain related matters this is why che centaur who is a male child is forbidden to see your panties but what do panties have to do with storks jenny asked bewildered i may not answer that just accept the fact that no male of any age may see any womans panties with the single dubious exception of his wifes this is not merely goblin protocol it is xanth protocol as for the storks they bring babies and no child is permitted to know the mechanism by which the stork is signaled for this purpose but this seems like nonsense to me jenny protested where i come from there are no you are not where you came from godiva reminded her jenny nodded realizing that there were whole hosts of ways in which she was ignorant of the ways of this land so i will merely advise you that a mistress in the sense i am addressing is a woman who consents to signal the stork with a man who is not her husband godiva frowned and jenny could see that this was no pleasant matter for her my husband indulged himself with several of these women and the stork being blind to propriety brought sons to two of them these are known as illegitimate offspring and their place in our society is secondary but in the absence of a legitimate heir to the chiefship the older boy would become eligible jenny began to get a glimmer you mean if gwendolyn wasnt if gwendolyn did not qualify she would be dispatched and the boy would assume the chiefship after gouty dispatched the tribe will need a chief if the leading candidate is not qualified she must be eliminated so that a better candidate can be considered eliminated jenny was still missing something killed jenny gazed at the woman in horror the way of goblins was abruptly coming clear and if she cant see well godiva nodded grimly a lame chief might be tolerated after all gouty does not walk well but a blind one would be out of the question unless she compensated so well that it made no difference spectacles could compensate but that would not be allowed and a centaur companion would compensate jenny said seeing it but why a winged one that was coincidental most centaurs are in centaur isle and there is no hope of getting one from there they hardly deign to associate with nonisle centaurs or with human beings and have no truck at all with goblins most remaining centaurs live in villages and guard their premises diligently che was alone he was the only one we could reach who was young enough to be trained the fact that when he matures he will be able to fly is a bonus gwendolyn could achieve real success among goblins with such a steed that can certainly be presented as a rationale for his presence but the real reason is to compensate for gwendolyns sight with such a creature at her side no matter how young she can participate actively in goblin affairs and demonstrate her competence that will not only enable her to become chief it will save her life jenny now saw why godiva had made such a great effort to abduct the foal her daughters life and fate were at stake still she wanted to be quite sure she understood because she would have to tell che about this and her own judgment had to be sure if one of those other goblins becomes chief will it make the tribe more likelike like the goblinate of the golden horde indeed you will have a chance to meet that other prospect for the chiefship in due course but if a woman assumes charge there will be much improvement this would be true for any woman but gwendolyn is the only one who has the chance because she is the chiefs daughter there will be considerable resistance to that because there has never before been a female chief but with the centaur and the wand i believe she can succeed whywhy cant you become chief i am not the daughter of the chief only of a subchief i am the wife of the chief but when he dies i will be only a widow which is no qualification only gwendolyn can do it jenny had seen enough already to be satisfied that what godiva had in mind was best for her tribe and probably best for all the creatures in the vicinity of the tribe i will tell che she said thank you remember he must agree as you have not to reveal gwendolyns liabilities i will move both of you to this suite when he agrees to listen his decision will be a separate matter such a thing is not lightly undertaken by a centaur and we must have his word when he gives it he will be completely free for there is no binding as firm as a centaurs word um could icould i see gwendolyn jenny asked i will tell che but it would be better if i could tell him how gwendolyn is if he asks i mean if he has to decide whether to be with her of course godiva got up and walked to a door in the wall not the one through which they had entered she opened it and ushered jenny through beyond was another chamber decorated with girlish things there were pictures of trees and flowers and animals and clouds there were cushions there was a feather bed and on it lay a beautiful goblin child asleep her dark hair spread out against the pillow and around to form a kind of coverlet it was obvious she was godivas daughter gwenny godiva said gently jenny felt a start for that version of the name was so similar to her own but of course it was the nickname for gwendolyn just as hers was for jennifer the eyelids flickered gwenny woke and looked up hello mother she murmured this is jenny elf who may become your companion godiva said gwenny sat up blinking hello jenny elf i did not see you she extended her hand in the general direction of jenny jenny took it and squeezed it for just a moment i just wanted to say hello she said i did not mean to disturb your sleep thats all right it wasnt much of a sleep jenny found herself liking gwenny goblin that was dangerous because she had to be objective maybe ill see you in the morning she said backing away id like that gwenny agreed she lay down again and closed her eyes jenny went out the door and then godiva took her back to the bare chamber where che remained i will talk to him she said i will wait a moment outside godiva said if he agrees to listen knock and i will convey you both to the other suite jenny entered che smiled as he saw her sammy found my confidence he exclaimed i feel much better now how did he do that jenny asked amazed she had not realized that such a thing could be found in that way i asked him and he came and rubbed against my leg and purred and my confidence was back he must have brought it oh sammy had done that for jenny in the past she just hadnt seen it quite that way che i have talked to godiva sheplease i think you should listen to her you dont have to make her deal just agree not to tell he looked at her if you tell me i will listen i will tell you but first we must go to a more comfortable chamber she knocked on the door it opened jenny led che out and sammy came along knowing that something was up without words they filed into the suite food will be delivered if you ask godiva said as she closed the door behind them i will come when you ask for me perhaps in the morning thank you jenny said sammy promptly found a suitable cushion and settled down for the rest of his orange snooze che stood for a moment and looked around plainly awed i did not realize that goblins had such accommodations they do for princesses or whatever jenny said she saw that he was tired so she decided to abbreviate the discussion let me tell you the essence now and in the morning ill tell you as much else as i know if you want i appreciate that remember you must not tell anyone else regardless what you decide about the deal she offers of course i did not want to be compromised by something extraneous but since you have ascertained that it is not i accept the terms she wants you to be the companion for her daughter gwenny who will be the next chief if you help her and will die if you dontbecause shes lame and mostly blind a female chief would try to make this a better tribe che had evidently been braced for something of significance but this surprised him but females arent goblin chiefs he protested this one can be with your help he pondered what kind of person is this goblin girl i saw her only briefly shes sleeping in the next chamber she seemed nice but of course i dont really know her perhaps i can see her oh i dont think the door would be unlocked jenny said trying it it opened she stared at it dumbfounded how could godiva be so trusting they entered there by the dim light of the torch lay gwenny goblin lovely in her sleep she is very like you che said oh no shes but jenny caught herself she is my age and size but of course her ears are round and she has five fingers these hardly matter he retreated his hooves landing very lightly so as not to wake the girl they returned to their own chamber and closed the door this alters the complexion he said i must consider then he settled down on the carpeted floor leaned against the carpeted wall and went to sleep jenny gathered cushions and formed a bed beside him she lay on it and the light of morning woke her she had not even been aware of falling asleep she had been so tired but now felt much refreshed she blinked and stretched and one hand encountered something furry and warm oh yes that was che centaur he she blinked again morning how could that be way down here in the anthill she sat up and saw that the light was coming from an alcove it seemed to be a well with the chamber at the bottom so that the light could come down she saw that its sides were shiny so that the light reflected how nice she had not noticed it at all in the night but of course then it had been dark and would have looked like just a blank niche by daylight the room was brighter and nicer than it had seemed by torchlight and it had seemed nice enough then this was evidently gwennys playroom that they were sharing gwenny was she still there jenny walked to the door between chambers but hesitated it wasnt her place to disturb the chiefs daughter after all besides which she had something to do she explored the chamber and found a curtained compartment with a shiny stone surface a basin a crock of water a sponge two brushes and a pot with a lid she picked up the pot and sniffed it then wrinkled her nose in disgust that was what she was looking for all right she used the pot then put the lid back on then she used the water and basin and sponge to clean herself again getting rid of the faint lines of grime that had escaped her before she brushed her hair working out the tangles that had sneaked back in overnight not only did she feel better she now felt quite good she stepped out of the curtained alcove sammy was up and pacing the floor oh she went to the outer door and knocked in a moment the bar lifted and it opened a goblin face peeked in oh moron jenny said recognizing him at first all goblins had looked alike to her but that was passing can you get us a box of dirt he seemed surprised not cookies she laughed not to eat silly for sammy then she reconsidered but bring some cookies too or whatever is good for breakfast for two she rereconsidered for three and a dead rat if you have one for she realized that sammy might not have much luck hunting down here actually she wasnt sure what sammy ate because she never saw the results of his hunting moron smiled he turned to the goblin behind him three piles of cookies a dead rat and a box of dirt they are hungry jenny bit her lip it seemed that goblin males were not entirely sour she turned back into the room che was awake now and getting to his feet he looked around theres a curtained place she said anticipating his need she hoped he knew how to use the potty himself it seemed he did but meanwhile there was a sound from the next chamber jenny went to the door and it opened as she reached it gwenny goblin stood there blinking in the way jenny had she was just jennys height hello she said uncertainly hello gwenny jenny said i am jenny elf we met last night oh i thought i had dreamed it gwenny said i was just going to the its being used right now gwenny tried to look across the room but it seemed that her vision did not reach that far theres another girl no che centaur heyour mother brought us here last night she did why she would like che to be your companion she would why you mean you dont know gwenny shook her head i dont know anything much i get lonely sometimes surely she did jenny had thought that che was coming here to be a prisoner but she realized that gwenny always had been a prisoner godiva didnt want anyone to know of her infirmities so she would have had little company how awful che came out hello gwenny he said politely gwenny peered intently in his direction are you really a centaur she asked seeming doubtful yes albeit a small one didnt your mother no jenny said quickly then to gwenny its empty now let me walk across with you oh i can find it gwenny said i know where everything is here if it isnt moved she walked across the room confidently enough but she limped for one leg seemed not to function perfectly it looked all right in fact it was a well proportioned leg but it seemed not to bend the way it should then jenny saw sammy who was lying in his bumpontheground mode in the middle of the room wait she cried diving for the cat gwenny stopped is something there sammy my cat he doesnt realize you cant see him she picked sammy up gwenny peered at sammy now at close range oh orange she exclaimed how pretty jenny could tell that these two would get along sammy she cant see you well from a distance she told him so you will have to find a place where she wont step she set him down she hoped that would work he could find anything but she hadnt tried this before there was a sound from the outer door oh that will be breakfast jenny said she was feeling quite organized now she crossed to it moron was there with the box of dirt and a yellowish chunk of cheese in the form of a rat evidently they had found rat cheese instead of a rat maybe that would do oh thank you moron jenny exclaimed taking the box she carried it to a corner near the curtained alcove and set it down there you are sammy you know what its for the rats yours too she hoped he would like the cheese she really preferred it to a real rat sammy headed for the box meanwhile jenny returned to the door where moron had three piles of cookies they were big cookies and tall piles they filled jennys arms she brought them into the center of the room then wondered where to set them down i believe i saw a table in the other room che said oh good jenny lumbered through the door and dumped the cookies on the table gwenny emerged from the curtains and walked toward the sound smell cookies she said yes i got them for us jenny said is it all right do you like cookies oh yes but mother never gave them to me for breakfast oh what does she give you gwenny scowled pease porridge hot oh is that good no its awful but its supposed to be good for me the adult conspiracy jenny exclaimed laughing did you ever doubt che inquired innocently maybe moron didnt realize jenny said oh you asked moron gwenny said hes not bright why who do you ask jenny asked mother usually brings it in that explains it shes smart i think i wasnt smart not to do what you did i just didnt know any better you see jenny is from another land che said she does not know local customs oh that must be fun gwenny exclaimed ive never been out of the mountain jenny considered and decided not to argue the case she missed her holt but it would be awful to be confined to it all the time so she ate her cookies which were very good and the others ate theirs she hoped sammy liked his cheese but didnt care to call attention to it lest he change his mind what is it like in your land gwenny asked where should she begin its a little like xanth but there arent goblins or dragons and most folk dont have magic talents all the folk i know are like me i mean with pointed ears and fourfingered hands except for the human beings you have pointed ears gwenny asked peering at her closely why so you do i didnt realize and you say your handsare you sure jenny held up a hand gwenny held up her own they touched sure enough they were of similar size but the goblin girl had one extra finger unlike the xanth elves che said i think jenny is unique in xanth unique gwenny asked i mean that there is none other like her here gwenny clapped her hands isnt that nice jenny was getting thirsty i should have asked for something to drink mother brings plain old wholesome milk pods gwenny said wrinkling her nose i wonder if jenny started it seems reasonable che continued lets try it gwenny concluded they got up and hurried to the outer door sammy was sleeping halfway there but he was in jennys path not gwennys evidently he had known where to find the spot where gwenny wasnt going jenny jumped over him as she was used to doing he must have liked his cheese because he hadnt protested that was a relief jenny knocked on the door in a moment it opened and morons face appeared some tsoda popka water please she said any flavor so long as its good he nodded soon it arrived purple fizz flavored in three bottles jenny took it and thanked him jenny about to sip hers paused have you ever she asked putting her thumb over the top of the bottle electra had told her about this and she was curious according to electra tsoda pop got angry when confined and shaken and swelled up in protest covered the bottle gwenny asked peering at her hand no why i am not certain this is proper che said but youre only five years old jenny reminded him you shouldnt know any better true what are you talking about gwenny asked perplexed this che said giving his bottle a shake the popka frothed up and squirted gwenny in the face oh she exclaimed astonished how did you do that like this jenny said touching gwenys hand and guiding her thumb to the top shake gwenny shook hard the popka swelled up furiously and blasted out spraying everything in a moment they were all doing it firing away until the bottles were only half full and too tired to froth any more then they drank what remained it tasted awful yet good because of the fun they had had they were all soaking their dresses and fur ruined what has happened here all three jumped it was godiva i fear we have misbehaved che said contritely godiva frowned but as her eyes focused on gwenny who was trying to be properly chastened but not succeeding very well they softened jenny realized that gwenny probably had not had many good times before well you will have to clean up and change your clothing you reek of tsoda her gaze focused on jenny have you spoken with che yes jenny said the eyes focused on che and have you come to a decision no che said without a word godiva departed what did she mean gwenny asked i guess wed better get cleaned up jenny said and i guess id better tell you come on ill sponge you off and you can sponge me off and well talk but who will sponge me off che asked disappointed we both will jenny said excellent they had to send out for more water and while they were at it they sent out the brimming potty for emptying soon they were cleaning up while che dutifully faced the door and closed his eyes your mother says you can be chief one day jenny explained to gwenny but not if anyone finds out that you cant see very well thats true they would dump me out as dragon bait and gobble would become chief gobble gobble goblin the eldest halfson of my father is he nice gwenny grimaced on her it looked cute hes the brattiest tenyearold brat who ever existed well your mother thought that if she got you a centaur to ride you could get around better and he could watch out for things and tell you about them so that no one would know you couldnt see them yourself then you could be chief why i never thought of that gwenny exclaimed maybe its true centaurs are very smart so she brought che but it wont work unless he agrees but i thought you said hes only five years old yes but by the time the time comes you might be adult and so would he so you could ride him gwenny considered when the two of them were clean and in nice new dresses and it was time to do the centaur foal she asked how did she bring you here che she abducted me i was afraid of that its the goblin way so you didnt want to come here that is correct gwenny shook her head im sorry about this che i didnt know of course you shouldnt stay here i will tell mother to let you go but what will become of you gwenny he asked she shrugged well its not much of a life anyway jenny felt her heart sink the goblin girl would survive only as long as her secret was kept and she would never be able to go out among the goblins that meant that eventually her condition would be discovered and then it would be over that probably wouldnt be good for the tribe either if a bratty brat took it over i have not decided che said but it isnt right to keep you away from your dam i dont want to hurt you i she paused whats this one of my wings che said you have wings i am a flying centaur i can not fly yet but in time i will i didnt know i never heard of a flying centaur i believe there were none in xanth before my sire and dam appeared he said at least not currently we are trying to become a new species that makes it even worse you cant be a new species if youre captive untrue were i to agree to be your companion in this fashion i would no longer be held captive and could go where i wished as long as you were with me and agreed to go gwenny nodded because a centaur never breaks an agreement still it isnt right i am not certain che said in fact i am unable to come to a decision so i shall delegate it to another who jenny elf jenny jumped no i cant decide for you che not on something that affects your whole life like that i think you shall have to for i can not and a decision needs to be made and his little jaw set in that way she recognized all right che ill decide she said but not right now ill have to think about it a lot but while youre thinking gwenny said wistfully can we be friends yes of course jenny said touched in fact while im thinking i will try to help you see things so you can go out among the goblins oh thank you gwenny cried jumping in joy ive always wanted to go out but except when my mother took me i couldnt jenny nodded understanding exactly how it was she had no idea how she was going to decide but at least this meant she didnt have to rush it occurred to her that this was like prince dolphs dilemma in which he had to choose between betrothees and one would die if he chose wrong gwenny would die if jenny chose wrong she played with that notion intrigued by it of course it really wasnt the same because the three of them were younger and were of three different species but tne parallels were sharp enough one male two females both of them older than he he had to choose one to be with and couldnt fhey all hked each other the difference was that this wasnt marriage but a different kind of association and that che would not choose jenny had to choose for him and she had no interest in the outcome no that wasnt true now that she worked it out she saw that she was in a real picklement of a jam she had to make a decision that would affect the life of one friend and the freedom of the other and it did affect her because she had come here into goblin mountain because she knew that che needed her being too young to survive the horror of isolation from his kind without the support of a friend but now he could have a friend gwenny goblin needed him and would be his friend and she was not only a nice girl she was a princess or at least a chiefess so jenny wasnt needed she was sort of the odd one out like electra if dolph married the princess nada she was no princess either in nature or role just a girl who had been wrenched out of her former life to come to this strange one how she wished she could return to her holt in the world of two moons and to her family who surely missed her and wondered what had happened to her but the hole through which she had come was plugged and she didnt know the way anyway and sammy could not find it because home was the one thing he could not find why are you so sad gwenny asked should she answer her situation really did not relate to the problem she is far removed from her home and folk che answered for her just as i am it is not an easy situation i wish you could both go home gwenny said and that i could go with you but you are to be a chief jenny protested id rather have friends jenny saw that the goblin girl needed a friend as much as che did che had many friends back at his home and so did jenny at hers their only problem was that they werent home gwenny was home but without friends her situation was just as bad as theirs lets go exploring jenny said changing the subject because there really wasnt anything she could do with the subject i can tell you what i see and you can tell me what or who it is i am not sure that is wise che said others will hear you talking and will realize that gwenny is not perceiving things directly jenny hadnt thought of that maybe i could whisper but she saw that it was still a problem or if we could work out some code the others wouldnt know only i dont think i could remember anything very complicated i could che said that is evidently part of the reason godiva chose a centaur it would be relatively simple to devise a mechanism amounting to a veritable language of signals known only to us they should be auditory or tactile rather than visual since gwenny can not see well at a distance i think tactile would be best were she riding a centaur simple flicks of the tail or twitches of the skin could signal affirmative or negative and more sophisticated combinations for other communications gwenny considered i think thats too complicated for me right now i do want to go out but i think id feel better waiting until im sure i can handle it if gobble ever caught on to my infirmities i would be doomed and hes so sneaky that i fear he would perhaps we could remain here and play with magic che suggested do you have a magic talent gwenny no that is not by myself goblins only have half talents and harpies have the other halves so its not easy for us to do magic i will have the magic wand of course but not yet she peered in his direction but you do i thought centaurs didnt it was thought that centaurs didnt he said but it turned out that we do my talent is making things light by flicking them with my tail that is why i must be careful what i flick i can turn it off when i choose but if i forget it can be awkward oh that seems like fun gwenny exclaimed can you make me light certainly but what is the point the point is i think it would be fun she said mother sometimes lofts me with the wand but if i had another way to float id like that very well stand in the middle of the chamber gwenny went to the middle they had long since finished brushing che off he stood beside her and flicked her on the shoulder with the tip of his tail oh it works she exclaimed i can jump so high she bent her good leg to jump dont do that jenny cried grabbing for her she was almost too late gwenny was in the process of jumping jenny grabbed her arm as she rose it was well that she did so for otherwise the goblin girl would have launched herself headfirst into the stone ceiling as it was her body rose and was stopped only by jennys hold on the arm she spun around squealing and kicking her feet before jenny managed to wrestle her back to the floor oh that was fun gwenny exclaimed fun jenny said severely you almost banged your head but im so light it wouldnt hurt not so che said your inertia remains intact my what slow to change jenny said remembering what godiva had said my slow to change remains intact gwenny asked confused not precisely che said inertia can be used in either the social or the physical sense i mean that your body has the same mass as ever but feels light so you can jump higher but if your head hit the ceiling it would be like landing on the floor head first oh gwenny said i wouldnt like that ill be careful but maybe if you flick me again i could just float that would be fun not in that dress jenny cautioned why not someone might see your panties oh gwenny flushed which was impressive on her dark face jenny had underestimated the seriousness of the warning she had not meant to embarrass the girl like that i thought of another thing to try she said hauling gwenny down another thing try my spectacles jenny removed them from her face and put them carefully on the goblin girls face they looked funny on her but they curved around to fit her head oh gwenny exclaimed i see you so they do work jenny said satisfied except except that i dont dare been seen in them gwenny said taking them off jenny accepted them back she had been just about blind she had gotten used to the spectacles and now felt lost without them maybe we can do something else she said quickly like telling stories oh i love stories gwenny agreed they are the only way i can travel jenny realized that with her own magic talent which she had discovered with che she might help the girl travel in a very special manner but right now she thought that a regular story was enough lets settle down and ill tell a tale she said then you can tell one and che can oh how nice gwenny cast about finding scattered cushions with her feet and picking them up to form into a pile she covered quite a bit of territory but somehow never encountered sammy who was sleeping in the very spot that she didnt go she piled them up in a corner and they plumped down on them che lying on one side jenny on the other and gwenny in the center what tale should she tell jenny had heard a number of nice tales of the history of her folk such as the ones about the former chiefs and their friends but she wasnt sure a goblin of xanth would understand these for example there was the one about prey pacer and softfoot who was lame gwenny might think she was being mocked there were the tales of the wolf friends but jenny didnt know whether there were wolves in xanth and she was pretty sure that if there were they did not have riders so that might only confuse the girl so she settled on one that was more like xanth adapting the terms to fit instead of high ones she could have what she wasnt sure what in xanth would fit so she tried something foolish sammy find me what fits she said the cat woke looked around and went to che settling down against the centaurs side so much for that i think that means i should answer your question che said what is it i need to know the xanth equivalent of the high ones che looked perplexed but offered an answer anyway the muses perhaps is there a muse of beauty they arent of that type they are patrons of the arts but perhaps erato the muse of love poetry would do does she get angry with mortal folk i dont think so maybe melpomene muse of tragedy she has a tragic mask a club and a sword maybe shes the one jenny agreed well one day melpomene was annoyed because a woman named willow had a babyi mean the stork brought her a baby girl who was so pretty that everyone knew she would grow up to be as beautiful as any muse she named the baby lily because she was as fair as that flower well see about that melpomene said lily shall not see the flower after which she is named no mortal may look as good as a muse without suffering tragedy willow went out in a field of flowers near the mountain of the muses where a flock of birds flew holding lily oh muses she said and die tears flowed from her eyes you have given me such a beautiful child but why have you made her blind then the muses were sorry but there was nothing they could do for once a thing was done it could not be undone lily grew up to be a fine girl but she never saw a flower or anything else she walked out in the field and touched the flowers including the one for which she was named but this was not good because flowers could not survive well when they were handled she began to cry why are you crying willow asked her oh mother you have taught me right from wrong and to appreciate what i have but how can i appreciate the flowers you speak of so fondly when my touch hurts them the flowers listened and were sad she likes us so much they said to themselves and she is named for one of us we must find a way for her to appreciate us without hurting us they discussed it among themselves and they asked the muses to help them and the muses remembered that they were at fault and agreed they could not make lily see but they could help the flowers change they gave the flowers the power to describe themselves in odor each flower assumed that fragrance it felt best described it some flowers like the roses believed they were extremely beautiful so they adopted scents that were delightful others thought they were ugly like the geraniums so they took unpleasant smells it didnt matter whether they really were beautiful or ugly only how they thought of themselves and some had an unrealistic view of the matter some were bold and had strong smells while others were very shy and had little or no fragrance though a person looking at them might have thought they deserved more thus it was that though some fragrances were not very accurate at least they helped define the flowers and distinguished one from another so it was that lily at last came to appreciate the flowers and could tell the rose from the daisy without touching them and she was happy and the flowers were happy and even melpomene was less tragic ever since then flowers have had different smells so that anyone can know them by either sight or scent there was a silence as jenny finished her story then gwenny spoke oh jenny i wish i could see that i think that must be why flowers have fragrance but if only i could see willow and lily i believe you can che said if jenny will sing for you oh i couldnt jenny said abashed then sing for me he said and gwenny can ignore us jenny understood what he meant and knew that it was right she nerved herself and looked at him for she knew she could sing for him she knew that though he had suggested it for the goblin girl he really wanted it for himself for he was still a foal and a captive deep in the mountain and no matter how educated he seemed he was afraid inside she hummed a little and the room slowly faded out then she sang and there was the field of flowers and the mountain of the muses in the background and willow holding her baby lily the tears on her face her hair spread out around and behind her like a soft cape the way godivas did indeed she looked a lot like the lady godiva caring so much for her daughter but helpless to give her the thing she lacked then the baby turned and jenny knew it was gwendolyn though the name was different here gwenny was in the scene in the background a centaur appeared watching but not interfering che was here too now near him was a sleeping orange cat time passed in an instant as it could in a dream or a vision and the baby grew to look a lot like the goblin girl but she still could not see but the flowers changed for her and assumed their fragrances and the girl came to know them and was thrilled the scene shook suddenly it fell apart and dissipated and they were all back in the chamber but the shaking continued indeed the whole mountain seemed to be rumbling what is that jenny asked alarmed i dont know gwenny said thats never happened before something must be wrong there were sounds in the passage outside wed better ask jenny said they went to the door and knocked after a moment moron opened it whats happening jenny asked the winged monsters are attacking the mountain he replied my sire che exclaimed he has arrived he sure has moron agreed he gave chief gouty until noon to give you and the elf back and when gouty didnt the monsters started the siege rocs are dropping boulders on us you had better stay in there because the tunnels may not be safe he closed the door i forgot about your folks jenny said of course they didnt just forget you what are we going to do you had better tell my mother to let you go gwenny said sadly i shall be sorry to lose your company but im sure your dam cares for you che as much as my mother does for me they should stop the attack when you are out they surely should che agreed but we must not decide on that basis for that is duress we must decide on the basis of what is proper he looked at jenny have you decided yet no jenny said she looked at gwenny if we told your mother no would she let us go she might but im not sure my father would he doesnt know why she brought you herenot the real reason i meanbecause he doesnt know i cant see well he thinks its just for company and he doesnt like anyone telling him what to do so when your sire came che and demanded your release gouty probablywell theres something he does with a finger i dont know what it is but its part of the adult conspiracy jenny said i think its an impolite way of saying no but she suspected it was more than that remembering what had happened on the withacookee river it must be so maybe you cant just leave now im sorry jenny turned to che would your sire stop the siege if you agreed to be gwennys companion i fear he would not che said lean speak for myself but i can not speak for him i believe he would conclude that my agreement was made under duress and was therefore invalid so whichever way it goes the siege is going to continue jenny said the strange thing was that she was almost relieved because it took much of the pressure off her decision she could afford to wait and take her time to make up her mind as long as it didnt make any difference the mountain shook again as another boulder landed some sand sifted down from the ceiling jenny realized that her decision might be the least of their problem they were in the midst of a battle and who could know how it would end lets go back to the cushions and sing she said frightened the others were quick to agree chapter electros empathy after the preliminary bombardment goblin mountain was pocked with dents and several goblin tunnels now were open that had been closed but before he sent in the smokers cheiron chose to negotiate again gloha do you think you can go there without being attacked he asked i think so she said i am a goblin and my aunt goldy is there shes my mothers big sister and though she did not approve of my father i think she has come to accept me electra stepped up godiva is goldys daughter she exclaimed i talked with her and learned that so godiva is your cousin gloha yes she is older than i amin fact she has a daughter almost as old as i am though we were never allowed to play together so maybe they dont accept me after all oh godivas not like that electra protested i mean i knew her only briefly but it was pretty intense because of the horde im sure she has nothing against you glohas eyes flicked toward her wings but she didnt speak everyone knew how crossbreeds were treated in some cultures let me go with you electra said maybe can talk to godiva if lectra thats dangerous nada warned her we were under truce with godiva because none of us wanted che to be hurt but now that truce is over you cant presume on your two days acquaintanceship i have little to fear from danger electra said nada did not reply neither of them had forgotten that if one of them were taken out of the picture this week a problem would be solved next week she had to let electra go gloha looked relieved she was ready to go but evidently preferred company the two of them walked to the mountain carrying white bits of cloth to show they were under truce they knew that the goblins could attack them but hoped they wouldnt they reached the nearest blasted tunnel the stone that had sealed it shut had been dislodged and rolled down the slope there was rubble piled at the entrance but it looked clear farther in hello gloha called we would like to talk go fly through a fire birdbrain a goblin called from he depths electra became annoyed listen dope we came to parlay you know the winged monsters will destroy the whole mountain if this goes on get someone up here to talk like who frecklebrain electra stiffened she did have freckles so did the elf girl that was one of the things electra liked about her as far as she knew there was nothing wrong with this but he goblin made it sound as if it were a crime it was glohas turn to be annoyed like godiva dimwit im not dimwit im scrounge the goblin replied then tell godiva scrounge gloha called tell her yourself is she coming here naw har har har gloha looked at electra they are my own kind but sometimes they get so annoying she said maybe we should go look for godiva electra suggested though the idea of going unguarded into the mountain frightened her maybe so gloha agreed i know my way around here pretty well though theyre always making new tunnels i know where she lives lets do it electra said before she could freak herself out of it she knew that if they did not succeed in negotiating the attack would resume and there might be no turning back ah right ill tell cheiron gloha spread her wings and flew quickly back she flew like a bird not like a bug she moved quickly because otherwise she would have fallen to the ground in a moment she was back he says its better to take the chance if were ready for it knowing the risk electra wished he hadnt phrased it quite that way but she kept her doubt to herself then lets go find godiva they entered the tunnel there was a light in its dim reaches which turned out to be one of the smoky torches the goblins used for light electra lifted it out of its socket so that they could have light where they went the smoke did its best to choke them but soon gave it up as a bad job and wrestled its way along the tunnel ceiling looking for someone else to suffocate hey whatcha doing in here a goblin demanded giving gloha a good look and electra a cursory one were going to tell godiva ourselves scrounge electra said bravely just as you suggested goblins werent capable of looking disgruntled but this one made the effort well see that you do he mumbled stepping back they went on following the tunnel as it wound around and down well have to change passages at the base gloha said but any of these will take us to the base electra was glad gloha knew where she was going electra by herself would have been lost after the first turn what are you up to electra turned startled there was the demoness metria surely looking for more interesting mischief it was probably best to answer her question and hope she lost interest were trying to negotiate to get che and jenny free you know how the goblins got them yes it would have been dull if you had won that game no captivity no siege of the mountain its still pretty dull electra said oh i dont think so you dont have a chance of getting the foal back so cheiron will just have to demolish the mountain thats interesting well well see electra said shortly meanwhile what about your own situation the demoness asked electra didnt want to answer but still hoped that if she played along the demoness would go away what about it dolph will choose and that will be that but everyone knows he will choose nada naga what happens to you then i die electra said you do gloha asked dismayed evidently she had not been aware of that aspect i have to marry the prince who woke me from my discounted thousand year sleep or die electra said i knew that when i got into it since he wont marry me thats it im so sorry gloha said i thought i was not well off with no male of my crossbreed but your case is worse electra really did not want to talk about it but didnt want to let the demoness know that maybe so how will you feel when you see him marry the naga princess metria asked persistently glad for her shes my friend and a wonderful person but she doesnt love him dont you mortals put great store by love yes but she can take a love potion how will you die must we have this conversation gloha demanded distraught electra appreciated her support but knew it would only make the demoness worse i dont know she said answering both of them actually she did know how she would die but did not like to talk about it i can show you wonderful ways to die metria said suffocation stroke rupture of i suspect i shall just expire in a maidenly manner electra said it will be most dull no wait i remember the demoness exclaimed there was a storywhen you went to mundania didnt you age rapidly so probably thats how it will be you will get older all of a sudden and become mature and then a hag and then a bag of bones all in a few minutes electra gritted her teeth fearing that it would be exactly like that she was actually around nine hundred years old only the magic of the enchantment kept her as young as she should be once that enchantment was broken she would revert to her proper age which was about eight hundred and fifty years dead but she refused to give the demoness the satisfaction of seeing her faint with horror no matter what you may be right she said weve got to get dolph to marry you gloha said no electra protested it has to be his choice i could surround you and give you nadas aspect metria said you could marry him and he wouldnt know the difference until it was too late no electra was trying not to cry knowing that the demoness would like that you would rather die and see him marry the one who doesnt love him and isnt right for him rather than do what is necessary metria inquired interested electra really didnt have much of an answer for that but she did the best she could i just want him to be happy how happy will he be with the wrong woman even if she takes a love potion nadas not wrong shes a princess she was betrothed to him before was despite her best intention she was arguing the case and playing into the demoness trap if you marry him and he becomes king you will be queen metria said wont that be right for him only if he chooses it she protested not really absorbing the demonic logic but hes a boy the demoness said derisively what does he know about choosing well he cant see farther than the nagawomans bosom thats not true electra cried he can see to her but she realized that she was only getting deeper into trouble her panties metria finished triumphantly he sets great store by those doesnt he well all men do but it seemed awfully lame and after hes finally seen them what will remain of that marriage for him life with an older woman whos a real reptile that isnt fair and by the time he realizes his mistake and comes to appreciate you the demoness continued inexorably you will be dead you could hardly have a neater revenge than that get out of here you but electra being still most of a week under the magic age of consent did not know the word you intemperate complaint what electra blinked the demoness had faded away and she stood before godiva she was appalled gloha stepped in the demoness was here teasing her cruelly she said she didnt mean you cousin godiva godiva frowned the demoness it figures but what are the two of you doing down here dont you know that the mountain is under siege were here to bargain gloha said we want the violence to stop come in godiva said showing the way into her suite gouty is indisposed so i am handling things for now inside was a very nice apartment with tapestries and cushions and daylight from a shaft leading up there was some rubble and dust in the bottom of the shaft that seemed to be of recent origin but the goblin woman ignored it they sat on cushions i have asked che centaur to be a companion for my daughter gwendolyn godiva said he is considering his response until he makes it we can not end the siege unless the winged monsters withdraw but cheiron will destroy the whole mountain electra protested he will not let his son be captive that is a risk we must take the woman said evenly but i think it will not come to that but i tell you cheiron let me introduce you to someone so that you can report to cheiron godiva said she reached up to pull on a tasseled cord and a gong sounded elsewhere in the mountain you have other captives electra asked one thing about this business it did take her mind off her own problem no in a short time there was a knock enter godiva called rising from her cushion the door opened and a man crawled in no it was a snake no it was electras mouth dropped open in amazement it was a naga prince naldo meet gloha goblin and electra who is prince dolphs betrothee godiva said girls meet prince naldo naga nadas brother electra had never met prince naldo before but she recognized the resemblance to nada now he assumed his human form and made a formal little bow he was almost unbelievably handsome i am glad to meet you at last electra and gloha i have heard much of you having just been talking with your king dor and queen irene at mount etamin both girls found themselves tonguetied this seemed impossible the naga were hereditary enemies to the goblins i shall explain godiva said there are covenants which extend back more than a thousand years to the years when the war between the monsters of the air and the monsters of the ground was fresh anticipating an attack by the monsters of the air we invoked such a covenant and summoned our allies goblins and naga have differences between themselves but these are superseded by the covenant the naga of mount etamin are here to support our effort aghast electra finally got her mouth going and the the ground dragons and and the callicantzari godiva agreed the callicantzari were horrendous underground monsters and the elves that cant be electra exclaimed i mean they come with me godiva led the way out of her suite it is true naldo murmured we can not claim to be delighted by this development but we are required to honor the covenant and must support the goblins against the winged monsters the local elves are similarly bound numbed electra followed the goblin woman to a chamber farther down the tunnel this business had abruptly escalated beyond her worst possible fears what was cheiron going to do when he learned of this godiva opened the door this appeared to be an infirmary with a bed and a goblin nurse there was a patient on the bed small and wan not a goblin not a child but an elf electra exclaimed but his elm must be far away beyond goblin mountain godiva agreed but not far as we think of distance he prefers to recline because his strength is low here but he is in good health then as they stepped close she introduced them this is bud of the tribe of flower elves the elf nodded and these are prince naldo naga gloha goblinharpy and electra betrothed to prince dolph of the human folk they nodded in turn bud elf looked surprised the human folk are allied with you too no electra said quickly they arent in this quarrel really just a few of us who know che centaur personally gloha and are here on behalf of cheiron centaur to see if we can get che and jenny released before the winged monsters destroy the mountain who is jenny he asked jenny elf shes electra paused realizing that this was another oddity shes not from an elm or from xanth she doesnt get weak away from her tree shes twice your size and her ears are pointed but shes definitely an elf think i should like to meet her i will bring her here godiva said she stepped out how can you help the goblins so far from your elm gloha asked bud i mean i am just here to arrange details bud said we shall defend one side of goblin mountain from intrusion by the winged monsters on that side that will relieve the goblins of the fear of a flank attack it certainly would the elves were small but their strength and expertise near their elm was such that no monsters would pass that way i never thought the elves would be in this gloha said unhappily but i suppose elves have to keep their word and a covenant is a word you are on the side of the winged monsters bud asked her isnt there a certain ambiguity in your position no che centaur is a winged monster and i am too to be sure he said indulging in the very most circumspect of male glances at her petite body electra knew that glance it was the kind no one directed at her while they talked prince naldo approached electra my sisterwhere is she now nadas with cheiron electra said we joined with him after delivering che here you delivered the centaur here he asked surprised it was a deal the goblinate of the golden horde was going to cook him so we joined forces with godiva to save him then we had to decide which group got him and she won we dont want him here but we didnt have a choice it was a matter of honor he concluded how well i understand tell me how are matters between the two of you nada and i get along fine we just wish dolph wasnt going to marry her it was another deal he said a political betrothal we had thought the prophecy referred to me and the princess ivy we were in error so nada took the lead electra wondered what would have happened had it been ivy on that quest instead of dolph ivy might well have married naldo he was indeed a prince and a handsome man in his human form but that would have meant that ivy would never have met grey murphyand that dolph would not have met electra well nada means to see it through she doesnt love dolph and i do but its his choice it is an irony my father would direct nada to break the betrothal but it is not his right we have accepted the benefits of the political liaison with castle roogna and can not in honor renege i know just as you cant renege on the covenant with the goblins he grimaced just so we find both situations awkward but our course is clear the flower elves are similarly caught the door openedand there was jenny elf but of course she couldnt be a true elf really because oh im so glad to see you lectra jenny exclaimed running up to give her a hug electra was suddenly aware how much they differed in size jenny was barely half her height che and gwenny and i had a tsoda fizz fight just the way we wanted to at the lake then she became aware of the others and was abashed id better introduce you electra said folks this is jenny from the world of two moons jenny this is gloha and prince naldo who is nadas brother and bud of the flower elves you can fly jenny asked looking first at gloha for answer gloha spread her wings and flew toward the ceiling but there wasnt room to go anywhere and she landed almost immediately you must meet che jenny said he doesnt fly yet but i know gloha said i came here with cheiron then jenny focused her spectacles on bud an elf she asked looking surprised but youre so small indeed he was only half her height bud smiled tolerantly just as the human folk have giants such as the ogres and the goblins have giants such as the callicantzari it becomes evident that we elves also have giants by the look of you you are young others of your kind must be larger yet yes im small maybe theres a mistake because my people never called themselves elves we must be another species that just happens to resemble yours in some ways bud smiled this interests me lets explore it further if you will he glanced at the others if i am not interfering with business my business is introducing you to each other godiva said so that when electra and gloha return to the surface they can made a competent report so that cheiron will believe that you really do have these allies gloha said i suppose mat means that you dont intend to give up che centaur or jenny elf jenny elf may go godiva said she is not captive she glanced at the girl but i expect you to keep your word i will jenny said but im not going until che does she turned back to bud you really think we are just variants of the same species i suspect we are equivalents for our respective lands do you have other creatures on yours you mean like trolls ah you have trolls are they pointeared like you no theyre roundeared and ugly they dont stand much taller than we do but they are way more massive interesting our trolls are tall and thin how many fingers on their hands ours have five unless some have been bitten off jenny smiled briefly four when theyre all there yours do sound similar after all electra listened with growing interest and realized that the others were doing the same are there human beings there bud asked some we really dont have much to do with them neither do we electra is the first i have had contact with in years your humans ears are pointed no jenny said growing excited they are round and they have five fingers too i mean i never actually saw one but i remember the stories round ears and extra fingers and theyre bighalf again as tall as we are she looked at electra in fact the same size as the ones here theyre the same except she looked away from electra theyre not friendly electra asked not with us jenny agreed were enemies mostly we have a long jiistory of fighting and our kind is seldom friendly with their kind it started when we first came to their world and we were civilized and they were primitive and they attacked us and slaughtered us and they were so big and strong and vicious that despite our magic and organization we suffered terribly and had to flee to the forest and hide and form into scattered tribes and ever since then she broke off looking around oh im sorry its not like that here i think it has been like that sometimes electra said and bud nodded when was youngi mean around nine hundred years ago she faltered as she saw others staring at her she slept for a number of centuries godiva explained owing to an enchantment she is no older than she looks in terms of the life she has lived yes electra said grateful for the womans clarification somehow it sounded normal when godiva said it there was more fighting between human beings and other creatures i dont know about elves specifically but they wanted to clear land for their villages bud said they wanted to cut down elms they wanted to bum our holt jenny agreed that its a tree we live in but we dont get stronger near it except that we fight harder to save it because i think we have affinities bud said perhaps when this ugly business is done you will visit our flower elm jenny iid like that jenny agreed now would you like to see the foal godiva asked electra before you return to the surface electra had almost forgotten her mission distracted by the developments yes wed better i regret meeting you in this circumstance electra and gloha naldo said i feel the same bud said but perhaps a compromise will be worked out i hope electra said fervently what would nada say when she learned that her brother was on the other side godiva led the way out of the chamber and jenny gloha and electra followed naldo remained perhaps to talk further with bud elf the naga and the elves supporting the goblinsthis changed things they came to another chamber guarded by a male goblin idiot electra exclaimed recognizing him hello lectra the goblin said whos your friend gloha meet idiot electra said smiling she had never liked goblins but the females had impressed her and the three males in godivas party had turned out to be all right too once allowance was made for their ugliness hello idiot gtoha said smiling shyly open the door idiot godiva snapped the goblin hastened to lift the bar they trooped in and the door closed behind them inside stood another goblin girl beside che this is my daughter gwendolyn godiva said gwendolyn these are electra and gloha from the surface as you can see electra is a human girl of about your own age and gloha is a winged goblin girl of fifteen gloha has been here before but you have not actually met before she is my first cousin they are here to verify the status of che centaur hello electra gwendolyn said hello gloha jenny crossed immediately to join gwendolyn yes those wings of glohas really work she said shes like che only older so she can fly a crossbreed oh how nice gwendolyn said a bit vaguely i have asked che centaur to be my daughters companion godiva said as you can see he is not being mistreated and believe they are getting along well something was slightly odd here but electra couldnt pin it down gwendolyn seemed like a nice girl and both jenny and che seemed to like her but why did she need a winged monster for a companion why this particular one who was bringing war to goblin mountain it just didnt seem to make sense to go to such extraordinary trouble for such a minor thing there were surely plenty of goblin girls available and plenty of harmless animals che electra said your sire is preparing to destroy the mountain level by level if he doesnt get you back im sure gwendolyn is a nice girl and happy for your company but how do you feel about this captivity i had some trepidation about entering the mountain che replied but my concern has been abated i am being well treated and i like gwenny i am in the process of deciding whether to agree to be her companion but that doesnt count when they are holding you captive gloha protested cheiron wont accept that it is a problem che said because it proved to be beyond me i have delegated the decision to another godiva was startled you have who jenny elf electra gloha and godiva stared at jenny you are deciding for him godiva asked well he asked me to jenny said abashed and what do you propose to tell him to do godiva asked i dont know i havent decided either godiva shared a look of bafflement with electra they were on opposite sides but neither saw much sense in this electra returned to che what happens to you if you agree i will remain here as gwennys companion but we may travel outside if we wish later but she can go outside by herself or with another goblin electra protested she doesnt need you che shrugged that is as it may be jenny will decide how can you be party to this jenny electra demanded i thought you were his friend i am his friend jenny replied gloha was equally baffled what happens to you if you say no i am uncertain it may be that i will be released electra turned grimly to godiva what happens if he says no she repeated i havent decided the gobliness said mother gwendolyn said angrily godiva paused then reluctantly she answered i will release him good electra said jenny tell him to tell her no and well all leave now and the siege will be lifted and no one will be hurt but jenny shook her headi cant tell him that i havent decided which side are you on electra demanded baffled and upset why dont you marry dolph jenny asked her in return because i cant just electra broke off and regrouped that has nothing to do with this but she was shaken for it was the last response she had expected from jenny was the elf in some similar situation she pondered suppose the goblins had threatened to kill them all electra and gloha included if che refused what they demanded but che didnt want to do it then he would be unable to say either yes or no so he would say he hadnt decided in which case electra and gloha had better get out of here as fast as they could but that question about marrying dolph jenny knew the decision wasnt electras to make maybe the decision on staying wasnt ches to make either but that was only because he had passed it on to jenny that wasnt any good parallel the whole situation of the marriage was complicated and no one would know how it would turn out until it happened though they all had a pretty good idea was there something more complicated here not a threat but some other factor for godiva simply did not seem like the kind to break her word which was what she would be doing if she dishonored the truce and did anything to electra or gloha in fact it was electras definite impression that godiva was telling the truth that she would let che go if he refused to be gwendolyns companion then why was che balkingand jenny toodespite what they knew of the siege and cheirons determination to free his foal if che agreed it seemed he would be well treated and even free to go outside because a centaurs word was his bond if he declined he would be freed so he had every reason to decide promptly yet he was not doing soand neither was jenny electra shook her head unable to make sense of it she would just have to go back out and make her report i guess thats it she said well go now they moved to the door tell cheiron of our allies godiva said the land dragons too are coming to support us worse and worse they walked up the tunnel and finally emerged into bright daylight squinting they walked to the winged monster camp cheiron met them there with chex beside him and prince dolph and princess nada in human form they all looked grimly hopeful itits complicated electra said heavily they arent letting che go exactly but they arent exactly holding him either they want him to decide whether to be the companion of godivas daughter gwendolyn and he hasnt decided a decision made under duress would not be valid cheiron said he knows that yes but this doesnt seem to be that exactly he hes having jenny elf decide for him and she hasnt made up her mind theyll treat him well if he agrees and let him go if he doesnt heseems satisfied just not decided there has to be duress cheiron said grimly we know how to deal with that but theres more gloha said they have allies allies who more goblins the flower elves electra said hating it the callicantzari the land dragons and the naga what nada demanded shocked your brother prince naldo was there theres an ancient covenant they have to help the goblins against the winged monsters there it was out my own people nada cried appalled i forgot about that covenant cheiron turned to her there is such a covenant yes but its never been invoked in our timenot for centuries in fact we hate the goblins thats how i got betrothed to dolph chex shook her head grimly it seems we have a problem electra had to agree feeling empathy for them all she knew about difficult situations chapter dolphs diagnosis dolph was stunned not only were the goblins intent on holding che they had summoned nadas people to help them that meant that if cheirons forces attacked again they would be going up against folk who were allied to castle roogna he could see how shocked nada was he wanted to cheer her up but couldnt think of anything sensible to say we had better verify this cheiron said grimly we should be able to spot land dragons on the move yes chex agreed they walked toward the clearing being used as a runway for takeoffs and landings ill go with you gloha exclaimed dolph was torn should he change to a winged form and go with them or remain to console nada fle turned to nadaand saw her tearfully hugging electra nada was closer to electra than she was to him why did that jar him so electra was always sympathetic to the problems of others he decided to go with the centaurs cheiron ran onto the field leaped spread his wings flicked his tail and flew up chex followed but paused as a roc came in it was best to give the big birds plenty of room because they didnt always see small creatures and their downdraft could be horrendous gloha went out then turned back to dolph who hadnt yet decided what form to assume prince dolph i dont feel easy in the air with the larger monsters and i cant keep the pace may i go with you oh he said surprised sure so he assumed the form of a winged centaur because that would be easiest for her to ride also he could talk with her in that form he had practiced it after attending the wedding of cheiron and chex and now could handle it well enough he could assume any living formand on occasion a borderline form like that of a ghostbut it took practice to make each form function perfectly thus his repertoire was limited but growing however there was one extra thing he needed in this form gloha hopped on she was a light little thing and as shapely as a nymph in her goblin aspect she evidently knew how to ride for her position was secure he didnt have to worry about her falling off he trotted up to join chex as she waited the wind from the landing roc blowing back her brown mane when we get to take off will you make me light he asked her chex glanced at him noting his change of form and his rider of course dolph the roc touched ground bounced and slid along the hard surface its claws sending up sparks as they braked against rocks a small brush fire started but a steamer dragon was ready to douse it with several wellaimed bursts the roc finally came to a stop and hopped off the landing strip it held a small beerbarrel tree trunk in its beak evidently this bird was on the beverage committee go ahead chex said touching dolph and gloha with two flicks of her tail immediately both dolph and the goblin girl became light dolph trotted onto the field spread his wings and jumped into the air he was airborne not as neatly as the real winged centaurs managed it but well enough he flew up to join cheiron who was circling overhead in a moment chex was coming up behind him when the three were at a suitable elevation they spread out and flew south watching the ground i think its true gloha said we really did see prince naldo and bud elf down there and they told us about the covenant but that wont make cheiron give up his foal dolph said more likely he will launch a desperation attack to get che back before any more goblin allies come but with the naga there dolph sighed i guess that makes it my problem i mean it already was but now even more so we cant start killing naga especially not nadas brother or elves she said dolph remembered jenny elf i dont think thats the same jennys not the same kind of elf but humans have never warred with elves oh yes not that i know of they keep mostly to their elms and once our kind learned to leave the elms alone that was that about four hundred years ago jordan the barbarian made a deal with bluebell elfi dont know exactly what it was but the stork brought her a crossbreed baby and rapunzel is their distant descendent so i guess humans and elves can get along when they try certainly we dont want trouble with them but if we support cheiron and the goblins wont let che go im not sure che wants to go gloha said well as cheiron said if there is duress im not sure there is for one thingwell how well do you know jenny elf not that well really but she seems all right and che really seems to like her she didnt have to go with him into goblin mountain but she did so if its a hard decision for him to make because maybe theres a threat or something she said carefully what about jenny would it be hard for her too i mean if she doesnt have to stay there i guess if she really likes him and doesnt want him hurt then maybe it could be pretty hard for her too and jennywhen electra asked her why she couldnt tell che to just say no and she said she couldnt and electra asked her which side she was on she said why dont you marry dolph and that sort of floored electra so maybe theres an answer there if we can just figure it out dolph was amazed what did his possible marriage to electra have to do with whether che remained with the goblins it doesnt make sense to me he admitted i guess maybe its because electra cant just decide to marry you gloha said because youre the one who has to decide right so if jenny couldnt decide because it was ches decision that would make sense but if he told her to make it then she can make it cant she i would think so but something must be stopping her she pondered dolph suppose you told electra to decide i mean you wouldnt decide she would and she would tell you which of them to marry her or nada would that be the same well shed just tell me to marry her everyone tells me to marry lectra would she really wouldnt she what was gloha trying to get at i dont know but i think maybe jenny elf knows it sure set electra back so if you can figure out what electra would say maybe you can figure out what jennys saying why shes not deciding about che yet despite everything and why che lets her thats another mystery why doesnt che make his own decision before things get really bad why dont you that has nothing to do with it i think maybe it does she said i think maybe it was such a tough decision that che couldnt make it himself so he asked jenny to make it and its still so tough she cant make it either just as maybe it would be too tough for electra if you told her to decide maybe its not quite the same problem but maybe close enough so the same principle holds all we have to do is figure out what it is she was making more sense how come youre making better progress on this than i am he asked well everyone knows that girls think better than boys do she said shrugging i didnt know that well youre a boy why did that seem to make so much sense okay so maybe there is a similar principle but i dont think they have any love triangle not a marriage triangle she agreed but it could be love how could it be love theyre children and were not she asked archly well im not im going to be married within a week im the same age as you you know if you cared to assume winged goblin form i could show you a thing or two dolph realized that she was indeed a fine figure of a goblin girl he was tempted to do just that become a winged goblin and see what she looked like then how about showing me your panties he asked she kicked him on the ribs those arent on the list for showing only if you wanted to marry me but i already have two betrothees he protested i was being facetious she said even though there is no boy of my kind i was just making the point that age is no barrier to love were all children according to the adult conspiracy but we can love oh i guess so the adult conspiracy was the bane of his life with its ridiculous tenets but jenny elf and gwendolyn goblin and che centaur dont they love their families and maybe each other not all love relates to the stork you know dolph hadnt known but let it pass so maybe they care about each other but why would that make it so hard for che to decide what to do i dont know thats what were trying to figure out if you dont marry electra she dies could there be something like that with gwendolyn goblin did she seem ill to you no she seemed perfectly healthy and nice i could see how well both che and jenny liked her but there must be something odd about her because thats the first time godiva ever let me meet her im sure we could have been friends if we had met earlier well as you said your wings but che has wings she said sharply thats right so it couldnt be the wings maybe its that hes male male how could a male be better than a female well electra had to be kissed awake by a prince maybe gwendolyn goblin has to have a male companion but im sure there are plenty of male goblins who could have been her playmate would any of them have been as nice as che well you dont expect a goblin male to be nice she said reasonably all the niceness is in the females so if she wanted a nice companion male it couldnt be a goblin he said still there must have been some other companion they could have gotten that wouldnt bring the winged monsters down to besiege their mountain why didnt they look for one of those thats the mystery she agreed or half of it why did they take cheand why cant he make up his mind about it ah we know is that maybe its like you and electra in some devious way he sighed you know if it was exactly like that it wouldnt be easy to solve i cant make up my mind which girl to marry maybe che cant make up his mind which girl should be his companion maybe she said doubtfully but i should think he would do it quickly enough if he knew that goblins and monsters would be fighting and dying if he didnt hes a centaur after all he has logical thought processes unlike the rest of us maybe we should ask a centaur dolph exclaimed but then a motion on the ground caught his eye oops theres a dragon she peered down so avidly she almost fell off his back it didnt matter for she would merely spread her wings and fly back oh yes a big smoker a smoker i saw a steamer in a moment and a half they had spied a whole slew of dragons a stew was a measurement that applied only to big fearsome things and was a standard unit for monsters normally it was sufficient for whatever purpose was intended dolph had never heard of a situation requiring two slews the dragons were tramping north from the land of the dragons toward goblin mountain there was no doubt about it the goblins claim was true arent you flying rather low dolph gloha asked dolph discovered that he was he flapped his wings harder but continued to descend oopsmy lightness is running out he exclaimed realizing then cheiron spied what was happening and swooped down he flicked dolph with his tail as he passed and suddenly dolph lurched up light again as he chased down his equilibrium he saw tiny grundy golem clinging to cheirons mane grundy was serving as translator for the assorted monsters so it was no bluff cheiron remarked unsurprised well we had better consider what to do while we fly back to the mountain those dragons wont arrive until tomorrow so we have some time to play with we think theres something funny about ches position dolph said that theres some reason he cant make a decision maybe like the way i cant decide between betrothees if we knew that reason maybe wed be able to help him decide there is only one decision cheiron said he is not remaining captive in that mountain uh were not sure he is captive dolph said i mean if he tells them no theyll let him go cheiron glanced sharply at him then why doesnt he tell them no theres something some reasonwe thought maybe you would be able to figure it out it seems like duress to me perhaps they have threatened to kill the elf girl if he says no gloha made a horrified peep and dolph was taken severely aback they had not thought of that and so he told jenny elf to decide because it affected her gloha said and she doesnt want to decide because she doesnt want to diebut she doesnt want to make him prisoner either and maybe they told her they would kill them both if they told dolph said his horror growing so she couldnt tell but she asked electra a question and nobody knew what it meant so the goblins didnt realize what question was this cheiron asked alertly why didnt electra marry dolph gloha said chex flying on the other side of them nodded if electra doesnt marry dolph she will die if che does not agree to be gwendolyns companion jenny elf will die it seems a reasonable parallel the case is not tight cheiron said but it will do as a working hypothesis if we proceed on that assumption it is definitely a case of duress in which case the reason they are not making the decision is to provide us tune to free them an agreement made under such duress would not be binding on che but perhaps he doesnt properly appreciate that so believes that his choice is between slavery and the life of his friend we shall have to act swiftly reducing the mountain before the land dragons arrive but if you attack wont they kill them anyway dolph asked i think not they will know that their only hope of reprieve is to return foal and elf unharmed they will keep them as hostages hoping in the end to bargain for their lives if they are not able to hold out until the dragons come as i judge it it will be extremely close but we can do it in time dolph was bothered by the prospect of such a life and death struggle but also by something else he had gotten to know godiva goblin during their trek to goblin mountain by overhearing her conversations with others in the party he remembered how she had honored the adult conspiracy refusing to show jenny a devastating gesture because she was a child while he chafed at the adult conspiracy it hardly seemed that a woman who honored it so carefully would be the kind to kill a girl just to make someone else do something adults whatever other awful things might be said about them usually tried to protect children rather than hurt them godiva had seemed very much like a protective mother gloha you saw che and jenny with gwendolyn didnt you he asked as they flew back a little apart from the centaurs how did they seem to get along together very well actually gloha said in fact she paused as if remembering something significant goblin girls are nice arent they was gwendolyn nice yes and shewhen electra asked what happened if che said no godiva said she hadnt decided and gwendolyn said mother and then godiva said she would release che well that could mean she would release him and kill jenny dolph said but godiva had not seemed like that kind of person she had been tough but true to her word i dont think so jenny didnt seem frightened just undecided and gwendolyn liked her i could tell when gwendolyn challenged her mother godiva backed down i dont think gwendolyn wanted jenny killed and i dont think she would be killed if gwendolyn didnt want it shes in line to be chiefess you know she has power even now as a child so it must be something else what about che was he frightened no he liked gwendolyn too the three of them really seemed to be friends in fact he said he liked gwenny as he called her and that he was being well treated if he said it it was true dolph said even a young centaur would not tell an untruth he might say nothing but he wouldnt lie thats what i thought dolph i dont think anyone was threatened then why wouldnt they decide she shrugged that baffles me i think we havent solved the mystery yet dolph said and i guess maybe wed better before there is bloodshed yes but how ill go in there and find out but youre not a goblin dolph i can become one but you dont know the mountain you dont know the goblin ways she was right he could get into deadly trouble blundering around in there i could become an ant or something and sneak in and somebody would step on you right again then maybe as myself gloha ive got to go mere and find out whats going on before horrible things happen maybe from some misunderstanding ill go with you but youve already risked it once i can take you right to che and jenny elf he nodded then he angled his flight toward cheiron when he got close he called can you hold off your attack a little longer i think i should go in there and see if i can bring che out i think maybe theres something we dont understand cheiron was grim there is too little time i must commence the attack in time to complete the reduction of the mountain before the land dragons arrive or the siege will fail but chex had closed on them dear but we can hold back on the smoke and fire for an hour to give you time cheiron said see females rule gloha murmured with satisfaction they reached the mountain and came down in single file for the landing cheiron chex and dolph immediately cheiron set about organizing the attack while dolph changed and approached nada and electra cheirons resuming the attack he said tersely because land dragons are coming and the mountain must be reduced before they get here but we think theres something we dont know and maybe i can get che and jenny out so gloha and i are going in for an hour ill go with you electra said immediately but nada drew her back my turn lectra she said with a dark glance but its dangerous gloha protested we know nada and electra said together i guess you want to see your brother dolph said to nada she didnt want just to be with dolph he knew though he delighted in the prospect of her company that too she said lets go now dolph realized what they were doing they were taking turns in danger so if one died the other could marry him it was a grim business but he couldnt fault it except suppose the wrong one the three of them advanced on the mountain already the rocs were taking off to seek more boulders to drop on the mountain and the steamer dragons were warming up they would steam the surface so that it would soften and the boulders would break it down faster once more of the inner tunnels were exposed the smokers could make the goblins retreat choking and the harpies could lay explosive eggs and set them rolling down the passages but if those eggs started catching nagasbrother specifically nadas brother ouch so nada was coming along to see personally gloha led the way nada changed to her natural form a womanheaded serpent which she found more comfortable for tunnels dolph considered and matched her form he remembered when they had first met six years before in this form they had become betrothed and kissed banging noses before getting it right he hadnt realized it then but he had fallen in love with her at the moment of that kiss of course he hadnt realized that she was five years older than he she had seemed his age or even slightly younger what times they had had then they moved down into the mountain a goblin appeared challenging them were coming to parlay again gloha called this is prince dolph and princess nada the goblins recognized those names they made way in half a dozen moments they were at the base level godiva awaited them at the door to her daughters chamber what is your mission prince dolph she inquired recognizing him the winged monsters are going to reduce this mountain to rubble before dawn tomorrow he replied your land dragon allies wont get here before then so you cant stop it we want to take che and jenny out of here and stop this battle before anyone is hurt you will not be able to reduce this mountain that fast godiva said our other allies will see to that she glanced at nada you may verify this with your brother if you wish maybe id better nada said godiva snapped her fingers in a moment handsome naldo naga slithered up nada he exclaimed surprised and delighted naldo she cried they slithered up to each other and kissed dolph wished she would kiss him with similar joy oh isnt he handsome gloha whispered to dolph i didnt see him in such good light last time naldo heard that he looked at gloha who blushed almost black so glad to meet you again lovely creature he said handsomely glohas blush assumed a purplish tinge with heartshaped squiggles of red nada rolled up her eyes she had remarked before that her brother could charm any female she had not exaggerated dolph understood how it was nada herself could charm any male how well he knew tell them of your efforts naldo godiva said naldo nodded as you know sis we dont like this situation but we are bound by the covenant and will acquit our obligation honorably we brought a supply of pineapples cherries and popcorn and will assume serpent form of the size required to carry these into key crevices by key tunnels they will detonate when any invaders come causing the tunnels to collapse on them it will not be possible to penetrate to the base without collapsing all the tunnels by which time the defensive forces will have exited with their captives to the nether world of the callicantzari assuming that proves necessary more likely this tactic will slow down the advance enough to allow the land dragons to arrive before the reduction is complete so the chances of the winged monsters prevailing are remote but the smokers can smoke you out nada said not if we collapse the tunnels before the smoke gets through and of course you would not want the captives to get smoked so i doubt it comes to that naldo shook his head sis you had better go back and tell cheiron that his effort is hopeless this stronghold will not be forced the decision will be made by the foal or the elf and then violence will be pointless nada was silent so was dolph naldos case was persuasive it really did not look possible for cheiron to rescue his foal by violence we should talk to che again gloha said by all means godiva said she opened the door foal elf and goblin girl stood within together hello prince dolph jenny said hello princess nada hello again gloha why was she so formal there was indeed something funny about this but dolph still couldnt fathom what it was well he would just have to do what he could che your sire is set to bring this mountain down into rubble he said and the nada are set to do the same in defense of it theres going to be a whole lot of trouble and many creatures may die you cant allow this to happen you must decide che nodded yes i must he looked at jenny what will it be oh che im sorry jenny said looking as woebegone as an elf could which was extremely so i dont see any other way you must agree to be gwennys companion i am relieved not sorry che said i so agree oh che gwendolyn exclaimed hugging him oh thank you thank you it means so much to me but your sire will level the mountain dolph protested he says a decision made under duress is not valid there is no duress che said but dolph started do not affront him naldo murmured behind him you know a centaurs word is inviolate uh yes of course dolph said flustered but che can you tell us why i mean after these goblins foalnapped you and kept you captive no the foal said firmly dolph looked at jenny elf then you jenny youre his friend why im sorry jenny said tearfully i cant tell you either just that its best dolph dreaded returning to tell cheiron and chex this but saw nothing else to do his mission had failed miserably nada came to his rescue che your sire and dam will have trouble understanding this they suspect you are too young to fully appreciate the ways of centaur honor could you come to the surface and tell them yourself why i dont know che said confused i really should stay with gwenny he looked at godiva you are free to go where you will che godiva said we accept your word and your sire and dam should also once they hear it from you directly che turned to gwendolyn do you feel up to making the trip to the surface gwenny i think you will not want to talk very much with others in this confusion but you could at least look outside id love to che the goblin girl said che turned to dolph then go tell my sire and dam that i am coming he said we will follow shortly dolph was relieved til do that what a pass this was nada lingered to talk with her brother gloha and dolph proceeded up the tunnel toward the surface why do you think hes doing it gloha asked when they were alone if theres no threat why wont they tell i think if i knew that id know how to make my own decision dolph said heavily i just cant figure it out glohas right metria said appearing between them boys are duller than girls that isnt what i said gloha protested then belatedly who are you shes the demoness metria dolph said she likes to drive folk crazy oh d mentia gloha said thats d metria the demoness said sharply so why are you here this time dolph asked deciding to get it over with i thought you might just possibly figure out whats with the foal if i gave you long enough to stew over it metria said but since youre not figuring well ill have to give you a hint i dont want your hint dolph exclaimed because at this point he did want it think about the parallel metria said if you dont marry electra who dies she does but what has that to do with if che doesnt become gwendolyns companion who does what but gwendolyns healthy he protested and if she isnt just having a companion wont help her what do you know of goblin society its vicious he said they kill each other to get ahead none of the males dares show any weakness or decency because itll be the end of him but that doesnt count for gwendolyn because shes female and they arent like that and what kind of a position is she slated for the demoness asked shell be the first female chief gloha said its always been a male job before then she put her little fist to her mouth oh my competing with males which means theyll kill her if they spy any weakness dolph exclaimed but che couldnt possibly protect her from them unless he provided her with something to eliminate her weakness gloha said but what could that weakness be i dont know dolph said she seemed all right to me her eyes didnt quite focus but he stopped a monstrous conjecture looming she could be almost gloha said suddenly dolph was able to make his diagnosis metria he started but the demoness was gone if gloha said then dolph continued to save her life she concluded and they wouldnt tell because and we mustnt either except for cheiron and chex after they give their word and no one else he said and no one else she agreed but he wondered about the demoness she honored no human scruples and could blab the secret throughout xanth would she she hadnt yet so maybe she didnt intend to it couldnt be that she had any compassion for the goblin girl or any interest in better relations with the goblins but maybe she thought it would be more entertaining to have a goblin chiefess some future year or maybe she had lost interest entirely that last would be best they arrived at the surface and quickly moved down to talk with cheiron and chex dolph resumed his natural form we must have your word not to reveal what we have learned dolph said does it concern the welfare of my son cheiron demanded yes then will not give my word but gloha said to chex dear chex murmured to cheiron until you tell me why this is necessary the centaur said to dolph che has agreed to be gwendolyns companion and whatt cheiron demanded outraged and we think he has reason gloha said to chex but we cant tell you unless dolph said to cheiron dear chex murmured is there duress cheiron demanded no dolph and gloha said together ha grundy golem said from cheirons mane not him dolph said grundys got the biggest mourn in xanth go elsewhere for the moment chex said to grundy but then the golem translated the nature of her glance and hastily departed chex rotated the glance and brought it to bear on cheiron cheiron considered we will not speak your secret he said at last but i make no commitment about my actions dolph glanced around to make sure that no other creature was in hearing we think gwendolyn goblin is blind or close to it if the goblins learn theyll kill her so she cant be chiefess gloha said so che dolph started will help her gloha continued i can see that the goblin girl has a problem cheiron said but that does not justify foalnapping our kid he was evidently upset then chex touched his arm as she looked toward the mountain they all looked che had arrived at the surface with gwendolyn goblin and jenny elf chapter chexs choice chex was thrilled to see her foal again but she knew that the situation had not been resolved for one thing cheiron had not made a commitment about his actions and that meant he still intended to get che back oh we forgot to tell you prince dolph said che said he would come up to tell you himself thats gwendolyn goblin with him what an omission but of course dolph remained pretty juvenile marriage would cure him of that they trotted up to the tunnel opening chex reached down to hug che youre all right she exclaimed almost painfully relieved of course dam he replied we have been treated very well i have decided to remain as gwennys companion so will not be returning with you but why she asked for she knew that she must not reveal her knowledge of the answer i weighed the considerations and consulted with jenny and made the appropriate decision he had indeed but how could she give up her foal to the goblins if you will not give adequate reason i can not accept your decision cheiron said carefully i must recover you from captivity che with an aplomb that made chex proud avoided responding to that sire dam allow me to introduce my companion gwendolyn goblin daughter of chief gouty and godiva hello gwendolyn chex and cheiron said together gwenny these are cheiron and chex centaur my sire and dam che said hello cheiron and chex the girl said shyly blinking she was pretty in the gobliness manner in a bright red dress and red slippers and with a red bow in her hair with other species appearance was no necessary guide to character but with goblins it was the ugly males were brutish and the pretty females were nice and my friend jenny elf che said turning to the elf girl she was in a blue dress slippers and ribbon a perfect complement to the goblins outfit she had brushed the snarls from her hair so that it hung long as the goblins did she seemed like an elf sister except for the pointed ears and huge spectacles she helped save me from the goblinate of the golden horde and has been a great comfort to me in my hours of need hello jenny said almost as shyly we met before chex centaur you gave me these spectacles yes of course dear chex said i am glad they have served you well and sammy cat che concluded indicating the orange speed bump now snoozing at ches front feet sammy twitched an ear hello sammy cat cheiron said formally now we must talk with the goblin chief because this matter has not been resolved an older gobliness appeared at the tunnel opening with her were nada naga and a male naga this is godiva goblin who is handling business while the chief is indisposed nada said and my brother prince naldo godiva these are cheiron and chex ches sire and dam as you have learned che has agreed to be my daughters companion godiva said your continued hostile activity seems pointless in the light of that decision you abducted our foal cheiron told her the fact that you subsequently prevailed on him to accede to your purpose does not absolve you of guilt or justify his continued presence in your mountain i did what i had to do godiva said and i will do what i have to do cheiron said oh che i did not know it would be like this gwendolyn said to the foal i dont want all this trouble and its all my fault jenny elf said tears on her face i must have made the wrong decision no che told her before cheiron could speak cheiron was silent because he was not going to challenge the word of his foal we are on different sides chex said it is a situation that can not be resolved by the decision of any one person we shall have to work out some compromise cheiron could not oppose that either but he was by no means daunted i bear no animosity to your daughter he told godiva but i will not give up my foal he is unique in a way your daughter is not and necessary to our species in a way your daughter is not and he must be with his own kind you must find some other companion for gwendolyn for che will not remain in your mountain then i think the proof must be in violence godiva said undaunted we shall retire and await your onset but i dont want this gwendolyn protested crying che you must go back to your folks no che looked desperately unhappy but his jaw was set in the same way as cheirons he took her hand and turned to the tunnel they entered and jenny elf followed chex knew she could not let this happen she had to find some way to resolve it without violence che and cheiron were both set and neither would change his mind for centaur character was legendary but chex was not only centaur but mother and she saw in godiva a mother and knew why the gobliness was doing this she saw also that che and gwendolyn goblin really did like each other and that the elf was friends with both the key might lie in the elf jenny she called the elf paused at the dark hole of the tunnel turning back yes chex centaur you are not bound come with me jenny was flustered but godiva evidently recognizing chexs concern interceded go with her jenny we will allow you to return to us if it can safely be done the girl remained confused but i canti mean i think she already knows talk to her jenny hesitated a moment more then turned back to the tunnel che she called ii will join you later then she picked up her orange fur ball and came down to chex cheiron turned away the barrage will resume in a moment he said nada bid parting to her brother and walked down the slope chex knew that she was suffering similarly not wanting to be on the other side from naldo this was all so difficult and it threatened the welfare of che chex wished that for once centaurs were not so resolute but she knew better than to argue the elf came to her get on my back chex said we must get away from here and talk perhaps we can find some way through the girl set the cat on chexs back then scrambled up herself it was obvious that she had never been on a centaur before but she seemed to have a touch for riding for her balance was sure once she got settled hold on chex said then she flicked them with her tail spread her wings and leaped off the mountain she saw as she moved past the camp that nada was hugging electra being consoled gloha the winged goblin girl was standing beside prince dolph looking forlorn and cheiron was directing the rocs and dragons in the renewed attack it would be a savage one chex knew because of the time limit whatever was to be accomplished had to be done before the land dragons arrived the irony was that cheiron now understood why the goblins needed che and that they would not mistreat the foal but could not retreat from his position cheiron was a male centaur that said it all then they were up above the trees and sailing into the sky chex did not want to watch the bombardment she knew that little good would come of it no matter how things turned out violence was the way of males and it seldom benefited anyone but they kept right on with it she could not tell cheiron no but she could signal her distress by absenting herself from the proceedings oooo this is fun jenny elf exclaimed she definitely knew how to ride her balance was excellent the cat seemed to be having no trouble either by the feel of him he was asleep again how is it that you know how to ride jenny when there are no centaurs in your land chex inquired were wolf riders the girl explained we have wolf friends and when we have to go somewhere fast we ride them i dont have a wolf friend yet but i guess we all know how to ride just naturally this is like being on a wolf when it makes a huge leap those must be big wolves how big are wolves in xanth too small for you to ride actually the straight wolves are in mundania but if they came here they would be too small to ride but your wolvesdo they fly no they just run fast and protect us and are our friends did that make it easy for you to be ches friend maybe it did the girl said surprised but mostly che just needed a friend chex reviewed what che and jenny had been into the deep jungle the goblins of the horde a long trek around the elements and captivity in goblin mountain she shuddered to think how che would have fared alone he needed a friend she agreed and you have been a good one but now it seems he has another friend oh gwennys not exactly a friend well she is but thats not the point hes her companion and she needs a companion who can see for her jenny didnt answer i called to you jenny because i believe you have the best understanding of the situation chex said we believe we have come to understand enough of it to enable us to appreciate godiva goblins motive in abducting our foal gwendolyn will be killed if she evinces any significant weakness and a centaur companion can both alleviate and conceal that weakness cheiron and i have undertaken not to tell isnt it true that gwendolyn is blind no she can see just not very well no better than i can and they cant put spectacles on her because then the goblins would know but che really can help her and oh i didnt want to tell him to do iti knew he should come homebut i just couldnt let gwenny die and neither could he we just couldnt she was crying again tormented by the difficulty of the decision even after it had been made and gwendolyns mother could not stand by and let her daughter be killed either chex knew exactly how that was that was what made it impossible to hate godiva she had indeed done what a mother had to do you dont see well without your spectacles jenny chex said how did you manage back in the world of two moons werent you almost blind there well yes with my eyes but it didnt matter so much because of the sending the what the sending it doesnt seem to work in xanth exactly what is it jenny itits sort of a mind connection when theres an emergency the chief can call everyone in the tribe without making a sound sometimes in past generations thats been the only thing that saved us from disaster we would call that mind reading chex said some folk have it as their magic talents but most of us have no mental connection with others isnt that awful lonely the girl asked wistfully it doesnt seem so perhaps because we have never experienced it so you were able to know people because of your contact with their minds yes pretty much and sammy helped in his way i sort of could see him i guess by his mind though i couldnt really talk to him i did trip and bang into things a lot but outside in the berry patches there wasnt much to bang into so it was all right chex saw how the girl put a positive face on something that must have been a continuing burden to her it was also clearer now why she kept the cat so close though she could no longer tune in to his mind jenny was from a far strange world but she was a good girl and she had helped che immeasurably how do you feel about che chex asked oh i like him jenny exclaimed i never met a centaur before except for you i mean but hes nice she was absolutely correct bur chex knew that che young as he was was highly discriminating about friendship he would not have been her frierra without good reason that was the best recommendation jenny elf could have had though she did not know it yet you gave him up to gwendolyn goblin oh i didnt do that jenny protested ill always be his friend but sheshe really does need him for her companion and shes nice too and and jenny was crying she could have had che to herself as it were but had done what she felt was right knowing that there would be a smaller place for her in his life because of it she also surely hurt to think of him remaining tied to the depths of goblin mountain but since he could leave it in the company of the goblin girl that was the lesser concern that explained why che had asked jenny to make the decision he had known that she would be making as much of a sacrifice as he gwendolyns gain was jennys loss che had not felt right about deciding that for jenny so jenny had decided it for jenny now she was on the way to being bereft of her only real friend in xanth chex was not satisfied with that but in the complex situation they faced she had no ready solution she looked down and spied the land dragons now significantly closer to the mountain they were big ones without even vestigial wings which meant they were in no way bound to see to ches safety the smaller winged dragons would not be able to oppose them once the land dragons arrived they would guard the mountain and only the rocs would be able to attack that would not be enough cheiron was right whatever he did had to be done promptly he surely had a stratagem to bring the mountain down faster than the goblins thought it could be done and force their capitulation before the following morning but there was so much danger to che in that violence here is the problem chex said after a bit cheiron simply is not going to allow our foal to be held in this manner if che has a commitment to the goblins cheiron is prepared to void it by eliminating the goblins but thats worse than ever jenny protested they arent such bad folk really not like the horde and gwenny truly is nice and so is godiva when you get to know her and this way the goblins will get better its not just gwenny its that its right to do i think perhaps it is chex said but cheiron is right too do you see any way out of this impasse i just wish they could all be friends and not fight any more jenny said tearfully so do i chex agreed fervently so it is up to us to find a way to make that possible now cheiron will not relent until che is home with us while godiva its not her really jenny said i mean it was maybe because she started it by foalnapping che but she gave him his choice after we met gwenny he could have gone home then but but gwendolyn would have died in due course chex said so it was ches decision even if you made it he wanted someone older and more objective than he was to make it so he could be sure it was right and perhaps it was right for him so now it is che on the other side we have one male centaur against another and we as females must find a way to resolve it but how can we jenny asked plaintively che has to be either with you or with gwenny unless we went to join him in goblin mountain chex said with a short and not very mirthful laugh you wouldnt fit in there jenny said with a trace less unmirth but you know che can visit you once he gave his word true but he would have to return and it is obvious that he will have to spend a lot of time with gwendolyn because any slip would be disastrous cheiron wants him free of goblin mountain entirely because there is a great deal of education he must have there simply isnt time to accommodate both ches centaur heritage and fulltime companionship with gwendolyn i guess not jenny agreed sadly unless she could come along come along and be with him while he learned she said she wants to get out and see things only she cant shes never been out of goblin mountain because she can get by in her room atone or maybe in a tunnel where she knows exactly where everything is but outside it would be hopeless unless she had a competent companion chex sighed i do see the problem of course with che she could do it because he would tell her what to see only he wouldnt tell her hed have some sort of signals only a centaur could memorize that nobody else knew about thats why it has to be a centaur they have mental powers others dont true chex said i could do it but of course a grown centaur wouldnt we have other business so does che actually other business he is destined to change the course of the history of xanth thats why he has to be free even if he wasnt a centaur and our foal we cannot allow the goblins to interfere with that indeed we feared that his abduction was a plot to prevent his destiny from being achieved but if gwenny gets to rule the goblins wouldnt that change things i mean theres never been a female goblin leader before with the magic wand she could do it if she could see well enough to use it or have someone tell her chex was stunned she almost fell out of the sky she had to pump her wings vigorously to recover equilibrium while jenny hung on to change the history of xanthby enabling a goblin woman to become a chief chex said after she got straightened out we assumed it was human history or centaur history we never thought of goblin history well maybe it isnt jenny said or maybe the goblins will do something that will affect the others all this time we were trying to protect che for his destinyand we may be interfering with that destiny now chex said i must tell cheiron will that change his mind jenny asked chex making a sweeping turn to go back to goblin mountain paused no he is already committed it is just one more reason to find some peaceful way through this picklement jenny considered you said that any centaur could help gwenny outside but they wouldnt thats right we centaurs are busy with our own concerns cheiron and i are trying to raise che for example but suppose gwenny visited you would one of you help gwenny while the other educated che we could but for what reason in case thats his destiny then you could keep his destiny and educate him and gwenny wouldnt suffer do you mean bring her to live with us chex asked astonished i guess it wasnt a good idea jenny said abashed chex considered it rationallyand suddenly everything fell into place cheiron could be satisfied and ches destiny would not be compromisedwhatever it wasand the goblin girl would be safe for none of them would betray her secret it could be doneif godiva let her go i think its an excellent idea chex said ill go tell cheiron right now she resumed her turn and winged powerfully for the mountain then something else fell into place in chexs mind jenny you will have to go in and talk to godiva because the rest of us are fighting the goblins but you will need to talk to che and gwendolyn too yes the girl agreed faintly i want you to take a message to che that perhaps will help him understand oh of course it is this remember the night stallions creed remember the night stallions creed she repeated ill tell him but what does it mean that would be complicated to explain for i suspect you do not have night mares in your world but i think he will fathom it and then tell you oh all right the girl did not push for further clarification and chex was glad because she wanted this decision to be ches as they approached the mountain they saw the rocs circling carrying boulders each would swoop low release its boulder at high speed then fly up while the boulder crashed into the mountain at an angle the mountain would shudder and several tunnels would be crushed in then the first roc would head off for another boulder while the next swooped in meanwhile the dragons were hovering when all three rocs completed their runs the firebreathers swooped in for strafing runs sending flames shooting into the exposed tunnels the steamers did likewise only their steam was intended to soften the substance of the mountain so that the boulders did more damage finally the smokers approached their attack would be the worst because their smoke would penetrate far into the mountain bringing misery and even death to those it caught the other winged monsters were relaxing waiting for their turn some were licking their chops evidently having a taste for smoked goblin but the naga are collapsing the tunnels so nothing can get through jenny said the smoke wont smoke them out cheiron will send in the cockatrices chex said they will freeze the goblins and naga with their glares and the tunnels will not be collapsed cheiron has studied siege technique he will counter alt their ploys thats one more reason i dont want this to continue i know how bad it will be for all concerned the goblins will retreat to the caverns of the calii calli callicantzari chex said they are like exaggerated goblins grotesque monsters with some of their limbs installed backwards only desperation would make the goblins go there but they are allies now because of the covenant and i guess theyll take che along with them we have to stop that the callicantzari will be treacherous allies they could put them all into the pot actually cheiron had probably anticipated that ploy also and would send the cockatrices first to the lower chambers to prevent the goblins from moving anyone out chex folded her wings and angled down her increasing weight lending her velocity if she didnt flick herself with her tail every so often she eventually became too heavy to fly but it was a good thing because otherwise she would never be able to be comfortable on land she zoomed down toward cheiron then spread her wings and braked abruptly just before lowering her hooves cheiron she said stop the smokers there is another way cheiron paused as he always did for her i shall be satisfied with no less than the return of our foal unharmed if the goblins think that night will stop us they are mistaken we have fireflies to illuminate the scene we can bring them both to our residence chex said che and gwendolyn he can be her companion in our glen he was startled why i suppose he could but we would then be obliged to take care of her which could be a burden ches destiny she said it may be to enable the goblins to have a female chief that could change the history of xanth that made him pause he realized that his efforts might be counterproductive very well i will suspend the attack for an hour if godiva will let her daughter go we will do it but she must answer promptly for i will not be stalled horses could be stalled but not centaurs jenny has access to the mountain she can go in and ask this could solve everything and make the entire course of this incident have meaning let her go in then he said but she must have an answer if she does not return within the hour the attack resumes and it will be swift he leaped into the air and flew off to attend to the halting of the attack its up to you now jenny chex said you will do us all a phenomenal favor if you bring this to pass the girl looked scared ill try she said ill try my very best chapter jennys judgment jenny was terrified as she approached the mountain carrying sammy she had been with company before but now she was alone except for the cat and the surface of the mountain was mostly rubble and the feel of warfare was in the air suppose the goblins thought she was an enemy invader and threw stones at her then she had a moderately bright notion sammy find a safe way in she said setting the cat down sammy seemed irritated to have his snooze interrupted but he picked his way to one of the smaller tunnel holes and went in jenny had to get down on her hands and knees to squeeze past the rubble partly blocking the hole and she got her nice blue dressactually it was gwennys dress smudged in the effort but she made it inside it was terrifyingly dark she should have thought to bring a torch how was she to find her way in such blackness sammy wait for me she called fearful of being left behind the cat would surely find a safe way in but that wouldnt do her any good if she didnt keep up with him it was so much harder here in xanth where she could neither send nor receive sammys mind there was a faint meow jenny went toward that and her foot caught a stone and she almost fell then she stepped over an edge and did fall screaming she slid into some sort of slick pit unable to catch herself then she realized that it was not a sheer drop but a steep tunnel in fact it was a slide she was sliding down and around and around swiftly but not horrendously this was the safe way in after a while her descent slowed she was sure the back of her dress was horribly soiled but at least she was all right now she saw light and in two and a half moments came to rest by one of the guttering torches sammy was waiting for her there licking the dirt off his fur now find godiva jenny told him slowly she took the torch out of its holder and followed as the cat set off again a male goblin intercepted them hey schnook where you going jenny adjusted her spectacles and looked at him she did not recognize him who are you what do you mean who am i he demanded im the one doing the asking here where are you going glasseyes im going to see godiva she said now get out of my way because this is important oh yeah elf he demanded making the elf sound like an epithet why you wanna see that female dog jenny realized that this was a juvenile goblin not only was he smaller than she was he didnt know the terms forbidden by the adult conspiracy of this world i dont have to tell you anything is that so pointears he said belligerently well im gobble son of the chief and i want to know what you have to say to that hair ball so this was gobble goblin the tenyearold son of gouty according to gwenny the brattiest brat who ever existed she could believe it she remembered that he would become chief if gwenny didnt ordinarily jenny tried to be polite to folk but she was in a hurry and this one was just not worth it disappear brat she said and pushed past him oh no you dont frecklebottom he cried grabbing her spectacles from her face suddenly jenny could hardly see give those back she demanded grabbing for him nyaa nyaa you cant get them he cried tauntingly staying out of her reach jenny lurched after him but only banged into a wall it scraped the side of her face and hurt horribly gobble laughed uproariously hey your snoot looks better already furriner why dont you do the other side too jenny was furious and humiliated worse she knew she could not catch him and she could not see where she was going without those spectacles she was in real trouble but she knew that if she started crying the brat would be even happier whats going on here a voice demanded jenny recognized it it was godiva she must have been close to the womans chamber when she ran into gobble aw nothing gobble said his voice developing a whining tone just playing you have her spectacles godiva said severely give them back this instant there was a faint crash and tinkle of something breaking oops dropped em gobble said oops stepped on em too by accident i guess theyre broke he had deliberately broken her spectacles how could she get around now what a calamity i will deal with you later gobble godiva said and there was that in her voice that made jenny wince she heard the brat fleeing evidently he recognized that tone too come with me jenny godivas hand took jennys elbow and guided her firmly suddenly jenny didnt have to worry about where she was going godiva knew exactly how to help her she must have had plenty of experience with gwenny in three quarters of a moment they were in godivas nice suite and the woman was sponging off jennys face it stung but in a good way for godiva had a mothers touch why did you return jenny she asked gently suddenly jenny remembered her mission chex centaur says can gwenny come to live with her she burst out sheshe knowsi didnt tell her but i understand i knew she had something in mind shes a mother if you could let gwenny go there then che could still be her companion and they wouldnt tell give up my daughter godiva asked dismayed but she must be chief otherwise otherwise gobble is jenny said making a face but chex isnt trying to stop that she understands she can teach heri mean gwenny can leam while theyre teaching cheand when its time for her to come back here and be chiefche will come too they want che with them they dont mind if hes gwennys companion and this is a way it is a way godiva agreed they want their child as i want mine but mine can have more freedom with them than theirs can have with me they are centaurs they can be trusted perhaps this is best then youll do it jenny asked youll let them go i will do it godiva said oh thank you jenny exclaimed hugging her you will have to get another pair of spectacles godiva said turning businesslike but what will become of you jenny become of me jenny asked blankly you came as i understand it into xanth by chance and can not return to your world you have helped che centaur and perhaps helped my daughter too what will you do with your life now that they will be secure in theirs whywhy i dont know i wasnt thinking of myself i just did whatever seemed best to do perhaps it is time you did think of yourself first i have to tell che and give him his mothers message oh what is that remember the night stallions creed jenny said before she thought then oh i dont know if i should have told you i mean it is all right jenny godiva said gently i understand that message she seemed sad what does it mean that is for che to decide come i will take you to them now they went to gwennys chambers godivas firm hand making it easy for jenny godiva opened the door moved them in and closed it behind them here are che and gwendolyn and your cat seems to be settling down on a cushion she said jenny appreciated that because the room was just a blur with vague shapes she couldnt recognize any of them jennywhere are your specs ches voice came i ran into gobble jenny said that explains it gwennys voice came i didnt see they were missing until che commented but i know what gobble is like now che will have to help you too i shall be glad to che said give him your message dear godiva murmured to jenny che chex says gwenny can come to your home with you jenny said so you can be home and still be her companion oooo gwendolyn exclaimed delighted why that is very nice jenny che said it does seem to solve our problem nicely if the lady godiva is amenable i have agreed to allow this godiva said with the understanding that the same strictures apply to your family che oh my sire and dam would not betray a confidence che said but do you wish to do this gwenny with you yes gwendolyn said i would be afraid otherwise but already you are helping me to see and if your folks are like you they would not have extended the offer were they not prepared to meet the attendant commitments he said they will treat you well and prevent your private situation from being known i assure you that you can trust them in this regard as you do me they are centaurs gwendolyn must have looked at her mother for godiva spoke this is true dear you will be secure with them but you motherwont you be lonely gwendolyn asked yes dear i will but i would be more lonely if anything were to happen to you i think you will be safer with the centaurs than you will be here until you are of age and experience to handle the magic wand perhaps you will visit regularly with che oh yes mother of course well visit gwendolyn said just the way che would have visited his folks oh this is wonderful i must pack some dresses i dont think there is time jenny said we have to be back at the surface within an hour or the attack will begin again i will bring your dresses out later godiva said once you emerge the siege will stop and it will be easy to complete arrangements oh good then we can go now give your other message jenny godiva murmured oh i forgot che your dam says to remember the night stallions creed there was a pause then che spoke subdued i shall do that that aspect had not occurred to me what does it mean gwendolyn asked it is a certain code enforced in the realm of dreams but relevant here che said i think my dam thought i would neglect it and perhaps i would have i must consider its application carefully jenny was frustrated what was the mystery here why should che keep it secret but if he didnt want to tell what it meant then he didnt have to right now they had to get on up to the surface before the attack resumed i will lead you out gwendolyn godiva said che will walk with jenny yes mother there was motion in the room then a shape loomed near jenny it was che he took her hand sammy jenny exclaimed wheres sammy a ball of fur rubbed against her legs she stooped to pick up the cat they trooped out the door and into the tunnel two by two it was a great comfort to have che guiding her for jenny knew he could see perfectly and would not lead her into any mischief she understood more clearly how important his companionship to gwendolyn was when a person couldnt see trustworthy guidance was essential they came to the bright surface jenny blinked the fact that she couldnt see well did not mean she wasnt sensitive to light it just meant that shapes at any distance were blurred i think we understand the nature of the agreement godiva said we do cheirons voice came jenny knew why they werent saying more goblins and winged monsters were surely within hearing range jennys incapacity of sight was known but gwendolyns had to remain secret gwendolyn will ride on me cheiron said we shall be afoot because che will walk but there is no need to tax your daughter with a long walk understood godiva said and helped the girl get on him jenny realized that this made it clear to monsters and goblins alike that gwendolyn was under cheirons protection and that the siege was over it would also make it impossible for others to tell that gwendolyn could not see so it was done and all was well jenny suddenly realized that her part in this was done she was no longer needed it was time for her to say farewell to her friends she fought back her tears not wishing to embarrass herself or them then che was beside her and you will ride my dam as i believe you did before he said me but that was just to do we not remain friends yes of course che she exclaimed but now you are safe and you have other things to do i would like to have you remain with me until you are able to return to your home but che you have a companion and your folks i have a companion and a friend i do not wish to lose my friend i would just be in the way your sire and dam will be so busy and when a person challenges a decision of the night stallion in his realm he dictates that the one who takes the part of another shall share the fate of that other this is part of his creed and it is a formidable one share the fate she asked blankly when prince dolph tried to protect grace ossein from the punishment of the night stallion he had to share her fate she was vindicated and so was dolph when grey murphy tried to help girard giant they snared fates my dam reminded me of this policy in the realm of dreams and i agree with it though it is only an analogy it was her way of alerting me to the appropriate procedure and signaling her acquiescence but what has that to do with me you took gwennys part though perhaps you felt it weakened your position now gwenny is coming to my home i would like to have you share her fate jenny was nonplused but thats not bad thats good gwenny will be happy with you will you not be also he was finally getting through to her you meanme too that is what he means dear godiva said you would have been welcome in goblin mountain but i think you will be better off with the centaurs with your friends jenny just stood there unable to speak chex spoke ride me jenny we welcome you thank you jenny said somewhat choked godiva lifted her and she was on chexs back still holding sammy i am glad that we were able to settle this matter amicably cheiron said to godiva we shall be in touch agreed godiva said then the centaurs walked down the slope and away from the mountain it was a long walk for they were limited by ches pace jenny knew that prince dolph could have assumed a large form and carried the foal quickly there while the two grown centaurs flew but evidently they preferred to go at their own pace and by themselves they stopped to pick fruit and eat it and to see the sights of xanth indeed their course seemed to weave around somewhat jenny wondered whyand then she found out there is one dear chex said very good cheiron said che please lead your companions to the spectacle bush a spectacle bush that was what they had been looking for jenny got down and found ches little hand in a moment gwenny had his other hand the ground is rough che said you must step cautiously i will guide you by small pressure on your hands and he did so so that neither of them had any difficulty i think this pair would look good on you jenny che said picking a pair and giving it to jenny she put them on her face and suddenly the world came clear again it was wonderful che picked another pair and put them on his own face jenny laughed you look so funny che and this pair should look nice on you gwenny he said picking a third pair but i cant gwendolyn protested it is not nice to express it but the spectacles make jenny elf look odd he said it would be courteous to don a similar pair to share her oddity and make her feel more comfortable as i have done my spectacles have no effect on my vision of course they are merely decoration oh i dont mind jenny protested but he made a no signal that gwendolyn could not see and she stopped what was he up to his sire or dam must have told him to do this somewhere along the way i dont want jenny to feel odd gwendolyn said no one knows me out here so i suppose i can wear a pair she put the spectacles on her face she stood for a moment her mouth slowly dropping open in amazement i can see she exclaimed i can see everything no matter how far away she tilted her face up isis that a cloud yes jenny said now understanding they had given gwendolyn a reason to wear the spectacles without commenting on what the lenses did now she could see as well as they could without having to admit how it was without them but if we encounter goblins we may all remove our spectacles che said until we are away from them so that they will not make fun of us the two girls nodded understanding very well they returned to the adult centaurs wearing their spectacles even sammy had a pair now i see you children enjoy playing games cheiron remarked perhaps the two of us should complete the effect by donning similar pairs no sire che said only children are permitted to be childish i stand corrected cheiron said making a droll face jenny did not know cheiron well but she could see already that she would like him well enough if you must indulge in such foolishness chex said severely at least indulge in it while we travel so as not to waste more time they quickly agreed gwenny scrambled onto cheirons back and jenny onto chexs the centaurs started off again but now it was different jenny could see all xanth and so could gwenny gwennys head was constantly turning that way and this as if she wanted to cram everything into her eyes before it disappeared then she faced jenny and jenny winked and gwenny broke out laughing mostly from the sheer joy of being able to see such an expression at this distance later in the day they encountered a giant land serpent the creature lifted its head hissing hungrilyonly to discover itself bracketed by two arrows that thudded into a tree on either side of its body it gazed at cheiron whose bow remained in his hands and decided to hiss at some creature far away in a moment it was gone jenny had assumed that the flying centaurs escaped threats by flying away from them now she saw that this was not always the case cheiron had not missed the serpent he had warned it a centaurs arrow went as true as his word they came to a stop beside a pleasant pool jenny suddenly realized how thirsty she had become oh i could drink half of it right now she exclaimed me too gwenny agreed caution cheiron said one must never take an unfamiliar pond for granted jenny remembered the hate spring of the horde and shuddered cheiron looked around and found several ladybugs being pestered by several gentlemenbugs he caught two of the latter in his hand and carried them to the pool and dropped them in they splashed then began swimming for the bank cheiron lifted them out and looked at them both were wet but otherwise unharmed he set them down beside a pennypede they ignored it instead scrambling back toward the ladybugs eager to pester them some more this water appears to be neutral cheiron remarked no love no hate no poison so it seemed nevertheless they sipped it cautiously at first it was sweet and good it occurred to jenny that cheiron had known the character of the lake before coming to it but he had wanted to make a point so that children excited about being able to see did not take foolish risks this was part of centaur education che had remained silent throughout he must have known dear chex said i believe i would prefer to spend the night in our own cottage rather than in the field it has been a wearing occasion very well cheiron said girls we shall need your help che can not ride readily and can not yet fly so you will have to hold him while we fly but the two said together in this manner chex said get on us and take his hands baffled they did so now each girl was riding a centaur reaching down to hold one of ches hands then cheiron flicked che with his tail che became so light that the pull of their hands on his drew him into the air dont let go he exclaimed the two centaurs flicked themselves spread their wings and jumped together into the air suddenly they were flying perfectly synchronized with che floating between them jenny realized that they could have done this anytime but wanted to give the girls some experience on the ground and with the spectacles first and perhaps they wanted to let the group get comfortable with itself before risking such a maneuver she was learning a lot about centaurs already chapter electros election electra watched the centaurs go gwendolyn goblin was riding cheiron and jenny elf was riding chex with little che prancing along between them their family of three had become a family of five and they all looked happy and electra was glad she knew the centaurs would take excellent care of the girls in fact not only would they be happy and healthy they would receive the best education available in xanth and the siege of goblin mountain was over before lives had been lost goblins were not electras favorite creatures but she had come to respect longhaired godiva if a woman were to become a goblin chief the goblins would become much better neighbors the winged monsters were departing some were evidently disappointed that they had not gotten to use their horrible weapons but most seemed glad to be away from here before the arrival of the land dragons that left godiva and nada and nadas handsome brother naldo and dolph nada and her brother were talking renewing their family ties and dolph was seeing the monsters off electra approached the gobliness i guess its hard to lose your daughter even if its for the best she said i would have lost her in a worse way if this had not happened godiva said but she did look sad at least they will be visiting she shrugged but i dont see this type of solution for you electra what will you do this week what can i do che could be a companion to both girls but dolph can marry only one maybe if i looked like nada you girls helped save che centaur and that helped save my daughter godiva said let me see what i can do for you unless your wand could make me beautiful stop it girl beauty is not the problem its just an aspect of it she inspected electra shrewdly you dont have a family here do you no my family is centuries gone but king dor and queen irene have been very good to me they have a conflict of interest they have to look to the welfare of their son i have no such conflict come into the mountain with me but godiva smiled not to stay electra i want to try some dresses on you dresses but my daughter is gone i have to fuss over someone oh electra could appreciate that godiva glanced to where the two naga were talking naldo may i have a moment with you before you go of course lady both naga slithered over naldo we have resolved a crisis here and i express my appreciation for the support of your folk your kind and ours are not normally allies but you honored the covenant we shall do the same when the time comes as goblins we can not oppose our own kind in mount etamin but when my daughter is grown and assumes power we shall see what can be done politically to alleviate your situation electra recognized the significance of that commitment if gwendolyn later became chief here and married a chief there she would be in a position to stop the goblin aggressions against the nada of mount etamin it might indeed turn out to pay the naga well for their honoring of the covenant because the goblins there were their worst nemesis indeed it was the reason nada had been betrothed to dolph to make an alliance with the human folk and gain power to push back the goblins thank you lady naldo said i am glad to have come to know you but you may be able to do something more immediate for your sister godiva said you know she doesnt want to marry dolph and not just because she doesnt want to void your alliance with the human folk you know electra must marry dolph or die within the week and furthermore she loves him now you are an astute observer of creature nature i want you to put your mind to this problem and come up with a devious solution that will serve all parties best but he protested within the hour she said while i dress electra she took electras arm and guided her into the tunnel with her free hand she lifted a smoky torch from its holder to light their way the funny thing was that electra being human was about twice as tall as the gobliness but she felt like a child with this adult he cant solve the problem that no one else has solved in six years electra protested belatedly as they wound down into the depths there is no solution i mean even if i didnt die he wouldnt love me and i dont want him to be unhappy there are ways to solve any problem godiva said its just a matter of finding them naldo has a clever mind i have seen it in action recently he will find a way though the rest of us may not properly understand it electra did not argue she knew this was an impossible dream unless the good magician had an answer that was her only real hope godiva brought her to her nice suite i make my daughters dresses myself she said because it isnt convenient to go out and harvest from clothes hangers or dress mannequins i get material and i cut and sew i believe they suit her well enough they make her beautiful electra said and the elf girlthat blue dress made her beautiful too it was amazing its just knowhow godiva asserted a woman can be beautiful in just a hank of hair if she drapes it correctly its all in the technique certainly godiva could she had the most lustrous black tresses electra had seen reaching down to her knees her hair flared out and around constantly caressing her but electra had no such asset godiva brought out white material this will be your wedding dress she said but any woman looks beautiful in her wedding dress godiva said it is part of the enchantment but i cant wear that if i dont get married of course you can naldo will figure out how the woman worked busily measuring electra here and there then cutting the material and tacking it together with quick temporary stitches soon she had it ready to try on strip electra gave up protesting there was a hope and fascination about this business that she could not resist of course she would not get to marry dolph but for this hour she might pretend she removed her shirt and jeans and heavy shoes godiva studied her with embarrassing directness you are grimy from the siege go to the alcove and sponge yourself off obediently electra went the voice of a mother was not to be denied there was a polished stone mirror but electra did not look at herself knowing that there was nothing to be gained she cleaned up dried then turned to put on her panties but they were gone in their place was something else she picked up the satiny bit of material it was a pair or delicate pink panties oh i cant wear these she said do you think i want you trying on a wedding dress in grimy offwhite panties godiva demanded embarrassed electra capitulated she donned the pink panties then the pink bra feeling wicked she stepped out knowing that her blush just about matched the color of the forbidden items very good godiva said briskly now this she held up the dress it was thoroughly evident that it was not lack of dressmaking expertise that caused godiva to wear her hair instead she must have had much practice with her daughter electra climbed into it almost afraid to touch it the material was wonderfully light and frilly godiva made quick adjustments then had her step into white slippers unbraid your hair electra did so and fluffed it out finally she had to don a translucent veil and put a white flower in her hair she felt totally foolish now look in the mirror godiva said pushing her back toward it reluctantly electra went she nerved herself and looked before her stood a vision of absolute beauty a veritable princess of a bride the woman in the mirror was tall and slender yet full above and full below and her thinly veiled face was lovely it couldnt possibly be her yes i think it will do godiva said now we must hide this until the occasion and see what naldo has devised electra was sorry to return to her old grimy clothes but she realized that this was best it had been a wonderful vision but that was all it was soon she was her normal shabby self with a package under her arm she had never felt as negative about herself as she did now that was the trouble with a vision it made the reality seem so much worse at the surface naldo was ready i believe i have found the way he said prince dolph must marry electra electras heart jumped foolishly the day before she is eighteen and divorce her the next day so he can marry nada he concluded that will save her life without depriving dolph of his desire electra couldnt bring herself to comment he had indeed found a technicality that should save her lifebut what was the point without dolph she didnt want to live nada looked no more pleased you do want dolph to be happy naldo asked electra yes of course electra said immediately realizing how selfish she was being dolph would not be happy if she died because of him or if he did not marry nada you can take a potion to nullify your love for him after your life has been saved naldo said electra nodded she could hardly imagine not being in love with dolph but of course that would ease her own pain and you do want not to void the alliance between our kind and the human folk naldo prodded nada yes of course nada agreed her voice the echo of electras and you can take a love potion with him naldo said then when you marry him you will love him nada was silent in the same way as electra naldo had indeed come up with an answer and the fact that neither of them liked it was irrelevant the fact that it was as cunningly sinister a device as anyone could imagine was also irrelevant it would work so lets tell prince dolph naldo said setting off at a brisk slither nada followed less briskly electra started to walk but godiva held her back if you have to you can ask the good magician she reminded her he may have a better answer i hope so electra said but naldo is cunning enough to make a good goblin leader godiva continued i dont think we appreciate the ramifications of his ploy i think you should play it through electra sighed if it makes dolph happy she said you are a generous person thats a good quality in folk other than goblins it was a poor consolation but electra couldnt afford to start crying for now dolph was coming toward them smiling evidently he was thrilled with the idea electra knew she loved an idiot this time there were no challenges at the good magicians castle grey murphy was ready for electras question he thought ivy greeted them both with abandon we saw that siege on the magic mirror she said i was frightened but we couldnt interfere im glad it turned out all right gwenny and jenny seem to be doing nicely at the centaurs glade now for your question grey said oh we dont have a question electra said quickly just a favor wed like to get two vials from you one to nullify love and the other to make it two vials ivy asked blankly were following my brothers suggestion nada said electra will marry dolph first then divorce him and i will marry him the next day so shell live and dolph will be happy but we wont be happy unless we change our own emotions so we arent asking you for an answer grey shook his head bemused just as well that was the answer i was going to give you i dont like it much but i found it in the book of answers so it must be right ivy went to the storeroom and fetched the vials these will be our wedding gifts to each of you she said but she did not look happy make sure you use these correctly grey cautioned the nullifier is no problem it simply cancels the magic love such as the enchantment that caused you to love the prince who woke you electra without touching any other magic so it wont cause you to age abruptly or to be free of the need to marry dolph but theres no need for you to take it until the divorce anyway he turned to nada but you must be careful to be looking at dolph when you take this because if you see another man first you will love him instead this is not the type of potion found in some springs that causes instant ah activity it will just make you love him but it would be awkward if i understand nada said theres one other thing electra said somewhat diffidently i dont know how toto signal the stork i understand that the marriage wont count until we do that grey shook his head youre still technically underage the adult conspiracy but dolph doesnt know either electra said so how do we ivy spread her hands were not allowed to tell you but surely you will be able to figure it out when the time comes most folk do electra didnt argue but she had her doubts they held the wedding on the isle of view of course that was where electra had slept for her thousand years and where prince dolph had kissed her awake king dor had arranged to have a pavilion that could be enclosed at night erected on the beach so that they could consummate the marriage right here on the island of love in fact the isle had become popular since its rediscovery and not merely for young couples it was a beautiful region the centaurs had even sent an expedition at one point to dig in the sand to see if they could find the ruins of the sorceress tapis old residence that expedition had been headed by centaurs named archae and ology and they had surely known what they were doing but no one else did they had not bothered to consult with electra who had actually lived there and could have told them all about it but this was the nature of the folk of centaur isle electra took her package into a closed chamber to don her wedding dress she had not been allowed to see dolph this day to her dismay it was part of the ritual of the occasion nada was to be her maid of honor which meant that it was her job to see that electra did things the right way that was just as well because electra knew she would have botched it on her own she was horribly nervous and guilty and depressed and hopeful all at once she would have one day and night married to dolph and her sheer joy in the notion was countered by her knowledge that it would be awful for dolph she would do anything to make him happy but this was not what would do it this would only save her life so that he would not suffer guilt when he married nada i just had an idea nada said as she fussed with the dress getting things fastened and adjusted suppose we pour the love potion into dolphs drink so he takes it when hes with you and electra was obscenely tempted she cursed herself for mat no it wouldnt be right nada sighed i thought you would say that your life and happiness are on the line but you insist on doing whats right im sorry i know its stupid that wasnt the word i had in mind nada went on with her business briskly she set a fragrant red rose of love in electras unbraided hair and put the veil on electras face adjusting both finally it was done nada stood back to look at her its amazing she breathed its a nice dress electra agreed you are suddenly the loveliest woman of the day nada said electra laughed somewhat bitterly godiva said that wedding dresses have magic think what it will do for you tomorrow for they would let out the seams here and here and particularly there so it would fit i can only see what it does for you today lectra youve always had an inferiority complex about your appearance but believe me you are stunning now take my word when the others see you they will be astonished they will not be mocking you you are queen for the moment make the most of it the only one i want to impress is dolph electra said regretfully and he she shrugged this time his eyes will pop out of his head nada said then they both laughed picturing that it was time oh nada i think my knees are going to melt electra exclaimed and theres a butterfly in your stomach nada said how did you know open your mouth and stand still nada said surprised electra did so nada whacked her on the back the butterfly flew out of her mouth and fluttered around the room it was bright yellow of course nada opened a window and the butterfly flew out you feel better now she said electra nodded it was true now you must go out there and do it my brother will guide you down the aisle just go where youre taken and when someone asks you a question say i do then kiss dolph after that its just a matter of listening while folk congratulate him for marrying you yes its a real sacrifice for him now stop that nada opened the door and shoved her out electra was suddenly in front of an audience everyone was there king dor queen irene dolphs grandpa bink with his wife chameleon in her neutral stage king emeritus trent with queen emeritis iris magician murphy with sorceress vadne grey murphy with ivy the zombie master with millie the ghost and their grown children hiatus and lacuna cheiron chex and che centaur and with che was gwenny goblin and jenny elf and her cat sammy all four wearing spectacles and looking happy with the joke godiva goblin with gloha beside her grundy golem and rapunzel marrow bones the walking skeleton and grace ossein his female friend with the nice bones even draco dragon quietly smoking in a comer keeping his fire damped for he was dolphs friend too and any number of other folk electra had come to know in her six years in this time everyone was there looking at her electra felt herself reeling she knew she was about to faint then a firm hand caught her elbow no you dont beautiful bride it was nadas handsome brother naldo naga in full human form the one who had suggested this way through their impasse she wasnt sure whether to bless him or curse him for that but his presence was reassuring he surely knew what he was doing why are they staring electra asked faintly they hardly believe it is you naldo replied in a low voice you have been transformed electra no she said doubtfully but somehow she did feel prettier than ever before except for that moment before godivas mirror when she had first tried on the dress she knew it was illusion but it was a precious one she was thankful for the veil which at least hid her freckles then two trumpet swans stood in a garden of red green and bluebells the swans lifted their flaring bells and played and the flowers rang their colored bells in accompaniment electra realized that queen irene must have taken great care with those plants so that they would be tuned just right it was the wedding march it was the loveliest music she could imagine though it mocked her in fact this whole elaborate ceremony mocked her because everyone knew it was only for a day yet electra knew that it was her only possible chance for joy if she wasted this she would have nothing on the remaining days of her life so she straightened her back faced forward and let naldo guide her down the aisle while the beautiful music played there seemed to be a murmur of awe as she passed the various folk of the audience they were probably admiring the dress electra was really thankful that godiva had made it for her because otherwise she would have been ashamed to be here at all she had had no idea that it would be such a fancy occasion then she saw prince dolph standing at the far end of the aisle at the edge of the pavilion he was in a suit and his hair was combed both of which she knew made him really uncomfortable he was taller than he had been when they first met they had been the same height though she was two years older but recently he had grown and now he was taller than she was he was also halfway handsome he was facing her and absolutely still he seemed to be in a trance her heart went out to him she knew he didnt want to marry her even for a day and she was sorry to be putting him through this but it was the way it had to be beyond the end of the aisle was a huge hypnogourd angled so that its peephole faced away before it stood what appeared to be a big wooden horse that was the xanthly representation of the night stallion she realizedthe head of the realm of bad dreams she had encountered him briefly when she first woke from her long sleep after being kissed by the prince and she had been terrified but now she was outside the gourd where the horse of another color did not have power and she was more curious than afraid what was he doing here but further consideration gave her the answer prince dolph had a special relationship with the gourd he could go there when he chose and be well treated because the night stallion liked him naturally the stallion was here for dolphs wedding he was dolphs best manor best creature king nabob naga nadas father was here to perform the ceremony naturally he had an interest too naldo placed her beside dolph facing the king and stepped back but dolph remained fixed it was as if he had been turned to stone which was impossible because the gorgon magician humfreys wife was no longer in xanth and nobody was getting stoned turn him it was the stallion electra understood that he could speak normally when he chose when he was in the gourd but this wasnt the gourd so it was more mental like a dream voice it didnt matter as long as he could be heard so electra put her hands on dolph and gently turned him to face king nabob she had thought that she was the one freaked out by the ceremony but now she saw that dolph was worse than she and she had to help him get through it she was glad to do it she would have been glad to help him through the rest of his life if only he had wanted that king nabob was saying something electra tried to pay attention but she was worried about dolph who might as well have been a zombie for all the animation he had he must be utterly terrified she took his hand and squeezed it reassuringly this would soon enough be over suddenly she was jolted to awareness of her own situation king nabob had asked her a question she remembered what to do i do she said pronounce you man and wife kiss the bride dolph remained in his trance so electra lifted her veil away and kissed him then at last he began to recover his arms tightened around her and he kissed her back that was a relief she had been getting quite worried about him then they were in the reception and the folk were filing by congratulating dolph electra would have been disgusted but she realized that this was all show in an effort to make the man feel good about being caught by the woman there was a wonderful big wedding cake too dolph was supposed to cut it but he still seemed a bit vague so she guided his hand for him her own nervousness had disappeared in her effort to get dolph through she would have to warn nada about this so that she would be prepared to get him through tomorrow finally it was all done and they were alone in the pavilion for the night the others had all gone home or wherever wedding guests went the chamber was beautiful it had a monstrous feather bed and pillows and cushions all over and not much else it seemed that couples were not expected to be interested in other things on their wedding night dolph seemed vague what now he asked now we have to consummate the marriage electra said because it isnt final until we do and it has to be final because you cant divorce me until it is he gazed at her as if still not quite understanding oh electra began removing her dress because she didnt want such a lovely outfit to be damaged in any way she would never use it again but nada would and nada would surely be twice as beautiful in it as electra could ever dream of being maybe you should take off your clothes too she suggested you have such a nice suit you dont want to sleep in it uh yes i guess he looked helplessly at her lectra ii think i never saw you before she laughed perversely enjoying this of course you have dolph ive been with you every chance i could possibly get ever since you kissed me awake six years ago i mean when you came down that aisle i didnt recognize you you were beautiful its the dress thats its magic oh he started removing his clothing urn should wei mean mother says folk shouldnt be undressed together were married now dolph she said brightly though the truth was that she was having a qualm or two of her own was he supposed to be allowed to see her panties now she concluded that it was now or never because after tomorrow it would be nadas panties he would be seeing after six years of trying if electras own panties were to have any chance at all it had to be before nadas she nerved herself and drew the dress off over her head suddenly she was in her wonderful pink underclothing she hoped dolph would have the grace to be impressed she turned to face him dolph was now in his underpants he looked at her and went straight back into his trance he just froze in place not moving a muscle oh no he had freaked out she went to him determined that this night of all nights would not be ruined snap out of it dolph she said its all right were married ppp he stuttered panties she agreed firmly i know they arent the ones you really wanted to see but maybe theyll help prepare you for tomorrow but he remained entranced he just stood there staring oh mice she snapped this isnt getting us anywhere she picked up a pillow and threw it at him it bounced off the side of his head that registered dolph picked up a cushion and hurled it at her electra threw another back at him soon they were in the middle of the biggest wildest pillow fight ever for there were many pillows and cushions and there was no one to stop them electra had had some pillow fights with nada and ivy at castle roogna but these had been restrained because they hadnt wanted anyone to overhear now with dolph there was no restraint what delight she got hold of the biggest pillow she could find swung it around her head and whammed him on the rear oho he cried joyfully and got another to wham her with she fled screaming happily now dolph was acting normal and that was the way she liked him eeeek she screamed as she tripped over a cushion and fell headlong on the feather bed doiph whammed her directly on the panties while she was down she rolled over and caught his ankles and yanked making him fail too in a moment they were wrestling jamming cushions at each other and tickling ribs they clasped each other trying to get into better whamming position rolling over and over dolph got a knee over her body pinning her down and reached for a pillow so he could wham her on the head but she cheated she sat up quickly caught his head in her hands and kissed him she expected him to make an exclamation of disgust and go to wash off his mouth but he seemed to lose his strength and his eyes went vacant oh im sorry dolph she said i should have let you hit me with the pillow dont go into a trance again kkkkiss he said look i know im not nada and you dont like me doing that she said frustrated but dolph this is my only night toto be with you and i wish he caught her shoulders with his hands and hauled her face down to his i never kissed you before he said do it again you mean youve never did it she asked incredulously oh dolph you can have all you want she kissed him again and again and again ten times getting in as many as she could before he got disgusted but he didnt get disgusted oh lectra he breathed i never knew it would be like this with you he kissed her back you mean you like mushy stuff with me she asked afraid to be too thrilled for fear he didnt mean it i guess i do he said then they hugged and kissed and hugged again and kissed again the pillow fight forgotten but how come she asked when they paused for air she was gaining confidence it seemed he really did like this when i saw you in that dress i didnt even recognize you he said i thought it was some other girl and i got scared because i didnt know what had gone wrong you were so beautiful was i really she asked hardly believing that he could have seen her that way really they told me the dress would make a difference but lectra it made so much more than i knew then you came closer and i saw a freckle under your veil and i knew it was you and that was the end of the illusion she thought and you were still so lovely i could hardly stand it he said all this time ive been betrothed to you and i never realized how beautiful you could be electra was elated you mean thats why you were in a trance because of me yes i never truly saw you before lectra i was such a fool not until that dress and then i took off the dress she said with resignation and i saw your panties and youryouri dont know the word bra i guess i never saw that before i didnt even know it existed and you were still so beautiful and i knew it wasnt just the dress pink panties are special she agreed one thing she knew having discovered their magic she was not about to take them off she wanted him to go right on thinking she was beautiful even if it was only the magic of the panties and bra nada might not need such magic to be beautiful but electra did then you kissed me and oh dolph its kind of you to say you liked it she said bursting with appreciation to think i could have been kissing you all this time instead of trying to kiss nada when she didnt want to be he said you would have kissed me anytime but i you can catch up now she suggested yes he kissed her again and then she kissed him and then he kissed her electras fondest dream was coming true oh lectra i just didnt know but after a time they were sated even with that and just lay beside each other staring at the ceiling electra realized that there must be special magic associated with the entire wedding ceremony to make him love her for the moment and she hated to break the enchantment but there was business that had to be accomplished you know we have to consummate this marriage she said finally id rather just look at you and hug you and kiss you he said that too but still we have to signal the stork but how do we do it he asked plaintively i never found out neither did i for they both were still victims of the adult conspiracy being underage they had married because they had to but had to discover the secret themselves if it had been possible to wait one more day electra would have been old enough to learn it ironically i think it has something to do with mushy stuff he said but what i guess kissing isnt it she said because if it was it would have happened by now and i guess hugging isnt it he said and pillow fighting and looking at panties they considered everything they could think of but nothing seemed to be it the secret remained impenetrable they realized that they just werent going to figure it out dejected they hugged and kissed a few more times then got serious maybe i can sneak out and ask nada electra said shes staying in a cave on the south end of the island with naldo and king nabob because its easy for them in snake form i think shell tell me if i beg her promise her youll never tell she told dolph said awed by the prospect of violating the adult conspiracy they have to think we figured it out for ourselves right she said she got up then found that she didnt have anything to wear she refused to use the lovely wedding dress for this and her regular clothing was in the other chamber where she had changed but maybe the door wasnt locked she wrapped a sheet around her and dolph wrapped another around himself then feeling mutually guilty they sneaked quietly out looking like two ghosts no one was around which was fortunate because they were about as inconspicuous as the sun and moon on a dark night more so in fact because die moon seldom appeared on a dark night and the sun had never been known to do it they slunk around to the brides changing chamber the door was unlocked to their relief they went in and electra found her yellow shirt and blue jeans and put them on you had better go back to the bedroom she whispered to him if someone comes you can say go away and throw a pillow at the door right but he lingered would it be all right if i kissed you again but im in my blah clothing she protested but you arent blah he said her heart was catching fire oh dolph ill always love you she said and kissed him with as much passion as she dared risk without turning him off then they left the room dolph slunk back toward the bedroom to guard the fort and electra set off through the moonlight for the naga camp the beach was gorgeous in the night the sand was soft and bright and the waves of the sea lapped gently up to smooth out the disturbances of the day the moon was using the water as a mirror reflecting itself in every wave everything was lovely and everything loved its neighbors for this was the isle of view well now bride pro tern a voice exclaimed causing electra almost to jump out of her skin fortunately she was able to clap her hands to her bosom and hold herself down in time to save her skin she had thought she was alone who she gasped weve met im the demoness metria remember oh when it came to folk electra did not want to meet at the moment this demon was two places ahead of the very top of the list metria could take great pleasure in blabbing about this embarrassing mission to all and sundry and everyone else but it would be impossible to get rid of her merely by being hostile electra wasnt sure she was up to being hostile anyway right now even to metria because she was still glowing from dolphs kiss he had actually asked her when she had been in her blah clothing so she tried to be neutral i remember whats on your freckled mind the demoness asked dolph kissed me electra said i mean even in this clothing of course you still have your pink panties on underneath electras heart descended from the clouds that was true the magic of those panties was still operating had she changed back to her old ones it would have been different i guess so electra said dully where are you going what use to lie even if there were any point in it the demoness probably had already guessed we cant figure out how to signal the stork im going to ask nada oho so youre going to do that tonight maybe ill watch if you do we wont do it electra said defiantly but it was a bluff because they had to do it if they didnt the marriage would not be consummated and it wouldnt count and electra would die the moment she turned eighteen tomorrow well not right at the moment actually she would start the process with her heart bleeding and her body aging as the enchantment expired and she would age and weaken into oblivion within hours then dolph would be free to marry nada anyway but he would be unhappy because of having let another person die she did not want him to be unhappy and if you do it the demoness said relentlessly then dolph will be free to divorce you and marry nada tomorrow that must make you feel great at least hell be happy electra said shortly hes an idiot right metria taken aback by electras ready agreement faded out that was a relief she was now at the south end of the isle where would nada and naldo be then she spied them in the sea they were swimming in their natural forms laughing as they used their tails to splash water on each other nada electra called nadas head whipped around lectra what are you doing down here oh nada please it means my life tell me how to signal the stork nada and her brother were forging to the shore they hit the beach and slithered up to electra their serpent bodies moving in perfect parallel but lectra nada protested the adult conspiracy but im married now and i have to do it please tell her naldo told his sister and slithered back to the ocean nada had respect for her brother and of course he was the one who had suggested this twomarriage course so nada told her you mean thats all there is to it electra asked amazed and somewhat disappointed not much of a secret is it nada said you must promise not to tell any children because if they ever found out how little there is to know they would laugh the adults right out of the picture i can see that electra agreed then she hugged nada and set off up the beach now at last she knew how to do it now she could save her life and free dolph for tomorrow her feelings remained oddly mixed back at the bedroom she found dolph waiting anxiously i was afraid something had happened to you he said no its perfectly safe here now she said remember this is the isle of view isle of view too he said laughing she whammed him with a pillow he grabbed her and kissed her they got into another hugging and tickling fight it was great fun but finally they had to get down to business we have to embrace each other very closely electra said but theres a catch weve been hugging he said i dont mind that whats the catch no clothing you mean no undershirt no shorts for you no panties for me that was the awful thing about it without the fabulous pink panties she would lose what remained of her attractiveness but he seemed to handle this unfortunate aspect pretty well how do we know when the signal goes out we see the ellipsis the what it looks like three dots it always marks the signal to the stork nada told me so we just keep hugging until we see dots he asked having trouble with this notion thats it it seems too simple to work its magic what was the point in admitting that she hardly believed it either it had to work oh yes well wed better do it they took off their underclothing and hugged this close dolph asked closer he squeezed her so that her ribs hurt thats hard not close she gasped he eased up immediately im sorry want to hurt you id rather kiss you we can do that too we can gee thats great he kissed her and she kissed him they rolled over and hugged some more and kissed again and the more they did it the more fun it became the lack of clothing didnt seem to be hurting surprisingly dolph seemed to like her just as well this way soon they forgot about what they were supposed to be doing and just kissed and kissed and hugged and hugged and got closer and closer they were so close it was hard to tell where one of them left off and the other this close lectra i never began like ghosts or demons they seemed to be overlapping each other but it didnt bother them at al electra knew that eventually they would have to get back to the business of signaling the stork but that could wait this was too much fun she was loving dolph and he was loving her back she felt an electrical thrill and realized that she was losing control of her magic talent the current was leaking out mildly electrifying them she hoped that was harmless because she just couldnt stop kissing him then dolphs body got hot and his eyes stared glassily past her face dolph whats the matter she asked afraid he was going into another trance or that her current had tingled too strongly and hurt him i see them he gasped shuddering see what she asked really worried his whole body was shaking i see the dots electra turned her head and looked where he was looking there they were three dots floating just above their bodies the dots paused to get their orientation then lined up in a row and took off through the wall heading for the stork we did it electra exclaimed we got to the ellipsis she had elected to do it right and they had made it dolph kissed her relaxing then he lay back and closed his eyes oh nada ill always love you he whispered electra felt her wildest hopes collapsing her fond dreams dissipated like the smoke of the demoness her heart began to bleed chapter dolphs decision afterward dolph lay beside her his mind and heart were spinning today he had not only gotten married and learned how to signal the stork he had discovered electra three great shocks had come to his indifference he had seen her beautiful in her wedding dress as lovely a creature as he could imagine he had seen her in panties and that had excited him in another strange yet wonderful way he had kissed her and discovered to his astonishment that her kisses were just as thrilling as nadas were after that the idea of summoning the stork with her had become interesting instead of burdensome but that brought another burden he had never thought he would have to handle how was he going to do it oh nada ill always love you but as he pondered it the answer fell into place he knew it was right satisfied he fell asleep in the morning he woke and kissed electra but she was strangely subdued maybe all their pillow fighting had worn her out he considered telling her what he had in mind to do but feared she would object so he didnt she would learn soon enough anyway they dressed dolph had only his good suit so he got into that electra got into her marvelous panties and bra then into her dull everyday clothing leaving the wedding dress hanging in the closet it was true she had no further need of that though he was sorry not to see her in it again but even in her ordinary clothing she was a wonderful girl it had taken him six years to realize that but he would never forget it electra helped get his buttons in order and she combed his hair and dusted off his shoes youre quite handsome dolph she said sadly what was wrong lectra i she forced a smile its all right dolph i know what to do he concluded that he did not understand women wed better get breakfast then they went out to the main pavilion there were assorted fruits and pastries that someone had obligingly set out dolph picked up an eclair electra walked to another table where the two vials of potion had been put she picked up the null potion lectra wait he cried but he was too late she drank the vial in one gulp he went to her lectra i didnt mean for you to its all right dolph she said my love would only get in your way at this point but if you dont mind i think ill sit down i think i have a headache well of course then but she was already walking away baffled he chewed on his eclair each time he took a bite it made a little eeeek because that was its nature the demoness metria appeared well prince how are you feeling she asked he gazed after electra sort of confused he confessed really now youve had your one night stand youve had your fun and its time to run time to dump electra who still loves you and go for the one who doesnt love you why should you be confused but she just drank the nulllove potion he exclaimed i wouldve stopped her if id realized but why should she wait the demoness inquired the longer she went on loving you the more she hurt now shes cleared the way for you just as she promised fool that she is your teasing wont work metria i made my decision last night yes i heard when i snooped on your oval so did she snooped on my what your circle loop omission you mean those three dots right your ellipsis but heres something that should really delight you dolph you know that potion she drank yes i didnt want her to it didnt work at least not the way she thought it would but the good magicians potions are guaranteed oh it abolished the love spell on her metria said but thats immaterial why because her magic love faded out years ago it was replaced by natural love so the potion had no effect she still loves you dope but why didnt she tell me that i presume because she wants you to be happy and doesnt want to spoil it for you its a kind of generosity no demon would indulge in but human beings arent up to our standard thats great he exclaimed i thought we demons were callous you have real potential prince dolph ignored her for he spied naldo and nada slithering toward the pavilion from the beach with them was another person a human woman of middle age in a fulllength white robe her dark hair was neatly pinned back and her nose was straight he had never seen her before prince dolph naldo said please meet clio the muse of history who has come to record the details of this unusual event the muse of history but the muses stay on mount parnassus dolph said normally we do prince dolph clio said but this is an extraordinary situation so i came to make sure i had it right she entered the pavilion and took one of the empty seats writing busily on her notepad uh sure dolph said disgruntled he hadnt realized that this would be an occasion warranting recording in a history tome the muse had not attended the wedding yesterday after all how could this be more important than that i suppose we had better get on with this naldo said most of the others have chosen not to attend but the centaur family will be here and my father king nabob to handle the formalities he and nada went to the changing rooms where they evidently had sets of clothes stored soon they emerged in human form naldo glanced back the way they had come ah yes there they are now dolph looked in the sky were two centaurs flying side by side somehow supporting a third between them as they came in for their landing in the sand he saw how they did it a girl riding each big one was holding a hand of the little one che they sent up a waft of sand as they touched then the centaurs folded their wings the girls jumped off and all five of them and a small orange cat came in ah of them were wearing big spectacles apparently enjoying some family joke dolph turnedand there behind him was king nabob do it he said dolph realized that the stage was his urn lectra he called electra got up and came to him of course dolph she said she brought out a small handkerchief and used it to wipe his face he had a bit of eclair on it may i kiss you one last time no he told her gently beautiful metria murmured electra turned away she wanted him to be happy so she was not making any scene she was dutifully giving him up because she loved him so many aspects of her were coming into focus now that he should have seen long ago nada was not in a wedding dress but it didnt matter she was beautiful in ordinary clothing she took a step toward the table where the vial of love elixir was please no dolph told her ii have something to say and i hope you will understand of course dolph she said exactly as electra had he took a breath nerved himself and spoke as he had rehearsed it to himself in the night oh nada ill always love you but i cant marry you electras face turned to him expressionless nada blinked what oh for censoreds sake the demoness snapped fading out in a cloud of deep disgust dolph gulped ii am breaking our betrothal nada because the fault is mine the forfeit is mine the alliance between my folk and yours must be honored as it has been you maymay marry whom you choose i hope always to be your friend and the friend of your folk andbut may i kiss you one last time nada was recovering her wits which had scattered somewhat not till you tell me why she said as she caught the last one because i wont divorce lectra ii know her better now and she loves me and shes doing everything she can to make me happy no matter how it hurts her and shes really more my typei mean she likes pillow fights and things and shes closer to my age and youi guess i thought no one else could have what you have but lectra does and freckles too and i can drink that vial of love potion and look at her and its just better this way so youre dumping me nada said dolph scuffled his feet yes so thats the meaning of the answer king nabob said the good magician humfrey told us to marry what draco bringsand draco brought dolph and yesterday i married dolph to electra ill kiss to that nada said she took hold of dolph and gave him a kiss that reminded him of the past night oh yes he loved herbut not quite the same way as he had before he had learned some things and matured and he knew what he had to do when she let him go dolph turned and took a step toward the table with the vial then he paused turning to electra no i dont think ill need it lectra you cant kiss me one last time because there isnt going to be any last time not for as long as i can imagine but if now you want to get on with one of the middle times or if you want to be mad at me for being so stupid about you i do she exclaimed and stepped into him her face was tearstreaked but her electricity tingled the way it had during the night and her kiss practically sent him floating i love you as you are stupid she whispered tenderly ii guess thats it then dolph said when his head steadied somewhat i wei dont know what well do except to stay married thank all of you for being here youre welcome stupid king nabob said gruffly and slithered away seeming quite satisfied dolph looked around the pavilion dazed by the neatness of the resolution but when he saw clio talking to jenny elf he realized that of course it had worked out because the muse of history had been here to ensure that it was correctly plotted magician murphys curse on ches abduction could have messed up other aspects of xanth history so it had required personal intervention to get it all straight again clio is explaining to jenny about muses i suspect chex remarked the elf has been telling stories and her details have not been completely accurate also she is from another land and perhaps has not before been written into the books of the muses i can appreciate why clio decided to give this matter her personal attention so it hadnt been because of dolphs undivorce he was glad of that nada and i will return to mount etamin naldo said but we shall certainly be in touch somehow dolph had the impression that the naga prince wasnt much surprised by this outcome maybe he had a notion what it was like spending a wedding night with a woman he had been the one to suggest this marriage and divorce and he had wanted to spare his sister grief it seemed he had found a way if so dolph was grateful because it had led to his discovery of electra it wasnt that nada was in any way diminished in his eye or heart but that he did after all have an alternative that he knew would keep him happy wait a bit naldo cheiron centaur said he did not seem surprised either perhaps none of the menfolk at the wedding were surprised we would like you to foalsit our family this afternoon nada was surprised you mean che and gwenny and jenny and sammy che said the spectacles spectacle but why because we have to take prince dolph and princess electra to the far side of the moon cheiron explained what electra asked your honeymoon chex clarified its traditional i meanyou called meim no you married the prince naldo said you are the first princess in memory to wear blue jeans thats right dolph agreed realizing and when im king youlj be queen electra began to wobble naldo caught her and supported her before she fell princesses swoon rather easily he said especially when they are new you will have to stay very close to her and keep an eye on her for the next few days prince dolph for the next few weeks nada said but princesses mend readily with affection months chex said perhaps years her voice was authoritative in the adult manner but somehow dolph no longer found that annoying he would do his best dolph felt a bit dizzy himself before he knew it he was on cheirons back and electra was on chexs back and they became light indeed as the tails of the centaurs flicked them then they were in the air rising above the beach and pavilion headed for the moon wherever it might be at this hour of the day dolph looked down the children were already running to the waters edge to build sand castles around the cat who did not deign to move out of the way except for jenny elf she was standing by herself looking somewhere dolph knew it was toward her home the world of two moons he knew how she felt losing one thing she loved while finding happiness with another her story was not yet done he suspected but he knew that the muses were on top of the situation now so they would see her story through as they had seen his own through look electra cried pointing down dolph looked where she pointed beyond the central ridge of the isle of view were two unicorns a male and a female walking toward the place where jenny elf stood why i believe i know of those unicorns chex exclaimed they were in a dream we made che spoke of a dream he had with jenny cheiron said do you suppose with that talent of hers it could be chex agreed look clio is finishing the chapter electra said looking to where the muse was putting away her notepad shes finishing the whole volume cheiron said im afraid this honeymoon isnt going to be recorded dolph looked across at electra who smiled the muse of history was not putting their next weeks activity into her book it was just as well they were now after all pan of the dread adult conspiracy authors note this is not an ordinary xanth note do not read beyond this page if you are squeamish oh there are some credits for puns and notions but i discourage these now as xanth is not quite as punny as it once was as xanth enters its teensthis is number thirteenit is maturing developing new awarenesses touching on more serious matters and putting aside some of its childish things though with luck it will never grow up enough to join the adult conspiracy so fans who send in puns are unlikely to see them in xanth but some did appear in this novel arthur hoover fired off the and other caliber shells bob leonardi had the heart attack chris cha stuck me with the traffic jam margaret drennan got the stage fright chris swanson saw the see shells and got bogged down in the corkscrew swamp plant city crystal river horseshoe beach and cross city all of which strange places show up in mundane florida by a suspicious coincidence becky shoenberg and asia lynn drank the red whine shelly poirer unwrapped the cheesecloth and ramiro gonzalez jr interpreted the good magicians answer for the naga folk just barely in time i had already recorded the scene the wrong way when i received his letter i have regarded xanth as the least consequential of the writing i do its easy fun and popular but the critics revile it and its hard to find anybody who likes it except the readers and booksellers i have been told that i should never have done more than the first xanth novel and disgust abounds about this business of having as many as nine novels in a trilogy i guess i thought a trilogy was three multiplied by three so here i am with the fourth novel of the second xanth trilogy not having learned better but there have been some slight indications that there is more to xanth than meets the mundane eye one naturally expects great literature as defined by the critics to achieve permanence and be read by following generations while the junk is quickly forgotten but xanth is violating that rule too and refusing to be forgotten every xanth novel remains in print and continues selling well and xanthrelated things like calendars and statuettes and game books are appearing some day there could even be a movie if the motion picture companies ever catch on to what folk like also there seems to be some genuine human benefit deriving from xanth so if literature were to be defined not by the critics but by permanence and relevance to the interests of real people xanth might score better than it has for example there has been more than one person who read xanth to alleviate the discomfort of illness including chemotherapy treatments there was a girl who was taken into a barn attacked with a hammer and raped she didnt dare tell but the experience shattered her then someone showed her ogre ogre which addresses a similar problem and where the girl finds comfort at last with an ogre this mundane girl found an ogre and her life mended and she wrote to tell me about it there was the girl who survived an auto accident but lost her ability to remember things she was a xanth reader and i attended her birthday party and i think it helped her to remember there are the mothers who have written to tell me that their children had no interest in reading until introduced to xanth there are the teachers who have told me similar things i suspect that literacy is the most important skill for todays person learning to read is vital and its getting harder to get folk to read this sort of thing is causing me to reconsider the value of xanth it may be more than just passing entertainment and jennyyes there is a real girl jenny gildwarg twelve years old whose ordinary life abruptly became extraordinary but not in a nice way jenny has a separate story which for our purpose begins dismember jenny is much like jenny elf in the novel only her ears are round and her hands have five fingers on this day she was walking home from school with several of her friends she stopped at an intersection looked both ways and waited for a car to pass the car slowed and stopped and the driver motioned to the children to cross they did so another car was approaching the intersection but the driver was intoxicated and impatient he passed the stopped car and took off he struck jenny and hurled her a fair distance that was almost the end of her life a driver behind that one witnessed the accident radioed for assistance and ran out to help the police and ambulance arrived promptly they arrested the drunk driver who was belligerent and had to be handcuffed they administered first aid to jenny and made ready to rush her to the hospital the mother of one of the other children saw the whole thing and came to tell jennys folks a family friend went to the scene and identified her for the police and ambulance crew he came home to report that there was a lot of blood but that she was still breathing i am trying to restrain myself but its difficult to stifle my attitude about drunk driving that man was convicted on all counts including reckless driving and nonappearance he paid court costs and got a suspended sentence chances are that by the time this sees print that driver will have forgotten this episode with luck he may already have notched another pedestrian on his bumper who can measure the grief brought to innocents because this soused burrosphincter couldnt wait his turn jennys folks scrambled to get to the hospital where they learned that jenny was in critical condition and comatose the doctors worked on her for several hours to get her stabilized then she was flown by helicopter to the emergency ward of another hospital where they worked on her for another several hours and transferred her to a childrens hospital at this point jennys folks were told that she would probably die she had only a per cent chance of survival her father had a heart attack which he survived her mother hung grimly on helped by the support of good friends and family but months later she was suffering things like bleeding ulcers and staying out of the hospital herself more by defiance than sense jenny made it through the critical period of seventytwo hours after those three days they increased her chances to per cent but not much was said about the state of her brain the specter that can haunt such cases is brain damage which the surgeons cant repair physically she was in a sorry state her lovely waistlength hair had been cut short and half her head shaved perhaps it was just as well that she remained unconscious for her awakening would have been a horror at this stage about three weeks later she was transferred to another hospital still in a coma she remained there six more weeks barely responsive to outside stimuli occasionally she would wiggle her big right toe lift her head a little and track with her eyes on request her mother showed her pictures of her catsjenny rescued every homeless cat she encountered and there were eleven cats at her homeand read notes from her friends to her jennys eyes widened and she sighed heavily this suggested that her nervous system was there and that her mind remained but that was all they had tried to tell her what had happened and perhaps then she had spoken her only word if that was the meaning of the sound she made no she did not cooperate with therapists it was as if she was deep in a pit and only the most evocative things could reach her at all and then only briefly she did not seem to want to live what was the point with her body paralyzed weeks passed without change at last jennys mother grasping at straws wrote to me she thought that maybe a letter from the author of xanth would strike some spark and motivate jenny to come out of the coma jenny had read the first ten xanth novels the accident had cut her off from the eleventh published not long before the things of xanth were common in jennys house the spelling bee was as balky as ever forcing them to use the mundane dictionary agent orange sometimes wilted their plants the gap chasm had an extension past their backyard the forget spell frequently caused things like homework and room tidying to be forgotten the monster under the bed made things disappear and the hypnogourdtv tended to trap her father after his hard days work so maybe xanth would have the magic needed to wake jenny from her long sleep jennys mother happened to know a novelist of the genre andrea alton whose novel demon of undoing featured civilized catlike creatures she asked andrea about this business of writing to me and andrea suggested that she ask me to name a character of xanth after jenny as this could be done without reference to jennys real nature and might encourage jenny to take notice at worst i would say no as it happened when i received the letter in feblueberry i was about three weeks from starting this novel i knew how it would begin and how it would end and i knew about che centaur needing help but much of the rest was inchoate i would figure it out when i got there so i wrote a letter to jenny for her mother to read to her and i told her of the novel and offered to put in a character with her name would she prefer an elf girl or an ogre girl i asked whether she liked elfquest the series of novels in comic formmany of my younger readers doand mentioned mat her bed monster had gotten lonely at home without her so had moved in under her hospital bed but he was in danger there of having a nurse give him a loathsome shot in the rump monsters dont much like shots for some reason i really had my doubts i hoped my letter would help for i have raised two daughters and by an odd coincidence each of them was once twelve years old and to me there is nothing more precious than a little girl but by the time my letter could reach her jenny would be almost three months in her coma and that was no positive sign so i schooled myself not to hope too much like electra with prince dolph i should say that i am not eager for a deluge of requests for characters named after readers this was a special situation i would rather have every young reader live safely and never suffer any pain or even a low grade at school one character can be named after a reader but i have half a million readers so if youre not in a coma dont ask jennys mother read my letter to her it brought a great widening of jennys eyes and her first smile since the accident she became responsive she would squeeze someones hand on command they used flash cards saying yes and no and jennys eyes would track to one or the other in answer to questions by such means her mother ascertained that jenny definitely preferred to have an elf girl not an ogre girl big surprise i was teasing her of course after that jenny cooperated with the therapists and each week saw improvement she remained largely paralyzed and was in a body brace and unable to move her left side or to talk she could not close her mouth a smile was about the limit of what she could do she had to have nerve blocks to free up her limbs she was we suspect in pain at times but jenny is a cheerful girl and her smiles became more frequent and then her laughs and then she managed to say the first word we are sure of hi its hard to speak when your face is paralyzed so she had miles to go and how far she would get no one could say but now she was in motion she was climbing out of the pit an inch at a time i wrote again and again on a weekly basis jenny became a major correspondent though she could not answer her mother reported on jennys reactions to my letters and interpreted the blinking of eyes could be a signal and a kind of game of twenty questions could run down what jenny had in mind she was so responsive now that it was easy to forget that she remained mostly paralyzed i learned that she is a vegetarian like me and i saw the drawings she had made before the accident for her story about the flowers and the blind girl yes that was jennys story that jenny elf told this is my listing of credit for that as i write this they are shopping for a wheelchair looking forward to the time when jenny can come home i joked about how she would zoom down the halls setting the nurses spinning and be known as spinning jenny i will if you wish make a report in the next xanth novel note about jennys progress as for jenny elf we dont yet know about her either she may remain in xanth or she may return to the world of two moons only the muses know for sure and they dont seem too certain any of you who havent visited that world may do so now to check it out for her elfquest graphic novels are in your bookstores for now take my word they arent junk any more than xanth is meanwhile back in mundania what would i do with that drunk driver if i ruled the universe id sentence him to three months in a coma and a possible lifetime crippled it is past time to start taking action with teeth in it to stop such brutal idiocy for this was no isolated event every day other drunk drivers are doing this to other innocent children why should they stop since punishment is a joke so i got into the novel and jenny elf took form as a cross between jenny of mundania and a visitor from elfquest i wrote to richard and wendy pini who record elfquest and they gave me permission to make jenny an elfquest elf rather than a xanth elf in fact they also got in touch with the original jenny sending her things of their realm i understand that at one point jenny annoyed by the rock music of a boy in the ward turned up her elfquest tape to drown it out should we call that spar wars so it was that an elfquest elf came to xanth making this novel unique the rest you know after i completed the novel and the note back in mayhem something came up i discovered that jenny lived close to a science fiction convention that was scheduled for noremember so i told her folks about it and said that if it turned out to be possible for jenny to attend i would go too i hate to travel but this was special and anyway it seemed unlikely that the hospital would let her go that soon surprise it could be arranged the hospital gave jenny a oneday pass and she came with two therapists and her family thus it was that i attended scicon in virginia and met jenny who was now thirteen she was still unable to move well or to talk and could not remain sitting in her wheelchair for long but i took her hand and talked to her intensely for about half an hour tuning out the rest of the world the essence of what i said to her was that maybe she had decided to wake from her coma on her own then learned of my first letter and said how nice whats for lunch at that point she began to smile we both knew it hadnt been that way then i got serious but maybe you were walking through the valley of the shadow of death and you faced resolutely toward that other world until my hand caught your hand and held you and turned you back to face this world i explained how had been just the final person in a long chain of her parents and friends reaching for her and so i had been able to stretch the last bit of the way and finally catch her hand but i hoped that what i had brought her back to was more than paralysis this convention was part of what the world offered for her then i introduced her to another person who had come richard pini of etfquest at this point she broke into a big smile richard gave her wendy pinis painting of jenny elf looking just like her only with pointed ears they will make a graphicthat is picturesversion of this novel published more or less concurrently so those of you who prefer exciting pictures to dull print may throw away this book and go for that one jenny got to tour the art show at the convention in her pretty purple gown and matching shoes in her wheelchair art guest of honor ron lindahn who does the xanth calendars showed his paintings personally for her the folk of the convention came up to meet her some in costumes ignoring richard and me we were happy to have it that way it was jennys hour but that was it jenny was very tired she had to return to her room and lie down and then she was taken back to the hospital i visited her there the next day and read a story to her and her similarly paralyzed friend kathy next day i returned to florida with a red artificial rose from jennys corsage i still have that rose
