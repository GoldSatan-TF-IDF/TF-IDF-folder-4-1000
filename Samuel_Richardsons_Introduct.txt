samuel richardsons introduction to pamela introduction since most publishers of pamela have preferred to print richardsons table of contents from the sixth edition his complete introduction his preface together with letters to the editor and comments is missing even from some of our best collections occasionally one finds the preface and the first two letters but only four publishers since richardson have attempted to reprint the full introduction harrison london who omits the first letter and cooke london both follow richardsons eighth edition ballantyne edinburgh uses the fourth the shakespeare head oxford the third and even these printings leave one dissatisfied the shakespeare head gives the fullest text but naturally omits richardsons revisions cooke gives the introduction in its final form but one misses the full text which accompanied the book in its heyday and rarely are both cooke and shakespeare head to be found in the same library richardsons complete introduction gains importance when we note that he retained and revised it through seven of his eight editions of pamela to see the text and follow richardsons changes is to get an unusually intimate view of his attitude toward his book of his concessions and tenacities of richardson the anonymous editor who could not keep the authors laurels completely under his hat this present reprint therefore intends to give the fullest text of richardsons introduction and to indicate his changes the text is that of the second edition reproduced with permission of the huntington library brackets added to this lithoprint show richardsons principal corrections th means that the bracketed lines were deleted in the fourth and all subsequent editions th change means that in the fourth and subsequent editions the bracketed lines were changed to the reading listed here as number six several changes within deleted passages are discussed but not marked on the text richardsons own editions of pamela appeared as follows november february march may september may october three months after richardsons death the first edition prints richardsons preface and two complimentary letters to these the introduction to this second edition adds twentyfour pages of letters and comment and the third edition makes no changes in the introduction whatsoever even retaining this second edition the fourth makes some changes and the fifth considerably more the sixth ahandsome quarto in a row of duodecimos abandons the introductory letters the seventh follows the fifth and the eight makes some major cuts notwithstanding richardsons freedom in editing these letters and fieldings insinuation in shamela that they were richardsons own copy he wrote none of them jean baptiste de freval afrenchman living in london for whom richardson was printing a book wrote the first the second probably came from william webster clergyman and editor of the weekly miscellany wherein the letter had appeared as an advertisement the first public reference to pamela on october webster owed an obligation eventually forgiven adebt of l to my most worthy friend mr richardson the printer and richardson reprints the letter using websters phrase to my worthy friend the editor of pamela these first two letters de frevals and websters respond to an authors request for criticism the rest new with the second edition are unsolicited all of these are the work of aaron hill excepting only the anonymous letter which richardson summarizes beginning on page xxi sent to richardson in care of charles rivington copublisher of pamela on november the first gratuitous response to richardsons book to advertisements in the daily gazeteer november and the london eveningpost december richardson added a note an anonymous letter relating to this piece is come to the editors hand who takes this opportunity having no better most heartily to thank the gentleman for his candid and judicious observations and to beg favour of a further correspondence with him under what restrictions he pleases instruction and not curiosity being sincerely the motive for this request if the gentleman had answered the introduction to pamela would perhaps have been shorter some of hills acerbity may have been absorbed from richardson hurt by the writers silence the doubleentendres mentioned on page xxii are given in the gentlemans unpublished letter in the forster collection in the victoria and albert museum jokes are often more severe and do more mischief than more solid objects to obviate some why not omit p betwixt fear and delight and p i made shift to eat a bit of etc but i had no appetite to any thing else in the light of this letter the second edition of pamela attests a curious fact while hill pontificates in the introduction about ignoring such vulgarity of mind richardson has tiptoed back to volume two and changed the questioned passages from the second edition forward pamela trembles during her wedding not betwixt fear and delight but betwixt fear and joy and although richardson leaves pamela her shift on page he changes her remark about appetite imade shift to get down a bit of applepie and a little custard but that was all by omitting the specific objections from his summary richardson managed at one stroke to save his righteousness in the introduction and his face in the text hills authorship of the introductory letters is easily established anna laetitia barbauld includes hills signature with a reduced version of the one which here begins on page xvi december thereafter richardsons italicized remarks two of them added in later editions provide the links abstract of a second letter from the same gentleman etc with wonderful indirection richardson had sent a copy of pamela to hills daughters along with some other books and as hill writes mallet without the smallest hint that it was his and with a grave apology as for a trifle of too light a species hill thanked richardson in the letter of december hill asks who on earth the author might be hinting the while by returning richardsons own phrase that he understands that it is richardson himself this trifle for such idare answer for the author his modesty misguides him to think it though hill tells mallet that richardson was very loth along time to confess it richardson did not dally long by december he has confirmed hills guess on that date hill writes acquainted with the amiable goodness of your heart ican foresee the pleasure it will give you to have given another pleasure and you heap it on me in the noblest manner by the joy you make me feel at finding pamelas incomparable author is the person i not only hopd to hear was so but whom i should have been quite grievd disturbd and mortified not to have really foundso yet iconfess till i began to read i had not the least notion of it but i presently took notice that whatever pamela thought said or did was all transfusion of your own fine spirit and as i know not if there lives another writer who could furnish her with such a sapid sweetness as she fills the table with icould not therefor chuse but name you to my hope as moulder of this maiden model mrs barbauld omits this letter but prints another from hill to richardson not to be found now in the forster collection bearing the same date december i ff this letter furnishes the delightful story so admirably related beginning on page xxxi from the second paragraph on we have a lively little boy in the family the pamela text is substantially the same as barbaulds but the first paragraph richardson has contrived to suit his editorial fiction the delightful story so gratified mr richardson that he sent lively little harry campbell the dear amiable boy two books an event almost enough to finish him out burst a hundred o lords in a torrent of voice rendered hoarse and half choaked by his passions he clasped his trembling fingers together and his hands were strained hard and held writhing his elbows were extended to the height of his shoulders and his eyes all inflamed with delight turned incessantly round from one side and one friend to the other scattering his triumphant ideas among us his fairyface ears and all was flushed as red as his lips and his flying feet told his joy to the floor in a wild and stamping impatience of gratitude the only other part of the introduction to pamela elsewhere in print is the concluding poem this too is hills printed in the weekly miscellany february along with his december letter and collected with hills works iii this is the poem it would seem of which hill boasts that he has given pamela ashort e as richardson intended asserting that mr pope has taught half the women in england to pronounce it wrong pope in his epistle to miss blount line had made the e long the gods to curse pamela with her prayers gave the gilt coach and dappled flanders mares the shining robes rich jewels beds of state and to complete her bliss a fool for mate hills lines are somewhat less successful he dedicated them to the unknown author of pamela two months after richardson had confessed his authorship richardson changes one line in the poem in hills works it reads whence public wealth derives its vital course richardson amore modern man perhaps reads public health his emendation however improves hills metaphor concerning a blaze which is a pilot pointing out the source of public wealth which is drunk to prevent gangrene from blackening to the bone further reflection led richardson a year later to change vital to moral throughout the letters in his introduction richardson made changes all largely stylistic that richardson removed the letters from the front of his book in response to criticism as cross and others have asserted is not quite accurate he removed them from the sixth edition but put them back in the seventh and eighth and his alterations show him giving in to criticism only by inches if indeed his changes to his introduction are not more simply those of any author trimming and with richardson ever so little his early extravagances richardsons stubbornness here suggests other reasons for his substituting a table of contents for his introduction in the sixth edition to print both would have been too prolix even for richardson and it seems that the table of contents detailing the entire action together with the change to big quarto volumes are richardsons efforts to authenticate pamela in the face of chandlers and kellys unauthorized sequel pamelas conduct in high life printed to complete the two duodecimo volumes of richardsons original story richardsons sixth edition is the first in which his own additional two volumes written to forestall chandler and kelly are included with the first two as a complete fourvolume unit twelve years later in his true pamela established he reverted to his introductory letters hills death in may also have moved richardson to restore the introduction which was chiefly hills work recalling both his friend and pamelas greener days in the eighth edition at the end of his life richardson still kept the introductory letters though with some final constrictions richardson makes the first changes to his introduction in the fourth edition excepting minor clarifications all deal with hills answer to the anonymous gentleman the attitude toward this gentleman has softened the rashest of all his advices becomes merely the least weighd of his judgments and his blindness becomes oversight he is no longer pedantic he no longer makes vulgar allusions but only fears that they might be made in the fifth edition richardson seems chiefly concerned with redundancy but he also diminishes some of the praise in deference to the gentleman it would seem richardson deletes his flattery of hill on pages xxix and xxxi and some of the most beautiful letters that have been written in any language become simply letters perhaps richardsons conscience was bothering him perhaps he had heard from his anonymous correspondent after all he now identifies the gentlemans remarks as coming in a letter from the country unless pure fancy this is new information for the letter now in the forster collection in no way indicates its place of origin richardsons seeking of the gentleman through advertisement in london newspapers suggests that he thought of his correspondent as a city man in the fifth edition one detects a certain discomfort with the false editorship and the praise richardson permits himself with it his direct response to criticism is slight he deletes from low to high life since pamelas conduct in high life had appeared four months previous from the passages which fielding ridicules in shamela he drops no more than wonderful from before author of pamela in the passage introducing the new letters page xv richardson now apologizes the author he implies wanted the praises omitted but much to his sorrow the editor could not disentangle them from the critical remarks the authors modesty however remains in the realm of possibility only where selfpraise is strong a vague uneasiness sets richardson to work on the style unable to locate the center of his trouble on pagev strongly interest them in the edifying story becomes attach their regard to the story but this is barely to nibble at his phrase so probable so natural so lively just preceding which perished in the eighth edition similarly he attempts to cure the last paragraph of his preface through minor incisions he drops the parenthesis about the great variety of entertaining incidents and he diminishes these engaging scenes to it but the paragraph is still too much for him in the eighth edition he cuts all but the outlines of his editorauthor pretext the seventh edition does no more than sharpen punctuation the eighth in general continues to trim little excesses though the loss is scarcely noticeable richardson further reduces hills praise of the book and his own praise of hill feeling his way toward a detached view of his book looking to posterity since pamela has fulfilled the prediction of foreign renown made by his french friend de freval richardson now omits de frevals obliging treachery to the literature of france page ix since the delightful story is anecdotal and not critical it too disappears other changes simply testify an authors attention to his style uninhibited by the fact that the style is indeed not his he deletes a senseless remark about masculine flexibility he removes nature from the foundation of the narrative title page and page v though left on page viii probably to avoid implying that nature is in the foundation only from the first richardsons disguise as editor is little more than halfhearted its purpose was at first partly commercial permitting advertising in the preface four ladies urged him on so richardson confesses he struck a bold stroke in the preface having the umbrage of the editors character to screen him self behind but the author nevertheless threw rather distinct shadows on the screen his preface speaks of the book altogether as a work of fiction the editor has set forth social duties he has painted vice and virtue drawn characters raised taught effected and embellished with a great variety of entertaining incidents yet suddenly the editor also seems to have done nothing more than to have perused these engaging scenes written a preface and gotten them into print richardson cannot quite give the imaginary author substance these sheets have accomplished all the wonders claimed for them not the author of these sheets richardson speaks not of the author but of an author of authors in general the implication hangs over the preface and is strengthened by de frevals letter that the editor himself has worked up the story from the barest details of real life which is of course what richardson did de freval continues to speak of the work entirely as of creative writing the epistolary style is aptly devised the book will become a pattern for this kind of fiction it is contrived for readers of all tastes but quite in contradiction de freval also implies that the editor has shown him the authors original work together with certain editorial changes necessary to protect the real pamela and mrb the second letter presumably websters toys with the suggestion that a young woman actually wrote the letters which richardson edits let us have pamela as pamela wrote it but this is only in play although the writer disparages novels the note which heads his letter when it first appeared in the weekly miscellany speaks of the author of pamela who has written an english novel and his opening remarks are clearly those of a critic speaking of fiction hills first letter goes solidly for the conclusion that an author aman of genius wrote the book the heading to the editor of pamela is richardsons only attempt to bring hills letter into his already wavering line in the fifth edition however he introduces this letter with his only straight statement that an author distinct from the editor is involved an author who begged the editor not to include flattery to the end of his days richardson continued to sit under the editorial shade sir charles grandison was published by the editor of pamela and clarissa enjoying the sunshine of his authorship his introduction to pamela and the care he took with it suggest more succinctly than anything else richardsons flirtation with his adorers which is not at all unlike

changes here and writes with the more assurance of success as an editor may be allowed to judge with more impartiality than is often to be found in an author but difficulties having arisen from different opinions some applauding the very things that others found fault with we have found it necessary to insert the praises in the following letters with the critical remarks because the writer has so kindly mixd them that they cannot be disjoind however earnestly the author of the piece desired it without obscuring and indeed defacing all the spirit of the reasoning the following objections to some passages in pamela were made by an anonymous gentleman in a letter from the country the ingenious writer of the two preceding letters answers these good natured objections as follows fourth least weighd fifth least considered it seems plain to me that this gentleman however laudable his intention may be on the whole discerns not an elegance in the occasions this gentleman in his postscript is pleasd to discover for jokes ieither find not that he has any signification at all or causelessly as i think apprehends that such coarsetasted allusions to loose lowlife idioms may be made that not to understand what is meant by them is both the cleanliest and prudentest way of confuting them in the mind of the reader an honesty so sincere and unguarded deleted fifth edition replaced in eighth with in a third letter the same benevolent gentleman writes as follows pamela or virtue rewarded in a series of familiar letters from a beautiful young damsel to her parents now first published in order to cultivate the principles of virtue and religion in the minds of the youth of both sexes a narrative which has its foundation in truth del th and nature and at the same time that it agreeably entertains by a variety of curious and affecting incidents is intirely divested of all those images which in too many pieces calculated for amusement only tend to inflame the minds

religion and morality in so easy and agreeable a manner as shall render them equally delightful and profitable del th to the younger class of readers as well as worthy of the attention of persons of maturer years and understandings if to set forth in the most exemplary lights the parental the filial and the social duties del th and that from low to high life if to paint vice in its proper colours to make it deservedly odious and to set virtue in its own amiable light to make it truly lovely if to draw characters justly and to support them equally if to raise a distress from natural causes and to excite compassion from proper motives if to teach the man of fortune how to use it the man of passion how to subdue it and the man of intrigue how gracefully and with honour to himself to reclaim

good ends del th in so probable so natural so lively a manner as shall engage the passions of every sensible reader and strongly interest them in the edifying story and all without raising a single idea throughout the whole that shall shock the exactest purity even in those tender instances where the exactest purity would be most apprehensive if these del th embellished with a great variety of entertaining incidents be laudable or worthy recommendations of any work the editor of the following letters which have their foundation in truth del th and nature ventures to assert that all these desirable ends are obtained th change in these sheets and as he is therefore confident of the favourable reception which he boldly bespeaks for this little work he thinks any further preface or apology for it unnecessary and the rather for two reasons st because he can appeal from his own passions which have been uncommonly moved in perusing these engaging scenes to the passions of every one who shall read them with the least attention and in the next place because an editor may reasonably be supposed to judge with an impartiality which is rarely to be met with in an author towards his own works the editor to the editor of the piece intitled pamela or virtue rewarded dear sir i have had inexpressible pleasure in the perusal of your pamela it intirely answers the character you give of it in your preface nor have you said one word too much in commendation of a piece that has advantages and excellencies peculiar to itself for besides the beautiful simplicity of the style and a happy propriety and clearness of expression the letters being written under the immediate impression of every circumstance which occasioned them and that to those who had a right to know the fair writers most secret thoughts the several passions of the mind must of course be more affectingly described and nature may be traced in her undisguised inclinations with much more propriety and exactness than can possibly be found in a detail of actions long past which are never recollected with the same affections hopes and dreads with which they were felt when they occurred this little book will infallibly be looked upon as the hitherto muchwanted standard or pattern for this kind of writing for it abounds with lively images and pictures with incidents natural surprising and perfectly adapted to the story with circumstances interesting to persons in common life as well as to those in exalted stations the greatest regard is every where paid in it to decency and to every duty of life there is a constant fitness of the style to the persons and characters described pleasure and instruction here always go hand in hand vice and virtue are set in constant opposition and religion everywhere inculcated in its native beauty and chearful amiableness not dressed up in stiff melancholy or gloomy forms on one hand nor yet on the other debased below its due dignity and noble requisites in compliment to a too fashionable but depraved taste and this i will boldly say that if its numerous beauties are added to its excellent tendency it will be found worthy a place not only in all families especially such as have in them young persons of either sex but in the collections of the most curious and polite readers for as it borrows none of its excellencies from the romantic flights of unnatural fancy its being founded in truth and nature and built upon experience will be a lasting recommendation to the discerning and judicious while the agreeable variety of occurrences and characters in which it abounds will not fail to engage the attention of the gay and more sprightly readers the moral reflections and uses to be drawn from the several parts of this admirable history are so happily deduced from a croud of different events and characters in the conclusion of the work that i shall say the less on that head but i think the hints you have given me should also prefatorily be given to the publick viz that it will appear from several things mentioned in the letters that the story must have happened within these thirty years past that you have been obliged to vary some of the names of persons places c and to disguise a few of the circumstances in order to avoid giving offence to some persons who would not chuse to be pointed out too plainly in it tho they would be glad it may do the good so laudably intended by the publication and as you have in confidence submitted to my opinion some of those variations iam much pleased that you have so managed the matter as to make no alteration in the facts and at the same time have avoided the digressive prolixity too frequently used on such occasions little book charming pamela face the world and never doubt of finding friends and admirers not only in thine own country but far from home del th where thou mayst give an example of purity to the writers of a neighbouring nation which now shall have an opportunity to receive english bullion in exchange for its own dross which has so long passed current among us in pieces abounding with all the levities of its volatile inhabitants the reigning depravity of the times has yet left virtue many votaries of their protection you need not despair may every headstrong libertine whose hands you reach be reclaimed and every tempted virgin who reads you imitate the virtue and meet the reward of the highmeriting tho lowdescended pamela iam sir your most obedient and faithful servant j b d f to my worthy friend the editor of pamela sir i return the manuscript of pamela by the bearer which i have read with a great deal of pleasure it is written with that spirit of truth and agreeable simplicity which tho much wanted is seldom found in those pieces which are calculated for the entertainment and instruction of the publick it carries conviction in every part of it and the incidents are so natural and interesting that i have gone handinhand and sympathizd with the pretty heroine in all her sufferings and been extremely anxious for her safety under the apprehensions of the bad consequences which i expected every page would ensue from the laudable resistance she made ihave interested myself in all her schemes of escape been alternately pleasd and angry with her in her restraint pleasd with the little machinations and contrivances she set on foot for her release and angry for suffering her fears to defeat them always lamenting with a most sensible concern the miscarriages of her hopes and projects in short the whole is so affecting that there is no reading it without uncommon concern and emotion thus far only as to the entertainment it gives as to instruction and morality the piece is full of both it shews virtue in the strongest light and renders the practice of it amiable and lovely the beautiful sufferer keeps it ever in her view without the least ostentation or pride she has it so strongly implanted in her that thro the whole course of her sufferings she does not so much as hesitate once whether she shall sacrifice it to liberty and ambition or not but as if there were no other way to free and save herself carries on a determind purpose to persevere in her innocence and wade with it throughout all difficulties and temptations or perish under them del th it is an astonishing matter and well worth our most serious consideration that a young beautiful girl in the low scene of life and circumstance in which fortune placed her without the advantage of a friend capable to relieve and protect her or any other education than what occurrd to her from her own observation and little reading in the course of her attendance on her excellent mistress and benefactress could after having a taste of ease and plenty in a higher sphere of life than what she was born and first brought up in resolve to return to her primitive poverty rather than give up her innocence isay it is surprising that a young person so circumstanced could in contempt of profferd grandeur on the one side and in defiance of penury on the other so happily and prudently conduct herself thro such a series of perplexities and troubles and withstand the alluring baits and almost irresistible offers of a fine gentleman so universally admired and esteemed for the agreeableness of his person and good qualities among all his acquaintance defeat all his measures with so much address and oblige him at last to give over his vain pursuit and sacrifice his pride and ambition to virtue and become the protector of that innocence which he so long and so indefatigably labourd to supplant and all this without ever having entertaind the least previous design or thought for that purpose no art used to inflame him no coquetry practised to tempt or intice him and no prudery or affectation to tamper with his passions but on the contrary artless and unpractised in the wiles of the world all her endeavours and even all her wishes tended only to render herself as unamiable as she could in his eyes tho at the same time she is so far from having any aversion to his person that she seems rather prepossessd in his favour and admires his excellencies whilst she condemns his passion for her aglorious instance of selfdenial thus her very repulses became attractions the more she resisted the more she charmd and the very means she used to guard her virtue the more endangerd it by inflaming his passions till at last by perseverance and a brave and resolute defence the besieged not only obtaind a glorious victory over the besieger but took him prisoner too i am charmed with the beautiful reflections she makes in the course of her distresses her soliloquies and little reasonings with herself are exceeding pretty and entertaining she pours out all her soul in them before her parents without disguise so that one may judge of nay almost see the inmost recesses of her mind apure clear fountain of truth and innocence amagazine of virtue and unblemishd thoughts i cant conceive why you should hesitate a moment as to the publication of this very natural and uncommon piece icould wish to see it out in its own native simplicity which will affect and please the reader beyond all the strokes of oratory in the world for those will but spoil it and should you permit such a murdering hand to be laid upon it to gloss and tinge it over with superfluous and needless decorations which like too much drapery in sculpture and statuary will but encumber it it may disguise the facts mar the reflections and unnaturalize the incidents so as to be lost in a multiplicity of fine idle words and phrases and reduce our sterling substance into an empty shadow or rather frenchify our english solidity into froth and whipsyllabub no let us have pamela as pamela wrote it in her own words without amputation or addition produce her to us in her neat country apparel such as she appeard in on her intended departure to her parents for such best becomes her innocence and beautiful simplicity such a dress will best edify and entertain the flowing robes of oratory may indeed amuse and amaze but will never strike the mind with solid attention in short sir a piece of this kind is much wanted in the world which is but too much as well as too early debauched by pernicious novels iknow nothing entertaining of that kind that one might venture to recommend to the perusal much less the imitation of the youth of either sex all that i have hitherto read tends only to corrupt their principles mislead their judgments and initiate them into gallantry and loose pleasures publish then this good this edifying and instructive little piece for their sakes the honour of pamelas sex demands pamela at your hands to shew the world an heroine almost beyond example in an unusual scene of life whom no temptations or sufferings could subdue it is a fine and glorious original for the fair to copy out and imitate our own sex too require it of you to free us in some measure from the imputation of being incapable of the impressions of virtue and honour del th and to shew the ladies that we are not inflexible while they are so in short the cause of virtue calls for the publication of such a piece as this oblige then sir the concurrent voices of both sexes and give us pamela for the benefit of mankind del th and as i believe its excellencies cannot be long unknown to the world and that there will not be a family without it so i make no doubt but every family that has it will be much improvd and betterd by it twill form the tender minds of youth for the reception and practice of virtue and honour confirm and establish those of maturer years on good and steady principles reclaim the vicious and mend the age in general insomuch that as i doubt not pamela will become the bright example and imitation of all the fashionable young ladies of great britain so the truly generous benefactor and rewarder of her exemplary virtue will be no less admired and imitated among the beau monde of our own sex iam your affectionate friend c introduction to this second edition the kind reception which this piece has met with from the publick del th alarge impression having been carried off in less than three months deserves not only acknowlegdment but that some notice should be taken of the objections that have hitherto come to hand against a few passages in it del th that so the work may be rendered as unexceptionable as possible and of consequence the fitter to answer the general design of it which is to promote virtue and cultivate the minds of the youth of both sexes th change but difficulties having arisen from the different opinions of gentlemen some of whom applauded the very things that others found fault with it was thought proper to submit the whole to the judgment of a gentleman of the most distinguishd taste and abilities the result of which will be seen in the subsequent pages del th we begin with the following letter at the desire of several gentlemen to whom on a very particular occasion it was communicated and who wishd to see it prefixed to the new edition it was directed to the editor of pamela dear sir you have agreeably deceivd me into a surprize which it will be as hard to express as the beauties of pamela though i opend this powerful little piece with more expectation than from common designs of like promise because it came from your hands for my daughters yet who could have dreamt he should find under the modest disguise of a novel all the soul of religion goodbreeding discretion goodnature wit fancy fine thought and morality ihave done nothing but read it to others and hear others again read it to me ever since it came into my hands and i find i am likely to do nothing else for i know not how long yet to come because if i lay the book down it comes after mewhen it has dwelt all day long upon the ear it takes possession all night of the fancyit has witchcraft in every page of it but it is the witchcraft of passion and meaning who is there that will not despise the false empty pomp of the poets when he observes in this little unpretending mild triumph of nature the whole force of invention and genius creating new powers of emotion and transplanting ideas of pleasure into that unweeded low garden the heart from the dry and sharp summit of reason yet i confess there is one in the world of whom i think with still greater respect than of pamela and that is of the del th wonderful author of pamelapray who is he dear sir and where and how has he been able to hide hitherto such an encircling and allmastering spirit he possesses every quality that art could have charmd by yet has lent it to and conceald it in naturethe comprehensiveness of his imagination must be truly prodigiousit has stretchd out this diminutive mere grain of mustardseed apoor girls little innocent story into a resemblance of that heaven which the best of good books has compard it toall the passions are his in their most close and abstracted recesses and by selecting the most delicate and yet at the same time most powerful of their springs thereby to act wind and manage the heart he moves us every where with the force of a tragedy what is there throughout the whole that i do not sincerely admire iadmire in it the strong distinguishd variety and picturesque glowing likeness to life of the characters iknow hear see and live among em all and if i coud paint coud return you their faces iadmire in it the noble simplicity force aptness and truth of so many modest oeconomical moral prudential religious satirical and cautionary lessons which are introducd with such seasonable dexterity and with so polishd and exquisite a delicacy of expression and sentiment that i am only apprehensive for the interests of virtue lest some of the finest and most touching of those elegant strokes of goodbreeding generosity and reflection shoud be lost under the too gross discernment of an unfeeling majority of readers for whose coarseness however they were kindly designd as the most useful and charitable correctives one of the bestjudgd peculiars of the plan is that these instructions being conveyd as in a kind of dramatical representation by those beautiful scenes her own letters and journals who acts the most moving and suffering part we feel the force in a threefold effect from the motive the act and the consequence but what above all i am charmd with is the amiable goodnature of the author who iam convincd has one of the best and most generous hearts of mankind because mismeasuring other minds by his own he can draw every thing to perfection but wickednessibecame inextricably in love with this delightful defect of his malice for ifound it owing to an excess in his honesty only observe sir with what virtuous reluctance he complies with the demands of his story when he stands in need of some blameable characters tho his judgment compels him to mark em with disagreeable colourings so that they make an odious appearance at first he cant forbear by an unexpected and gradual decline from themselves to soften and transmute all the horror conceivd for their baseness till we are arrivd through insensible stages at an inclination to forgive it intirely i must venture to add without mincing the matter what i really believe of this book it will live on through posterity with such unbounded extent of good consequences that twenty ages to come may be the better and wiser for its influence it will steal first imperceptibly into the hearts of the young and the tender where it will afterwards guide and moderate their reflections and resolves when grown older and so agradual moral sunshine of unaustere and compassionate virtue shall break out upon the world from this trifle for such idare answer for the author his modesty misguides him to think itno applause therefore can be too high for such merit and let me abominate the contemptible reserves of meanspirited men who while they but hesitate their esteem with restraint can be fluent and uncheckd in their envyin an age so deficient in goodness every such virtue as that of this author is a salutary angel in sodom and one who coud stoop to conceal adelight he receives from the worthy woud be equally capable of submitting to an approbation of the praise of the wicked i was thinking just now as i returnd from a walk in the snow on that old roman policy of exemptions in favour of men who had given a few bodily children to the republickwhat superior distinction ought our country to find del th but that policy and we are at variance for reward of this father of millions of minds which are to owe new formation to the future effect of his influence upon the whole as i never met with so pleasing so honest and so truly deserving a book ishoud never have done if i explaind all my reasons for admiring its authorif it is not a secret oblige me so far as to tell me his name for since i feel him the friend of my soul it would be a kind of violation to retain him a strangeriam not able to thank you enough for this highly acceptable present and as for my daughters they have taken into their own hands the acknowledgment due from their gratitude iam dear sir your c dec abstract of a second letter from the same gentleman no sentiments which i have here or in my last expressd of the sweet pamela being more than the bare truth which every man must feel who lends his ear to the inchanting prattler why does the authors modesty mislead his judgment to suspect the style wants polishing no sir there is an ease anatural air adignifyd simplicity and measured fullness in it that resembling life outglows it he has reconciled the pleasing to the proper the thought is everywhere exactly cloathd by the expression and becomes its dress as roundly and as close as pamela her countryhabit remember tho she put it on with humble prospect of descending to the level of her purpose it adornd her with such unpresumd increase of loveliness sat with such neat propriety of elegant neglect about her that it threw out all her charms with tenfold and resistless influence and so dear sir it will be always found when modest beauty seeks to hide itself by casting off the pride of ornament it but displays itself without a covering and so becoming more distinguished by its want of drapery grows stronger from its purposd weakness th change there were formed by an anonymous gentleman the following objections to some passages in the work that the style ought to be a little raised at least so soon as pamela knows the gentlemans love is honourable and when th her his diffidence is changed to ease and from about the fourth day after marriage it should be equal to the rank she is raisd to del th and charged to fill becomingly that to avoid the idea apt to be joind with the word squire the gentleman should be styled sir james or sir john c and lady davers in a new edition might procure for him the title of a baronet that if the sacred name were seldomer repeated it would be better for that the wise mans advice is be not righteous overmuch that the penance which pamela suffers from lady davers might be shortend that she is too timorous after owning her marriage to that lady and ought to have a little more spirit and del th get away sooner out at the window or call her own servants to protect and carry her to her husbands appointment that females are too apt to be struck with images of beauty and that the passage where the gentleman is said to span the waist of pamela with his hand is enough to ruin a nation of women by tightlacing that the word naughty had better be changed to some other as bad faulty wicked vile abominable scandalous which in most places would give an emphasis for which recourse must otherwise be had to the innocent simplicity of the writer an idea not necessary to the moral of the story nor of advantage to the character of the heroine that the words p foolish thing that i am had better be foolish that i am the same gentleman observes by way of postscript that jokes are often more severe and do more mischief than more solid objections and would have one or two passages alterd to avoid giving occasion for the supposition of a double entendre particularly in two places which he mentions viz p and he is pleased to take notice of several other things of less moment some of which are merely typographical and very kindly expresses on the whole ahigh opinion of the performance and thinks it may do a great deal of good for all which as well as for his objections the editor gives him very sincere thanks others are of opinion that the scenes in many places in the beginning especially are too low and that the passions of lady davers in particular are carried too high and above nature and others have intimated that pamela ought for example sake to have dischargd mrs jewkes from her service these are the most material objections that have come to hand all which are considered in the following del th extracts from some of the most beautiful letters del th that have been written in any language th adds change the gentlemans advice not to alter pamela at all was both friendly and solidly just irun in with full sail to his anchorage that the low scenes are no more out of nature than the high passions of proud lady davers out of nature do they say tis my astonishment how men of letters can read with such absent attention they are so far from out of nature they are absolute nature herself or if they must be confessd her resemblance they are such a resemblance at least as our true face gives our face in the lookingglass i wonder indeed what it is that the gentlemen who talk of low scenes woud desire should be understood by the epithet nothing properly speaking is low that suits well with the place it is raisd tothe passions of nature are the same in the lord and his coachman all that makes them seem different consists in the degrees in the means and the air whereto or wherewith they indulge em if in painting distinctions like these which arise but from the forms of mens manners drawn from birth education and custom awriter falls short of his characters there his scene is a low one indeed whatever high fortune it flatterd but to imagine that persons of rank are above a concern for what is thought felt or acted by others of their species between whom and themselves is no difference except such as was owing to accident is to reduce human nature to a lowness too low for the truth of her frailty in pamela in particular we owe all to her lowness it is to the docile effects of this lowness of that amiable girl in her birth her condition her hopes and her vanities in every thing in short but her virtue that her readers are indebted for the moral reward of that virtue and if we are to look for the low among the rest of the servants less lovely tho they are than a pamela there is something however so glowingly painted in the lines whereby the author has markd their distinctionssomething so movingly forceful in the grief at their parting and joy at the happy return something so finely at once and so strongly and feelingly varied even in the smallest and least promising little family incidents that i need only appeal from the heads to the hearts of the objectors themselves whether these are low scenes to be censurd and as for the opposite extreme they woud quarrel with the highpassiond and untamd lady davers icoud direct em to a dozen or two of quality originals from whom with exception perhaps of her wit one woud swear the author had taken her copy what a sum might these objectors ensure to be paid by the husbands and sons of such termagant hermaphrodite minds upon their making due proof that they were no longer to be found in the kingdom i know you are too just to imagine me capable of giving any other opinion than my bestweighd and true one but because it is fit you should have reasons in support of a judgment that can neither deserve nor expect an implicit reception iwill run over the anonymous letter i herewith return you and note with what lightness even men of goodnaturd intention fall into mistakes by neglect in too hasty perusals which their benevolence woud take pleasure in blushing at when they discover their weakness in a cooler revisal the writer of this letter is for having the style raisd after pamelas advance in her fortune but surely this was hasty advice because as the letters are writ to her parents it woud have lookd like forgetting and in some sort insulting the lowliness of their inferior condition to have assumd a new air in her language in place of retaining a steady humility but here it must not be passd unobservd that in her reports of conversations that followd her marriage she does aptly and beautifully heighten her style and her phrases still returning however to her decent simplicity in her addresses to her father and mother i am against giving a gentleman who has ennobled himself by reforming his vices and rewarding the worth of the friendless the unnecessary new toy of a title it is all strong in nature as it stands in the letters and i dont see how greatness from titles can add likeness or power to the passions so complete a resemblance of truth stands in need of no borrowd pretensions the only of this writers objections which ithink carries weight is that which advises some little contraction of the prayers and appeals to the deity isay little contraction for they are nobly and sincerely pathetic and i say it only in fear lest if fansied too long by the fashionably averse to the subject minds which most want the purposd impression might hazard the loss of its benefit by passing over those pious reflections which if shorter would catch their attention certainly the gentlemans objection against the persecution that pamela suffers from lady davers in respect to the relation this madwoman bears to the brother is the th th change rashest of all his advices and when he thinks she ought rather to have assumd the protection of her servants he seems unaware of the probable consequence where there was a puppy of quality in the case who had even without provocation drawn his sword on the poor passive pamela far from bearing a thought of exciting an abler resentment to the danger of a quarrel with so worthless a coxcomb how charmingly natural apprehensive and generous is her silence during the recital she makes of her sufferings with regard to this masculine part of the insult as also her prevention of mrs jewkess less delicate bluntness when she was beginning to complain of the whelp lords impertinence if i were not afraid of a pun ishoud tell the anonymous letterwriter that he made a too tightlaced objection where he quarrels with the spannd waist of pamela what in the name of unshapeliness coud he find to complain of in a beautiful girl of sixteen who was born out of germany and had not yet reachd ungraspable roundnessthese are wonderful sinkings from purpose where a man is considering such mental and passionate beauties as this gentleman professd to be touchdby but when he goes on to object against the word naughty as applyd in the phrase naughty master th change i grow mortified in fear for our human sufficiency compard with our aptness to blunder for here tis plain this director of anothers discernment is quite blind himself to an elegance one woud have thought it impossible not to be struck by faulty wicked abominable scandalous which are the angry adjectives he prefers to that sweet one woud have carried marks of her rage not affliction whereas naughty contains in one single significant petulance th avariety of twenty thousand inexpressible delicacies it insinuates at once all the beautiful struggle between her contempt of his purpose and tender regard for his person her gratitude to himself and his family her recollection of his superior condition there is in the elegant choice of this halfkind halfpeevish word aneverenough to be praisd speaking picture of the conflict betwixt her disdain and her reverence del th see sir the reason i had for apprehending some danger that the refind generosity in many of the most charming of the sentiments woud be lost upon the too coarse conception of some for whose use the author intended them it is the same case again in foolish thing that i am which this nice del th unnice gentleman woud advise you to change into foolish that i am he does not seem to have tasted the pretty contempt of herself the submissive diminutive so distant from vanity yet allayed by the gentle reluctance in selfcondemnation del th and the other fine touches of nature which woud all have been lost in the grave sober sound of his dutch emendation del th as to his paragraph in postscript ishall say the less of it because the gentlemans own good sense seems to confess by the place he has chosen to rank it in that it ought to be turnd out of doors as too dirty for the rest of his letter th change in the occasions he is pleasd to discover for jokes ieither find not that he has any signification at all or such vulgar coarsetasted allusions to loose lowlife idioms ins that not to understand what he means is both the cleanliest and prudentest way of confuting him and now sir you will easily gather how far i am from thinking it needful to change any thing in pamela iwould not scratch such a beautiful face for the indies del th you can hardly imagine how it charms me to hear of a second edition already but the news of still new upon new ones will be found no subject of wonder as tis sure that no family is without sisters or brothers or daughters or sons who can read or wants fathers or mothers or friends who can think so equally certain it is that the train to a parcel of powder does not run on with more natural tendency till it sets the whole heap in a blaze than that pamela inchanting from family to family will overspread all the hearts of the kingdom as to the objection of those warm friends to honesty who are for having pamela dismiss mrs jewkes there is not one among all these benevolent complainers who woud not discern himself to have been laudably in the wrong were he only to be askd this plain question whether a step both illjudgd and undutiful had not been the reverse of a pamelas character two or three times over mr b had informd her that mrs jewkes and himself having been equally involvd in one guilt she must forgive or condemn both together after this it grew manifest duty not to treat her with marks of resentment and as here was a visible necessity to appear not desirous of turning her away so in point of mere moral regard to the bad woman herself it was nobler to retain her with a prospect of correcting in time her loose habit of thinking than by casting her off to the licentious results of her temper abandon her to temptations and danger which a virtue like pamelas coud not wish her exposdto del th the manner in which this admirable gentleman gives his opinion of the piece and runs thro the principal characters is so masterly that the readers of pamela will be charmd by it tho they should suppose that his inimitable benevolence has overvalud the piece itself inspird without doubt by some skill more than human and comprehending in an humble and seemingly artless narration aforce that can tear up the heartstrings this author has prepard an enamouring philtre for the mind which will excite such a passion for virtue as scarce to leave it in the power of the will to neglect her longinus iremember distinguishing by what marks we may know the sublime says it is chiefly from an effect that will follow the reading it adelightfullyadhering idea that clings fast to the memory and from which it is difficult for a man to disengage his attention if this is a proof of the sublime there was never sublimity so lastingly felt as in pamela not the charmers own prattling idea stuck so close to the heart of her master as the incidents of her story to the thoughts of a reader the author transports and transforms with a power more extensive than horace requires in his poet mr b and the turns of his passions and the softness yet strength of their amiable object after having given us the most masterly image of nature that ever was painted take possession of and dwell in the memory and there too broods the kind and the credulous parson williamss dove without serpentine mixture hatching pity and affection th change for an honesty so sincere and so silly there too take their places all the lower supports of this beautiful fabrick i am sometimes transformd into plain goodman andrews and sometimes the good woman his wife as for old mr longman and jonathan the butler they are sure of me both in their turns now andthen iam colbrand the swiss but as broad as i stride in that character ican never escape mrs jewkes who often keeps me awake in the night till the ghost of lady davers drawing open the curtains scares the scarer of me and of pamela and then itake shelter with poor penitent john and the rest of the men and the maids of all whom i may say with compassionate marcia the youths divide their reader th th change and this fine writer adds i am glad i made war in my last upon the notion of altering the style for having read it twice over since then and to audiences where the tears were applausively eloquent icould hardly here and there find a place where one word can be changd for a better there are some indeed where twere possible to leave out afew without making a breach in the building but in short the author has put so bewitching a mixture together of the raisd with the natural and the soft with the strong and the eloquent thatnever sentiments were finer and fuller of life never any were utterd so sweetly even in what relates to the pious and frequent addresses to god inow retract on these two last revisals the consent i half gave on a former to the anonymous writers proposal who advisd the author to shorten those beautieswhoever considers his pamela with a view to find matter for censure is in the condition of a passionate lover who breaks in upon his mistress without fear or wit with intent to accuse her and quarrel he came to her with pique in his purpose but his heart is too hard for his malice and he goes away more enslavd for complaining del th the following delightful story so admirably related will give great pleasure to the reader and we take the liberty of inserting it for that very reason del th what a nevertobe satisfied length has this subject always the power of attracting me into and yet before i have done imust by your means tell the author a story which a judge not so skilful in nature as he is might be in danger perhaps of mistaking for a trifling and silly one iexpect it shoud give him the clearest conviction in a case he is subject to question del th we have a lively little boy in the family about seven years old but alas for him poor child quite unfriended and born to no prospect he is the son of an honest poor soldier by a wife grave unmeaning and innocent yet the boy see the power of connubial simplicity is so pretty so genteel and gayspirited that we have made him and designd him our own ever since he could totter and waddle the wanton rogue is half air and every motion he acts by has a spring like pamelas when she threw down the cardtable all this quickness however is temperd by a goodnaturd modesty so that the wildest of his flights are thought rather diverting than troublesome he is an hourly foundation for laughter from the top of the house to the parlours and to borrow an attribute from the reverend mr peters tho without any note of his musick plays a very good fiddle in the family ihave told you the history of this tomtit of a prater because ever since my first reading of pamela he puts in for a right to be one of her hearers and having got half her sayings by heart talks in no other language but hers and what really surprises and has charmd me into a certain foretaste of her influence he is at once become fond of his book which before he coud never be brought to attend to that he may read pamela he says without stopping the first discovery we made of this power over so unripe and unfixd an attention was one evening when i was reading her reflections at the pond to some company the little rampant intruder being kept out by the extent of the circle had crept under my chair and was sitting before me on the carpet with his head almost touching the book and his face bowing down toward the fire he had sat for some time in this posture with a stillness that made us conclude him asleep when on a sudden we heard a succession of heartheaving sobs which while he strove to conceal from our notice his little sides swelld as if they woud burst with the throbbing restraint of his sorrow iturnd his innocent face to look toward me but his eyes were quite lost in his tears which running down from his cheeks in free currents had formd two sincere little fountains on that part of the carpet he hung over all the ladies in company were ready to devour him with kisses and he has since become doubly a favourite and is perhaps the youngest of pamelas converts the same del th incomparable writer has favourd us with an objection del th that is more material than any we have mentiond which cannot be better stated nor answerd than in his own del th beautiful words viz an objection is come into my thoughts which i should be glad the author would think proper to obviate in the front of the second edition there are mothers or grandmothers in all families of affluent fortune who tho they may have none of lady daverss insolence will be apt to feel one of her fears that the example of a gentleman so amiable as mr b may be followd by the jackies their sons with too blind and unreflecting a readiness nor does the answer of that gentleman to his sisters reproach come quite up to the point they will rest on for tho indeed it is true all the world woud acquit the best gentleman in it if he married such a waitingmaid as pamela yet there is an illdiscerning partiality in passion that will overthrow all the force of that argument because every belovd maid will be pamela in a judgment obscurd by her influence and since the ground of this fear will seem solid idont know how to be easy till it is shewn nor ought it to be left to the authors modesty that they who consider his design in that light will be found but shortsighted observers request it of him then to suffer it to be told them that not a limited but general excitement to virtue was the first and great end to his story and that this excitement must have been deficient and very imperfectly offerd if he had not lookd quite as low as he coud for his example because if there had been any degree or condition more remote from the prospect than that which he had chosen to work on that degree might have seemd out of reach of the hope which it was his generous purpose to encourage and so he was under an evident necessity to find such a jewel in a cottage and exposd too as she was to the severest distresses of fortune with parents unable to support their own lives but from the daily hard product of labour nor woud it have been sufficient to have placd her thus low and distressful if he had not also supposd her a servant and that too in some elegant family for if she had always remaind a fellowcottager with her father it must have carried an air of romantick improbability to account for her polite education if she had wanted those improvements which she found means to acquire in her service it woud have been very unlikely that she shoud have succeeded so well and had destroyd one great use of the story to have allowd such uncommon felicity to the effect of mere personal beauty and it had not been judicious to have represented her as educated in a superior condition of life with the proper accomplishments before she became reducd by misfortunes and so not a servant but rather an orphan under hopeless distresses because opportunities which had made it no wonder how she came to be so winningly qualified woud have lessend her merit in being so and besides where had then been the purposd excitement of persons in pamelas condition of life by an emulation of her sweetness humility modesty patience and industry to attain some faint hope of arriving in time within view of her happinessand what a delightful reformation shoud we see in all families where the vanity of their maids took no turn toward ambition to please but by such innocent measures as pamelas as it is clear then the author was under a necessity to suppose her a servant he is not to be accountable for mistaken impressions which the charms he has given her may happen to make on wrong heads or weak hearts tho in favour of maids the reverse of her likeness what is it then they may say that the lowness and distance of pamelas condition from the gentlemans who married her proposes to teach the gay world and the fortunate it is this by comparison with that infinite remoteness of her condition from the reward which her virtue procurd her one great proof is derivd which is part of the moral of pamela that advantages from birth and distinction of fortune have no power at all when considerd against those from behaviour and temper of mind because where the last are not added all the first will be boasted in vain whereas she who possesses the last finds no want of the first in her influence in that light alone let the ladies of rank look at pamela such an alarming reflection as that will at the same time that it raises the hope and ambition of the humble correct and mortify the disdain of the proud for it will compel them to observe and acknowledge that tis the turn of their mind not the claims of their quality by which and which only womens charms can be lasting and that while the haughty expectations inseparable from an elevated rank serve but to multiply its complaints and afflictions the condescensions of accomplishd humility attracting pity affection and reverence secure an hourly increase of felicity so that the moral meaning of pamelas goodfortune far from tempting young gentlemen to marry such maids as are found in their families is by teaching maids to deserve to be mistresses to stir up mistresses to support their distinction del th we shall only add that it was intended to prefix two neat frontispieces to this edition and to present them to the purchasers of the first and one was actually finished for that purpose but there not being time for the other from the demand for the new impression and the engraving part of that which was done tho no expence was spared having fallen very short of the spirit of the passages they were intended to represent the proprietors were advised to lay them aside and were the rather induced to do so from the following observation of a most ingenious gentleman in a letter to the editor i am so jealous says he in behalf of our inward idea of pamelas person that i dread any figurd pretence to resemblance for it will be pity to look at an air and imagine it hers that does not carry some such elegant perfection of amiableness as will be sure to find place in the fancy verses sent to the bookseller for the unknown
