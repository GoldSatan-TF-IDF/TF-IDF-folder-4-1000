the black abbot of puthuum clark ashton smith let the grape yield for us its purple flame and rosy love put off its maidenhood by blackening moons in lands without a name we slew the incubus and all his brood song of king hoaraphs bowmen zobal the archer and cushara the pikebearer had poured many a libation to their friendship in the sanguine liquors of yoros and the blood of the kingdoms enemies in that long and lusty amity broken only by such passing quarrels as concerned the division of a wineskin or the apportioning of a wench they had served amid the soldiery of king hoaraph for a strenuous decade savage warfare and wild fantastic hazard had been their lot the renown of their valor had drawn upon them ultimately the honor of hoaraphs attention and he had assigned them for duty among the picked warriors that guarded his palace in faraad and sometimes the twain were sent together on such missions as required no common hardihood and no disputable fealty to the king now in company with the eunuch simban chief purveyor to hoaraphs wellreplenished harem zobal and cushara had gone on a tedious journey through the tract known as izdrel which clove the western part of yoros asunder with its rustycolored wedge of desolation the king had sent them to learn if haply there abode any verity in certain travelers tales which concerned a young maiden of celestial beauty who had been seen among the pastoral peoples beyond izdrel simban bore at his girdle a bag of gold coins with which if the girls pulchritude should be in any wise commensurate with the renown thereof he was empowered to bargain for her purchase the king had deemed that zobal and cushara should form an escort equal to all contingencies for izdrel was a land reputedly free of robbers or indeed of any human inhabitants men said however that malign goblins tall as giants and humped like camels had oftentimes beset the wayfarers through izdrel that fair but illmeaning lamiae had lured them to an eldritch death simban quaking corpulently in his saddle rode with small willingness on that outward journey but the archer and the pike bearer full of wholesome skepticism divided their bawdy jests between the timid eunuch and the elusive demons without other mishap than the rupturing of a wineskin from the force of the new vintage it contained they came to the verdurous pasturelands beyond that dreary desert here in low valleys that held the middle meanderings of the river vos cattle and dromedaries were kept by a tribe of herders who sent biannual tribute to hoaraph from their teeming droves simban and his companions found the girl who dwelt with her grandmother in a village beside the vos and even the eunuch acknowledged that their journey was well rewarded cushara and zobal on their part were instantly smitten by the charms of the maiden whose name was rubalsa she was slender and of queenly height and her skin was pale as the petals of white poppies and the undulant blackness of her heavy hair was full of sullen copper gleamings beneath the sun while simban haggled shrilly with the cronelike grandmother the warriors eyed rubalsa with circumspect ardor and addressed to her such gallantries as they deemed discreet within hearing of the eunuch at last the bargain was driven and the price paid to the sore depletion of simbans moneybag simban was now eager to return to faraad with his prize and he seemed to have forgotten his fear of the haunted desert zobal and cushara were routed from their dreams by the impatient eunuch before dawn and the three departed with the still drowsy rubalsa ere the village could awaken about them noon with its sun of candent copper in a blackishblue zenith found them far amid the rusty sands and irontoothed ridges of izdrel the route they followed was little more than a footpath for though izdrel was but thirty miles in width at that point few travelers would dare those fiendinfested leagues and most preferred an immensely circuitous road used by the herders that ran to the southward of that evil desolation following the vos nearly to its debouchment in the indaskian sea cushara splendid in his platearmor of bronze on a huge piebald mare with a cataphract of leather scaled with copper led the cavalcade rubalsa who wore the red homespun of the herders women followed on a black gelding with silk and silver harness which hoaraph had sent for her use close behind her came the watchful eunuch gorgeous in particolored sendal and mounted ponderously with swollen saddlebags all about him on the gray ass of uncertain age which through his fear of horses and camels he insisted on riding at all times in his hand he held the leadingrope of another ass which was nearly crushed to the ground by the wineskins waterjugs and other provisions zobal guarded the rear with unslung bow slim and wiry in his suiting of light chain mail on a nervous stallion that chafed incessantly at the rein at his back he bore a quiver filled with arrows which the court sorcerer amdok had prepared with singular spells and dippings in doubtful fluids for his possible use against demons zobal had accepted the arrows courteously but had satisfied himself later that their iron barbs were in no wise impaired by amdoks treatment a similarly ensorceled pike had been offered by amdok to cushara who had refused it bluffly saying that his own welltried weapon was equal to the spitting of any number of devils because of simban and the two asses the party could make little speed however they hoped to cross the wilder and more desolate portion of izdrel ere night simban though he still eyed the dismal waste dubiously was plainly more concerned with his precious charge than with the imagined imps and lamiae and cushara and zobal both rapt in amorous reveries that centered about the luscious rubalsa gave only a perfunctory attention to their surroundings the girl had ridden all morning in demure silence now suddenly she cried out in a voice whose sweetness was made shrill by alarm the others reined their mounts and simban babbled questions to these rubalsa replied by pointing toward the southern horizon where as her companions now saw a peculiar pitchblack darkness had covered a great portion of the sky and hills obliterating them wholly this darkness which seemed due neither to cloud nor sandstorm extended itself in a crescent on either hand and came swiftly toward the travelers in the course of a minute or less it had blotted the pathway before and behind them like a black mist and the two arcs of shadow racing northward had flowed together immuring the party in a circle the darkness then became stationary its walls no more than a hundred feet away on every side sheer impenetrable it surrounded the wayfarers leaving above them a clear space from which the sun still glared down remote and small and discolored as if seen from the bottom of a deep pit ai ai ai howled simban cowering amid his saddlebags i knew well that some devilry would overtake us at the same moment the two asses began to bray loudly and the horses with a frantic neighing and squealing trembled beneath their riders only with much cruel spurring could zobal force his stallion forward beside cusharas mare mayhap it is only some pestilential mist said cushara never have i seen such mist replied zobal doubtfully and there are no vapors to be met with in izdrel methinks it is like the smoke of the seven hells that men fable beneath zothique shall we ride forward said cushara i would learn whether or not a pike can penetrate that darkness calling out some words of reassurance to rubalsa the twain sought to spur their mounts toward the murky wall but after a few swerving paces the mare and the stallion balked wildly sweating and snorting and would go no farther cushara and zobal dismounted and continued their advance on foot not knowing the source or nature of the phenomenon with which they had to deal the two approached it warily zobal nocked an arrow to his string and cushara held the great bronzeheaded pike before him as if charging an embattled foe both were more and more puzzled by the murkiness which did not recede before them in the fashion of fog but maintained its opacity when they were close upon it cushara was about to thrust his weapon into the wall then without the least prelude there arose in the darkness seemingly just before him a horrible multitudinous clamor as of drums trumpets cymbals jangling armor jarring voices and mailed feet that tramped to and fro on the stony ground with a mighty clangor as cushara and zobal drew back in amazement the clamor swelled and spread till it filled with a babel of warlike noises the whole circle of mysterious night that hemmed in the travelers veriiy we are sore beset shouted cushara to his comrade as they went back to their horses it would seem that some king of the north has sent his myrmidons into yoros yea said zobal but it is strange that we saw them not ere the darkness came and the darkness surely is no natural thing before cushara could make any rejoinder the martial clashings and shoutings ceased abruptly all about it seemed that there was a rattling of innumerable sistra a hissing of countless huge serpents a raucous hooting of illomened birds that had foregathered by thousands to these indescribably hideous sounds the horses now added a continual screaming and the asses a more frenzied braying above which the outcries of rubalsa and simban were scarce audible cushara and zobal sought vainly to pacify their mounts and comfort the madly frightened girl it was plain that no army of mortal men had beleaguered them for the noises still changed from instant to instant and they heard a most evil howling and a roaring as of hellborn beasts that deafened them with its volume naught however was visible in the gloom whose circle now began to move swiftly without widening or contracting to maintain their position in its center the warriors and their charges were compelled to leave the path and to flee northwardly amid the harsh ridges and hollows all around them the baleful noises continued keeping as it seemed the same interval of distance the sun slanting westward no longer shone into that eerily moving pit and a deep twilight enveloped the wanderers zobal and cushara rode as closely beside rubalsa as the rough ground permitted straining their eyes constantly for any visible sign of the cohorts that seemed to encompass them both were filled with the darkest misgivings for it had become all too manifest that supernatural powers were driving them astray in the untracked desert moment by moment the gross darkness seemed to close in and there was a palpable eddying and seething as of monstrous forms behind its curtain the horses stumbled over boulders and outcroppings of oresharp stone and the grievously burdened asses were compelled to put forth an unheardof speed to keep pace with the evershifting circle that menaced them with its horrid clamor rubalsa had ceased her outcries as if overcome by exhaustion or resignation to the horror of her plight and the shrill screeches of the eunuch had subsided into fearful wheezing and gasping ever and anon it seemed that great fiery eyes glared out of the gloom floating close to earth or moving aloft at a gigantic height zobal began to shoot his enchanted arrows at these appearance and the speeding of each bolt was hailed by an appalling outburst of satanic laughters and ululations in such wise they went on losing all measure of time and sense of orientation the animals were galled and footsore simban was nigh dead from fright and fatigue rubalsa drooped in her saddle and the warriors awed and baffled by the predicament in which their weapons appeared useless began to flag with a dull weariness never again shall i doubt the legendry of izdrel said cushara gloomily it is in my mind that we have not long either to doubt or believe rejoined zobal to add to their distress the terrain grew rougher and steeper and they climbed acclivitous hillsides and went down endlessly into drear valleys anon they came to a flat open pebbly space there all at once it seemed that the pandemonium of evil noises drew back on every hand receding and fading into faint dubious whispers that died at a vast remove simultaneously the circling night thinned out and a few stars shone in the welkin and the sharpspined hills of the desert loomed starkly against a vermilion afterglow the travelers paused and peered wonderingly at one another in a gloom that was no more than that of natural twilight what new devilry is this asked cushara hardly daring to believe that the hellish leaguers had vanished i know not said the archer who was staring into the dusk but here mayhap is one of the devils the others now saw that a muffled figure was approaching them bearing a lit lantern made of some kind of translucent horn at some distance behind the figure lights appeared suddenly in a square dark mass which none of the party had discerned before this mass was evidently a large building with many windows the figure drawing near was revealed by the dim yellowish lantern as a black man of immense girth and tallness garbed in a voluminous robe of saffron such as was worn by certain monkish orders and crowned with the twohorned purple hat of an abbot he was indeed a singular and unlookedfor apparition for if any monasteries existed amid the barren reaches of izdrel they were hidden and unknown to the world zobal however searching his memory recalled a vague tradition he had once heard concerning a chapter of negro monks that had flourished in yoros many centuries ago the chapter had long been extinct and the very site of its monastery was forgotten nowadays there were few blacks anywhere in the kingdom other than those who did duty as eunuchs guarding the seraglios of nobles and rich merchants the animals began to display a certain uneasiness at the strangers approach who art thou challenged cushara his fingers tightening on the haft of his weapon the black man grinned capaciously showing rows of discolored teeth whose incisors were like those of a wild dog his enormous unctuous jowls were creased by the grin into folds of amazing number and volume and his eyes deeply slanted and close together seemed to wink perpetually in pouches that shook like ebon jellies his nostrils flared prodigiously his purple rubbery lips drooled and quivered and he licked them with a fat red salacious tongue before replying to cusharas question i am ujuk abbot of the monastery of puthuum he said in a thick voice of such extraordinary volume that it appeared almost to issue from the earth under his feet methinks the night has overtaken you far from the route of travelers i bid you welcome to our hospitality aye the night took us betimes cushara returned dryly neither he nor zobal was reassured by the look of lust in the abbots obscenely twinkling eyes as he peered at rubalsa moreover they had now noted the excessive and disagreeable length of the dark nails on his huge hands and bare splayed feet nails that were curving threeinch talons sharp as those of some beast or bird of prey it seemed however that rubalsa and simban were less abhorrently impressed or had not noticed these details for both made haste to acknowledge the abbots proffer of hospitality and to urge acceptance upon the visibly reluctant warriors to this urging zobal and cushara yielded both inwardly resolving to keep a close watch on all the actions and movements of the abbot of puthuum ujuk holding the horn lantern aloft conducted the travelers to that massive building whose lights they had discerned at no great distance a ponderous gate of dark wood swung open silently at their approach and they entered a spacious courtyard cobbled with worn greasylooking stones and dimly illumined by torches in rusty iron sockets several monks appeared with startling suddenness before the travelers who had thought the courtyard vacant at first glance they were all of unusual bulk and stature and their features possessed an extraordinary likeness to those of ujuk from whom indeed they could hardly have been distinguished save by the yellow cowls which they wore in lieu of the abbots horned purple hat the similarity extended even to their curved and talonlike nails of inordinate length their movements were fantasmally furtive and silent without speaking they took charge of the horses and asses cushara and zobal relinquished their mounts to the care of these doubtful hostlers with a reluctance which apparently was not shared by rubalsa or the eunuch the monks also signified a willingness to relieve cushara of his heavy pike and zobal of his ironwood bow and halfemptied quiver of ensorceled arrows but at this the warriors balked refusing to let the weapons pass from their possession ujuk led them to an inner portal which gave admission to the refectory it was a large low room lit by brazen lamps of antique workmanship such as ghouls might have recovered from a desertsunken tomb the abbot with ogrelike grinnings besought his guests to take their place at a long massive table of ebony with chairs and benches of the same material when they had seated themselves ujuk sat down at the tables head immediately four monks came in bearing platters piled with spicily smoking viands and deep earthen flagons full of a dark amberbrown liquor and these monks like those encountered in the courtyard were gross ebonblack simulacra of their abbot resembling him precisely in every feature and member zobal and cushara were chary of tasting the liquor which for its odor appeared to be an exceptionally potent kind of ale for their doubts concerning ujuk and his monastery grew graver every moment also in spite of their hunger they refrained from the food set before them which consisted mainly of baked meats that neither could identify simban and rubalsa however addressed themselves promptly to the meal with appetites sharpened by long fasting and the weird fatigues of the day the warriors observed that neither food nor drink had been placed before ujuk and they conjectured that he had already dined to their growing disgust and anger he sat lolling obesely with lustful eyes upon rubalsa in a stare broken only by the nictitations that accompanied his perpetual grinning this stare soon began to abash the girl and then to alarm and frighten her she ceased eating and simban who had been deeply preoccupied till then with his supper was plainly perturbed when he saw the flagging of her appetite he seemed for the first time to notice the abbots unmonastic leering and showed his disapproval by sundry horrible grimaces he also remarked pointedly in a loud piercing voice that the girl was destined for the harem of king hoaraph but at this ujuk merely chuckled as if simban had uttered some exquisitely humorous jest zobal and cushara were hard put to repress their wrath and both itched hotly for the fleshing of their weapons in the abbots gross bulk he however seemed to have taken simbans hint for he shifted his gaze from the girl instead he began to eye the warriors with a curious and loathsome avidity which they found little less insupportable than his ogling of rubalsa the wellnourished eunuch also came in for his share of ujuks regard which seemed to have in it the hunger of a hyena gloating over his prospective prey simban obviously ill at ease and somewhat frightened now tried to carry on a conversation with the abbot volunteering much information as to himself his companions and the adventures which had brought them to puthuum ujuk seemed little surprised by this information and zobal and cushara who took no part in the conversation became surer than ever that he was no true abbot how far have we gone astray from the route to faraad asked simban i do not consider that you have gone astray rumbled ujuk in his subterranean voice for your coming to puthuum is most timely we have few guests here and we are loth to part with those who honor our hospitality king hoaraph will be impatient for our return with the girl simban quavered we must depart early tomorrow tomorrow is another matter said ujuk in a tone half unctuous half sinister perhaps by then you will have forgotten this deplorable haste little was said during the rest of the meal and indeed little was drunk or eaten for even simban seemed to have lost his normally voracious appetite ujuk still grinning as if at some uproarious jest known only to himself was apparently not concerned with the urging of food upon his guests certain of the monks came and went unbidden removing the laden dishes and as they departed zobal and cushara perceived a strange thing for no shadows were cast by the monks on the lamplit floor beside the moving adumbrations of the vessels they carried from ujuk however a heavy misshapen umbrage fell and lay like a prone incubus beside his chair methinks we have come to a hatching place of demons whispered zobal to cushara we have fought many men thou and i but never such as wanted wholesome shadows aye muttered the pikebearer but i like this abbot even less than his monks though he alone is the caster of a shade ujuk now rose from his seat saying i trow that ye are all weary and would sleep betimes rubalsa and simban who had both drunk a certain amount of the powerful ale of puthuum nodded a drowsy assent zobal and cushara noting their premature sleepiness were glad they had declined the liquor the abbot led his guests along a corridor whose gloom was but little relieved by the flaring of torches in a strong draft that blew stealthily from an undetermined source causing a rout of wild shadows to flitter beside the passers on either hand there were cells with portals shut only by hangings of a coarse hempen fabric the monks had all vanished the cells were seemingly dark and an air of ageold desolation pervaded the monastery together with a smell as of moldering bones piled in some secret catacomb midway in the hall ujuk paused and held aside the arras of a doorway that differed in no wise from the rest within a lamp burned depending from an archaic chain of curiously linked and fretted metal the room was bare but spacious and a bed of ebony with opulent quiltings of an olden fashion stood by the farther wall under an open window this chamber the abbot indicated was for the occupancy of rubalsa and he then offered to show the men and the eunuch their respective quarters simban seeming to wake all at once from his drowsiness protested at the idea of being separated in such wise from his charge as if ujuk had been prepared for this and had given orders accordingly a monk appeared forthwith bringing quilts which he laid on the flagged floor within the portals of rubalsas room simban stretched himself promptly on the improvised bed and the warriors withdrew with ujuk come said the abbot his wolfish teeth gleaming in the torchlight ye will sleep soundly in the beds i have prepared zobal and cushara however had now assumed the position of guardsmen outside the doorway of rubalsas chamber they told ujuk curtly that they were responsible to king hoaraph for the girls safety and must watch over her at all times i wish ye a pleasant vigil said ujuk with a cachinnation like the laughter of hyenas in some underground tomb with his departure it seemed that the black slumber of a dead antiquity settled upon all the building rubalsa and simban apparently slept without stirring for there was no sound from behind the hempen arras the warriors spoke only in whispers lest they should arouse the girl their weapons held ready for instant use they watched the shadowy hall with a jealous vigilance for they did not trust the quietude about them being well assured that a host of foul cacodemons couched somewhere behind it biding the time of assault howbeit nothing occurred to reconfirm them in such apprehensions the draft that breathed furtively along the hall seemed to tell only of ageforgotten death and cyclic solitude the two began to perceive signs of dilapidation in walls and floor that had heretofore escaped their notice eery fantastical thoughts came to them with insidious persuasion it seemed that the building was a ruin that had lain uninhabited for a thousand years that the black abbot ujuk and his shadowless monks were mere imaginations things that had never been that the moving circle of darkness the pandemonian voices that had herded them toward puthuum were no more than a daymare whose memory was now fading in the fashion of dreams thirst and hunger troubled them for they had not eaten since early morn and had snatched only a few hasty drafts of wine or water during the day both however began to feel the oncreeping of a sleepy hebetude which under the circumstances was most undesirable they nodded started and awoke recurrently to their peril but still like a siren voice in poppydreams the silence seemed to tell them that all danger was a bygone thing an illusion that belonged to yesterday several hours passed and the hall lightened with the rising of a late moon that shone through a window at its eastern end zobal less bedrowsed than cushara was awakened to full awareness by a sudden commotion among the animals in the courtyard without there were neighings that rose to a frenzied pitch as if something had frightened the horses and to these the asses began to add their heavy braying till cushara was also aroused make sure that thou drowsest not again zobal admonished the pikebearer i shall go forth and inquire as to the cause of this tumult tis a good thought commended cushara and while thou art gone see to it that none has molested our provisions and bring back with thee some apricots and cakes of sesame and a skin of rubyred wine the monastery itself remained silent as zobal went down the hall his buskins of linkcovered leather ringing faintly at the halls end an outer door stood open and he passed through it into the courtyard even as he emerged the animals ceased their clamor he could see but dimly for all the torches in the courtyard save one had burnt out or been extinguished and the low gibbous moon had not yet climbed the wall nothing to all appearance was amiss the two asses were standing quietly beside the mountainous piles of provisions and saddlebags they had borne the horses seemed to drowse amicably in a group zobal decided that perhaps there had been some temporary bickering between his stallion and cusharas mare he went forward to make sure that there was no other cause of disturbance afterward he turned to the wineskins intending to refresh himself before rejoining cushara with a supply of drinkables and comestibles hardly had he washed the dust of izdrel from his throat with a long draft when he heard an eery dry whispering whose source and distance he could not at once determine sometimes it seemed at his very ear and then it ebbed away as if sinking into profound subterranean vaults but the sound though variable in this manner never ceased entirely and it seemed to shape itself into words that the listener almost understood words that were fraught with the hopeless sorrow of a dead man who had sinned long ago and had repented his sin through black sepulchral ages as he harkened to the sere anguish of that sound the hair bristled on the archers neck and he knew such fear as he had never known in the thick of battle and yet at the same time he was aware of deeper pity than the pain of dying comrades had ever aroused in his heart and it seemed that the voice implored him for commiseration and succor laying upon him a weird compulsion that he dared not disobey he could not wholly comprehend the things that the whisperer besought him to do but somehow he must ease that desolate anguish still the whispering rose and fell and zobal forgot that he had left cushara to a lone vigil beset with hellish dangers forgot that the voice itself might well be only a device of demons to lure him astray he began to search the courtyard his keen ears alert for the source of the sound and after some dubitation he decided that it issued from the ground in a corner opposite the gateway here amid the cobbling in the walls angle he found a large slab of syenite with a rusty metal ring in its center he was quickly confirmed in his decision for the whispering became louder and more articulate and he thought that it said to him lift the slab the archer grasped the rusty ring with both hands and putting forth all his strength he succeeded in tilting back the stone albeit not without such exertion as made him feel that his very spine would crack a dark opening was exposed and from it surged a charnel stench so overpowering that zobal turned his face away and was like to have vomited but the whisper came with a sharp woeful beseeching out of the darkness below and it said to him descend zobal wrenched from its socket the one torch that still burned in the courtyard by its lurid flaring he saw a flight of worn steps that went down into the reeking sepulchral gloom and resolutely he descended the steps finding himself at their bottom in a hewn vault with deep shelves of stone on either hand the shelves running away into darkness were piled with human bones and mummified bodies and plainly the place was the catacomb of the monastery the whispering had ceased and zobal peered about in bewilderment not unmixed with horror i am here resumed the dry susurrous voice issuing from amid the heaps of mortal remnants on the shelf close beside him startled and feeling again that crisping of the hairs on his neck zobal held his torch to the low shelf as he looked for the speaker in a narrow niche between stacks of disarticulated bones he beheld a halfdecayed corpse about whose long attenuate limbs and hollow body there hung a few rotten shreds of yellow cloth these he thought were the remnants of a robe such as was worn by the monks of puthuum then thrusting his torch into the niche he discerned the lean mummylike head on which moldered a thing that had once been the horned hat of an abbot the corpse was black as ebony and plainly it was that of a great negro it bore an aspect of incredible age as if it had lain there for centuries but from it came the odor of newly ripe corruption that had sickened zobal when he lifted the slab of syenite as he stood staring down it seemed to zobal that the cadaver stirred a little as if fain to rise from its recumbent posture and he saw a gleaming as of eyeballs in the deepshadowed sockets and the dolorously curling lips were retracted still farther and from between the bared teeth there issued that awful whispering which had drawn him into the catacomb listen closely said the whispering there is much for me to tell thee and much for thee to do when the telling is done i am uldor the abbot of puthuum more than a thousand years ago i came with my monks to yoros from ilcar the black empire of the north the emperor of ilcar had driven us forth for our cult of celibacy our worship of the maiden goddess ojhal were hateful to him here amid the desert of izdrel we built our monastery and dwelt unmolested we were many in number at first but the years went by and one by one the brothers were laid in the catacomb we had delved for our resting place they died with none to replace them i alone survived in the end for i had won such sanctity as ensures longevous days and had also become a master of the arts of sorcery time was a demon that i held at bay like one who stands in a charmed circle my powers were still hale and unimpaired and i lived on as an anchorite in the monastery at first the solitude was far from irksome to me and i was wholly absorbed in my study of the arcana of nature but after a time it seemed that such things no longer satisfied i grew aware of my loneliness and was much beset by the demons of the waste who had troubled me little heretofore succubi fair but baneful lamiae with the round soft bodies of women came to tempt me in the drear vigils of the night i resisted but there was one shedevil more cunning than the others who crept into my ceil in the semblance of a girl i had loved long ago ere yet i had taken the vow of ojhal to her i succumbed and of the unholy union was born the halfhuman fiend ujuk who has since called himself the abbot of puthuum after that sin i wished to die and the wish was manifoldly strengthened when i beheld the progeny of the sin too greatly however had i offended ojhal and a frightful penance was decreed for me i lived and daily i was plagued and persecuted by the monster ujuk who grew lustily in the manner of such offspring but when ujuk had gained his full stature there came upon me such weakness and decrepitude as made me hopeful of death scarce could i stir in my impotence and ujuk taking advantage of this bore me in his horrid arms to the catacomb and laid me among the dead here i have remained ever since dying and rotting eternally and yet eternally alive for almost a millennium i have suffered unsleepingly the dire anguish of repentance that brings no expiation through the powers of saintly and sorcerous vision that never left me i was doomed to watch the foul deeds the helldark iniquities of ujuk wearing the guise of an abbot endowed with strange infernal powers together with a kind of immortality he has presided over puthuum through the centuries his enchantments have kept the monastery hidden save from those that he wishes to draw within reach of his ghoulish hunger his incubuslike desires men he devours and women are made to serve his lust and still i am condemned to see his turpitudes and the seeing is my most grievous punishment the whisper sank away and zobal who had listened in eldritch awe as one who hears the speech of a dead man was doubtful for a moment that uldor still lived then the sere voice went on archer i crave a boon from thee and i offer in return a thing that will aid thee against ujuk in thy quiver thou bearest charmed arrows and the wizardry of him that wrought them was good such arrows can slay the elseimmortal powers of evil they can slay ujuk and even such evil as endures in me and forbids me to die archer grant me an arrow through the heart and if that suffice not an arrow through the right eye and one through the left and leave the arrows in their mark for i deem that thou canst well spare so many one alone is needed for ujuk as to the monks thou hast seen i will tell thee a secret they are twelve in number but zobal would scarcely have believed the thing that uldor now unfolded if the events of the day had not left him beyond all incredulity the abbot continued when i am wholly dead take thou the talisman which depends about my neck the talisman is a touchstone that will dissolve such ill enchantments as have a material seeming if applied thereto with the hand for the first time zobal perceived the talisman which was an oval of plain gray stone lying upon uldors withered bosom on a chain of biack silver make haste o archer the whispering implored zobal had socketed his torch in the pile of moldering bones beside uldor with a sense of mingled compulsion and reluctance he drew an arrow from his quiver notched it and aimed unflinchingly down at uldors heart the shaft went straightly and deeply into its mark and zobal waited but anon from the retracted lips of the black abbot there issued a faint murmuring archer another arrow again the bow was drawn and a shaft sped unerringly into the hollow orbit of uldors right eye and again after an interval there came the almost inaudible pleading archer still another shaft once more the bow of ironwood sang in the silent vault and an arrow stood in the left eye of uldar quivering with the force of its propulsion this time there was no whisper from the rotting lips but zobal heard a curious rustling and a sigh as of lapsing sand beneath his gaze the black limbs and body crumbled swiftly the face and head fell in and the three arrows sagged awry since there was naught now but a pile of dust and parting bones to hold them embedded leaving the arrows as uldor had enjoined him to do zobal groped for the gray talisman that was now buried amid those fallen relics finding it he hung it carefully at his belt beside the long straight sword which he carried perhaps he reflected the thing might have its use ere the night was over quickly he turned away and climbed the steps to the courtyard a saffronyellow and lopsided moon was soaring above the wall and he knew by this that he had been absent overlong fmm his vigil with cushara all however seemed tranquil the drowsing animals had not stirred and the monastery was dark and soundless seizing a full wineskin and a bag containing such edibles as cushara had asked him to bring zobal hurried back to the open hall even as he passed into the building the arraslike silence before him was burst asunder by a frightful hubbub he distinguished amid the clamor the screaming of rubalsa the screeching of simban and the furious roaring of cushara but above these as if to drown them all an obscene laughter mounted continually like the welling forth of dark subterrene waters thick and foul with the fats of corruption zobal dropped the wineskin and the sack of comestibles and raced forward unslinging his bow as he went the outcries of his companions continued but he heard them faintly now above the damnable incubuslike laughter that swelled as if to fill the whole monastery as he neared the space before rubalsas chamber he saw cushara beating with the haft of his pike at a blank wall in which there was no longer a hempencurtained doorway behind the wall the screeching of simban ceased in a gurgling moan like that of some butchered steer but the girls terrorsharpened cries still mounted through the smothering cachinnation this wall was wrought by demons raged the pike bearer as he smote vainly at the smooth masonry i kept a faithful watch but they built it behind me in a silence as of the dead and a fouler work is being done in that chamber master thy frenzy said zobal as he strove to regain the command of his own faculties amid the madness that threatened to overwhelm him at that instant he recalled the oval gray touchstone of uldor which hung at his baldric from its black silver chain and it came to him that the closed wall was perhaps an unreal enchantment against which the talisman might serve even as uldor had said quickly he took the touchstone in his fingers and held it to the blank surface where the doorway had been cushara looked on with an air of stupefaction as if deeming the archer demented but even as the talisman clicked faintly against it the wall seemed to dissolve leaving only a rude arras that fell away in tatters as if it too had been no more than a sorcerous illusion the strange disintegration continued to spread the whole partition melted away to a few worn blocks and the gibbous moon shone in as the abbey of puthuum crumbled silently to a gapped and roofless ruin all this had occurred in a few moments but the warriors found no room for wonder by the livid light of the moon which peered down like the face of a wormgnawed cadaver they looked upon a scene so hideous that it caused them to forget all else before them on a cracked floor from whose interstices grew desert grasses the eunuch simban lay sprawled in death his raiment was torn to streamers and bood bubbled darkly from his mangled throat even the leather pouches which he bore at his girdle had been ripped open and gold coins vials of medicine and other oddments were scattered around him beyond by the halfcrumbled outer wall rubalsa lay in a litter of rotted cloth and woodwork which had been the gorgeously quilted ebon bed she was trying to fend off with her lifted hands the enormously swollen shape that hung horizontally above her as if levitated by the floating winglike folds of its saffron robe this shape the warriors recognized as the abbot ujuk the overwelling laughter of the black incubus had ceased and he turned upon the intruders a face contorted by diabolic lust and fury his teeth clashed audibly his eyes glowed in their pouches like beads of redhot metal as he withdrew from his position over the girl and loomed monstrously erect before her amid the ruins of the chamber cushara rushed foreward with leveled pike ere zobal could fit one of his arrows to the string but even as the pikebearer crossed the sill it seemed that the foully bloated form of ujuk multiplied itself in a dozen yellowgarmented shapes that surged to meet cusharas onset appearing as if by some hellish legerdemain the monks of puthuum had mustered to assist their abbot zobal cried out in warning but the shapes were all about cushara dodging the thrusts of his weapon and clawing ferociously at his platearmor with their terrific threeinch talons valiantly he fought them only to go down after a little and disappear from sight as if whelmed by a pack of ravening hyenas remembering the scarce credible thing that uldor had told him zobal wasted no arrows upon the monks his bow ready he waited for full sight of ujuk beyond the seething rout that mangled malignantly back and forth above the fallen pikebearer in an eddying of the pack he aimed swiftly at the looming incubus who seemed wholly intent on that fiendish struggie as if directing it in some wise without spoken word or ponderable gesture straight and true the arrow sped with an exultant singing and good was the sorcery of amdok who had wrought it for ujuk reeled and went down his horrid fingers tearing vainly at the shaft that was driven nigh to its fledging of eaglequills in his body now a strange thing occurred for as the incubus fell and writhed to and fro in his dying the twelve monks all dropped away from cushara tossing convulsively on the floor as if they were but shaken shadows of the thing that died it seemed to zobal that their forms grew dim and diaphanous and he saw the cracks in the flagstones beyond them and their writhings lessened with those of ujuk and when ujuk lay still at last the faint outlines of the figures vanished as if erased from earth and air naught remained but the noisome bulk of that fiend who had been the progeny of the abbot uldor and the lamia and the bulk shrank visibly from instant to instant beneath its sagging garments and a smell of ripe corruption arose as if all that was human in the hellish thing were rotting swiftly away cushara had scrambled to his feet and was peering about in a stunned fashion his heavy armor had saved him from the talons of his assailants but the armor itself was scored from greaves to helmet with innumerable scratches whither have the monks gone he inquired they were all about me an instant ago like so many wild dogs worrying a fallen aurochs the monks were but emanations of ujuk said zobal they were mere fantasms multiple eidola that he sent forth and withdrew into himself at will and they had no real existence apart from him with ujuks death they had become less than shadows verily such things are prodigious opined the pikebearer the warriors now turned their attention to rubalsa who had struggled to a sitting posture amid the downfallen wreckage of her bed the tatters of rotten quilting which she clutched about her with shamefast fingers at their approach served but little to conceal her wellrounded ivory nakedness she wore an air of mingled fright and confusion like a sleeper who has just awakened from some atrocious nightmare had the incubus harmed thee inquired zobal anxiously he was reassured by her faint bewildered negative dropping his eyes before the piteous disarray of her girlish beauty he felt in his heart a deeper enamorment than before a passion touched with such tenderness as he had never known in the hot brief loves of his hazardhaunted days eyeing cushara covertly he knew with dismay that this emotion was shared to the fullest by his comrade the warriors now withdrew to a little distance and turned their backs decorously while rubalsa dressed i deem said zobal in a low voice beyond overhearing of the girl that thou and i tonight have met and conquered such perils as were not contracted for in our service to hoaraph and i deem that we are of one mind concerning the maiden and love her too dearly now to deliver her to the captious lust of a sated king therefore we cannot return to faraad if it piease thee we shall draw lots for the girl and the loser will attend the winner as a true comrade till such time as we have made our way from izdrel and have crossed the border of some land lying beyond hoaraphs rule to this cushara agreed when rubalsa had finished her dressing the two began to look about them for such objects as might serve in the proposed sortilege cushara would have tossed one of the gold coins stamped with hoaraphs image which had rolled from simbans torn moneybag but zobal shook his head at the suggestion having espied certain items which he thought even more exquisitely appropriate than the coin these objects were the talons of the incubus whose corpse had now dwindled in size and was horribly decayed with a hideous wrinkling of the whole head and an actual shortening of the members in this process the claws of hands and feet had all dropped away and were lying loose on the pavement removing his helmet zobal stooped down and placed with it the five hellishlooking talons of the right hand among which that of the index finger was the longest he shook the helmet vigorously as one shakes a dicebox and there was a sharp clattering from the claws then he held the helmet out to cushara saying he who draws the forefinger talon shall take the girl cushara put in his hand and withdrew it quickly holding aloft the heavy thumbnail which was shortest of all zobal drew the nail of the middle finger and cushara at his second trial brought forth the little fingers claw then to the deep chagrin of the pikebearer zobal produced the dearly coveted index talon rubalsa who had been watching this singular procedure with open curiosity now said to the warriors what are ye doing zobal started to explain but before he had finished the girl cried out indignantly neither of ye has consulted my preference in this matter then pouting prettily she turned away from the disconcerted archer and flung her arms about the neck of cushara
