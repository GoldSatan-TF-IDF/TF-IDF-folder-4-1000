the fiddler chapter i phil the fiddler viva garibaldi sang a young italian boy in an uptown street accompanying himself on a violin which from its battered appearance seemed to have met with hard usage as the young singer is to be the hero of my story i will pause to describe him he was twelve years old but small of his age his complexion was a brilliant olive with the dark eyes peculiar to his race and his hair black in spite of the dirt his face was strikingly handsome especially when lighted up by a smile as was often the case for in spite of the hardships of his lot and these were neither few nor light filippo was naturally merry and lighthearted he wore a velveteen jacket and pantaloons which atoned by their extra length for the holes resulting from hard usage and antiquity his shoes which appeared to be wholly unacquainted with blacking were like his pantaloons two or three sizes too large for him making it necessary for him to shuffle along ungracefully it was now ten oclock in the morning two hours had elapsed since filippo or phil as i shall call him for the benefit of my readers unfamiliar with italian names had left the miserable home in crosby street where he and forty other boys lived in charge of a middleaged italian known as the padrone of this person and the relations between him and the boys i shall hereafter speak at present i propose to accompany phil though he had wandered about singing and playing for two hours phil had not yet received a penny this made him somewhat uneasy for he knew that at night he must carry home a satisfactory sum to the padrone or he would be brutally beaten and poor phil knew from sad experience that this hard taskmaster had no mercy in such cases the block in which he stood was adjacent to fifth avenue and was lined on either side with brownstone houses it was quiet and but few passed through it during the busy hours of the day but phils hope was that some money might be thrown him from a window of some of the fine houses before which he played but he seemed likely to be disappointed for he played ten minutes without apparently attracting any attention he was about to change his position when the basement door of one of the houses opened and a servant came out bareheaded and approached him phil regarded her with distrust for he was often ordered away as a nuisance he stopped playing and hugging his violin closely regarded her watchfully youre to come in said the girl abruptly che cosa volete said phil suspiciously what do you want i dont understand your italian rubbish said the girl youre to come into the house in general boys of phils class are slow in learning english after months and even years sometimes their knowledge is limited to a few words or phrases on the other hand they pick up french readily and as many of them en route for america spend some weeks or months in the french metropolis it is common to find them able to speak the language somewhat phil however was an exception and could manage to speak english a little though not as well as he could understand it what for i go he asked a little distrustfully my young master wants to hear you play on your fiddle said the servant hes sick and cant come out all right said phil using one of the first english phrases he had caught i will go come along then phil followed his guide into the basement thence up two flight of stairs and along a handsome hall into a chamber the little fiddler who had never before been invited into a fine house looked with admiration at the handsome furniture and especially at the pictures upon the wall for like most of his nation he had a love for whatever was beautiful whether in nature or art the chamber had two occupants one a boy of twelve years was lying in a bed propped up by pillows his thin pale face spoke of long sickness and contrasted vividly with the brilliant brown face of the little italian boy who seemed the perfect picture of health sitting beside the bed was a lady of middle age and pleasant expression it was easy to see by the resemblance that she was the mother of the sick boy phil looked from one to the other uncertain what was required of him can you speak english asked mrs leigh si signora a little answered our hero my son is sick and would like to hear you play a little and sing too added the sick boy from the bed phil struck up the song he had been singing in the street a song well known to all who have stopped to listen to the boys of his class with the refrain viva garibaldi his voice was clear and melodious and in spite of the poor quality of his instrument he sang with so much feeling that the effect was agreeable the sick boy listened with evident pleasure for he too had a taste for music i wish i could understand italian he said i think it must be a good song perhaps he can sing some english song suggested mrs leigh can you sing in english she asked phil hesitated a moment and then broke into the common street ditty shoe fly dont bouder me giving a quaint sound to the words by his italian accent do you know any more asked henry leigh when our hero had finished not english said phil shaking his head you ought to learn more i can play more said phil but i know not the words then play some tunes thereupon the little italian struck up yankee doodle which he played with spirit and evident enjoyment do you know the name of that asked henry phil shook his head it is yankee doodle phil tried to pronounce it but the words in his mouth had a droll sound and made them laugh how old are you asked henry twelve years then you are quite as old as i am i wish you were as well and strong as he seems to be said mrs leigh sighing as she looked at henrys pale face that was little likely to be always a delicate child henry had a year previous contracted a cold which had attacked his lungs and had gradually increased until there seemed little doubt that in the long struggle with disease nature must succumb and early death ensue how long have you been in this country un anno how long is that a year said henry i know that because annus means a year in latin si signor a year said phil and where do you come from da napoli that means from naples i suppose si signor most of the little italian musicians to be found in our streets are brought from calabria the southern portion of italy where they are purchased from their parents for a fixed sum or rate of annual payment but it is usual for them when questioned to say that they come from naples that being the principal city in that portion of italy or indeed in the entire kingdom who do you live with continued henry with the padrone and who is the padrone he take care of me he bring me from italy is he kind to you phil shrugged his shoulders he beat me sometimes he answered beats you what for if i bring little money does he beat you hard si signor with a stick he must be a bad man said henry indignantly how much money must you carry home two dollars but it isnt your fault if people will not give you money non importa he beat me he ought to be beaten himself phil shrugged his shoulders like most boys of his class to him the padrone seemed allpowerful the idea that his oppressive taskmaster should be punished for his cruelty had never dawned upon him knowing nothing of any law that would protect him he submitted to it as a necessity from which there was no escape except by running away he had not come to that yet but some of his companions had done so and he might some day after this conversation he played another tune mrs leigh drew out her purse and gave him fifty cents phil took his fiddle under his arm and following the servant who now reappeared emerged into the street and moved onward chapter ii phil and his protector to a certain extent phil was his own master that is he was at liberty to wander where he liked provided he did not neglect his business and returned to the lodginghouse at night with the required sum of money but woe to him if he were caught holding back any of the money for his own use in that case he would be beaten and sent to bed without his supper while the padrone according to the terms of his contract with the distant parent would withhold from the amount due the latter ten times the sum kept by the boy in the middle of the day he was allowed to spend three cents for bread which was the only dinner allowed him of course the boys were tempted to regale themselves more luxuriously but they incurred a great risk in doing so sometimes the padrone followed them secretly or employed others to do so and so was able to detect them besides they traveled in general by twos and threes and the system of espionage was encouraged by the padrone so mutual distrust was inspired and the fear of being reported made the boys honest phil left the house of mr leigh in good spirits though he had earned nothing before the fifty cents he had just received made a good beginning and inspired in him the hope of getting together enough to save him a beating for one night at least he walked down toward sixth avenue and turning the corner walked down town at length he paused in front of a tobacconists shop and began to play but he had chosen an unfortunate time and place the tobacconist had just discovered a deficiency in his money account which he suspected to be occasioned by the dishonesty of his assistant in addition to this he had risen with a headache so that he was in a decidedly bad humor music had no charms for him at that moment and he no sooner heard the first strains of phils violin than he rushed from the shop bareheaded and dashed impetuously at the young fiddler get away from my shop you little vagabond he cried if i had my way you should all be sent out of the country phil was quick to take a hint he saw the menace in the shopkeepers eyes and stopping abruptly ran farther down the street hugging his fiddle which he was afraid the angry tobacconist might seize and break this to him would be an irreparable misfortune and subject him to a severe punishment though the fault would not be his next he strolled into a side street and began to play in front of some dwellinghouses two or three young children who had been playing in the street gathered about him and one of them gave him a penny they were clamorous for another tune but phil could not afford to work for nothing and seeing no prospects of additional pay took his violin and walked away much to the regret of his young auditors who though not rich were appreciative they followed him to the end of the block hoping that he would play again but they were disappointed phil played two or three times more managing to obtain in all twentyfive cents additional he reached the corner of thirteenth street just as the large public school known as the thirteenth street school was dismissed for its noon intermission give us a tune johnny cried edward eustis one of the oldest boys yes a tune joined in several others this was an invitation to which phil was always willing to respond besides he knew from experience that boys were more generous in proportion to their means than those of larger growth and he hoped to get enough from the crowd around him to increase his store to a dollar the boys gathered around the little minstrel who struck up an italian tune but without the words sing sing cried the boys phil began to sing his clear fresh voice produced a favorable impression upon the boys hes a bully singer said one i cant sing much better myself you sing your singing would be enough to scare a dozen tom cats then we should be well matched look here johnny cant you sing something in english phil in response to this request played and sang shoo fly which suiting the boys taste he was called upon to repeat the song being finished edward eustis took off his cap and went around the circle now boys you have a chance to show your liberality he said ill start the collection with five cents thats ahead of me said james marcus justice to a large and expensive family will prevent me contributing anything more than two cents the smallest favors thankfully received said edward then take that and be thankful said tom lane dropping in a penny i havent got any money said frank gaylord but heres an apple and he dropped a large red apple into the cap phil watching with interest the various contributions was best pleased with the last the money he must carry to the padrone the apple he might keep for himself and it would vary agreeably his usual meager fare the biggest contribution yet said edward here sprague you are liberal whatll you give my note at ninety days you might fail before it comes due then take three cents tis all i have i can no more though poor the offering be oh dont quote shakespeare it isnt shakespeare its milton just as much one as the other here johnny said edward after going the rounds hold your hands and ill pour out the money you can retire from business now on a fortune phil was accustomed to be addressed as johnny that being the generic name for boy in new york he deposited the money in his pocket and taking his fiddle played once more in acknowledgment of the donation the boys now dispersed leaving phil to go on his way he took out the apple with the intention of eating it when a rude boy snatched it from his hand give it back said phil angrily dont you wish you may get it said the other holding it out of his reach the young musician had little chance of redress his antagonist was a head taller than himself and besides he would not have dared lay down his fiddle to fight lest it might be broken give it to me he said stamping his foot i mean to eat it myself said the other coolly its too good for the likes of you youre a thief dont you call me names you little italian ragamuffin or ill hit you said the other menacingly it is my apple im going to eat it but the speaker was mistaken as he held the apple above his head it was suddenly snatched from him he looked around angrily and confronted edward eustis who seeing phils trouble from a little distance had at once come to his rescue what did you do that for demanded the thief what did you take the boys apple for because i felt like it then i took it from you for the same reason do you want to fight blustered the rowdy not particularly then hand me back that apple returned the other thank you i shall only hand it to the rightful owner that little italian boy are you not ashamed to rob him do you want to get hit i wouldnt advise you to do it the rowdy looked at the boy who confronted him edward was slightly smaller but there was a determined look in his eye which the bully who like those of his class generally was a coward at heart did not like he mentally decided that it would be safer not to provoke him come here johnny and take your apple said edward phil advanced and received back his property with satisfaction youd better eat it now ill see that he doesnt disturb you phil followed the advice of his new friend promptly he had eaten nothing since seven oclock and then only a piece of dry bread and cheese and the apple a rare luxury he did not fail to relish his wouldbe robber scowled at him meanwhile for he had promised himself the pleasure of dispatching the fruit edward stood by till the apple was eaten and then turned away the rowdy made a movement as if to follow phil but edward quickly detected him and came back dont you dare touch him he said significantly or youll have to settle accounts with me do you see that policeman i am going to ask him to have an eye on you youd better look out for yourself the other turned at the caution and seeing the approach of one of the metropolitan police quickly vanished he had a wholesome fear of these guardians of the public peace and did not care to court their attention edward turned away but in a moment felt a hand tugging at his coat looking around he saw that it was phil grazia signore said phil gratefully i suppose that means thank you phil nodded all right johnny i am glad i was by to save you from that bully chapter iii giacomo after eating the apple phil decided to buy his frugal dinner he therefore went into a bakers shop and bought two penny rolls and a piece of cheese it was not a very luxurious repast but with the apple it was better than usual a few steps from the shop door he met another italian boy who was bound to the same padrone how much money have you giacomo asked phil speaking of course in his native tongue forty cents how much have you a dollar and twenty cents you are very lucky filippo a rich signora gave me fifty cents for playing to her sick boy then i sang for some schoolboys and they gave me some money i am afraid the padrone will beat me tonight he has not beat me for a week have you had dinner filippo yes i had some bread and cheese and an apple did you buy the apple no one of the schoolboys gave it to me it was very good said phil in a tone of enjoyment i had not eaten one for a long time nor i do you remember filippo the oranges we had in italy i remember them well i was happy then said giacomo sighing there was no padrone to beat me and i could run about and play now i have to sing and play all day i am so tired sometimes so tired filippo you are not so strong as i giacomo said phil looking with some complacency at his own stout limbs dont you get tired filippo yes often but i dont care so much for that but i dont like the winter i thought i should die with cold sometimes last winter said giacomo shuddering do you ever expect to go back to italy filippo sometime i wish i could go now i should like to see my dear mother and my sisters and your father i dont want to see him said giacomo bitterly he sold me to the padrone my mother wept bitterly when i went away but my father only thought of the money filippo and giacomo were from the same town in calabria they were the sons of italian peasants who had been unable to resist the offers of the padrone and for less than a hundred dollars each had sold his son into the cruelest slavery the boys were torn from their native hills from their families and in a foreign land were doomed to walk the streets from fourteen to sixteen hours in every twentyfour gathering money from which they received small benefit many times as they trudged through the streets weary and hungry sometimes cold they thought with homesick sadness of the sunny fields in which their earliest years had been passed but the hard realities of the life they were now leading soon demanded their attention naturally lighthearted filippo or phil bore his hard lot more cheerfully than some of his comrades but giacomo was more delicate and less able to bear want and fatigue his livelier comrade cheered him up and giacomo always felt better after talking with phil as the two boys were walking together a heavy hand was laid on the shoulder of each and a harsh voice said is this the way you waste your time little rascals both boys started and looking up recognized the padrone he was a short man very dark with fierce black eyes and a sinister countenance it was his habit to walk about the streets from time to time and keep a watch unobserved upon his young apprentices if they may be so called if he found them loitering about or neglecting their work they were liable to receive a sharp reminder the boys were both startled at his sudden appearance but after the first start phil who was naturally courageous recovered his selfpossession not so with giacomo who was the more afraid because he knew he had gained but little money thus far we are not wasting our time padrone said phil looking up fearlessly we will see about that how long have you been together only five minutes how much money have you filippo a dollar and twenty cents good you have done well and how is it with you giacomo i have forty cents then you have been idle said the padrone frowning no signore said the boy trembling i have played but they did not give me much money it is not his fault said phil coming boldly to the defense of his friend attend to your own affairs little scrapegrace said the padrone roughly he might have got as much as you no padrone i was lucky a kind lady gave me fifty cents that is not my affair i dont care where you get the money but if you dont bring home all i expect you shall feel the stick these last words were addressed to giacomo who understood their import only too well in the miserable lodging where he herded with thirty or forty others scarcely a night passed without the brutal punishment of one or more unfortunate boys who had been unsuccessful in bringing home enough to satisfy the rapacity of the padrone but of this an account will hereafter be given now go to work both of you said the padrone harshly the two boys separated giacomo went uptown while phil kept on his way toward the astor house the padrone made his way to the nearest liquor shop where he invested a portion of the money wrung from the hard earnings of his young apprentices toward the close of the afternoon phil found himself in front of the astor house he had played several times but was not fortunate in finding liberal auditors he had secured but ten cents during this time and it seemed doubtful whether he would reach the sum he wanted he crossed over to the city hall park and feeling tired sat down on one of the benches two bootblacks were already seated upon it play us a tune johnny said one will you give me pennies asked phil doubtfully for he did not care with such a severe taskmaster to work for nothing yes well give you pennies upon this phil struck up a tune wheres your monkey asked one of the boys i have no monkey if you want a monkey heres one for you said tim rafferty putting his hand on his companions shoulder hes too big said phil laughing hould yer gab tim rafferty said the other its you thatll make a better monkey nor i say johnny do you pay your monkeys well give me my pennies said phil with an eye to business play another tune then phil obeyed directions when he had finished a contribution was taken up but it only amounted to seven cents however considering the character of the audience this was as much as could be expected how much have you made today johnny asked tim a dollar said phil a dollar thats more nor i have made i tell you what boys i think ill buy a fiddle myself ill make more money that way than blackin boots a great fiddler youd make tim rafferty cant i play then lend me your fiddle johnny till i try it a little phil shook his head give it to me now i wont be hurtin it youll break it then ill pay for it it isnt mine whose is it then the padrones and whos the padrone the man i live with if the fiddle is broken he will beat me then hes an ould haythen and you may tell him so with tim raffertys compliments but i wont hurt it phil however feared to trust the violin in unskillful hands he knew the penalty if any harm befell it and he had no mind to run the risk so he rose from the seat and withdrew to a little distance tim rafferty following for though he cared little at first he now felt determined to try the fiddle if you dont give it to me ill put a head on you he said you shall not have it said phil firmly for he too could be determined the little chaps showing fight said tims companion look out tim hell mash you i can fight him wid one hand said tim he advanced upon our young hero who being much smaller would probably have been compelled to yield to superior force but for an interference entirely unexpected by tim chapter iv an invitation to supper tim had raised his fist to strike the young fiddler when he was suddenly pushed aside with considerable force and came near measuring his length on the ground who did that he cried angrily recovering his equilibrium i did it said a calm voice tim recognized in the speaker paul hoffman whom some of my readers will remember as paul the peddler paul was proprietor of a necktie stand below the astor house and was just returning home to supper he was a brave and manly boy and his sympathies were always in favor of the oppressed he had met phil before and talked with him and seeing him in danger came to his assistance what made you push me demanded tim fiercely what were you going to do to him rejoined paul indicating the italian boy i was only goin to borrer his fiddle he would have broken it said phil you dont know how to play said paul you would have broken his fiddle and then he would be beaten i would pay for it if i did said tim you say so but you wouldnt even if you did it would take time and the boy would have suffered what business is that of yours demanded tim angrily it is always my business when i see a big boy teasing a little one youll get hurt some day said tim suddenly not by you returned paul not particularly alarmed tim would have gladly have punished paul on the spot for his interference but he did not consider it prudent to provoke hostilities paul was as tall as himself and considerably stronger he therefore wisely confined himself to threatening words come along with me phil said paul kindly to the little fiddler thank you for saving me said phil gratefully the padrone would beat me if the fiddle was broke never mind about thanks phil tim is a bully with small boys but he is a coward among large ones have you had any supper no said phil wont you come home and take supper with me phil hesitated you are kind he said but i fear the padrone what will he do to you he will beat me if i dont bring home enough money how much more must you get sixty cents you can play better after a good supper come along i wont keep you long phil made no more objection he was a healthy boy and his wanderings had given him a good appetite so he thanked paul and walked along by his side one object paul had in inviting him was the fear that tim rafferty might take advantage of his absence to renew his assault upon phil and with better success than before how old are you phil he asked twelve years and who taught you to play no one i heard the other boys play and so i learned do you like it sometimes but i get tired of it i dont wonder i should think playing day after day might tire you what are you going to do when you become a man phil shrugged his shoulders i dont know he said i think ill go back to italy have you any relations there i have a mother and two sisters and a father yes a father why did they let you come away the padrone gave my father money dont you hear anything from home no signore i am not a signore said paul smiling you may call me paul is that an italian name me call it paolo that sounds queer to me whats james in italian giacomo then i have a little brother giacomo how old is he eight years old my sister bettina is eight years i wish i could see her you will see her again some day phil you will get rich in america and go back to sunny italy the padrone takes all my money youll get away from the old rascal some day keep up good courage phil and all will come right but here we are follow me upstairs and i will introduce you to my mother and giacomo said paul laughing at the italian name he had given his little brother mrs hoffman and jimmy looked with some surprise at the little fiddler as he entered with paul mother said paul this is one of my friends whom i have invited to take supper with us he is welcome said mrs hoffman kindly have you ever spoken to us of him i am not sure his name is phil phil the fiddler we call him filippo said the young musician we will call you phil it is easier to speak said paul this is my little brother jimmy he is a great artist now you are laughing at me paul said the little boy well he is going to be a great artist some day if he isnt one yet do you think jimmy you could draw phil here with his fiddle i think i could said the little boy slowly looking carefully at their young guest but it would take some time perhaps phil will come some day and give you a sitting will you come asked jimmy i will come some day meanwhile mrs hoffman was preparing supper since paul had become proprietor of the necktie stand as described in the last volume they were able to live with less regard to economy than before so when the table was spread it presented quite a tempting appearance beefsteak rolls fried potatoes coffee and preserves graced the board supper is ready paul said his mother when all was finished here phil you may sit here at my right hand said paul i will put your violin where it will not be injured phil sat down as directed not without feeling a little awkward yet with a sense of anticipated pleasure accustomed to bread and cheese alone the modest repast before him seemed like a royal feast the meat especially attracted him for he had not tasted any for months indeed seldom in his life for in italy it is seldom eaten by the class to which phils parents belonged let me give you some meat phil said paul now shall we drink the health of the padrone in coffee i will not drink his health said phil he is a bad man who is the padrone asked jimmy curiously he is my master he sends me out to play for money and must you give all the money you make to him yes if i do not bring much money he will beat me then he must be a bad man why do you live with him he bought me from my father he bought you repeated jimmy puzzled he hires him for so much money explained paul but why did your father let you go with a bad man asked jimmy he wanted the money said phil he cared more for money than for me what wonder that the boys sold into such cruel slavery should be estranged from the fathers who for a few paltry ducats sell the liberty and happiness of their children even where the contract is for a limited terms of years the boys in five cases out of ten are not returned at the appointed time a part unable to bear the hardships and privations of the life upon which they enter are swept off by death while of those that survive a part are weaned from their homes or are not permitted to go back you must not ask too many questions jimmy said mrs hoffman fearing that he might awaken sad thoughts in the little musician she was glad to see that phil ate with a good appetite in truth he relished the supper which was the best he remembered to have tasted for many a long day is italy like america asked jimmy whose curiosity was excited to learn something of phils birthplace it is much nicer said phil with a natural love of country there are olive trees and orange trees and grapes very many are there really orange trees have you seen them grow i have picked them from the trees many times i should like that but i dont care for olives they are good too i should like the grapes there are other things in italy which you would like better jimmy said paul what do you mean paul the galleries of fine paintings yes i should like to see them have you seen them phil shook his head the picture galleries are in the cities and not in the country district where he was born sometime when i am rich we will all go to italy jimmy then if phil is at home we will go and see him i should like that paul though jimmy was not yet eight years old he had already exhibited a remarkable taste for drawing and without having received any instruction could copy any ordinary picture with great exactness it was the little boys ambition to become an artist and in this ambition he was encouraged by paul who intended as soon as he could afford it to engage an instructor for jimmy chapter v on the ferry boat when supper was over phil bethought himself that his days work was not yet over he had still a considerable sum to obtain before he dared go home if such a name can be given to the miserable tenement in crosby street where he herded with his companions but before going he wished to show his gratitude to paul for his protection and the supper which he had so much and so unexpectedly enjoyed shall i play for you he asked taking his violin from the top of the bureau where paul had placed it will you asked jimmy his eyes lighting up with pleasure we should be very glad to hear you said mrs hoffman phil played his best for he felt that he was playing for friends after a short prelude he struck into an italian song though the words were unintelligible the little party enjoyed the song bravo phil said paul you sing almost as well as i do jimmy laughed you sing about as well as you draw said the little boy there you go again with your envy and jealousy said paul in an injured tone others appreciate me better sing something and we will judge of your merits said his mother not now said paul shaking his head my feelings are too deeply injured but if he has time phil will favor us with another song so the little fiddler once more touched the strings of his violin and sang the hymn of garibaldi he has a beautiful voice said mrs hoffman to paul yes phil sings much better than most of his class shall i bring him up here again any time paul we shall always be glad to see him here phil took his cap and prepared to depart goodby he said in english i thank you all for your kindness will you come again said mrs hoffman we shall be glad to have you do come pleaded jimmy who had taken a fancy to the darkeyed italian boy whose brilliant brown complexion contrasted strongly with his own pale face and blue eyes these words gave phil a strange pleasure since his arrival in america he had become accustomed to harsh words and blows but words of kindness were strangers to his ears for an hour he forgot the street and his uninviting home and felt himself surrounded by a true home atmosphere he almost fancied himself in his calabrian home with his mother and sisters about him in his home as it was before cupidity entered his fathers heart and impelled him to sell his own flesh and blood into slavery in a foreign land phil could not analyze his own emotions but these were the feelings which rose in his heart and filed it with transient sadness i thank you much he said i will come again some day come soon phil said paul you know where my necktie stand is come there any afternoon between four and five and i will take you home to supper do you know the way out or shall i go with you i know the way said phil he went downstairs and once more found himself on the sidewalk it was but six oclock and five or six hours were still before him before he could feel at liberty to go home should he return too early he would be punished for losing the possible gains of the hour he had lost even if the sum he brought home were otherwise satisfactory so whatever may be his fatigue or however inclement the weather the poor italian boy is compelled to stay out till near midnight before he is permitted to return to the hard pallet on which only he can sleep off his fatigues again in the street phil felt that he must make up for lost time now six oclock is not a very favorable time for street music citizens who do business downtown have mostly gone home to dinner those who have not started are in haste and little disposed to heed the appeal of the young minstrel later the saloons will be well frequented and not seldom the young fiddlers may pick up a few sometimes a considerable number of pennies by playing at the doors of these places or within if they should be invited to enter but at six there is not much to be done after a little reflection phil determined to go down to fulton ferry and got on board the brooklyn steamboat he might get a chance to play to the passengers and some no doubt would give him something at any rate the investment would be small since for one fare or two cents he might ride back and forward several times as long as he did not step off the boat he therefore directed his steps toward the ferry and arrived just in time to go on board the boat the boat was very full so large a number of the people in brooklyn are drawn to new york by business and pleasure that the boats particularly in the morning from seven to nine and in the afternoon from five to seven go loaded down with foot passengers and carriages phil entered the ladies cabin though ostensibly confined to ladies use it was largely occupied also by gentlemen who did not enjoy the smoke which usually affects disagreeably the atmosphere of the cabin appropriated to their own sex our young musician knew that to children the hearts and purses of ladies are more likely to open than those of gentlemen and this guided him entering he found every seat taken he waited till the boat had started and then taking his position in the center of the rear cabin he began to play and sing fixing at once the attention of the passengers upon himself that boys a nuisance he ought not to be allowed to play on the boat muttered an old gentleman looking up from the columns of the evening post now papa said a young lady at his side why need you object to the poor boy i am sure he sings very nicely i like to hear him i dont you know papa you have no taste for music why you went to sleep at the opera the other evening i tried to said her father in whom musical taste had a very limited development it was all nonsense to me he is singing the hymn of garibaldi what a sweet voice he has such a handsome little fellow too he has a dirty face and his clothes are quite ragged but he has beautiful eyes see how brilliant they are no wonder he is dirty and ragged it isnt his fault poor boy i have no doubt he has a miserable home im going to give him something just as you like florence as i am not a romantic young damsel i shall not follow your example by this time the song was finished and phil taking off his cap went the rounds none of the contributions were larger than five cents until he came to the young lady of whom we have spoken above she drew a twentyfivecent piece from her portemonnaie and put it into phils hand with a gracious smile which pleased the young fiddler as much as the gift welcome though that undoubtedly was thank you lady he said you sing very nicely she replied phil smiled and dirty though his face was the smile lighted it up with rare beauty do you often come on these boats asked the young lady sometimes but they do not always let me play said phil i hope i shall hear you again you have a good voice thank you signorina you can speak english i tried to speak with one of you the other day but he could only speak italian i know a few words signorina i hope i shall see you again and the young lady prompted by a natural impulse of kindness held out her hand to the little musician he took it respectfully and bending over touched it with his lips the young lady to whom this was quite unexpected smiled and blushed by no means offended but she glanced round her to see whether it was observed by others upon my word florence said her father as phil moved away you have got up quite a scene with this little ragged musician i am rather glad he is not ten or twelve years older or there might be a romantic elopement now papa you are too bad said florence just because i choose to be kind to a poor neglected child you fancy all sorts of improbable things i dont know where you get all your foolish romance from not from me i am sure i should think not said florence laughing merrily your worst enemy wont charge you with being romantic papa i hope not said her father shrugging his shoulders but the boat has touched the pier shall we go on shore or have you any further business with your young italian friend not today papa the passengers vacated the boat and were replaced by a smaller number on their way from brooklyn to new york chapter vi the barroom phil did not leave the boat he lingered in the cabin until the passengers were seated and after the boat was again under way began to play this time however he was not as fortunate as before while in the midst of a tune one of the men employed on the boat entered the cabin at times he would not have interfered with him but he happened to be in ill humor and this proved unfortunate for phil stop your noise boy he said phil looked up may i not play no nobody wants to hear you the young fiddler did not dare to disobey he saw that for the present his gains were at an end however he had enough to satisfy the rapacity of the padrone and could afford to stop he took a seat and waited quietly till the boat landed one of the lady passengers as she passed him on her way out of the cabin placed ten cents in his hand this led him to count up his gains he found they amounted to precisely two dollars and fifty cents i need not play any more he thought i shall not be beaten tonight he found his seat so comfortable especially after wandering about the streets all day that he remained on the boat for two more trips then taking his violin under his arm he went out on the pier it was halfpast seven oclock he would like to have gone to his lodging but knew that it would not be permitted in this respect the italian fiddler is not as well off as those who ply other street trades newsboys and bootblacks are their own masters and whether their earnings are little or great reap the benefit of them themselves they can stop work at six if they like or earlier but the little italian musician must remain in the street till near midnight and then after a long and fatiguing day he is liable to be beaten and sent to bed without his supper unless he brings home a satisfactory sum of money phil walked about here and there in the lower part of the city as he was passing a barroom he was called in by the barkeeper give us a tune boy he said it was a low barroom frequented by sailors and a rough set of customers of similar character the red face of the barkeeper showed that he drank very liberally and the atmosphere was filled with the fumes of bad cigars and bad liquor the men were ready for a good time as they called it and it was at the suggestion of one of them that phil had been invited in play a tune on your fiddle you little ragamuffin said one phil cared little how he was addressed he was at the service of the public and what he chiefly cared for was that he be paid for his services what shall i play he asked anything hiccoughed one its all the same to me i dont know one tune from another the young fiddler played one of the popular airs of the day he did not undertake to sing for the atmosphere was so bad that he could hardly avoid coughing he was anxious to get out into the street but he did not wish to refuse playing when he had finished his tune one of those present a sailor cried thats good step up boys and have a drink the invitation was readily accepted by all except phil noticing that the boy kept his place the sailor said step up boy and wet your whistle phil liked the weak wines of his native land but he did not care for the poisonous decoctions of be found in such places i am not thirsty he said yes you are here give this boy a glass of brandy i do not want it said phil you wont drink with us exclaimed the sailor who had then enough to be quarrelsome then ill make you and he brought down his fist so heavily upon the counter as to make the glasses rattle then ill make you here give me a glass and ill pour it down his throat the fiddler was frightened at his vehemence and darted to the door but the sailor was too quick for him overtaking phil he dragged him back with a rough grasp and held out his hand for the glass but an unexpected friend now turned up oh let the boy go jack said a fellow sailor if he dont want to drink dont force him but his persecutor was made ugly by his potations and swore that phil should drink before he left the barroom that he shall not said his new friend who is to prevent it demanded jack fiercely i will then ill pour a glass down your throat too returned jack menacingly no need of that i am ready enough to drink but the boy shant drink if he dont want to he shall retorted the first sailor with an oath still holding phil by the shoulder with one hand with the other he took a glass which had just been filled with brandy he was about to pour it down his throat when the glass was suddenly dashed from his hand and broke upon the floor with a fresh oath jack released his hold on phil and maddened with rage threw himself upon the other instantly there was a general melee phil did not wait to see the result he ran to the door and emerging into the street ran away till he had placed a considerable distance between himself and the disorderly and drunken party in the barroom the fight there continued until the police attracted by the noise forced an entrance and carried away the whole party to the stationhouse where they had a chance to sleep off their potations freed from immediate danger the young fiddler kept on his way he had witnessed such scenes before as he had often been into barrooms to play in the evening he had not been paid for his trouble but he cared little for that as the money would have done him no good he would only have been compelled to pass it over to the padrone these boys even at a tender age are necessarily made familiar with the darker side of metropolitan life vice and crime are displayed before their young eyes and if they do not themselves become vicious it is not for the want of knowledge and example it would be tedious to follow phil in his wanderings we have already had a glimpse of the manner in which the days passed with him only it is to be said that this was a favorable specimen he had been more fortunate in collecting money than usual besides he had had a better dinner than usual thanks to the apple and a supper such as he had not tasted for months about ten oclock as he was walking on the bowery he met giacomo his companion of the morning the little boy was dragging one foot after the other wearily there was a sad look on his young face for he had not been successful and he knew too well how he would be received by the padrone yet his face lighted up as he saw phil often before phil had encouraged him when he was despondent he looked upon our young hero as his only friend for there was no other of the boys who seemed to care for him or able to help him is it you filippo he said yes giacomo what luck have you had not much i have only a little more than a dollar i am so tired but i dont dare go back the padrone will beat me an idea came to phil he did not know how much money he had but he was sure it must be considerably more than two dollars why should he not give some to his friend to make up his deficiencies and so perhaps save him from punishment i have had better luck he said i have almost three dollars you are always luckier than i filippo i am stronger giacomo it does not tire me so much to walk about you can sing too i cannot sing very much and i do not get so much money tell me just how much money you have giacomo i have a dollar and thirty cents said giacomo after counting the contents of his pockets meanwhile phil had been doing the same thing the result of his count was that he found he had two dollars and eighty cents listen giacomo he said i will give you enough to make two dollars but then you will be beaten no i shall have two dollars and five cents left then neither of us will get beaten how kind you are filippo oh it is nothing besides i do not want to carry too much or the padrone will expect me to bring as much every day and that i cannot do so it will be better for us both the transfer was quickly made and the two boys kept together until they heard the clock strike eleven it was now so late that they determined to return to their miserable lodging for both were tired and longed for sleep chapter vii the home of the boys it was a quarterpast eleven when phil and giacomo entered the shabby brick house which they called home for want of a better from fifteen to twenty of their companions had already arrived and the padrone was occupied in receiving their several contributions the apartment was a mean one miserably furnished but seemed befitting the principal occupant whose dark face was marked by an expression of greed and alternately showed satisfaction or disappointment as the contents of the boys pockets were satisfactory or otherwise those who had done badly were set apart for punishment he looked up as the two boys entered well filippo he said harshly how much have you got phil handed over his earnings they were up to the required limit but the padrone looked only half satisfied is that all you have he asked suspiciously it is all signore you have not done well this afternoon then when i met you at twelve oclock you had more than a dollar it was because a good signora gave me fifty cents the padrone still suspicious plunging his hands into phils pockets but in vain he could not find another penny take off your shoes and stockings he said still unsatisfied phil obediently removed his shoes and stockings but no money was found concealed as the padrone half suspected sometimes these poor boys beset by a natural temptation secrete a portion of their daily earnings whenever they are detected woe betide them the padrone makes an example of them inflicting a cruel punishment in order to deter other boys from imitating them having discovered nothing he took phils violin and proceeded to giacomo now for you he said giacomo handed over his money the padrone was surprised in turn but his surprise was of a different nature he had expected to find him deficient knowing that he was less enterprising than phil he was glad to get more money than he expected but a little disappointed that he had no good excuse for beating him for he had one of those hard cruel natures that delight in inflicting pain and anguish upon others take care that you do as well tomorrow he said go and get your supper one of the larger boys was distributing bread and cheese to the hungry boys nearly all ate as if famished plain and uninviting as was the supper for they had been many hours without food but phil who as we know had eaten a good supper at mrs hoffmans felt very little appetite he slyly gave his bread to one of the boys who on account of the small sum he brought home had been sentenced to go without but the sharp eyes of the padrone which despite his occupation managed to see all that was going on detected this action and he became suspicious that phil had bought supper out of his earnings why did you give your bread to giuseppe he demanded because i was not hungry answered phil why were you not hungry did you buy some supper no signore then you should be hungry a kind lady gave me some supper how did it happen i knew her son his name is paolo he asked me to go home with him then he gave me a good supper how long were you there you might have been playing and brought me some more money said the padrone who with characteristic meanness grudged the young fiddler time to eat the meal that cost him nothing it was not long signore you can eat what is given you but you must not waste too much time a boy entered next who showed by his hesitating manner that he did not anticipate a good reception the padrone accustomed to judge by appearances instantly divined this well ludovico he said sharply what do you bring me pardon padrone said ludovico producing a small sum of money i could not help it seventyfive cents repeated the padrone indignantly you have been idle you little wretch no padrone indeed i did my best the people would not give me money where did you go i was in brooklyn you have spent some of the money no padrone you have been idle then no supper tonight pietro my stick pietro was one of the older boys he was ugly physically and his disposition corresponded with his appearance he could have few good traits or he would not have possessed the confidence of the padrone he was an efficient assistant of the latter and cooperated with him in oppressing the other boys indeed he was a nephew of the padrones and for this reason as well as his similarity of disposition he was treated with unusual indulgence whenever the padrone felt suspicious of any of the boys he usually sent them out in company with pietro who acted as a spy faithfully reporting all that happened to his principal pietro responded with alacrity to the command of the padrone and produced a stout stick which he handed to his uncle now strip off your jacket said the padrone harshly spare me padrone do not beat me it was not my fault said the unhappy ludovico imploringly take off your jacket repeated the padrone pitilessly one look of that hard face might have taught ludovico even if he had not witnessed the punishment so often inflicted on other boys that there was no hope for him help him pietro said the padrone pietro seized ludovicos jacket and pulled it off roughly then he drew off the ragged shirt which the boy wore underneath and his bare back was exposed to view hold him pietro in pietros firm grasp the boy was unable to stir the padrone whirled the stick aloft and brought it down upon the naked flesh leaving behind a fearful wheal ludovico shrieked aloud and again implored mercy but in vain for the stick descended again and again meanwhile the other boys looked on helpless to interfere the more selfish were glad that they had escaped though not at all sure but it would be their turn next evening there were others who felt a passive sympathy for their unlucky comrade others were filled with indignation at the padrone knowing how cruel and unjust were his exactions among these was phil possessed of a warm and sympathetic heart he never witnessed these cruel punishments without feeling that he would like to see the padrone suffering such pain as he inflicted upon others if i were only a man he often thought i would wrench the stick from his hand and give him a chance to feel it but he knew too well the danger of permitting his real sentiments to be reflected in his face it would only bring upon him a share of the same punishment without benefiting those who were unfortunate enough to receive it when ludovicos punishment was ended he was permitted to go to bed but without his supper nor was his the only case five other boys were subjected to the same punishment the stick had no want of exercise on that evening here were nearly forty boys subjected to excessive fatigue privation and brutal treatment daily on account of the greed of one man the hours that should been given in part to instruction and partly to such recreation as the youthful heart craves were devoted to a pursuit that did nothing to prepare them for the duties of life and this white slavery for it merits no better name is permitted by the law of two great nations italy is in fault in suffering this traffic in her children of tender years and america is guilty as well in not interfering as she might at all events to abridge the long hours of labor required of these boys and forcing their cruel guardians to give them some instruction one by one the boys straggled in by midnight all had returned and the boys were permitted to retire to their beds which were poor enough this however was the least of their troubles sound are the slumbers of young however hard the couch on which it rests especially when as with all the young italian boys the day has been one of fatigue chapter viii a cold day the events thus far recorded in the life of our young hero took place on a day toward the middle of october when the temperature was sufficiently mild to produce no particular discomfort in those exposed to it we advance our story two months and behold phil setting out for his days wandering on a morning in december when the keen blasts swept through the streets sending a shiver through the frames even of those who were well protected how much more then must it be felt by the young street musician who with the exception of a woolen tippet wore nothing more or warmer than in the warmer months yet phil with his natural vigorous frame was better able to bear the rigor of the winter weather than some of his comrades as giacomo to whom the long hours spent in the streets were laden with suffering and misery the two boys went about together when they dared to do so though the padrone objected but for what reason it did not seem manifest unless because he suspected that two would plan something prejudicial to his interests phil who was generally more successful than giacomo often made up his smaller comrades deficiencies by giving him a portion of his own gains it was a raw day only those who felt absolutely obliged to be out were to be seen in the streets but among these were our two little fiddlers whatever might be the weather they were compelled to expose themselves to its severity however the boys might suffer they must bring home the usual amount but at eleven oclock the prospects seemed rather discouraging they had but twentyfive cents between them nor would anyone stop to listen to their playing i wish it were night filippo said giacomo shivering with cold so do i giacomo are you very cold yes said the little boy his teeth chattering i wish i were back in italy it is never so cold there no giacomo you are right but i would not mind the cold so much if i had a warm overcoat like that boy pointing out a boy clad in a thick overcoat and a fur cap drawn over his ears while his hands were snugly incased in warm gloves he too looked at the two fiddlers and he could not help noticing how cold they looked look here you little chaps are you cold you look as if you had just come from greenland yes said phil we are cold your hands look red enough here is an old pair of gloves for one of you i wish i had another pair they are not very thick but they are better than none he drew a pair of worsted gloves from his pocket and handed them to phil thank you said phil but having received them he gave them to giacomo you are colder than i am giacomo he said take them but you are cold too filippo i will put my hands in my pockets dont mind me of course this conversation took place in italian for though phil had learned considerable english giacomo understood but a few words of it the gloves afforded some protection but still both boys were very cold they were in brooklyn having crossed the ferry in the morning they had wandered to a part not closely built up where they were less sheltered and experienced greater discomfort cant we go in somewhere and get warm pleaded giacomo here is a grocery store we will go in there phil opened the door and entered the shopkeeper a peevishlooking man with lightish hair stood behind the counter weighing out a pound of tea for a customer what do you want here you little vagabonds he exclaimed harshly as he saw the two boys enter we are cold said phil may we stand by your stove and get warm do you think i provide a fire for all the vagabonds in the city said the grocer with a brutal disregard of their evident suffering phil hesitated not knowing whether he was ordered out or not clear out of my store i say said the grocer harshly i dont want you in here do you understand at this moment a gentleman of prepossessing appearance entered the store he heard the grocers last words and their inhumanity made him indignant what do these boys want mr perkins he said they want to spend their time in my shop i have no room for such vagabonds we are cold said phil we only want to warm ourselves by the fire i dont want you here said the grocer irritably mr perkins said the gentleman sharply have you no humanity what harm can it do you to let these poor boys get warm by your fire it will cost you nothing it will not diminish your personal comfort yet you drive them out into the cold the grocer began to perceive that he was on the wrong tack the gentleman who addressed him was a regular and profitable customer and he did not like to incur his ill will which would entail loss they can stay mr pomeroy he said with an ill grace since you ask it i do not ask it i will not accept as a personal favor what you should have granted from a motive of humanity more especially as after this exhibition of your spirit i shall not trade here any longer by this time the grocer perceived that he had made a mistake i hope you will reconsider that mr pomeroy he said abjectly the fact is i had no objections to the boys warming themselves but they are mostly thieves and i could not keep my eyes on them all the time i think you are mistaken they dont look like thieves did you ever have anything stolen by one of this class of boys not that i know of said the grocer hesitatingly but it is likely they would steal if they got a chance we have no right to say that of anyone without good cause we never steal said phil indignantly for he understood what was said of course he says so sneered the grocer come and warm yourselves if you want to the boys accepted this grudging invitation and drew near the stove they spread out their hands and returning warmth proved very grateful to them have you been out long asked the gentleman who had interceded in their behalf also drawing near the stove since eight signore do you live in brooklyn no in new york and do you go out every day si signore how long since you came from italy a year would you like to go back he would said phil pointing to his companion i would like to stay here if i had a good home what kind of a home have you with whom do you live with the padrone i suppose that means your guardian yes sir answered phil is he kind to you he beats us if we do not bring home enough money your lot is a hard one what makes you stay with him dont the boys ever run away sometimes what does the padrone do in that case he tries to find them and if he does what then he beats them for a long time evidently your padrone is a brute why dont you complain to the police phil shrugged his shoulders and did not answer he evidently thought the suggestion an impracticable one these boys are wont to regard the padrone as above all law his power seems to them absolute and they never dream of any interference and indeed there is some reason for their cherishing this opinion however brutal his treatment i know of no case where the law has stepped in to rescue the young victim this is partly no doubt because the boys few of whom can speak the english language do not know their rights and seldom complain to outsiders never to the authorities probably in some cases the treatment is less brutal than i have depicted but from the best information i can obtain from trustworthy sources i fear that the reality if anything exceeds the picture i have drawn i think i should enjoy giving your padrone a horsewhipping said the gentleman impetuously can such things be permitted in the nineteenth century i have no doubt the little rascals deserve all they get said the grocer who would probably have found in the italian padrone a congenial spirit mr pomeroy deigned no reply to this remark well boys he said consulting his watch i must leave you here are twentyfive cents for each of you i have one piece of advice for you if your padrone beats you badly run away from him i would if i were in your place addio signore said the two boys i suppose that means goodby well goodby and better luck chapter ix pietro the spy though from motives of policy the grocer had permitted the boys to warm themselves by his fire he felt only the more incensed against them on this account and when mr pomeroy had gone determined to get rid of them havent you got warm yet he asked i cant have you in my way all day we will go said phil come giacomo he did not thank the grocer knowing how grudgingly permission had been given so they went out again into the chill air but they had got thoroughly warmed and were better able to bear it where shall we go filippo asked the younger boy we will go back to new york it is not so cold there giacomo unhesitatingly assented to whatever phil proposed he was not selfreliant like our hero but always liked to have someone to lean upon they made their way back to fulton ferry in a leisurely manner stopping here and there to play but it was a bad day for business the cold was such that no one stopped to give them anything except that one young man dropped ten cents in phils hand as he hurried by on his way home at length they reached the ferry the passengers were not so many in number as usual the cabin was so warm and comfortable that they remained on board for two or three trips playing each time in this way they obtained about thirty cents more they would have remained longer but that one of the deck hands asked how many times are you going across for two cents and this made them think it prudent to go when six oclock came giacomo asked phil who acted as treasurer how much money they had two dollars answered phil that is only one dollar for each yes giacomo then we shall be beaten said the little boy with a sigh i am afraid so and get no supper yes said phil unless he added we get some supper now with this money asked giacomo startled at the boldness of the suggestion yes we shall be beaten at any rate it will be no worse for us if we get some supper will you buy some bread no said phil daringly i am going to buy some meat what will the padrone say i shall not tell the padrone do you think he will find out no besides we ought to have some supper after walking about all day evidently phil had begun to think and the essential injustice of laboring without proper compensation had impressed his youthful mind giacomo was more timid he had not advanced as far as phil nor was he as daring but i have already said that he was guided in a great measure by phil and so it proved in this case phil having made up his mind set about carrying his plan into execution only a block distant was a cheap restaurant where plates of meat were supplied to a poor class of customers at ten cents per plate let us go in here he said giacomo followed but not without trepidation he knew that what they were about to do would be a heinous crime in the eyes of the padrone even phil had never ventured upon such direct rebellion before but mr pomeroys suggestion that he should run away was beginning to bear fruit in his mind he had not come to that yet but he might why should he not earn money for his own benefit as well as for the padrone true he was bound to the latter by a legal contract entered into by his father but phil without knowing much about law had an indistinct idea that the contract was a onesided one and was wholly for the advantage of the other party the tyrant is always in danger of losing his hold upon the victim when the latter begins to think they entered the restaurant and sat down at a table the tables were greasy the floor was strewed with sawdust the waiters were dirty and the entire establishment was neither neat nor inviting but it was democratic no customers were sent away because they were unfashionably attired the only requisite was money enough to defray their bills nevertheless giacomo felt a little in awe even of the dirty waiters his frugal meals were usually bought at the bakers shop and eaten standing in the street sitting down at a table even though it was greasy seemed a degree of luxury to which he was not entitled but phil more easily adapted himself to circumstances he knew that he had as much right there as any other customer presently a waiter presented himself have you ordered he asked give me some roast beef said phil what will you have giacomo the same as you filippo said giacomo in italian whats that asked the waiter thinking he had named some dish he will have some roast beef too will you have some coffee giacomo if you have it answered the smaller boy so phil gave the double order and very soon the coffee and meat were placed before them i suspect that few of my readers would have regarded these articles with any relish one need not be fastidious to find fault with the darkhued beverage which was only a poor imitation of coffee and the dark fragments of meat which might have been horseflesh so far as appearance went but to the two italian boys it was indeed a feast the coffee which was hot warmed their stomachs and seemed to them like nectar while the meat was as palatable as the epicure finds his choicest dishes while eating even giacomo forgot that he was engaged in something unlawful and his face was lighted up with rare satisfaction it is good said phil briefly as he laid down his knife and fork after disposing of the last morsel upon his plate i wish i could have such a supper every day said giacomo i will when i am a man said phil i dont think i shall ever be a man said giacomo shaking his head why not asked phil regarding him with surprise i do not think i shall live what makes you think so giacomo said phil startled i am not strong filippo said the little boy i think i get weaker every day i long so much to go back to italy if i could see my mother once more i would be willing to die then you must not think of such things giacomo said phil who like most healthy boys did not like to think of death you will get strong when summer comes the weather is bad now of course i dont think i shall filippo do you remember matteo yes i remember him matteo was a comrade who had died six months before he was a young boy about the size and age of giacomo i dreamed of him last night filippo he held out his hand to me well i think i am going to die like him dont be foolish giacomo said phil but though he said this even he was startled by what giacomo had told him he was ignorant and the ignorant are prone to superstition so he felt uncomfortable but did not like to acknowledge it you must not think of this giacomo he said you will be an old man some day thats for you filippo it isnt for me said the little boy come let us go said phil desirous of dropping the subject he went up to the desk and paid for both the sum of thirty cents now come he said giacomo followed him out and they turned down the street feeling refreshed by the supper they had eaten but unfortunately they had been observed as they left the restaurant they attracted the attention of pietro whom chance had brought thither at an unfortunate time his sinister face lighted up with joy as he realized the discovery he had made but he wished to make sure that it was as he supposed they might have gone in only to play and sing he crossed the street unobserved by phil and giacomo and entered the restaurant were my two brothers here he asked assuming relationship two boys with fiddles yes they just went out did they get supper yes they had some roast beef and coffee thank you said pietro and he left the restaurant with his suspicions confirmed i shall tell the padrone he said to himself they will feel the stick tonight chapter x frenchs hotel pietro had one of those mean and malignant natures that are best pleased when they are instrumental in bringing others into trouble he looked forward to becoming a padrone himself some time and seemed admirably fitted by nature to exercise the inhuman office he lost no time on his return in making known to his uncle what he had learned for the boys to appropriate to their own use money which had been received for their services was in the eyes of the padrone a crime of the darkest shade in fact if the example were generally followed it would have made a large diminution of his income though the boys might have been benefited he listened to pietro with an ominous scowl and decided to inflict condign punishment upon the young offenders meanwhile phil and giacomo resumed their wanderings they no longer hoped to make up the large difference between what they had and the sum they were expected by the padrone to bring as the evening advanced the cold increased and penetrated through their thin clothing chilling them through and through giacomo felt it the most by and by he began to sob with the cold and fatigue what is the matter giacomo asked phil anxiously i feel so cold filippo so cold and tired i wish i could rest the boys were in printing house square near the spot where now stands the franklin statue if you want to rest giacomo said phil pityingly we will go into frenchs hotel a little while i should like to they entered the hotel and sat down near the heater the grateful warmth diffused itself through their frames and giacomo sank back in his seat with a sigh of relief do you feel better giacomo asked his comrade yes filippo i wish i could stay here till it is time to go home we will then we shall get no more money outside the padrone will beat us at any rate it will be no worse for us besides they may possibly ask us to play here i can play no more tonight filippo i am so tired phil knew very little of sickness or he might have seen that giacomo was going to be ill exposure fatigue and privation had been too much for his strength he had never been robust and he had been subjected to trials that would have proved hard for one much stronger to bear when he had once determined to remain in the comfortable hotel phil leaned back in his chair also and decided to enjoy all the comfort attainable what though there was a beating in prospect he had before him two or three hours of rest and relief from the outside cold he was something of a philosopher and chose not to let future evil interfere with present good near the two boys sat two young men merchants from the interior of new york state who were making a business visit to the metropolis well gardner said the first where shall we go tonight why need we go anywhere i thought you might like to go to some place of amusement so i would if the weather were less inclement the most comfortable place is by the fire you are right as to that but the evening will be long and stupid oh we can worry it through here for instance are two young musicians indicating the little fiddlers suppose we get a tune out of them agreed here boy can you play on that fiddle yes said phil well give us a tune then is that your brother no he is my comrade he can play too will you play giacomo the younger boy roused himself the two stood up and played two or three tunes successfully a group of loungers gathered around them and listened approvingly when they had finished phil took off his hat and went the rounds some gave the two first mentioned contributing most liberally the whole sum collected was about fifty cents phil and giacomo now resumed their seats they felt now that they were entitled to rest for the remainder of the evening since they had gained quite as much as they would have been likely to earn in wandering about the streets the group that had gathered about them dispersed and they ceased to be objects of attention fatigue and the warmth of the room gradually affected giacomo until he leaned back and fell asleep i wont take him till its time to go back thought phil so giacomo slept on despite the noises in the street outside and the confusion incident to every large hotel as he sat asleep he attracted the attention of a stout gentleman who was passing leading by the hand a boy of ten is that your brother he asked in a low tone of phil no signore it is my comrade so you go about together yes sir answered phil bethinking himself to use english instead of italian he seems tired yes he is not so strong as i am do you play about the streets all day yes sir how would you like that henry asked his father to the boy at his side i should like to play about the streets all day said henry roguishly misinterpreting the word play i think you would get tired of it what is your name my boy filippo and what is the name of your friend giacomo did you never go to school phil shook his head would you like to go yes sir you would like it better than wandering about the streets all day yes sir why do you not ask your father to send you to school my father is in italy and his father also si signore answered phil relapsing into italian what do you think of that henry asked the gentleman how should you like to leave me and go to some italian city to roam about all day playing on the violin i think i would rather go to school i think you would are you often out so late filippo i think that is the name you gave me phil shrugged his shoulders always he answered at what time do you go home at eleven it is too late for a boy of your age to sit up why do you not go home sooner the padrone would beat me who is the padrone the man who brought me from italy to america poor boys said the gentleman compassionately yours is a hard life i hope some time you will be in a better position phil fixed his dark eyes upon the stranger grateful for his words of sympathy thank you he said goodnight said the stranger kindly goodnight signore an hour passed the city hall clock near by struck eleven the time had come for returning to their mercenary guardian phil shook the sleeping form of giacomo the little boy stirred in his sleep and murmured madre he had been dreaming of his mother and his faroff italian home he woke to the harsh realities of life four thousand miles away from that mother and home have i slept filippo he asked rubbing his eyes and looking about him in momentary bewilderment yes giacomo you have slept for two hours and more it is eleven oclock then we must go back yes take your violin and we will go they passed out into the cold street which seemed yet colder by contrast with the warm hotel they just left and crossing to the sidewalk that skirts the park walked up centre street giacomo was seized with a fit of trembling his teeth chattered with the cold a fever was approaching although neither he nor his companion knew it are you cold giacomo asked phil noticing how he trembled i am very cold i feel sick filippo you will feel better tomorrow said phil but the thought of the beating which his little comrade was sure to receive saddened him more than the prospect of being treated in the same way himself they kept on their way past the tombs with its gloomy entrance through the illlighted street scarcely noticed by the policeman whom they passed for he was accustomed to see boys of their class out late at night until at last they reached the dwelling of the padrone who was waiting their arrival with the eagerness of a brutal nature impatient to inflict pain chapter xi the boys reception phil and giacomo entered the lodginghouse wholly unconscious of the threatening storm the padrone scowled at them as they entered but that was nothing unusual had he greeted them kindly they would have had reason to be surprised well he said harshly how much do you bring the boys produced two dollars and a half which he pocketed is this all he asked it was cold said phil and we could not get more the padrone listened with an ominous frown are you hungry he asked do you want your supper phil was puzzled by his manner for he expected to be deprived of his supper on account of bringing less money than usual why should the padrone ask him if he wanted his supper though he was not hungry he thought it best to answer in the affirmative what would you like asked the padrone again phil was puzzled for the suppers supplied by the padrone never varied always consisting of bread and cheese perhaps continued the padrone meeting no answer you would like to have coffee and roast beef all was clear now phil understood that he had been seen going in or out of the restaurant though he could not tell by whom he knew well enough what to expect but a chivalrous feeling of friendship led him to try to shield his young companion even at the risk of a more severe punishment to be inflicted upon himself it was my fault he said manfully giacomo would not have gone in but for me wicked ungrateful boy exclaimed the padrone wrathfully it was my money that you spent you are a thief phil felt that this was a hard word which he did not deserve the money was earned by himself though claimed by the padrone but he did not venture to say this it would have been revolutionary he thought it prudent to be silent why do you say nothing exclaimed the padrone stamping his foot why did you spend my money i was hungry so you must live like a nobleman our supper is not good enough for you how much did you spend thirty cents for each no signore for both then you shall have each fifteen blows one for each penny i will teach you to be a thief pietro the stick now strip padrone said phil generously let me have all the blows it was my fault giacomo only went because i asked him if the padrone had had a heart this generous request would have touched it but he was not troubled in that way he must be whipped too he said he should not have gone with you he is sick padrone persisted phil excuse him till he is better not a word more roared the padrone irritated at his persistence if he is sick it is because he has eaten too much he added with a sneer pietro my stick the two boys began to strip mechanically knowing that there was no appeal phil stood bare to the waist the padrone seized the stick and began to belabor him phils brown face showed by its contortions the pain he suffered but he was too proud to cry out when the punishment was finished his back was streaked with red and looked maimed and bruised put on your shirt commanded the tyrant phil drew it on over his bleeding back and resumed his place among his comrades now said the padrone beckoning to giacomo the little boy approached shivering not so much with cold as with the fever that had already begun to prey upon him phil turned pale and sick as he looked at the padrone preparing to inflict punishment he would gladly have left the room but he knew that it would not be permitted the first blow descended heavily upon the shrinking form of the little victim it was followed by a shriek of pain and terror what are you howling at muttered the padrone between his teeth i will whip you the harder giacomo would have been less able to bear the cruel punishment than phil if he had been well but being sick it was all the more terrible to him the second blow likewise was followed by a shriek of anguish phil looked on with pale face set teeth and blazing eyes as he saw the barbarous punishment of his comrade he felt that he hated the padrone with a fierce hatred had his strength been equal to the attempt he would have flung himself upon the padrone as it was he looked at his comrades half wishing that they would combine with him against their joint oppressor but there was no hope of that some congratulated themselves that they were not in giacomos place others looked upon his punishment as a matter of course there was no dream of interference save in the mind of phil the punishment continued amid the groans and prayers for mercy of the little sufferer but at the eighth stroke his pain and terror reached a climax and nature succumbed he sank on the floor fainting the padrone thought at first it was a pretense and was about to repeat the strokes when a look at the pallid colorless face of the little sufferer alarmed him it did not excite his compassion but kindled the fear that the boy might be dying in which case the police might interfere and give him trouble therefore he desisted but unwillingly he is sick said phil starting forward he is no more sick than i am scowled the padrone pietro some water pietro brought a glass of water which the padrone threw in the face of the fallen boy the shock brought him partially to he opened his eyes and looked around vacantly what is the matter with you demanded the padrone harshly where am i asked giacomo bewildered but as he asked this question his eyes met the dark look of his tyrant and he clasped his hands in terror do not beat me he pleaded i feel sick he is only shamming said pietro who was worthy to be the servant and nephew of such a master but the padrone thought it would not be prudent to continue the punishment help him put on his clothes pietro he said i will let you off this time little rascal but take heed that you never again steal a single cent of my money giacomo was allowed to seek his uncomfortable bed his back was so sore with the beating he had received that he was compelled to lie on his side during the night the feverish symptoms increased and before morning he was very sick the padrone was forced to take some measures for his recovery not from motives of humanity but because giacomos death would cut off a source of daily revenue and this in the eyes of the mercenary padrone was an important consideration phil went to bed in silence though he was suffering from the brutal blows he had received the thought of the punishment and suffering of giacomo affected him more deeply than his own as i have said the two boys came from the same town in southern italy they had known each other almost from infancy and something of a fraternal feeling had grown up between them in phils case since he was the stronger it was accompanied by the feeling that he should be a protector to the younger boy who on his side looked up to phil as stronger and wiser than himself though only a boy of twelve what had happened led phil to think seriously of his position and prospects he did not know for how long his services had been sold to the padrone by his father but he felt sure that the letter of the contract would be little regarded as long as his services were found profitable what hope then had he of better treatment in the future there seemed no prospect except of continued oppression and long days of hardship unless and here the suggestion of mr pomeroy occurred to him unless he ran away he had known of boys doing this before some had been brought back and of course were punished severely for their temerity but others had escaped and had never returned what had become of them phil did not know but he rightly concluded that they could not be any worse off than in the service of the padrone thinking of all this phil began to think it probable that he too would some day break his bonds and run away he did not fix upon any time he had not got as far as this but circumstances as we shall find in our next chapter hastened his determination and this though he knew it not was the last night he would sleep in the house of the padrone chapter xii giacomos presentiments phil woke up the next morning feeling lame and sore his back bore traces of the flogging he had received the night before as his eyes opened they rested upon twenty boys lying about him and also upon the dark unsightly walls of the shabby room and the prospect before him served to depress even his hopeful temperament but he was not permitted to meditate long pietro opened the door and called out in harsh tones get up all of you or the padrone will be here with his stick the invitation was heard and obeyed the boys got up yawning and rubbing their eyes having a wholesome dread of their tyrant and his stick which no tenderness of heart ever made him reluctant to use their toilet did not require long to make the padrone was quite indifferent whether they were clean or not and offered them no facilities for washing when they were dressed they were supplied with a frugal breakfast a piece of bread and cheese each their instruments were given them and they were started off for a long day of toil phil looked around for giacomo who had slept in a different room but he was not to be seen is giacomo sick this morning pietro he asked of the padrones nephew he pretends to be sick little drone said pietro unfeelingly if i were the padrone i would let him taste the stick again phil felt that he would like to see the brutal speaker suffering the punishment he wanted inflicted on him but he knew pietros power and malice too well to give utterance to the wish a longing came to him to see giacomo before he went out he might have had a secret presentiment of what was coming signor pietro he said may i see giacomo before i go out this request would have been refused without doubt but that pietro felt flattered at being addressed as signor to which his years did not yet entitle him phil knew this and therefore used the title what do you want to see him for he asked suspiciously i want to ask him how he feels yes you can go in tell him he must get up tomorrow the padrone will not let him spend his time in idleness so phil having already his fiddle under his arm entered the room where giacomo lay the other occupants of the room had risen and the little boy was lying on a hard pallet in the corner his eyes lighted up with joy as he saw phil enter i am glad it is you filippo he said i thought it was the padrone come to make me get up how do you feel this morning giacomo i do not feel well filippo my back is sore and i am so weak his eyes were very bright with the fever that had now control and his cheeks were hot and flushed phil put his hand upon them your cheeks are very hot giacomo he said you are going to be sick i know it filippo said the little boy i may be very sick i hope not giacomo lean over filippo said giacomo i want to tell you something phil leaned over until his ear was close to the mouth of his little comrade i think i am going to die filippo whispered giacomo phil started in dismay no no giacomo he said that is nonsense you will live a great many years i think you will filippo you are strong but i have always been weak and lately i am tired all the time i dont care to live very much it is hard to live and the little boy sighed as he spoke you are too young to die giacomo it is only because you are sick that you think of it you will soon be better i do not think so filippo i should like to live for one thing what is that asked phil gazing with strange wonder at the patient sad face of the little sufferer who seemed so ready to part with the life which in spite of his privations and hardships seemed so bright to him i should like to go back to my home in italy and see my mother again before i die she loved me the almost unconscious emphasis which he laid on the word she showed that in his own mind he was comparing her with his father who had sold him into such cruel slavery if you live giacomo you will go back and see her some day i shall never see her again filippo said the little boy sadly if you ever go back to italy when you are older will you go and see her and tell her that that i thought of her when i was sick and wanted to see her yes giacomo said phil affected by his little companions manner filippo called pietro in harsh tones i must go said phil starting to his feet kiss me before you go said giacomo phil bent over and kissed the feverish lips of the little boy and then hurried out of the room he never saw giacomo again and this though he knew it not was his last farewell to his little comrade so phil commenced his wanderings he was free in one way he could go where he pleased the padrone did not care where he picked up his money as long as he brought home a satisfactory amount phil turned to go up town though he had no definite destination in view he missed giacomo who lately had wandered about in his company and felt lonely without him poor giacomo he thought i hope he will be well soon avast there boy someone called just come to anchor and give us a tune phil looked up and saw two sailors bearing down upon him to use a nautical phrase with arms locked and evidently with more liquor aboard than they could carry steadily give us a tune boy and well pay you said the second phil had met such customers before and knew what would please them he began playing some lively dancing tunes with so much effect that the sailors essayed to dance on the sidewalk much to the amusement of a group of boys who collected around them go it bluejacket go it boots exclaimed the boys designating them by certain prominent articles of dress the applause appeared to stimulate them to further efforts and they danced and jumped high in air to the hilarious delight of their juvenile spectators after a time such a crowd collected that the attention of a passing policeman was attracted whats all this disturbance he demanded in tones of authority were stretching our legs a little shipmate said the first sailor then youd better stretch them somewhere else than in the street i thought this was a free country hiccoughed the second youll find it isnt if i get hold of you said the officer want to fight demanded the second sailor belligerently boy stop playing said the policeman i dont want to arrest these men unless i am obliged to do it phil stopped playing and this put a stop to the dance finding there was no more to be seen the crowd also dispersed with arms again interlocked the sailors were about to resume their walk forgetting to pay the piper but phil was not at all bashful about presenting his claims he took off his cap and going up to the jolly pair said i want some pennies sailors are free with their money parsimony is not one of their vices both thrust their hands into their pockets and each drew out a handful of scrip which they put into phils hands without looking to see how much it might be thats all right boy isnt it inquired the first all right answered phil wondering at their munificence he only anticipated a few pennies and here looked to be as much as he was generally able to secure in a day as soon as he got a good chance he counted it over and found four half dollars three quarters and four tens in all three dollars and fifteen cents at this rate probably the sailors money would not last long however this was none of phils business it was only nine oclock in the forenoon and he had already secured enough to purchase immunity from blows at night still there was one thing unsatisfactory about it all this money was to go into the hands of the padrone phil himself would reap none of the benefit unless he bought his dinner as he had purchased supper the evening before but for this he had been severely punished though he could not feel that he had done very wrong in spending the money he himself earned however it would be at least three hours before the question of dinner would come up he put the money into the pocket of his ragged vest and walked on it was not so cold as the day before the thermometer had risen twentyfive degrees during the night a great change but not unusual in our variable climate phil rather enjoyed this walk notwithstanding his back was a little lame he walked up the bowery to the point where third and fourth avenues converge into it he kept on the lefthand side and walked up fourth avenue passing the cooper institute and the bible house and a little further on stewarts magnificent marble store on the block just above stood a book and periodical store kept as the sign indicated by richard burnton phil paused a moment to look in at the windows which were filled with a variety of attractive articles suddenly he was conscious of his violin being forcibly snatched from under his arm he turned quickly and thought he recognized tim rafferty to whom the reader was introduced in the third chapter of this story chapter xiii phil finds a capitalist to account for phils unexpected loss i must explain that tim rafferty whose ordinary place of business was in or near the city hall park had been sent uptown on an errand he was making his way back leisurely when just as he was passing burntons bookstore he saw phil looking in at the window he immediately recognized him as the little italian fiddler who had refused to lend him his fiddle as described in a previous chapter in his attempt he was frustrated by paul hoffman his defeat incensed him and he determined if he ever met phil again to get even with him as he expressed it it struck him that this was a good opportunity to borrow his fiddle without leave when phil discovered his loss he determined to run after the thief give me back my fiddle he cried but this tim was in no hurry to do as he had longer legs than phil the chances were that he would escape but some distance ahead he saw one of the bluecoated guardians of the public peace or in newsboy parlance a cop and saw that phil could easily prove theft against him as it would be impossible to pass himself off as a fiddler he must get rid of the violin in some way and the sooner the better he threw it into the middle of the street just as a heavy cart was coming along the wheels of the ponderous vehicle passed over the frail instrument crushing it utterly phil ran forward to rescue his instrument but too late it was spoiled beyond recovery phil picked up the pieces mechanically and took them back with him but he soon realized that he might as well cast them away again meanwhile tim satisfied with the mischief he had done and feeling revenged for his former mortification walked up a side street and escaped interference phil had come to one of those crises in human experience when it is necessary to pause and decide what to do next the fiddle was not a valuable one in fact it was a shabby little instrument but it was phils stock in trade moreover it belonged to the padrone and however innocent phil might be as regarded its destruction his tyrannical master was sure to call him to heavy account for it he was certain to be severely punished more so than the evening before and this was not a pleasant prospect to look forward to the padrone was sure not to forgive an offense like this thinking over these things a bold suggestion came into phils mind why need he go back at all why should he not take this occasion for breaking his fetters and starting out into life on his own account there was nothing alarming in that prospect he was not afraid but that he could earn his own living and fare better than he did at present when out of his earnings and those of his comrades the padrone was growing rich other boys had run away and though some had been brought back others had managed to keep out of the cruel clutches of their despotic master it did not take phil long to come to a decision he felt that he should never have a better chance he had three dollars in his pocket thanks to the generosity of the sailors and this would last him some time it would enable him to get out of the city which would be absolutely necessary since if he remained the padrone would send pietro for him and get him back there was only one regret he had at leaving the padrone it would part him from his little comrade giacomo giacomo at least would miss him he wished the little boy could have gone with him but this under present circumstances was impossible by staying he would only incur a severe punishment without being able to help his comrade it was still but nine oclock he had plenty of time before him as he would not be missed by the padrone until he failed to make his appearance at night having no further occasion to go uptown he decided to turn and walk down into the business portion of the city he accordingly made his way leisurely to the city hall park when he suddenly bethought himself of paul hoffman who had served as his friend on a former occasion besides giacomo paul was the only friend on whom he could rely in the city paul was older and had more experience than he and could no doubt give him good advice as to his future plans he crossed the park and broadway and kept along on the west side of the street until he reached the necktie stand kept by paul the young street merchant did not at first see him being occupied with a customer to whom he finally succeeded in selling two neckties then looking up he recognized the young fiddler how are you phil he said in a friendly manner where have you kept yourself i have not seen you for a long time i have been fiddling said phil but i dont see your violin now what has become of it it is broken destroyed said phil how did that happen phil described the manner in which his violin had been stolen do you know who stole it it was that boy who tried to take it once in the park when i stopped him yes i know him it is tim rafferty he is a mean boy i will pay him up for it i do not care for it now said phil but what will your padrone say when you come home without it he would beat me but i will not go home what will you do i will run away good for you phil i like your spunk said paul heartily i wouldnt go back to the old villain if i were you where are you going away from new york if i stay here the padrone would catch me how much did you earn with your fiddle when you had it two dollars if it was a good day that is excellent ill tell you what phil if you could stay in the city i would invite you to come and live with us you could pay your share of the expense say three or four dollars a week and keep the rest of your money to buy clothes and to save i should like it said phil but if i stay in the city the padrone would get hold of me has he any legal right to your services asked paul phil looked puzzled he did not understand the question i mean did your father sign any paper giving you to him yes said phil comprehending now then i suppose he could take you back you think you must go away from the city then phil yes where do you think of going i do not know you might go to jersey to newark which is quite a large city only ten miles from here i should like to go there i dont think the padrone would send there to find you but how are you going to make your living you have lost your fiddle i can sing but you would make more money with your fiddle si signore dont talk to me in italian phil i no understand it phil laughed you can speak english much better than most italian boys some cannot speak at all some speak french because we all stayed in paris sometime before we came to america parlezvous francais oui monsieur un peu well i cant those three words are all the french i know but i say phil you ought to have a fiddle i should like to have one i should make more money how much would one cost i dont know ill tell you what i will do phil said paul after a moments thought i know a pawnbrokers shop on chatham street where there is a fiddle for sale i dont think it will cost very much not more than five dollars you must buy it i have not five dollars said phil then i will lend you the money you shall buy it and when you have earned money enough you shall come back to new york some day and pay me thank you said phil gratefully i will surely pay you of course you will phil said paul confidently i can see by your face that you are honest i dont believe you would cheat your friend i would not cheat you signor paul i see phil you are bound to make an italian of me you may just call me paul and dont mind about the signor now ill tell you what i propose i cannot leave my business for an hour and a half you can go where you please but come back at that time and i will take you home to dinner with me on the way back i will stop with you at the chatham street store and ask the price of the violin then if it doesnt cost too much i will buy it all right said phil you must come back at twelve oclock phil i will come phil strolled down to the battery feeling a little strange without his violin he was elated with the thought of his coming freedom and for the first time since he landed in america the future looked bright to him chapter xiv the tambourine girl arriving at trinity church phil turned into wall street looking about him in a desultory way for he was at present out of business men and boys were hurrying by in different directions to and from banks and insurance offices while here and there a lawyer or lawyers clerk might be seen looking no less busy and preoccupied if phil had had three thousand dollars instead of three he too might have been interested in the price of gold and stocks but his financial education had been neglected and he could not have guessed within twenty the days quotations for either as he walked along his attention was suddenly drawn to a pair of italians a man and a girl of twelve the former turning a handorgan the latter playing a tambourine there was nothing unusual in the group but phils heart beat quick for in the girl he thought he recognized a playmate from the same village in which he was born and bred lucia he called eagerly approaching the pair the girl turned quickly and seeing the young fiddler let fall her tambourine in surprise filippo she exclaimed her eyes lighting up with the joy with which we greet a friends face in a strange land why did you drop your tambourine scelerata demanded the man harshly lucia a pretty brownfaced girl did not lose her joyful look even at this rebuke she stooped and picked up the tambourine and began to play mechanically but continued to speak to filippo how long are you in the city asked phil speaking of course in his native language only two weeks answered lucia i am so glad to see you filippo when did you come from italy i cannot tell i think it is somewhere about two months and did you see my mother before you came away asked phil eagerly yes filippo i saw her she told me if i saw you to say that she longed for her dear boy to return that she thought of him day and night did she say that lucia yes filippo and is my mother well asked phil anxiously for he had a strong love for his mother she is well filippo she is not sick but she is thin and she looks sad i will go and see her some day said phil i wish i could see her now when will you go i dont know when i am older but where is your fiddle filippo asked lucia do you not play filippo glanced at the organgrinder whom he did not dare to take into his confidence so he answered evasively another boy took it i shall get another this afternoon are you with the padrone yes come lucia said the man roughly ceasing to play we must go on lucia followed her companion obediently reluctant to leave phil with whom she desired to converse longer but the latter saw that her guardian did not wish the conversation to continue and so did not follow this unexpected meeting with lucia gave him much to think of it carried back his thoughts to his humble but still dear italian home and the mother from whom he had never met with anything but kindness and a longing to see both made him for the moment almost sad but he was naturally of a joyous temperament and hope soon returned i will save money enough to go home he said to himself it will not take very much not more than fifty dollars i can get it soon if i do not have to pay money to the padrone as may be inferred phil did not expect to return home in style a firstclass ticket on a cunarder was far above his expectations he would be content to go by steerage all the way and that could probably be done for the sum he named so his sadness was but brief and be soon became hopeful again he was aroused from his thoughts of home by a hand laid familiarly on his shoulder turning he saw a bootblack whose adventures have been chronicled in the volume called ragged dick they had become acquainted some three months before dick having acted as a protector to phil against some rough boys of his own class been buyin stocks asked dick i dont know what they are said phil innocently youre a green one said dick i shall have to take you into my bankin house and give you some training in business have you got a bankin house asked phil in surprise in course i have dont you see it pointing to an imposinglooking structure in front of which they were just passing my clerks is all hard to work in there while i go out to take the air for the benefit of my constitushun phil looked puzzled not quite understanding dicks chaffing and looked rather inquiringly at the blacking box finding it a little difficult to understand why a banker on so large a scale should be blacking boots in the street shine your boots sir said dick to a gentleman just passing not now im in a hurry blackin boots is good exercise continued dick answering the doubt in phils face i do it for the benefit of my health thus combinin profit with salubriousness i cant understand such long words said phil i dont know much english i would talk to you in italian said dick only it makes my head ache whats come of your fiddle you havent sold it and bought erie shares have you a boy stole it from me and broke it id like to lick him who was it i think his name was tim rafferty i know him said dick ill give him a lickin next time i see him can you asked phil doubtfully for his enemy was as large as dick in course i can my fists are like sledgehammers jest feel my muscle dick straightened out his arm and phil felt of the muscle which was hard and firm its as tough as a tenyearold chicken said dick it wont be healthy for tim to come round my way what made him steal your fiddle he aint goin into the musical line is he he was angry because i didnt want to lend it to him just then tim rafferty himself turned the corner there was a lull in his business and he was wandering along the street eating an apple there he is said phil suddenly espying his enemy dick looked up and saw with satisfaction that phil was right tim had not yet espied either nor did he till dick addressed him are you round collectin fiddles this mornin he asked tim looked up and seeing that his victim had found an able champion felt anxious to withdraw he was about to turn back but dick advanced with a determined air jest stop a minute tim rafferty said he im agoin to intervoo you for the herald thats what they do with all the big rascals nowadays im in a hurry said tim thats what the pickpocket said when the cop was gently persuadin him to go to the tombs but the cop didnt see it i want the pleasure of your society a minute or two i hear youre in the music business no im not said tim shortly what made you borrer this boys fiddle then i dont know anything about it said tim in a fright some folks forgets easy returned dick i know a man what went into tiffanys and took up a watch to look at and carried it off forgettin to pay for it thats what he told the judge the next day and the judge sent him to the island for a few months to improve his memory the air over to the island is very good to improve the memory you ought to know said tim sullenly youve been there times enough have i said dick maybe you saw me there was it the ninth time you were there or the tenth i never was there said tim maybe it was your twin brother suggested dick what made you break my friends fiddle he wouldnt have minded it so much only it belonged to his grandfather a noble count who made boots for a livin i dont believe he had a fiddle at all said tim thats where your forgetfulness comes in said dick have you forgot the lickin i gave you last summer for stealin my blackin box you didnt lick me said tim then ill lick you harder next time said dick you aint able said tim who glancing over his shoulder saw the approach of a policeman and felt secure i will be soon said dick who also observed the approach of the policeman id do it now only ive got to buy some gold for a friend of mine just let me know when its perfectly convenient to take a lickin tim shuffled off glad to get away unharmed and dick turned to phil ill give him a lickin the first time i catch him when there isnt a cop around he said phil left his friend at this point for he saw by the clock on trinity spire that it was time to go back to join paul hoffman as he had agreed i may here add that phils wrongs were avenged that same evening his friend dick administered to tim the promised lickin with such good effect that the latter carried a black eye for a week afterwards chapter xv phils new plans as the clock struck twelve phil reached the necktie stand of his friend paul hoffman just in time said paul are you hungry a little thats right youre going to dine with me and i want you to bring a good appetite with you what will your mother say asked phil doubtfully wait and see if you dont like what she says you can go off without eating where have you been i went down to wall street on business inquired paul with a smile no said phil seriously i saw lucia who is she i forgot you dont know lucia she lived in my home in italy and i used to play with her she told me of my mother thats lucky phil i hope your mother is well she is not sick but she is thin she thinks of me said phil of course she does you will go home and see her some day i hope so of course you will said paul confidently i saw the boy who stole my fiddle continued phil tim rafferty yes what did he say i was with a bootblack the one they call ragged dick do you know him yes i know dick he is a bully fellow always joking dick wanted to lick him but a policeman came and he went away does dick know that he stole your fiddle yes then he will be sure to punish him it will save me the trouble the walk was not long soon they were at pauls door i have brought company to dinner mother said paul entering first i am glad to see you phil said mrs hoffman why have you not come before how is that phil will you stay now said paul mrs hoffman looked at paul inquiringly phil was afraid he would not be welcome he exclaimed he is always welcome said mrs hoffman where is your fiddle asked jimmy a boy took it said phil and threw it into the street and a wagon went over it and broke it jimmy was quite indignant for his friend when the story had been told its lucky for tim rafferty that he is not here said paul or he might suffer if i was a big boy id lick him said jimmy belligerently i never saw you so warlike before jimmy said paul to phil this sympathy seemed pleasant he felt that he was in the midst of friends and friends were not so plentiful as not to be valued what are you going to have for dinner mother asked paul i am sorry paul that i have no warm meat i have some cold roast beef some hot potatoes and an apple pudding you neednt apologize mother thats good enough for anybody its as good as phil gets at his boarding house i am sure he has got rather tired of it and isnt going to stay are you going to leave the padrone asked mrs hoffman with interest si signora said phil will he let you go i shall run away said phil you see mother phil would be sure of a beating if he went home without his fiddle now he doesnt like to be beaten and the padrone gives harder beatings than you do mother i presume so said mrs hoffman smiling i do not think i am very severe no you spoil the rod and spare the child is phil going to stay in the city no the padrone would get hold of him if he did he is going to new jersey to make his fortune but he will need a fiddle i am going to lend him money enough to buy one i know a pawnbroker who has one for sale i think i can get it for three or four dollars when phil gets it he is going around giving concerts how much can you make in a day phil sometimes i make two dollars answered phil that is excellent especially when you are your own padrone you will be able to save up money you will have to buy a pocketbook phil where will you sleep phil asked jimmy interested phil shrugged his shoulders he had not thought of that question particularly i dont know he said i can sleep anywhere of course he will stop at the firstclass hotels jimmy said paul like all men of distinction i shouldnt wonder if he married an heiress in six months and went back to italy on a bridal tour he is too young to be married said jimmy who it will be perceived understood everything literally i dont know but he is said paul but he isnt too old to be hungry so mother whenever dinner is ready we shall be it is all ready except peeling the potatoes paul we can do that ourselves it is good exercise and will sharpen our appetites you will have to eat fast or there wont be much left jimmy is the most tremendous eater i ever saw and wont leave much for the rest of us if we give him the chance now paul expostulated jimmy feeling aggrieved at this charge you know i dont eat as much as you do hear him talk phil i dont eat more than enough to keep a fly alive it must be a pretty large fly paul said jimmy slyly good joke jimmy mother you must give jimmy twelve potatoes today instead of the ten he usually eats oh paul how can you tell such stories exclaimed jimmy shocked at such an extravagant assertion phil laughed for there was something ludicrous in the idea of jimmy who was a slight boy of seven making away with such a large quantity and the little boy began to see that it was a joke at his expense the dinner went off well all had a good appetite and did full justice to mrs hoffmans cookery the pudding in particular was pronounced a success it was so flaky and wellseasoned and the sauce flavored with lemon was so good that everyone except mrs hoffman took a second piece for the first time since he had left italy phil felt the uncomfortable sensation of having eaten too much however with the discomfort was the pleasant recollection of a good dinner and to the mind of the little fiddler the future brightened as it is very apt to do under such circumstances and he felt ready to go out and achieve his fortune why wont you stop with us tonight phil and start on your journey tomorrow asked mrs hoffman i am sure jimmy would be glad of your company yes phil stay said paul phil hesitated it was a tempting invitation but on the other hand if he remained in the city till the next day he might be in danger from the padrone he expressed this fear i am afraid the padrone would catch me he said no he wont you can go out with me and buy the fiddle now and then come back and play to mother and jimmy tomorrow morning i will go with you to the jersey city ferry myself and if we meet the padrone ill give him a hint to be off phil still hesitated but finally yielded to the united request but it was now one oclock and paul must be back to his business phil took his cap and went with him to purchase the fiddle promising to come back directly they went into chatham street and soon halted before a small shop in front of which were three gilt balls indicating that it was a pawnbrokers shop entering they found themselves in a small apartment about twelve feet front by twenty in depth completely filled with pawnable articles in great variety a large part however consisting of clothing for when the poor have occasion to raise money at a pawnbrokers they generally find little in their possession to pawn except their clothing here was a shawls pawned for a few shillings by a poor woman whose intemperate husband threw the burden of supporting two young children upon her next to it was a black coat belonging to a clerk who had been out of employment for three months and now was out of money also here was a childs dress pawned by the mother in dire necessity to save the child from starving there was a plain gold ring snatched by a drunken husband from the finger of his poor wife not to buy food but to gratify his insatiable craving for drink over this scene of confusion presided a little old man with blear eyes and wrinkled face but with a sharp glance fully alive to his own interests he was an englishman born but he had been forty years in america he will be remembered by those who have read paul the peddler though nearly as povertystricken in appearance as his poorest customers the old man was rich if reports were true his business was a very profitable one allowing the most exorbitant rates of interest and being a miser he spent almost nothing on himself so that his hoards had increased to a considerable amount he looked up sharply as paul and phil entered and scanned them closely with his ferretlike eyes chapter xvi the fashionable party eliakim henderson for this was the pawnbrokers name did not remember paul though on one occasion our hero had called upon him nearly all his customers came to pawn articles not to purchase and eliakim naturally supposed that the two boys had come on this errand before entering paul said to phil dont say anything leave me to manage as they entered phil espied a fiddle hanging up behind the counter and he saw at a glance that it was better than the one he had been accustomed to play upon but to his surprise paul did not refer to it at first what will you give me on this coat asked paul indicating the one he had on he had no intention of selling it but preferred to come to the fiddle gradually that the pawnbroker might not think that was his main object and so charge an extra price eliakim scanned the garment critically it was nearly new and in excellent condition and he coveted it i will give you a dollar said he naming a price low enough to advance upon that is too little said paul shaking his head i might give you fifty cents more but i should lose if you didnt redeem it i dont think you would i paid ten dollars for it but it is old no it isnt i have only had it a few weeks how much do you want on it asked eliakim scanning paul sharply to see how much he seemed in want of money i dont want any today if i should want some next week i will come in it will be older next week said eliakim not wanting to lose the bargain for he hoped it would not be redeemed never mind i can get along till then can i do no business with you this morning asked eliakim disappointed i dont know said paul looking carelessly around my friend here would like a fiddle if he can get one cheap what do you ask for that one up there eliakim took down the fiddle with alacrity he had had it on hand for a year without securing a customer it had originally been pawned by a poor musician for a dollar and a quarter but the unfortunate owner had never been able to redeem it among his customers the pawnbroker had not found one sufficiently musical to take it off his hands here was a slight chance and he determined to effect a sale if he could it is a splendid instrument he said enthusiastically brushing off the dust with a dirty cotton handkerchief i have had many chances to sell it why didnt you sell it then demanded paul who did not believe a word of this because it was only pawned i kept it for the owner oh well if you cant sell it it doesnt matter it is for sale now said eliakim quickly he has not come for it and i shall keep it no longer just try it see what a splendid instrument it is said the pawnbroker dwelling on the adjective to give emphasis to it paul tried it but not knowing how to play of course created only discord he did not offer it to phil because the young italian boy would have made it sound too well and so enhanced the price it dont sound very well said he indifferently but i suppose it will do to learn on what do you want for it five dollars said eliakim studying the face of paul to observe the effect of his announcement five dollars repeated paul take it back then and wait till a t stewart wants one i havent got five dollars to throw away but the pawnbroker did not expect to get his first price he named it in order to have a chance to fall stay he said as paul made a motion to leave what will you give me for it ill give you a dollar and a half said paul turning back a dollar and a half exclaimed eliakim holding up both hands in horror do you want to ruin me no i think you want to ruin me i am willing to pay a fair price you may have it for three dollars and a half no doubt youd be glad to get that come phil well go stay you may have it for three dollars though i shall lose by it so should i if i paid you that price i can wait till some other time but eliakim did not intend to let this chance slip he had found the fiddle rather unsalable and feared if he lost his chance of disposing of it it might remain on his hands for a year more he was willing therefore to take less than the profit he usually calculated upon in the sale of articles which remained unredeemed you may have it for two dollars and a half he said as far as paul could judge though he did not know much about the price of violins this was a reasonable price but he knew that eliakim must have got it for considerably less or he would not so soon have come down to this sum he did not hesitate therefore to try to get it a little cheaper ill give you two dollars and a quarter he said and not a penny more eliakim tried hard to get ten cents more but paul saw that he was sure of his purchase and remained obdurate so after a pretense of putting up the fiddle the pawnbroker finally said you may have it but i tell you that i shall lose money all right said paul hand it over where is the money asked eliakim cautiously paul drew from his pocket a twodollar bill and twentyfive cents in currency and received the fiddle the pawnbroker scrutinized the money closely fearing that it might be bad but finally making up his mind on that point deposited it in his money drawer well phil we may as well go said paul weve got through our business the pawnbroker heard this and a sudden suspicion entered his mind that paul had been too sharp for him i might have got twentyfive cents more he thought regretfully and this thought disturbed the complacency he felt at first well phil how do you like it asked paul as they emerged into the street let me try it said phil eagerly he struck up a tune which he played through his face expressing the satisfaction he felt is it as good as your old one it is much better said phil i will pay you for it and he drew out the money the sailors had given him in the morning no phil said his friend you may need that money keep it and pay me when you have more but i shall be away you will come to the city some day when you do you will know where to find me now go and play a tune to jimmy he is waiting for you if you remain in the streets your old enemy tim rafferty may want to borrow your fiddle again you are very kind to me paolo said phil raising his dark eyes with a sudden impulse of gratitude its nothing phil said paul modestly you would do the same for me if i needed it yes i would said phil but i am poor and i cannot help you you wont be poor always phil said paul cheerfully nor i either i hope i mean to be a merchant some time on a bigger scale than now as for you you will be a great player and give concerts at the academy of music phil laughed but still seemed pleased at the prophecy well phil i must bid you goodby for a little while or my clerks will be cheating me i will see you at supper addio paolo said phil addio said paul laughing wouldnt i make a good italian paul returned to his stand and phil took the direction of mrs hoffmans rooms while on his way he heard the sound of a handorgan and looking across the way saw with some uneasiness his old enemy pietro playing to a crowd of boys i hope he wont see me said phil to himself he was afraid pietro would remember his old violin and seeing the difference in the instrument he now had inquire how he got it he might if not satisfied on this point take phil home with him which would be fatal to his plans he thought it prudent therefore to turn down the next street and get out of sight as soon as possible fortunately for him pietro had his back turned so that he did not observe him nothing would have pleased him better than to get the little fiddler into trouble for besides being naturally malicious he felt that an exhibition of zeal in his masters service would entitle him to additional favors at the hands of the padrone whom he hoped some day to succeed oh what a beautiful fiddle said jimmy in admiration as phil reappeared do you think i could play on it phil shook his head smiling dont let jimmy have it he would only spoil it said mrs hoffman i dont think he would succeed as well in music as in drawing will you play something asked jimmy phil willingly complied and for half an hour held jimmy entranced with his playing the little boy then undertook to teach phil how to draw but at this phil probably cut as poor a figure as his instructor would have done at playing on the violin so the afternoon wore away happily for all three and at five paul made his appearance when supper was over phil played again and this attracting the attention of the neighbors mrs hoffmans rooms were gradually filled with visitors who finally requested phil to play some dancing tunes finding him able to do so an impromptu dance was got up and mrs hoffman considerably to her surprise found that she was giving a dancingparty paul that nothing might be left out took a companion with him and they soon reappeared with cake and ice cream which were passed around amid great hilarity and it was not until midnight that the last visitor went out and the sound of music and laughter was hushed you are getting fashionable in your old age mother said paul gayly i think i shall send an account of your party to the home journal i believe it is usual to describe the dresses of the ladies said mrs hoffman smiling oh yes i wont forget that just give me a piece of paper and see how i will do it paul whose education i repeat here was considerably above that of most boys in his position sat down and hastily wrote the following description which was read to the great amusement of his auditors mrs hoffman mother of the wellknown artist jimmy hoffman esq gave a fashionable party last evening her spacious and elegant apartments were crowded with finely dressed gentlemen and ladies from the lower part of the city signor filippo the great italian musician furnished the music mrs hoffman appeared in a costly calico dress and had a valuable gold ring on one of her fingers her son the artist was richly dressed in a gray suit purchased a year since miss bridget flaherty of mott street was the belle of the occasion and danced with such grace and energy that the floor came near giving away beneath her fairy tread miss flaherty by the way weighed one hundred and eighty pounds mr mike donovan newspaper merchant handed round refreshments with his usual graceful and elegant deportment miss matilda wiggins appeared in a magnificent print dress imported from paris by a t stewart and costing a shilling a yard no gloves were worn as they are now dispensed with in the best society at a late hour the guests dispersed mrs hoffmans party will long be remembered as the most brilliant of the season i did not know you had so much talent for reporting paul said his mother you forgot one thing however what is that you said nothing of yourself i was too modest mother however if you insist upon it i will do so anything at all to please you paul resumed his writing and in a short time had the following among those present we observed the handsome and accomplished paul hoffman esq the oldest son of the hostess he was elegantly dressed in a pepperandsalt coat and vest blue necktie and brown breeches and wore a sixcent diamond breastpin in the bosom of his shirt his fifteencent handkerchief was perfumed with cologne which he imported himself at a cost of ten cents per bottle he attracted general admiration you seem to have got over your modesty paul said his mother i am sleepy said jimmy drowsily rubbing his eyes as this expressed the general feeling they retired to bed at once and in half an hour were wandering in the land of dreams chapter xvii the padrone is anxious the next morning paul and phil rose later that usual they slept longer in order to make up for the late hour at which they retired as they sat down to breakfast at halfpast eight paul said i wonder whether the padrone misses you phil yes said phil he will be very angry because i did not come back last night will he think you have run away i do not know some of the boys stay away sometimes because they are too far off to come home then he may expect you tonight i suppose he will have a beating ready for you yes he would beat me very hard said phil if he thought i did not mean to come back i should like to go and tell him that he need not expect you i should like to see how he looks he might beat you too paolo i should like to see him try it said paul straightening up with a consciousness of strength he might find that rather hard phil looked admiringly at the boy who was not afraid of the padrone like his comrades he had been accustomed to think of the padrone as possessed of unlimited power and never dreamed of anybody defying him or resisting his threats though he had determined to run away his soul was not free from the tyranny of his late taskmaster and he thought with uneasiness and dread of the possibility of his being conveyed back to him well mother said paul glancing at the clock as he rose from the breakfast table it is almost nine oclock rather a late hour for a business man like me you are not often so late paul it is lucky that i am my own employer or i might run the risk of being discharged i am afraid the excuse that i was at mrs hoffmans fashionable party would not be thought sufficient i guess i wont have time to stop to shave this morning you havent got anything to shave said jimmy dont be envious jimmy i counted several hairs this morning well phil are you ready to go with me dont forget your fiddle when shall we see you again philip said mrs hoffman i do not know said the little minstrel shall you not come to the city sometimes i am afraid the padrone would catch me said phil whenever you do come phil said paul come right to me i will take care of you i dont think the padrone will carry us both off and he would have to take me if he took you goodby philip said mrs hoffman offering her hand i hope you will prosper so do i phil said jimmy phil thus took with him the farewells and good wishes of two friends who had been drawn to him by his attractive face and good qualities he could not help wishing that he might stay with them permanently but he knew that this could not be to remain in the same city with the padrone was out of the question meanwhile we return to the house which phil had forsaken and inquire what effect was produced by his nonappearance it was the rule of the establishment that all the boys should be back by midnight phil had generally returned an hour before that time when therefore it was near midnight the padrone looked uneasily at the clock have you seen filippo he asked addressing his nephew no signore answered pietro filippo has not come in do you think he has run away asked the padrone suspiciously i dont know said pietro have you any reason to think he intended to run away no said pietro i should not like to lose him he brings me more money than most of the boys he may come in yet when he does said the padrone frowning i will beat him for being so late is there any boy that he would be likely to tell if he meant to run away yes said pietro with a sudden thought there is giacomo the sick boy yes filippo went in this morning to speak to him he might have told him then that is true i will go and ask him giacomo still lay upon his hard pallet receiving very little attention his fever had increased and he was quite sick he rolled from one side to the other in his restlessness he needed medical attention but the padrone was indifferent and none of the boys would have dared to call a doctor without his permission as he lay upon his bed the padrone entered the room with a hurried step where is giacomo he demanded harshly here i am signore padrone answered the little boy trembling as he always did when addressed by the tyrant did filippo come and speak with you this morning before he went out si signore what did he say he asked me how i felt what did you tell him i told him i felt sick nothing more i told him i thought i should die nonsense said the padrone harshly you are a coward you have a little cold that is all did he say anything about running away no signore dont tell me a lie said the tyrant frowning i tell you the truth signore padrone has not filippo come home no i do not think he has run away said the little boy why not i think he would tell me so you two are friends are you si signore i love filippo answered giacomo speaking the last words tenderly and rather to himself than to the padrone he looked up to phil though little older than himself with a mixture of respect and devotion leaning upon him as the weak are prone to lean upon the strong then you will be glad to hear said the padrone with a refinement of cruelty that i shall beat him worse than last night for staying out so late dont beat him padrone pleaded giacomo bursting into tears perhaps he cannot come home did he ever speak to you of running away asked the padrone with a sudden thought giacomo hesitated he could not truthfully deny that filippo had done so but he did not want to get his friend into trouble he remained silent looking up at the tyrant with troubled eyes why do you not speak did you hear my question asked the padrone with a threatening gesture had the question been asked of some of the other boys present they would not have scrupled to answer falsely but giacomo had a religious nature and neglected as he had been he could not make up his mind to tell a falsehood so after a pause he faltered out a confession that phil had spoken of flight do you hear that pietro said the padrone turning to his nephew the little wretch has doubtless run away shall i look for him tomorrow asked pietro with alacrity for to him it would be a congenial task to drag phil home and witness the punishment yes pietro i will tell you where to go in the morning we must have him back and i will beat him so that he will not dare to run away again the padrone would have been still more incensed could he have looked into mrs hoffmans room and seen the little fiddler the center of a merry group his brown face radiant with smiles as he swept the chords of his violin it was well for phil that he could not see him chapter xviii phil eludes his pursuer phil had already made up his mind where to go just across the river was new jersey with its flourishing towns and cities settled to a large extent by men doing business in new york the largest of these cities was newark only ten miles distant there phil decided to make his first stop if he found himself in danger of capture he could easily go farther this plan paul approved and it was to be carried into execution immediately i will go down to the cortlandt street ferry with you phil said paul i should like to have you if it will not take you from your business paolo my business can wait said paul i mean to see you safe out of the city the padrone may be in search of you already i think he will send pietro to find me said phil who is pietro phil explained that pietro was the padrones nephew and assisted in oppressing the boys i hope he will send him said paul phil looked up in surprise i should like to see this pietro what would he do if he should find you he would take me back if you did not want to go i couldnt help it said phil shrugging his shoulders he is much bigger than i is he bigger than i am i think he is as big he isnt big enough to take you away if i am with you paul did not say this boastfully but with a quiet confidence in his own powers in which he was justified though by no means quarrelsome he had on several occasions been forced in selfdefense into a contest with boys of his own size and in some instances larger and in every case he had acquitted himself manfully and come off victorious i should not be afraid if you were with me paolo said phil you are right phil said paul approvingly but here we are at the ferry cortlandt street is a short distance below the astor house and leads to the ferry connecting on the other side with trains bound for philadelphia and intermediate places paul paid the regular toll and passed through the portal with phil are you going with me asked the little fiddler in surprise only to jersey city phil there might be some of your friends on board the boat i want to see you safe on the cars then i must leave you you are very kind paolo you are a good little chap phil and i mean to help you but the boat is about ready to start let us go on board they walked down the pier and got on the boat a minute before it started they did not pass through to the other end but leaning against the side kept their eyes fixed on the city they were about to leave they had not long to wait the signal was heard and the boat started leisurely from the pier it was but ten feet distant when the attention of paul and phil was drawn to a person running down the drop in great haste he evidently wanted to catch the boat but was too late phil clutched at pauls arm and pointed to him in evident excitement it is pietro he said at that moment pietro standing on the brink caught sight of the boy he was pursuing looking back at him from the deck of the ferryboat a look of exultation and disappointment swept over his face as he saw phil but realized that he was out of his reach he had a handorgan with him and this had doubtless encumbered him and prevented his running as fast as he might otherwise so that is pietro is it said paul regarding him attentively in order to fix his face in his memory yes paolo said phil his eyes fixed nervously upon his pursuer who maintained his place and was watching him with equal attention you are not frightened phil are you phil admitted that he was he will come over in the next boat he said but he will not know where you are he will seek me will he then i think he will be disappointed the cars will start on the other side before the next boat arrives i found out about that before we started phil felt relieved by this intelligence but still he was nervous knowing well pietros malice he dreaded the chances of his capturing him he stays there he does not go away said phil it will do him no good phil he is like a cat watching a canary bird beyond his reach i dont think he will catch you today he may go in the cars too suggested phil that is true on the whole phil when you get to newark i advise you to walk into the country dont stay in the city he might find you there i will do what you say paolo it will be better they soon reached the jersey shore the railroad station was close by they went thither at once and phil bought a ticket for newark how soon will the cars start inquired paul of a railway official in five minutes was the answer then phil i advise you to get into the cars at once take a seat on the opposite side though there is no chance of your being seen by pietro who will get here too late still it is best to be on the safe side i will stay near the ferry and watch pietro when he lands perhaps i will have a little conversation with him i will go paolo well goodby phil and good luck said paul cheerfully if you ever come to new york come to see me yes paolo i will be sure to come and phil though i dont think you will ever fall into the power of that old brute again i am sure you wont if you take good care of yourself still if he does get you back again come to me the first chance you get and i will see what i can do for you thank you paolo i will remember your kindness always said the little fiddler gratefully that is all right phil goodby goodby said phil and shaking the hand of his new friend he ascended the steps and took a seat on the opposite side as paul had recommended i am sorry to part with phil said paul to himself hes a fine little chap and i like him if ever that old brute gets hold of him again he shant keep him long now signor pietro ill go back and see you on your arrival phil was right in supposing that pietro would take passage on the next boat he waited impatiently on the drop till it touched and sprang on board he cursed the interval of delay fearing that it would give phil a chance to get away however there was no help for this time and tide wait for no man but it often happens that we are compelled to wait for them but at length the boat touched the jersey shore and pietro sprang out and hurried to the gates looking eagerly on all sides for a possible glimpse of the boy he sought he did not see him for the cars were already on their way but his eyes lighted up with satisfaction as they lighted on paul whom he recognized as the companion of phil he had seen him talking to the little fiddler probably he would know where he had gone he walked up to paul who was standing near and touching his cap said excuse me signore but have you seen my little brother your little brother repeated paul deliberately si signore a little boy with a fiddle he was so high and pietro indicated the height of phil correctly by his hand there was a boy came over in the boat with me said paul yes yes he is the one signore said pietro eagerly and he is your brother si signore thats a lie thought paul i should know it even if phil had not told me phil is a handsome little chap he wouldnt have such a villainouslooking brother as you can you tell me where he has gone asked pietro eagerly didnt he tell you where he was going asked paul in turn i think he means to run away said pietro did you see where he went why should he want to run away asked paul who enjoyed tantalizing pietro who he saw was chafing with impatience did you not treat him well he is a little rascal said pietro he is treated well but he is a thief and you are his brother repeated paul significantly did you see where he went asked pietro getting angry i want to take him back to his father how should i know returned paul coolly do you think i have nothing to do but to look after your brother why didnt you tell me that before said pietro incensed dont get mad said paul indifferently it wont do you any good perhaps if you look round you will see your brother ill tell him you want him if i see him pietro looked at paul suspiciously it struck him that the latter might be making a fool of him but paul looked so utterly indifferent that he could judge nothing from his appearance he concluded that phil was wandering about somewhere in jersey city it did not occur to him that he might have taken the cars for some more distant place at any rate there seemed no chance of getting any information out of paul so he adjusted his handorgan and walked up the street leading from the ferry looking sharply on either side hoping to catch a glimpse of the runaway but of course in vain i dont think youll find phil today signor pietro said paul to himself as he watched his receding form now as there is nothing more to be done here i will go back to business chapter xix pietros pursuit the distance from new york to newark is but ten miles phil had been there once before with an older boy he was at no loss therefore as to the proper place to get out he stepped from the cars and found himself in a large depot he went out of a side door and began to wander about the streets of newark now for the first time he felt that he was working for himself and the feeling was an agreeable one true he did not yet feel wholly secure pietro might possibly follow in the next train he inquired at the station when the next train would arrive in an hour was the reply it would be an hour therefore before pietro could reach newark he decided to walk on without stopping till he reached the outskirts of the city and not venture back till nightfall when there would be little or no danger accordingly he plodded on for an hour and a half till he came where the houses were few and scattered at intervals in a business point of view this was not good policy but safety was to be consulted first of all he halted at length before a grocery store in front of which he saw a small group of men standing his music was listened to with attention but when he came to pass his cap round afterward the result was small in fact to be precise the collection amounted to but eight cents hows business boy asked a young man who stood at the door in his shirtsleeves and was evidently employed in the grocery that is all i have taken said phil showing the eight cents did you come from new york this morning yes then you havent got enough to pay for your ticket yet phil shrugged his shoulders i dont believe youll make your fortune out here phil was of precisely the same opinion but kept silent you would have done better to stay in new york to this also phil mentally assented but there were imperative reasons as we know for leaving the great city it was already halfpast twelve and phil began after his walk to feel the cravings of appetite he accordingly went into the grocery and bought some crackers and cheese which he sat down by the stove and ate are you going farther asked the same young man who had questioned him before i shall go back to newark tonight said phil let me try your violin can you play asked phil doubtfully for he feared that an unpracticed player might injure the instrument yes i can play ive got a fiddle at home myself our hero surrendered his fiddle to the young man who played passably youve got a pretty good fiddle he said i think its better than mine can you play any dancing tunes phil knew one or two and played them if you were not going back to newark i should like to have you play with me this evening i dont have anybody to practice with i would not know where to sleep said phil hesitatingly oh weve got beds enough in our house will you stay phil reflected that he had no place to sleep in newark except such as he might hire and decided to accept the offer of his new friend this is my night off from the store he said i havent got to come back after supper just stay around here till six oclock then ill take you home and give you some supper and then well play this evening phil had no objection to this arrangement in fact it promised to be an agreeable one for him as he was sure of a supper a bed and breakfast there was no particular necessity for him to earn anything more that day however he went out for an hour or two and succeeded in collecting twentyfive cents he realized however that it was not so easy to pick up pennies in the country as in the city partly because population is sparser and partly because though there is less privation in the country there is also less money a little before six phils new friend whose name he ascertained was edwin grover washed his hands and putting on his coat said come along phil phil who had been sitting near the stove prepared to accompany him we havent got far to go said edwin who was eighteen i am glad of that for the sooner i get to the supper table the better after five minutes walk they stopped at a comfortable twostory house near the roadside thats where i put up said edwin he opened the door and entered followed by phil who felt a little bashful knowing that he was not expected have you got an extra plate mother asked edwin this is a professor of the violin who is going to help me make some music this evening he is welcome said mrs grover cheerfully we can make room for him he is an italian i suppose what is your name filippo i will call you philip i suppose that is the english name will you lay down your violin and draw up to the fire i am not cold said phil he is not cold he is hungry as ollendorf says said edwin who had written a few french exercises according to ollendorfs system is supper almost ready it will be ready at once there is your father coming in at the front gate and henry with him mr grover entered and phil made the acquaintance of the rest of the family he soon came to feel that he was a welcome guest and shared in the family supper which was well cooked and palatable then edwin brought out his fiddle and the two played various tunes phil caught one or two new dancing tunes from his new friend and in return taught him an italian air three or four people from a neighboring family came in and a little impromptu dance was got up so the evening passed pleasantly and at halfpast ten they went to bed phil sleeping in a little room adjoining that in which the brothers edwin and harry slept after breakfast the next morning phil left the house with a cordial invitation to call again when he happened to be passing before proceeding with his adventures we must go back to pietro he as we know failed to elicit any information from paul likely to guide him in his pursuit of phil he was disappointed still he reflected that phil had but a quarter of an hours start of him scarcely that indeed and if he stopped to play anywhere he would doubtless easily find him there was danger of course that he would turn off somewhere and pietro judged it best to inquire whether such a boy had passed seeing two boys playing in the street he inquired have you seen anything of my little brother what does he look like inquired one he is not quite so large as you he had a fiddle with him no i havent seen him have you dick yes said the other there was a boy went along with a fiddle this was true but as we know it was not phil did you see where he went demanded pietro eagerly straight ahead was the reply lured by the delusive hope these words awakened pietro went on he did not stop to play on his organ he was too intent on finding phil at length at a little distance before him he saw a figure about the size of phil playing on the violin he hurried forward elated but when within a few yards he discovered to his disappointment that it was not phil but a little fiddler of about his size he was in the employ of a different padrone he was doubtless the one the boy had seen disappointed pietro now turned back and bent his steps to the ferry but he saw nothing of phil on the way i would like to beat him the little wretch he said to himself angrily if i had not been too late for the boat i would have easily caught him it never occurred to pietro that phil might have taken the cars for a more distant point as he actually did the only thing he could think of for he was not willing to give up the pursuit was to go back he remained in jersey city all day wandering about the streets peering here and there but he did not find phil for a very good reason the padrone awaited his report at night with some impatience phil was one of the smartest boys he had and he had no mind to lose him did you find him pietro he asked as soon as his nephew entered his presence i saw him said pietro then why did you not bring him back pietro explained the reason his uncle listened attentively pietro you are a fool he said at length why am i a fool asked pietro sullenly because you sought filippo where he is not where is he he did not stop in jersey city he went farther he knew that you were on his track did you ask at the station if such a boy bought a ticket i did not think of it then you were a fool what do you want me to do tomorrow you must go to newark that is the first large town i must have filippo back i will go said pietro briefly he was mortified at the name applied to him by his uncle as well as by the fact of phils having thus far outwitted him he secretly determined that when he did get him into his power he would revenge himself for all the trouble to which he had been put and there was little doubt that he would keep his word chapter xx pietros disappointment though phil had not taken in much money during the first day of independence he had more than paid his expenses he started on the second day with a good breakfast and good spirits he determined to walk back to newark where he might expect to collect more money than in the suburbs if he should meet pietro he determined not to yield without a struggle but he felt better now than at first and less afraid of the padrone nine oclock found him again in newark he soon came to a halt and began to play a few paused to listen but their interest in music did not extend so far as to affect their pockets phil passed around his hat in vain he found himself likely to go unrewarded for his labors but just then he noticed a carriage with open door waiting in front of a fashionable drygoods store two ladies had just come out and taken their seats preparatory to driving off when phil stepped up bareheaded and held his cap he was an unusually attractive boy and as he smiled one of the ladies who was particularly fond of children noticed him what a handsome boy she said to her companion some pennies for music said phil how old are you asked the lady twelve years just the age of my johnny if i give you some money what will you do with it i will buy dinner said phil i never give to vagrants said the second lady a spinster of uncertain age who did not share her nieces partiality for children it isnt his fault if he is a vagrant aunt maria said the younger lady i have no doubt he is a thief continued aunt maria with acerbity i am not a thief said phil indignantly for he understood very well the imputation and he replaced his cap on his head i dont believe you are said the first lady here take this and she put in his hand twentyfive cents thank you signora said phil with a grateful smile that money is thrown away said the elderly lady you are very indiscriminate in your charity eleanor it is better to give too much than too little aunt maria isnt it you shouldnt give to unworthy objects how do you know this boy is an unworthy object he is a young vagrant can he help it it is the way he makes his living the discussion continued but phil did not stop to hear it he had received more than he expected and now felt ready to continue his business one thing was fortunate and relieved him from the anxiety which he had formerly labored under he was not obliged to obtain a certain sum in order to escape a beating at night he had no master to account to he was his own employer as long as he kept out of the clutches of the padrone phil continued to roam about the streets very much after the old fashion playing here and there as he thought it expedient by noon he had picked up seventyfive cents and felt very well satisfied with his success but if as we are told the hour that is darkest is just before day it also happens sometimes that danger lies in wait for prosperity and danger menaced our young hero though he did not know it to explain this we must go back a little when pietro prepared to leave the lodginghouse in the morning the padrone called loudly to him pietro said he you must find filippo today where shall i go asked pietro go to newark filippo went there no doubt while you stupid that you are went looking for him in jersey city you have been in newark before yes signore padrone very good then you need no directions if i do not find him in newark where shall i go he is in newark said the padrone confidently he will not leave it he judged that phil would consider himself safe there and would prefer to remain in a city rather than go into the country i will do my best said pietro i expect you to bring him back tonight i should like to do so said pietro and he spoke the truth apart from his natural tendency to play the tyrant over smaller boys he felt a personal grudge against phil for eluding him the day before and so subjecting him to the trouble of another days pursuit besides the mortification of incurring a reprimand from his uncle never did agent accept a commission more readily than pietro accepted that of catching and bringing filippo to the padrone leaving the lodginghouse he walked down to the ferry at the foot of cortlandt street and took the first train for newark it was ten oclock before he reached the city he had nothing in particular to guide him but made up his mind to wander about all day inquiring from time to time if anyone had seen his little brother describing phil after a while his inquiries were answered in the affirmative and he gradually got on the track of our hero at twelve oclock phil went into a restaurant and invested thirty cents in a dinner as the prices were low he obtained for this sum all he desired ten minutes afterward as he was walking leisurely along with that feeling of tranquil enjoyment which a full stomach is apt to give pietro turned the corner behind him no sooner did the organgrinder catch sight of his prey than a fierce joy lighted up his eyes and he quickened his pace ah scelerato i have you now he exclaimed to himself tonight you shall feel the stick but opportunely for himself phil looked behind him when he saw pietro at but a few rods distance his heart stood still with sudden fright and for an instant his feet were rooted to the ground then the thought of escape came to him and he began to run not too soon stop called out pietro stop or i will kill you but phil did not comprehend the advantage of surrendering himself to pietro he understood too well how he would be treated if he returned a prisoner instead of obeying the call he only sped on the faster now between the pursuer and the pursued there was a difference of six years pietro being eighteen while phil was but twelve this of course was in pietros favor on the other hand the pursuer was encumbered by a handorgan which retarded his progress while phil had only a violin which did not delay him at all this made their speed about equal and gave phil a chance to escape unless he should meet with some interruption stop called pietro furiously beginning to realize that the victory was not yet won phil looked over his shoulder and seeing that pietro was no nearer took fresh courage he darted round a corner with his pursuer half a dozen rods behind him they were not in the most frequented parts of the city but in a quarter occupied by twostory wooden houses seeing a front door open phil with a sudden impulse ran hastily in closing the door behind him a woman with her sleeves rolled up who appeared to have taken her arms from the tub hearing his step came out from the back room what do ye want she demanded suspiciously save me cried phil out of breath someone is chasing me he is bad he will beat me the womans sympathies were quickly enlisted she had a warm heart and was always ready to give aid to the oppressed whist darlint run upstairs and hide under the bed ill send him off wid a flea in his ear whoever he is phil was quick to take the hint he ran upstairs and concealed himself as directed while he was doing it the lower door which he had shut was opened by pietro he was about to rush into the house but the muscular form of phils friend stood in his way out wid ye said she flourishing a broom which she had snatched up is that the way you inter a dacint womans house ye spalpeen i want my brother said pietro drawing back a little before the amazon who disputed his passage go and find him thin said bridget mcguire and kape out of my house but he is here said pietro angrily i saw him come in then one of the family is enough said bridget i dont want another lave here wid you give me my brother then said pietro provoked i dont know anything of your brother if he looks like you hes a beauty sure returned mrs mcguire will you let me look for him faith and i wont you may call him if you plase pietro knew that this would do very little good but there seemed nothing else to do filippo he called come here the padrone has sent for you what was ye sayin demanded bridget not comprehending the italian i told my brother to come then you can go out and wait for him said she i dont want you in the house pietro was very angry he suspected that phil was in the rear room and was anxious to search for him but bridget mcguire was in the way no light delicate woman but at least forty pounds heavier than pietro moreover she was armed with a broom and seemed quite ready to use it phil was fortunate in obtaining so able a protector pietro looked at her and had a vague thought of running by her and dragging phil out if he found him but bridget was planted so squarely in his path that this course did not seem very practicable will you give me my brother demanded pietro forced to use words where he would willingly have used blows i havent got your brother he is in this house thin he may stay here but you shant said bridget and she made a sudden demonstration with the broom of so threatening a character that pietro hastily backed out of the house and the door was instantly bolted in his face chapter xxi the siege when the enemy had fairly been driven out of the house mrs mcguire went upstairs in search of phil our hero had come out from his place of concealment and stood at the window where is pietro he asked as his hostess appeared in the chamber i druv him out of the house said bridget triumphantly then he wont come up here interrogated phil its i that would like to see him thry it said mrs mcguire shaking her head in a very positive manner id break my broom over his back first phil breathed freer he saw that he was rescued from immediate danger where is he now hes outside watching for you hell have to wait till you come out may i stay here till he goes sure and you may said the warmhearted irishwoman youre as welcome as flowers in may are you hungry no thank you said phil i have eaten my dinner wont you try a bit of bread and cold mate now she asked hospitably you are very kind said phil gratefully but i am not hungry i only want to get away from pietro is that the haythens name sure i niver heard it before it is peter in english and has he got the name of the blessed st peter thin sure st peter would be mightily ashamed of him and is he your brother do you say no said phil he said he was but i thought it was a wicked lie when he said it hes too bad sure to be a brother of yours but i must go down to my work my clothes are in the tub and the water will get cold will you be kind enough to tell me when he goes away asked phil sure i will rest aisy darlint he shant get hold of you pietros disappointment may be imagined when he found that the victim whom he had already considered in his grasp was snatched from him in the very moment of his triumph he felt nearly as much incensed at mrs mcguire as at phil but against the former he had no remedy over the stalwart irishwoman neither he nor the padrone had any jurisdiction and he was compelled to own himself ignominiously repulsed and baffled still all was not lost phil must come out of the house some time and when he did he would capture him when that happy moment arrived he resolved to inflict a little punishment on our hero on his own account in anticipation of that which awaited him from his uncle the padrone he therefore took his position in front of the house and maintained a careful watch that phil might not escape unobserved so half an hour passed he could hear no noise inside the house nor did phil show himself at any of the windows pietro was disturbed by a sudden suspicion what if while he was watching phil had escaped by the back door and was already at a distance this would be quite possible for as he stood he could only watch the front of the house the rear was hidden from his view made uneasy by this thought he shifted his ground and crept stealthily round on the side in the hope of catching a view of phil or perhaps hearing some conversation between him and his amazonian protector by which he might set at rest his suddenly formed suspicions he was wrong however phil was still upstairs he was disposed to be cautious and did not mean to leave his present place of security until he should be apprised by his hostess that pietro had gone bridget mcguire kept on with her washing she had been once to the front room and looking through the blinds had ascertained that pietro was still there hell have to wait long enough she said to herself the haythen its hard hell find it to get the better of bridget mcguire she was still at her tub when through the opposite window on the side of the house she caught sight of pietro creeping stealthily along as we have described ill be even wid him said bridget to herself exultingly ill tache him to prowl around my house she took from her sink near by a large longhandled tin dipper and filled it full of warm suds from the tub then stealing to the window she opened it suddenly and as pietro looked up suddenly launched the contents in his face calling forth a volley of imprecations which i would rather not transfer to my page being in italian bridget did not exactly understand their meaning but guessed it is it there ye are she said in affected surprise why did you do that demanded pietro finding enough english to express his indignation why did i do it repeated bridget how would i know that you were crapin under my windy it serves ye right anyhow i dont want you here send out my brother then said pietro theres no brother of yours inside said mrs mcguire its a lie said pietro angrily stamping his foot do you want it agin asked bridget filling her dipper once more from the tub causing pietro to withdraw hastily to a greater distance dont you tell bridget mcguire that she lies my brother is in the house reiterated pietro doggedly he is no brother of yours he says so he lies said pietro shure and its somebody else lies im thinkin said bridget is he in the house demanded pietro finding it difficult to argue with phils protector i dont see him said bridget shrewdly turning and glancing round the room ill call the police said pietro trying to intimidate his adversary i wish you would she answered promptly it would save me the trouble ill make a charge against you for thryin to break into my house maybe you want to stale something pietro was getting disgusted mrs mcguire proved more unmanageable than he anticipated it was tantalizing to think that phil was so near him and yet out of his reach he anathematized phils protector in his heart and i am afraid it would have gone hard with her if he could have had his wishes fulfilled he was not troubled to think what next to say for bridget suddenly terminated the interview by shutting down the window with the remark go away from here i dont want you lookin in at my windy pietro did not however go away immediately he moved a little further to the rear having a suspicion that phil might escape from the door at the back while he was watching here he suddenly heard the front door open and shut with a loud sound he ran to the front thinking that phil might be taking flight from the street door but it was only a ruse of mrs mcguire who rather enjoyed tantalizing pietro he looked carefully up and down the street but seeing nothing of phil he concluded he must still be inside he therefore resumed his watch but in some perplexity as to where he ought to stand in order to watch both front and rear phil occasionally looked guardedly from the window in the second story and saw his enemy but knew that as long as he remained indoors he was safe it was not very agreeable remaining in the chamber alone but it was a great deal better than falling into the clutches of pietro and he felt fortunate to have found so secure a place of refuge pietro finally posted himself at the side of the house where he could command a view of both front and rear and there maintained his stand nearly underneath the window at which his intended prisoner was standing as phil was watching him suddenly he heard steps and bridget mcguire entered the chamber she bore in her hand the same tin dipper before noticed filled with steaming hot water phil regarded her with some surprise would you like to see some fun now she asked her face covered by a broad smile yes said phil open the windy aisy so he wont hear phil obeyed directions and managed not to attract the attention of his besieger below who chanced at the moment to be looking toward the door in the rear now said bridget take this dipper and give him the binifit of it dont let him see you do it cautioned his protector phil took the idea and the dipper at once phil holding the dipper carefully discharged the contents with such good aim that they drenched the watching pietro the water being pretty hot a howl of pain and rage rose from below and pietro danced about frantically looking up he saw no one for phil had followed directions and drawn his head in immediately but mrs mcguire less cautious looked out directly afterward will ye go now or will ye stand jist where i throw the hot water in reply pietro indulged in some rather emphatic language but being in the italian language in which he was more fluent it fell unregarded upon the ears of mrs mcguire i told you to go she said ive got some more wather inside pietro stepped back in alarm he had no disposition to take another warm shower bath and he had found out to his cost that bridget mcguire was not a timid woman or easily frightened but he had not yet abandoned the siege he shifted his ground to the front of the house and took a position commanding a view of the front door chapter xxii the siege is raised though phil was the besieged party his position was decidedly preferable to that of pietro the afternoon was passing and he was earning nothing he finally uncovered his organ and began to play a few gathered around him but they were of that class with whom money is not plenty so after a while finding no pennies forthcoming he stopped suddenly but did not move on as his auditors expected him to he still kept his eyes fixed on mrs mcguires dwelling he did this so long as to attract observation youll know the house next time mister said a sharp boy pietro was about to answer angrily when a thought struck him will you do something for me he asked how much inquired the boy suggestively five cents answered pietro understanding his meaning it isnt much said the boy reflectively tell me what you want though pietro was not much of a master of english he contrived to make the boy understand that he was to go round to the back door and tell mrs mcguire that he pietro was gone he intended to hide close by and when phil came out as he hoped on the strength of his disappearance he would descend upon him and bear him off triumphantly armed with these instructions the boy went round to the back door and knocked thinking it might be phils enemy mrs mcguire went to the door holding in one hand a dipper of hot suds ready to use in case of emergency well what do you want she asked abruptly seeing that it was a boy hes gone said the boy whos gone the man with the handorgan maam and what for do i care demanded bridget suspiciously this was a question the boy could not answer in fact he wondered himself why such a message should have been sent he could only look at her in silence who told you to tell the man was gone asked bridget with a shrewdness worthy of a practitioner at the bar the italian told me did he repeated bridget who saw into the trick at once hes very kind he didnt want you to know he told me said the boy remembering his instructions when it was too late mrs mcguire nodded her head intelligently true for you said she what did he pay you for tellin me five cents thin its five cints lost do you want to earn another five cints yes said the boy promptly thin do what i tell you what is it come in and ill tell you the boy having entered mrs mcguire led him to the front door now said she when i open the door run as fast as you can the man that sint you will think it is another boy and will run after you do ye mind the young messenger began to see the joke and was quite willing to help carry it out but even the prospective fun did not make him forgetful of his promised recompense wheres the five cents he asked here said bridget and diving into the depths of a capacious pocket she drew out five pennies thats all right said the boy now open the door bridget took care to make a noise in opening the door and as it opened she said in a loud and exultant voice youre all safe now the mans gone now run she said in a lower voice the boy dashed out of the doorway but mrs mcguire remained standing there she was not much surprised to see pietro run out from the other side of the house and prepare to chase the runaway but quickly perceiving that he was mistaken he checked his steps and turning saw mrs mcguire with a triumphant smile on her face why dont you run she said you can catch him it isnt my brother he answered sullenly i thought you was gone she said i am waiting for my brother thin youll have to wait you wanted to chate me you haythen but bridget mcguire aint to be took in by such as you youd better lave before my man comes home from his work or hell give you lave of absence wid a kick without waiting for an answer bridget shut the door and bolted it leaving her enemy routed at all points in fact pietro began to lose courage he saw that he had a determined foe to contend with he had been foiled thus far in every effort to obtain possession of phil but the more difficult the enterprise seemed the more anxious he became to carry it out successfully he knew that the padrone would not give him a very cordial reception if he returned without phil especially as he would be compelled to admit that he had seen him and had nevertheless failed to secure him his uncle would not be able to appreciate the obstacles he had encountered but would consider him in fault for this reason he did not like to give up the siege though he saw little hopes of accomplishing his object at length however he was obliged to raise the siege but from a cause with which neither phil nor his defender had anything to do the sky which had till this time been clear suddenly darkened in ten minutes rain began to fall in large drops a sudden shower unusual at this time of the year came up and pedestrians everywhere caught without umbrellas fled panicstricken to the nearest shelter twice before as we know pietro had suffered from a shower of warm water this though colder was even more formidable vanquished by the forces of nature pietro shouldered his instrument and fled incontinently phil might come out now if he chose his enemy had deserted his post and the coast was clear thatll make the haythen lave thought mrs mcguire who though sorry to see the rain on account of her washing exulted in the fact that pietro was caught out in it she went to the front door and looked out looking up the street she just caught a glimpse of the organ in rapid retreat she now unbolted the door the danger being at an end and went up to acquaint phil with the good news you may come down now she said is he gone inquired phil shure hes runnin up the street as fast as his legs can carry him thank you for saving me from him said phil with a great sense of relief at the flight of his enemy whisht now i dont nade any thanks come down by the fire now so phil went down and bridget on hospitable thoughts intent drew her only rockingchair near the stove and forced phil to sit down in it then she told him with evident enjoyment of the trick which pietro had tried to play on her and how he had failed he couldnt chate me the haythen she concluded i was too smart for the likes of him anyhow where do you live when you are at home i have no home now said phil with tears in his eyes and have you no father and mother yes said phil they live in italy and why did they let you go so far away they were poor and the padrone offered them money answered phil forced to answer though the subject was an unpleasant one and did they know he was a bad man and would bate you i dont think they knew said phil with hesitation my mother did not know ive got three childer myself said bridget theyll get wet comin home from school the darlints but i wouldnt let them go with any man to a far country if hed give me all the gowld in the world and where does that man live that trates you so bad in new york and does peter or whatever the haythens name is live there too yes pietro lives there the padrone is his uncle and treats him better than the rest of us he sent him after me to bring me back and what is your name is it peter like his no my name is filippo its a quare name american boys call me phil thats better its a christian name and the other isnt before i married my man i lived five years at mrs robertsons and she had a boy they called phil his whole name was philip thats my name in english then why dont you call it so instead of philipo what good is the o anyhow in my country they put the o before the name instead of to the tailend of it my mother was an oconnor but its likely ivery country has its own ways phil knew very little of ireland and did not fully understand mrs mcguires philosophical remarks otherwise they might have amused him as they may possibly amuse my readers i cannot undertake to chronicle the conversation that took place between phil and his hostess she made numerous inquiries to some of which he was able to give satisfactory replies to others not but in half an hour there was an interruption and a noisy one three stout freckledfaced children ran in at the back door dripping as if they had just emerged from a showerbath phil moved aside to let them approach the stove forthwith mrs mcguire was engaged in motherly care removing a part of the wet clothing and lamenting for the state in which her sturdy offspring had returned but presently order was restored and the bustle was succeeded by quiet play us a tune said pat the oldest phil complied with the request and played tune after tune to the great delight of the children as well as of mrs mcguire herself the result was that when shortly after on the storm subsiding phil proposed to go the children clamored to have him stay and he received such a cordial invitation to stop till the next morning that he accepted nothing loath so till the next morning our young hero is provided for chapter xxiii a pitched battle has my youthful reader ever seen a dog slinking home with downcast look and tall between his legs it was with very much the same air that pietro in the evening entered the presence of the padrone he had received a mortifying defeat and now he had before him the difficult task of acknowledging it well pietro said the padrone harshly where is filippo he is not with me answered pietro in an embarrassed manner didnt you see him then demanded his uncle hastily for an instant pietro was inclined to reply in the negative knowing that the censure he would incur would be less but phil might yet be taken he probably would be sooner or later pietro thought and then his falsehood would be found out and he would in consequence lose the confidence of the padrone so difficult though it was he thought it politic to tell the truth si signore i saw him said he then why didnt you drag him home demanded his uncle with contracted brow didnt i tell you to bring him home si signore but i could not are you not so strong as he then asked the padrone with a sneer is a boy of twelve more than a match for you who are six years older i could kill him with my little finger said pietro stung by this taunt and for the moment he looked as if he would like to do it then you didnt want to bring him come you are not too old for the stick yet pietro glowed beneath his dark skin with anger and shame when these words were addressed to him he would not have cared so much had they been alone but some of the younger boys were present and it shamed him to be threatened in their presence i will tell you how it happened he said suppressing his anger as well as he could and you will see that i was not in fault speak on then said his uncle but his tone was cold and incredulous pietro told the story as we know it it will not be necessary to repeat it when he had finished his uncle said with a sneer so you were afraid of a woman i am ashamed of you what could i do pleaded pietro what could you do repeated the padrone furiously you could push her aside run into the house and secure the boy you are a coward afraid of a woman it was her house said pietro she would call the police so could you you could say it was your brother you sought there was no difficulty do you think filippo is there yet i do not know tomorrow i will go with you myself said the padrone i see i cannot trust you alone you shall show me the house and i will take the boy pietro was glad to hear this it shifted the responsibility from his shoulders and he was privately convinced that mrs mcguire would prove a more formidable antagonist than the padrone imagined whichever way it turned out he would experience a feeling of satisfaction if the padrone got worsted it would show that he pietro need not be ashamed of his defeat if mrs mcguire had to surrender at discretion he would rejoice in her discomfiture so in spite of his reprimand he went to bed with better spirits than he came home the next morning pietro and the padrone proceeded to newark as proposed arrived there the former led his uncle at once to the house of the redoubtable mrs mcguire it will be necessary for us to precede them patrick mcguire was a laborer and for some months past had had steady work but as luck would have it work ceased for him on the day in which his wife had proved so powerful a protector to phil when he came home at night he announced this niver mind pat said mrs mcguire who was sanguine and hopeful well live somehow ive got a bit of money upstairs and ill earn something by washing we wont starve ill get work agin soon maybe said pat encouraged shure you will and if i dont ill help you wash said her husband humorously shure youd spoil the clothes said bridget laughing in the evening phil played and they had a merry time mr mcguire quite forgot that he was out of work and seizing his wife by the waist danced around the kitchen to the great delight of the children the next morning phil thanked mrs mcguire for her kindness and prepared to go away why will you go asked bridget hospitably shure we have room for you you can pay us a little for your atin and sleep with the childer i should like it said phil but but what pietro will come for me and if he does my pat will kick him out of doors mr mcguire was six feet in height and powerfully made there was no doubt he could do it if he had the opportunity but phil knew that he must go out into the streets and then pietro might waylay him when he had no protector at hand he explained his difficulty to mrs mcguire and she proposed that he should remain close at hand all the forenoon near enough to fly to the house as a refuge if needful if pietro did not appear in that time he probably would not at all phil agreed to this plan and accordingly began to play and sing in the neighborhood keeping a watchful lookout for the enemy his earnings were small for the neighborhood was poor still he picked up a few pennies and his store was increased by a twentyfive cent gift from a passing gentleman he had just commenced a new tune being at that time ten rods from the house when his watchful eyes detected the approach of pietro and more formidable still the padrone he did not stop to finish his tune but took to his heels at that moment the padrone saw him with a cry of exultation he started in pursuit and pietro with him he thought phil already in his grasp phil dashed breathless into the kitchen where mrs mcguire was ironing whats the matter she asked the padrone pietro and the padrone exclaimed phil pale with affright mrs mcguire took in the situation at once run upstairs she said pats up there on the bed he will see they wont take you phil sprang upstairs two steps at a time and dashed into the chamber mr mcguire was lying on the outside of the bed peacefully smoking a clay pipe whats the matther he asked repeating his wifes question they have come for me said phil have they said pat then theyll go back im thinkin where are they but there was no need of a reply as their voices were already audible from below talking with mrs mcguire the distance was so trifling that they had seen phil enter the house and the padrone having a contempt for the physical powers of woman followed boldly they met mrs mcguire at the door what do you want she demanded the boy said the padrone i saw him come in here did ye your eyes is sharp thin she stood directly in the passage so that neither could enter without brushing her aside send him out said the padrone faith and i wont said bridget he shall stay here as long as he likes i will come in and take him said the padrone furiously i wouldnt advise ye to thry it said mrs mcguire coolly move aside woman or i will make you said the italian angrily ill stay where i am shure its my own house and i have a right to do it pietro said the padrone with sudden thought he may escape from the front door go round and watch it by his sign bridget guessed what he said though it was spoken in italian he wont run away she said ill tell you where he is if you want to know where asked the padrone eagerly hes upstairs thin the padrone would not be restrained any longer he made a rush forward and pushing mrs mcguire aside sprang up the stairs he would have found greater difficulty in doing this but bridget knowing her husband was upstairs made little resistance and contented herself after the padrone had passed with intercepting pietro and clutching him vigorously by the hair to his great discomfort screaming murther at the top of her lungs the padrone heard the cry but in his impetuosity he did not heed it he expected to gain an easy victory over phil whom he supposed to be alone in the chamber he sprang toward him but had barely seized him by the arm when the gigantic form of the irishman appeared and the padrone found himself in his powerful grasp what business have ye here you bloody villain demanded pat breakin into an honest mans house without lave or license ill teach you manners you baste give me the boy gasped the padrone you cant have him thin said pat you want to bate him you murderin ould villain ill have you arrested said the padrone furiously writhing vainly to get himself free he was almost beside himself that phil should be the witness of his humiliation will you thin demanded pat thin the sooner you do it the betther open the window phil phil obeyed not knowing why the request was made he was soon enlightened the irishman seized the padrone and lifting him from the floor carried him to the window despite his struggles and thrusting him out let him drop it was only the second story and there was no danger of serious injury the padrone picked himself up only to meet with another disaster a passing policeman had heard mrs mcguires cries and on hearing her account had arrested pietro and was just in time to arrest the padrone also on the charge of forcibly entering the house as the guardian of the peace marched off with pietro on one side and the padrone on the other mrs mcguire sat down on a chair and laughed till she cried shure they wont come for you again in a hurry phil darlint she said theyve got all they want im thinkin i may add that the pair were confined in the stationhouse over night and the next day were brought before a justice reprimanded and fined chapter xxiv the death of giacomo great was the astonishment at the italian lodginghouse that night when neither the padrone nor pietro made his appearance great was the joy too for the nightly punishments were also necessarily omitted and the boys had no one to pay their money to there was another circumstance not so agreeable all the provisions were locked up and there was no supper for the hungry children finally at halfpast eleven three boys bolder than the rest went out and at last succeeded in obtaining some bread and crackers at an oyster saloon in sufficient quantities to supply all their comrades after eating heartily they went to bed and for one night the establishment ran itself much more satisfactorily to the boys than if the padrone had been present the next morning the boys went out as usual having again bought their breakfast and dispersed themselves about the city and vicinity heartily hoping that this state of things might continue but it was too good to last when they returned at evening they found their old enemy in command he looked more illtempered and sour than ever but gave no explanation of his and pietros absence except to say that he had been out of the city on business he called for the boys earnings of the day previous but to their surprise made no inquiries about how they had supplied themselves with supper or breakfast he felt that his influence over the boys and the terror which he delighted to inspire in them would be lessened if they should learn that he had been arrested and punished the boys were accustomed to look upon him as possessed of absolute power over them and almost regarded him as above law pietro too was silent partly for the same reasons which influenced the padrone partly because he was afraid of offending his uncle meanwhile poor giacomo remained sick if he had been as robust and strong as phil he would have recovered but he was naturally delicate and exposure and insufficient food had done their work only too well four days afterward to advance the story a little one of the boys came to the padrone in the morning saying signore padrone giacomo is much worse i think he is going to die nonsense said the padrone angrily he is only pretending to be sick so that he need not work i have lost enough by him already nevertheless he went to the little boys bedside giacomo was breathing faintly his face was painfully thin his eyes preternaturally bright he spoke faintly but his mind seemed to be wandering where is filippo he said i want to see filippo in this wish the padrone heartily concurred he too would have been glad to see filippo but the pleasure would not have been mutual why do you want to see filippo he demanded in his customary harsh tone giacomo heard and answered though unconscious who spoke to him i want to kiss him before i die he said what makes you think you are going to die said the tyrant struck by the boys appearance i am so weak murmured giacomo stoop down filippo i want to tell you something in your ear moved by curiosity rather than humanity the padrone stooped over and giacomo whispered when you go back to italy dear filippo go and tell my mother how i died tell her not to let my father sell my little brother to a padrone or he may die far away as i am dying promise me filippo there was no answer the padrone did indeed feel a slight emotion of pity but it was unhappily transient giacomo did not observe that the question was not answered kiss me filippo said the dying boy one of the boys who stood nearby with tears in his eyes bent over and kissed him giacomo smiled he thought it was filippo with that smile on his face he gave one quick gasp and died a victim of the padrones tyranny and his fathers cupidity it is the testimony of an eminent neapolitan physician i quote from signor casali editor of leco ditalia that of one hundred italian children who are sold by their parents into this white slavery but twenty ever return home thirty grow up and adopt various occupations abroad and fifty succumb to maladies produced by privation and exposure death came to giacomo as a friend no longer could he be forced out into the streets to suffer cold and fatigue and at night inhuman treatment and abuse his slavery was at an end we go back now to phil though he and his friends had again gained a victory over pietro and the padrone he thought it would not be prudent to remain in newark any longer he knew the revengeful spirit of his tyrants and dreaded the chance of again falling into their hands he must of course be exposed to the risk of capture while plying his vocation in the public streets therefore he resisted the invitation of his warmhearted protectors to make his home with them and decided to wander farther away from new york the next day therefore he went to the railway station and bought a ticket for a place ten miles further on this he decided would be far enough to be safe getting out of the train he found himself in a village of moderate size phil looked around him with interest he had the fondness natural to his age for seeing new places he soon came to a schoolhouse it was only a quarter of nine and some of the boys were playing outside phil leaned against a tree and looked on though he was at an age when boys enjoy play better than work or study he had no opportunity to join in their games one of the boys observing him came up and said frankly do you want to play with us yes said phil brightening up i should like to come on then phil looked at his fiddle and hesitated oh ill take care of your fiddle for you here this tree is hollow just put it inside and nobody will touch it phil needed no second invitation sure of the safety of his fiddle which was allimportant to him since it procured for him his livelihood he joined in the game with zest it was so simple that he easily understood it his laugh was as loud and merry as any of the rest and his face glowed with enjoyment it does not take long for boys to become acquainted in the brief time before the teachers arrival phil became on good terms with the schoolboys and the one who had first invited him to join them said come into school with us you shall sit in my seat will he let me asked phil pointing to the teacher to be sure he will come along phil took his fiddle from its hidingplace in the interior of the tree and walked beside his companion into the schoolroom it was the first time he had ever been in a schoolroom before and he looked about him with curiosity at the desks and the maps hanging on the walls the blackboards too he regarded with surprise not understanding their use after the opening exercises were concluded the teacher whose attention had been directed to the newcomer walked up to the desk where he was seated phil was a little alarmed for associating him with his recollections of the padrone he did not know but that he would be punished for his temerity in entering without the teachers invitation but he was soon reassured by the pleasant tone in which he was addressed what is your name my young friend filippo you are an italian i suppose si signore does that mean yes sir yes sir answered phil remembering to speak english is that your violin yes sir where do you live phil hesitated i am traveling he said at last you are young to travel alone how long have you been in this country a year and have you been traveling about all that time no signore i have lived in new york i suppose you have not gone to school no signore well i am glad to see you here i shall be glad to have you stay and listen to our exercises the teacher walked back to his desk and the lessons began phil listened with curiosity and attention for the first time in his life he felt ashamed of his own ignorance and wished he too might have a chance to learn as the children around him were doing but they had homes and parents to supply their wants while he must work for his livelihood after a time recess came then the boys gathered around and asked phil to play them a tune will he let me asked the young fiddler again referring to the teacher the latter being applied to readily consented and expressed his own wish to hear phil so the young minstrel played and sang several tunes to the group of children who gathered around him time passed rapidly and the recess was over before the children anticipated it i am sorry to disturb your enjoyment said the teacher but duty before pleasure you know i will only suggest that as our young friend here depends on his violin for support we ought to collect a little money for him james reynolds suppose you pass around your hat for contributions let me suggest that you come to me first the united offerings though small individually amounted to a dollar which phil pocketed with much satisfaction he did not remain after recess but resumed his wanderings and about noon entered a grocery store where he made a hearty lunch thus far good fortune attended him but the time was coming and that before long when life would wear a less sunny aspect chapter xxv phil finds a friend it was the evening before christmas until today the winter had been an open one but about one oclock in the afternoon the snow began to fall the flakes came thicker and faster and it soon became evident that an oldfashioned snowstorm had set in by seven oclock the snow lay a foot deep on the level but in some places considerably deeper for a brisk wind had piled it up in places in a handsome house some rods back from the village street lived dr drayton a physician whose skill was so well appreciated that he had already though still in the prime of life accumulated a handsome competence he sat this evening in his library in dressinggown and slippers his wife nearby engaged in some needlework i hope you wont be called out this evening joseph said mrs drayton as a gust of wind tattled the window panes i echo that wish my dear said the doctor looking up from the last number of the atlantic monthly i find it much more comfortable here reading dr holmes last article the snow must be quite deep it is i found my ride from the north village this afternoon bleak enough you know how the wind sweeps across the road near the pond schoolhouse i believe there is to be a christmaseve celebration in the town hall this evening is there not no it has been postponed till tomorrow evening that will be better the weather and walking will both be better shall we go mary if you wish it she said hesitatingly her husband understood her hesitation christmas day was a sad anniversary for them four years before their only son walter a boy of eight had died just as the christmas church bells were ringing out a summons to church since then the house had been a silent one the quiet unbroken by childish noise and merriment much as the doctor and his wife were to each other both felt the void which walters death had created and especially as the anniversary came around which called to mind their great loss i think we had better go said the doctor though god has bereft us of our own child it will be pleasant for us to watch the happy faces of others perhaps you are right joseph half an hour passed the doctor continued reading the atlantic while his wife occupied with thoughts which the conversation had called up kept on with her work just then the bell was heard to ring i hope it is not for you joseph said his wife apprehensively i am afraid it is said the doctor with a look of resignation i thought it would be too good luck for me to have the whole evening to myself i wish you were not a doctor said mrs drayton it is rather too late to change my profession my dear said her husband goodhumoredly i shall be fifty next birthday to be sure ellen jones tells me that in her class at the normal school there is a maiden lady of sixtytwo who has just begun to prepare herself for the profession of a teacher i am not quite so old as that here the servant opened the door ushering in a farm laborer goodevening abner said the doctor recognizing him as indeed he knew every face within half a dozen miles anything amiss at home mrs felton is took with spasms said abner can you come right over what have you done for her put her feet in warm water and put her to bed can you come right over yes said the doctor rising and exchanging his dressinggown for a coat and drawing on his boots i will go as soon as my horse is ready orders were sent out to put the horse to the sleigh this was quickly done and the doctor fully accoutered walked to the door i shall be back as soon as i can mary he said that wont be very soon it is a good twomiles ride i shant loiter on the way you may be sure of that abner i am ready the snow was still falling but not quite so fast as early in the afternoon the wind however blew quite as hard and the doctor found all his wrappings needful at intervals on the road he came to deep drifts of snow through which the horse had some difficulty in drawing the sleigh but at length he arrived at the door of his patient he found that the violence of her attack was over and satisfied of this left a few simple directions which he considered sufficient nature would do the rest now for home he said to himself i hope this will be my last professional call this evening mary will be impatient for my return he gave the reins to his horse who appeared to feel that he was bound homeward and traveled with more alacrity than he had come he too no doubt shared the doctors hope that this was the last service required of him before the morrow doctor drayton had completed rather more than half his journey when looking to the right his attention was drawn to a small dark object nearly covered with snow instinctively he reined up his horse good heavens he exclaimed it must be a boy god grant he is not frozen he leaped from his sleigh and lifted the insensible body it is an italian boy and here is his violin the poor child may be dead he said to himself in a startled tone i must carry him home and see what i can do for him so he took up tenderly our young hero for our readers will have guessed that it was phil and put both him and his violin into the sleigh then he drove home with a speed which astonished even his horse who though anxious to reach his comfortable stable would not voluntarily have put forth so great an exertion as was now required of him i must explain that phil had for the last ten days been traveling about the country getting on comfortably while the ground was bare of snow today however had proved very uncomfortable in the city the snow would have been cleared off and would not have interfered so much with traveling he had bought some supper at a grocery store and after spending an hour there had set out again on his wanderings he found the walking so bad that he made up his mind to apply for a lodging at a house not far back but a fierce dog by his barking had deterred him from the application the road was lonely and he had seen no other house since finally exhausted by the effort of dragging himself through the deep snow and stiff with cold he sank down by the side of the road and would doubtless have frozen had not the doctor made his appearance opportunely mrs drayton was alarmed when her husband entered the sittingroom bearing phils insensible form she jumped to her feet in alarm who is it joseph she asked a poor italian boy whom i found by the side of the road is he dead asked the doctors wife quickly i think not i will restore him if there is any life left in him it was fortunate for phil that he had been discovered by a skillful physician who knew the most effectual means of bringing him to the flame of life was burning low and a little longer exposure would have closed the earthly career of our young hero but he was spared as we hope for a happy and useful career by the application of powerful restoratives phil was at length brought round his chilled limbs grew warm and his heart began to beat more steadily and strongly a bed was brought down to the sittingroom and he was placed in it where am i he asked faintly when he opened his eyes you are with friends my boy dont ask questions now in the morning you may ask as many as you like phil closed his eyes languidly and soon fell into a sound sleep nature was doing her work well and rapidly in the morning phil woke up almost wholly restored as he opened his eyes he met the kind glances of the doctor and his wife how do you feel this morning asked the doctor i feel well said phil looking around him with curiosity do you think you could eat some breakfast asked dr drayton with a smile yes sir said phil then my lad i think i can promise you some as soon as you are dressed but i see from your looks you want to know where you are and how you came here dont you remember the snowstorm yesterday phil shuddered he remembered it only too well i found you lying by the side of the road about halfpast eight in the evening i suppose you dont remember my picking you up no sir you were insensible i was afraid at first you were frozen but i brought you home and thanks to providence you are all right again where is my fiddle asked phil anxiously it is safe there it is on the piano phil was relieved to see that his faithful companion was safe he looked upon it as his stock in trade for without it he would not have known how to make his livelihood he dressed quickly and was soon seated at the doctors wellspread table he soon showed that in spite of his exposure and narrow escape from death he had a hearty appetite mrs drayton saw him eat with true motherly pleasure and her natural love of children drew her toward our young hero and would have done so even had he been less attractive joseph she said addressing her husband i want to speak to you a moment he followed her out of the room well my dear he said i want to ask a favor it is granted in advance perhaps you will not say so when you know what it is i can guess it you want to keep this boy are you willing i would have proposed it if you had not he is without friends and poor we have enough and to spare we will adopt him in place of our lost walter thank you joseph it will make me happy whatever i do for him i will do for my lost darling they went back into the room they found phil with his cap on and his fiddle under his arm where are you going philip asked the doctor i am going into the street i thank you for your kindness would you not rather stay with us phil looked up uncertain of his meaning we had a boy once but he is dead will you stay with us and be our boy phil looked in the kind faces of the doctor and his wife and his face lighted up with joy at the unexpected prospect of such a home with people who would be kind to him i will stay he said you are very kind to me so our little hero had drifted into a snug harbor his toils and privations were over and for the doctor and his wife it was a glad day also on christmas day four years before they had lost a child on this christmas god had sent them another to fill the void in their hearts chapter xxvi conclusion it was a strange thing for the homeless fiddler to find himself the object of affectionate care and solicitude to feel when he woke up in the morning no anxiety about the days success he could not have found a better home naturally attractive and without serious faults phil soon won his way to the hearts of the good doctor and his wife the house seemed brighter for his presence and the void in the heart of the bereaved mother was partially filled her lost walter would have been of the same age as phil had he lived for his sake she determined to treat the boy who seemed cast by providence upon her protection as a son to begin with phil was carried to the village tailor where an ample wardrobe was ordered for him his old clothes were not cast aside but kept in remembrance of his appearance at the time he came to them it was a novel sensation for phil when in his new suit with a satchel of books in his hand he set out for the town school it is needless to say that his education was very defective but he was far from deficient in natural ability and the progress he made was so rapid that in a year he was on equal footing with the average of boys at his age he was able at that time to speak english as fluently as his companions and but for his dark eyes and clear brown complexion he might have been mistaken for an american boy his popularity with his schoolfellows was instant and decided his good humor and lively disposition might readily account for that even if his position as the adopted son of a prominent citizen had no effect but it was understood that the doctor who had no near relatives intended to treat phil in all respects as a son even to leaving him his heir it may be asked whether the padrone gave up all efforts to recover the young fiddler he was too vindictive for this boys had run away from him before but none had subjected him to such ignominious failure in the effort for their recovery it would have fared ill with our young hero if he had fallen again into the hands of his unscrupulous enemy but the padrone was not destined to recover him day after day pietro explored the neighboring towns but all to no purpose he only visited the principal towns while phil was in a small town not likely to attract the attention of his pursuers a week after his signal failure in newark the padrone inserted an advertisement in the new york herald offering a reward of twentyfive dollars for the recovery of phil but our hero was at that time wandering about the country and the advertisement did not fall under the eyes of those with whom he came in contact at length the padrone was compelled to own himself baffled and give up the search he was not without hopes however that sometime phil would turn up he did hear of him again through pietro but not in a way to bring him any nearer his recovery this is the way it happened one saturday morning in march about three months after phil had found a home the doctor said to him phil i am going to new york this morning on a little business would you like to come with me phils eyes brightened though he was happy in his village home he had longed at times to find himself in the city streets with which his old vagabond life had rendered him so familiar i should like it very much he answered eagerly then run upstairs and get ready i shall start in fifteen minutes phil started and then turned back i might meet pietro or the padrone he said hesitating no matter if you do i shall be with you if they attempt to recover you i will summon the police the doctor spoke so confidently that phil dismissed his momentary fear two hours later they set foot in new york now phil said the doctor my business will not take long after that if there are any friends you would like to see i will go with you and find them i should like to see paul hoffman said phil i owe him two dollars and a half for the fiddle he shall be paid said the doctor he shall lose nothing by trusting you an hour afterward while walking with the doctor in a side street phils attention was attracted by the notes of a handorgan turning in the direction from which they came he met the glance of his old enemy pietro it is pietro he said quickly touching the arm of his companion pietro had not been certain till then that it was phil it looked like him to be sure but his new clothing and general appearance made such a difference between him and the phil of former days that he would have supposed it only an accidental resemblance but phils evident recognition of him convinced him of his identity he instantly ceased playing and with eager exultation advanced to capture him phil would have been alarmed but for his confidence in the doctors protection i have got you at last scelerato said pietro roughly grasping phil by the shoulder with a hostile glance the doctor instantly seized him by the collar and hurled him back what do you mean by assaulting my son he demanded coolly pietro was rather astonished at this unexpected attack he is my brother he said he must go back with me he is not your brother if you touch him again i will hand you to the police he ran away from my uncle said pietro your uncle should have treated him better he stole a fiddle said pietro doggedly he had paid for it over and over again said the doctor phil come along we have no further business with this young man they walked on but pietro followed at a little distance seeing this dr drayton turned back young man he said do you see that policeman across the street si signore answered pietro then i advise you to go in a different direction or i shall request him to follow you pietros sallow face was pale with rage he felt angry enough to tear phil to pieces but his rage was unavailing he had a wholesome fear of the police and the doctors threat was effectual he turned away though with reluctance and phil breathed more freely pietro communicated his information to the padrone and the latter finding that phil had found a powerful protector saw that it would be dangerous for him to carry the matter any further and sensibly resolved to give up the chase of the padrone i have only further to say that some months later he got into trouble in a low drinking saloon an altercation arose between him and another ruffian one evening when the padrone in his rage drew a knife and stabbed his adversary he was arrested and is now serving out his sentence in sing sing pietro by arrangement with him took his place stipulating to pay him a certain annual sum but he has taken advantage of his uncles incarceration to defraud him and after the first payment neglected to make any returns it may readily be imagined that this imbitters the padrones imprisonment knowing what i do of his fierce temper i should not be surprised to hear of a murderous encounter between him and his nephew after his release from imprisonment unless as is probable just before the release pietro should flee the country with the illgotten gains he may have acquired during his term of office meanwhile the boys are treated with scarcely less rigor by him than by his uncle and toil early and late suffering hardships and privations that pietro may grow rich paul hoffman had often thought of phil and how he had fared he was indeed surprised and pleased when the young fiddler walked up and called him by name phil he exclaimed grasping his hand heartily i am very glad to see you have you made a fortune he has found a father said dr drayton speaking for phil who wants to thank you for your past kindness to his son it was nothing said paul modestly it was a great deal to phil for except your family he had no friends to this paul made a suitable reply and gave phil and his new father an earnest invitation to dine with him this the doctor declined but agreed to call at the rooms of mrs hoffman if paul would agree to come and pass the next sunday with phil as his visitor paul accepted the invitation with pleasure and it is needless to say that he received a hearty welcome and agreed in the approaching summer to make another visit and now we bid farewell to phil the young street musician if his life henceforth shall be less crowded with adventures and so less interesting it is because he has been fortunate in securing a good home some years hence the doctor promises to give himself a vacation and take phil with him to europe where he will seek out his italian home and the mother with whom he has already opened communication by letter so we leave phil in good hands and with the prospect of a prosperous career but there are hundreds of young street musicians who have not met with his good fortune but are compelled by hard necessity to submit to the same privations and hardships from which he is happily relieved may a brighter day dawn for them also i hope my readers feel an interest in paul hoffman the young street merchant who proved so efficient a friend to our young hero his earlier adventures are chronicled in paul the peddler his later history will be chronicled in the next volume of this series which will be entitled slow and sure or from the sidewalk to the shop the end
