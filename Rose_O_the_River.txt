rose o the river table of contents the pine and the rose old kennebec the edgewood drive blasphemious swearin the game of jackstraws hearts and other hearts the little house the garden of eden the serpent the turquoise ring rose sees the world gold and pinchbeck a country chevalier housebreaking the dream room the pine and the rose it was not long after sunrise and stephen waterman fresh from his dip in the river had scrambled up the hillside from the hut in the alderbushes where he had made his morning toilet an early ablution of his sort was not the custom of the farmers along the banks of the saco but the waterman house was hardly a stones throw from the water and there was a clear deep swimminghole in the willow cove that would have tempted the busiest man or the least cleanly in york county then too stephen was a child of the river born reared schooled on its very brink never happy unless he were on it or in it or beside it or at least within sight or sound of it the immensity of the sea had always silenced and overawed him left him cold in feeling the river wooed him caressed him won his heart it was just big enough to love it was full of charms and changes of varying moods and sudden surprises its voice stole in upon his ear with a melody far sweeter and more subtle than the boom of the ocean yet it was not without strength and when it was swollen with the freshets of the spring and brimming with the bounty of its sister streams it could dash and roar boom and crash with the best of them stephen stood on the side porch drinking in the glory of the sunrise with the saco winding like a silver ribbon through the sweet loveliness of the summer landscape and the river rolled on toward the sea singing its morning song creating and nourishing beauty at every step of its onward path cradled in the heart of a great mountainrange it pursued its gleaming way here lying silent in glassy lakes there rushing into tinkling little falls foaming great falls and thundering cataracts scores of bridges spanned its width but no steamers flurried its crystal depths here and there a rough little rowboat tethered to a willow rocked to and fro in some quiet bend of the shore here the silver gleam of a rising perch chub or trout caught the eye there a pickerel lay rigid in the clear water a fish carved in stone here eels coiled in the muddy bottom of some pool and there under the deep shadows of the rocks lay fat sleepy bass old and incredibly wise quite untempted by and wholly superior to the rural fishermans worm the river lapped the shores of peaceful meadows it flowed along banks green with maple beech sycamore and birch it fell tempestuously over darns and fought its way between rocky cliffs crowned with stately firs it rolled past forests of pine and hemlock and spruce now gentle now terrible for there is said to be an indian curse upon the saco whereby with every great sun the child of a paleface shall be drawn into its cruel depths lashed into fury by the stony reefs that impeded its progress the river looked now sapphire now gold now white now leaden gray but always it was hurrying hurrying on its appointed way to the sea after feasting his eyes and filling his heart with a morning draught of beauty stephen went in from the porch and pausing at the stairway called in stentorian tones get up and eat your breakfast rufus the boys will be picking the side jams today and im going down to work on the logs if you come along bring your own pickpole and peavey then going to the kitchen pantry he collected from the various shelves a pitcher of milk a loaf of bread half an applepie and a bowl of blueberries and with the easy methods of a household unswayed by feminine rule moved toward a seat under an appletree and took his morning meal in great apparent content having finished and washed his dishes with much more thoroughness than is common to unsuperintended man and having given rufus the second call to breakfast with the vigor and acrimony that usually marks that unpleasant performance he strode to a high point on the riverbank and shading his eyes with his hand gazed steadily down stream patches of green fodder and blossoming potatoes melted into soft fields that had been lately mown and there were glimpses of tasseling corn rising high to catch the sun far far down on the opposite bank of the river was the hint of a brown roof and the tip of a chimney that sent a slender wisp of smoke into the clear air beyond this and farther back from the water the trees apparently hid a cluster of other chimneys for thin spirals of smoke ascended here and there the little brown roof could never have revealed itself to any but a lovers eye and that discerned something even smaller something like a pinkish speck that moved hither and thither on a piece of greensward that sloped to the waterside shes up stephen exclaimed under his breath his eyes shining his lips smiling his voice had a note of hushed exaltation about it as if she whoever she might be had in condescending to rise conferred a priceless boon upon a waiting universe if she were indeed a up so his tone implied then the day somewhat falsely heralded by the sunrise had really begun and the human race might pursue its appointed tasks inspired and uplifted by the consciousness of her existence it might properly be grateful for the fact of her birth that she had grown to womans estate and above all that in common with the sun the lark the morningglory and other beautiful things of the early day she was up and about her lovely cheery heartwarming business the handful of chimneys and the smoke spirals rising here and there among the trees on the riverbank belonged to what was known as the brier neighborhood there were only a few houses in all scattered along a side road leading from the river up to liberty centre there were no great signs of thrift or prosperity but the wiley cottage the only one near the water was neat and well cared for and nature had done her best to conceal mans indolence poverty or neglect bushes of sweetbrier grew in fragrant little forests as tall as the fences clumps of wild roses sprang up at every turn and over all the stone walls as well as on every heap of rocks by the wayside prickly blackberry vines ran and clambered and clung yielding fruit and thorns impartially to the neighborhood children the pinkish speck that stephen waterman had spied from his side of the river was rose wiley of the brier neighborhood on the edgewood side as there was another of her name on brigadier hill the edgewood minister called one of them the climbing rose and the other the brier rose or sometimes rose of the river she was well named the pinkish speck she had not only some of the sweetest attributes of the wild rose but the parallel might have been extended as far as the thorns for she had wounded her scores hearts be it understood not hands the wounding was on the whole very innocently done and if fault could be imputed anywhere it might rightly have been laid at the door of the kind powers who had made her what she was since the smile that blesses a single heart is always destined to break many more she had not a single silk gown but she had what is far better a figure to show off a cotton one not a brooch nor a pair of earrings was numbered among her possessions but any ordinary gems would have looked rather dull and trivial when compelled to undergo comparison with her bright eyes as to her hair the local milliner declared it impossible for rose wiley to get an unbecoming hat that on one occasion being in a frolicsome mood rose had tried on all the headgear in the village emporium childrens gingham shakers mourning bonnets for aged dames mens haying hats and visored caps and she proved superior to every test looking as pretty as a pink in the best ones and simply ravishing in the worst in fact she had been so fashioned and finished by nature that had she been set on a revolving pedestal in a showwindow the bystanders would have exclaimed as each new charm came into view look at her waist see her shoulders and her neck and chin and her hair while the children gazing with raptured admiration would have shrieked in unison i choose her for mine all this is as much as to say that rose of the river was a beauty yet it quite fails to explain nevertheless the secret of her power when she looked her worst the spell was as potent as when she looked her best hidden away somewhere was a vital spark which warmed every one who came in contact with it her lovely little person was a trifle below medium height and it might as well be confessed that her soul on the morning when stephen waterman saw her hanging out the clothes on the river bank was not large enough to be at all out of proportion but when eyes and dimples lips and cheeks enslave the onlooker the soul is seldom subjected to a close or critical scrutiny besides rose wiley was a nice girl neat as wax energetic merry amiable economical she was a dutiful granddaughter to two of the most irritating old people in the county she never patronized her pugnosed pastyfaced girl friends she made wonderful pies and doughnuts and besides small souls if they are of the right sort sometimes have a way of growing to the discomfiture of cynics and the gratification of the angels so on one bank of the river grew the brier rose a fragile thing swaying on a slender stalk and looking at its pretty reflection in the water and on the other a sturdy pine tree well rooted against wind and storm and the sturdy pine yearned for the wild rose and the rose so far as it knew yearned for nothing at all certainly not for rugged pine trees standing tall and grim in rocky soil if in its present stage of development it gravitated toward anything in particular it would have been a welldressed white birch growing on an irreproachable lawn and the river now deep now shallow now smooth now tumultuous now sparkling in sunshine now gloomy under clouds rolled on to the engulfing sea it could not stop to concern itself with the petty comedies and tragedies that were being enacted along its shores else it would never have reached its destination only last night under a full moon there had been pairs of lovers leaning over the rails of all the bridges along its course but that was a common sight like that of the ardent couples sitting on its shady banks these summer days looking only into each others eyes but exclaiming about the beauty of the water lovers would come and go sometimes reappearing with successive installments of loves in a way wholly mysterious to the river meantime it had its own work to do and must be about it for the side jams were to be broken and the boom let out at the edgewood bridge old kennebec it was just seven oclock that same morning when rose wiley smoothed the last wrinkle from her dimity counterpane picked up a shred of cornhusk from the spotless floor under the bed slapped a mosquito on the windowsill removed all signs of murder with a moist towel and before running down to breakfast cast a frowning look at her pincushion almira otherwise mite shapley had been in her room the afternoon before and disturbed with her careless hand the pattern of roses pins they were kept religiously in the form of a maltese cross and if while she was extricating one from her clothing there had been an alarm of fire rose would have stuck the pin in its appointed place in the design at the risk of losing her life entering the kitchen with her light step she brought the morning sunshine with her the old people had already engaged in differences of opinion but they commonly suspended open warfare in her presence there were the usual last things to be done for breakfast offices that belonged to her as her grandmothers assistant she took yesterdays soda biscuits out of the steamer where they were warming and softening brought an apple pie and a plate of seed cakes from the pantry settled the coffee with a piece of dried fish skin and an egg shell and transferred some fried potatoes from the spider to a covered dish did you remember the meat grandpa were all out she said as she began buttoning a stiff collar around his reluctant neck remember land yes i wisht i ever could forgit anything the butcher says hes bout tired o travelin over the country lookin for critters to kill but if he finds anything hell be up along in the course of a week he aint a real smart butcher cyse higgins aint land rose dont button that dickey clean through my epperdummis i have to sport starched collars in this life on account o you and your granmother bein so chock full o style but i hope to the lord i shant have to wear em in another world you wont his wife responded with the snap of a dish towel or if you do theyll wilt with the heat rose smiled but the soft hand with which she tied the neckcloth about the old mans withered neck pacified his spirit and he smiled knowingly back at her as she took her seat at the breakfast table spread near the open kitchen door she was a dazzling rose and it is to be feared a wasted one for there was no one present to observe her clean pink calico and the still more subtle note struck in the green ribbon which was tied round her throat the ribbon that formed a sort of calyx out of which sprang the flower of her face as fresh and radiant as if it had bloomed that morning give me my coffee turrible quick said mr wiley i must be down the bridge fore they start dogwarpin the side jam i notice youre always due at the bridge on churnin days remarked his spouse testily taint me as appints drivin dates at edgewood replied the old man the boysll hev a turrible job this year the logs air ricked up jest like roses jackstraws i never seeem so turrible ricked up in all my experence an lije dennett don know no more bout pickin a jam than coopers cow turrible sot in his ways too cant take a mite of advice i was tellin him how to go to work on that bung thats formed between the gret gray rock an the shore the awfullest place to bung that there is between this an biddeford and says he look here ive ben boss on this river for twelve year an ill be doggoned if im goin to be taught my business by any man this aint no river says i as youd know says i if youd ever lived on the kennebec pity you hednt stayed on it says he i wish to the land i hedsays i an then i come away for my tongues so turrible spry an sarcustic that i knew if i stopped any longer i should stir up strife theres some folks thatll set on addled aigs year in an year out as if there want good fresh ones bein laid every day an lije dennetts one of em when it comes to river drivin theres lots o folks as have made a good livin by mindin their own business observed the still sententious mrs wiley as she speared a sodabiscuit with her fork mindin your own business is a turrible selfish trade responded her husband loftily if your neighbor is more ignorant than what you are particlarly if hes as ignorant as coopers cow youd ought as a kennebec man an a christian to set him on the right track though its always a turrible risky thing to do roses grandfather was called by the irreverent younger generation sometimes turrible wiley and sometimes old kennebec because of the frequency with which these words appeared in his conversation there were not wanting those of late who dubbed him uncle ananias for reasons too obvious to mention after a long indolent tolerably truthful and useless life he had at seventyfive lost sight of the dividing line between fact and fancy and drew on his imagination to such an extent that he almost staggered himself when he began to indulge in reminiscence he was a feature of the edgewood drive being always present during the five or six days that it was in progress sometimes sitting on the riverbank sometimes leaning over the bridge sometimes reclining against the buttend of a huge log but always chewing tobacco and expectorating to incredible distances as he criticized and damned impartially all the expedients in use at the particular moment i want to stay down by the river this afternoon said rose ever so many of the girls will be there and all my sewing is done up if grandpa will leave the horse for me ill take the drivers lunch to them at noon and bring the dishes back in time to wash them before supper i suppose you can go if the rest do said her grandmother though its an awful lazy way of spendin an afternoon when i was a girl there was no such dawdlin goin on i can tell you nobody thought o lookin at the river in them days there wasnt time but its such fun to watch the logs rose exclaimed next to dancing the greatest fun in the world specially as all the young men in town will be there watchin too was the grandmothers reply eben brooks an richard bean got home yesterday with their doctors diplomas in their pockets mrs brooks says eben stood fortynine in a class o fiftyfive an seemed considable proud of him an i guess it is the first time he ever stood anywheres but at the foot i tell you when these fiftyfive new doctors git scattered over the country therell be considable many folks keepin house under ground dick beans goin to stop a spell with rufe an steve waterman thatll make one more to play in the river rufus aint hardly got his workin legs on yit allowed mrwiley but steves all right hes a turrible smart driver an turrible reckless too hell take all the chances there is though to a man thats lived on the kennebec there aint what can rightly be called any turrible chances on the saco hed better be tendin to his farm objected mrs wiley his hay is all in rose spoke up quickly and he only helps on the river when the farm work isnt pressing besides though its all play to him he earns his two dollars and a half a day he dont keer about the two and a half said her grandfather he jest cant keep away from the logs theres some that cant when i first moved here from gardner where the climate never suited me the climate of any place where you hev regular work never did an never will suit you remarked the old mans wife but the interruption received no comment such mistaken views of his character were too frequent to make any impression as i was sayin rose he continued when we first moved here from gardner we lived neighbor to the watermans steve an rufus was little boys then always playin with a couple o wild cousins o theirn considable older steve would scare his mother pretty nigh to death stealin away to the mill to ride on the carriageside o the log that was bein sawed hitchin clean out over the river an then jerkin back most into the jaws o the machinery he never hed any common sense to spare even when he was a young one remarked mrs wiley and i dont see as all the cademy education his father throwed away on him has changed him much and with this observation she rose from the table and went to the sink steve aint nobodys fool dissented the old man but hes kind o daft about the river when he was little he was allers buildin dams in the brook an sailin chips an runnin on the logs allers choppin up stickins an raftin em together in the pond i callate mis waterman died considable afore her time jest from fright lookin out the winders and seein her boys slippin between the logs an gittin their daily dousin she could nt understand it an theres a heap o things womenfolks never do an never can understand jest because they air womenfolks one o the things is men i spose interrupted mrs wiley men in general but more particlarly husbands assented old kennebec howsomever theres another thing they dont an cant never take in an thats sport steve does river drivin as he would horseracin or tigershootin or tightrope dancin an he always did from a boy when he was about twelve or fifteen he used to help the riverdrivers spring and fall reglar he couldnt do nothin but shin up an down the rocks after hammers an hatchets an ropes but he was turrible pleased with his job stepanfetchit they used to call him them days stephanfetchit waterman good name for him yet came in acid tones from the sink hes still steppin an fetchin only its rose thats doin the drivin now im not driving anybody that i know of answered rose with heightened color but with no loss of her habitual selfcommand then when he graduated from errants went on the crafty old man who knew that when breakfast ceased churning must begin steve used to get seventyfive cents a day helpin clear up the river if you can call this here silvry streamlet a river hed pick off a log here an there an send it afloat an dig out them that hed got ketched in the rocks and tidy up the banks jest like spring housecleanin if hed hed any kind of a boss an hed ben trained on the kennebec hed a made a turrible smart driver steve would hell be drownded thats whatll become o him prophesied mrs wiley specially if rose encourages him in such silly foolishness as ridin logs from his house down to ourn dark nights seein as how steve built ye a nice pig pen last month pears to me you might have a good word for him now an then mother remarked old kennebec reaching for his second piece of pie i want a mite deceived by that pig pen no moren i was by jed towles hen coop nor ivory dunns wellcurb nor pitt packards shedsteps if you hed ever kep up your buildins yourself roses beaux wouldnt hev to do their courtin with carpenters tools its the pigpen an the hencoop you want to keep your eye on mother not the motives of them as made em its turrible onsettlin to inspeck folks motives too turrible close riding a log is no more to steve than riding a horse so he says interposed rose to change the subject but i tell him that a horse doesnt revolve under you and go sideways at the same time that it is going forwards logridin aint no trick at all to a man of sperit said mr wiley theres a few places in the kennebec where the waters too shaller to let the logs float so we used to build a flume an the logs would whiz down like arrers shot from a bow the boys used to collect by the side o that there flume to see me ride a log down an ive watched em drop in a dead faint when i spun by the crowd but land you cant drownd some folks not without you tie nailkegs to their head an feet an drop em in the falls i ve rid logs down the bilinest rapids o the kennebec an never lost my head i remember well the year o the gret freshet i rid a log from there there father thatll do said mrs wiley decisively ill put the cream in the churn an you jest work off some o your steam by bringin the butter for us afore you start for the bridge it dont do no good to brag afore your own womenfolks work goes considable bettern stories at every place cept the loafers bench at the tavern and the baffled raconteur who had never done a piece of work cheerfully in his life dragged himself reluctantly to the shed where before long one could hear him moving the dasher up and down sedately to his favorite churning tune of broad is the road that leads to death and thousands walk together there but wisdom shows a narrow path with here and there a traveler the edgewood drive just where the bridge knits together the two little villages of pleasant river and edgewood the glassy mirror of the saco broadens suddenly sweeping over the dam in a luminous torrent gushes of pure amber mark the middle of the dam with crystal and silver at the sides and from the seething vortex beneath the golden cascade the white spray dashes up in fountains in the crevices and hollows of the rocks the mad water churns itself into snowy froth while the foamdecked torrent deep strong and troubled to its heart sweeps majestically under the bridge then dashes between wooded shores piled high with steep masses of rock or torn and riven by great gorges there had been much rain during the summer and the saco was very high so on the third day of the edgewood drive there was considerable excitement at the bridge and a goodly audience of villagers from both sides of the river there were some who never came some who had no fancy for the sight some to whom it was an old story some who were too busy but there were many to whomit was the event of events a neverending source of interest above the fall covering the placid surface of the river thousands of logs lay quietly in boom until the turning out process on the last day of the drive should release them and give them their chance of display their brief moment of notoriety their opportunity of interesting amusing exciting and exasperating the onlookers by their antics heaps of logs had been cast up on the rocks below the dam where they lay in hopeless confusion adding nothing however to the problem of the moment for they too bided their time if they had possessed wisdom discretion and caution they might have slipped gracefully over the falls and steering clear of the hidden ledges about which it would seem they must have heard whispers from the old pine trees along the river have kept a straight course and reached their destination without costing the edgewood lumber company a small fortune or if they had inclined toward a jolly and adventurous career they could have joined one of the various jams or bungs stimulated by the thought that any one of them might be a keylog holding for a time the entire mass in its despotic power but they had been stranded early in the game and after lying high and dry for weeks would be picked off one by one and sent downstream in the tumultuous boil the foaming hubbub and flurry at the foot of the falls one enormous peeled log wallowed up and down like a huge rhinoceros greatly pleasing the children by its clumsy cavortings some conflict of opposing forces kept it ever in motion yet never set it free below the bridge were always the real battlegrounds the scenes of the first and the fiercest conflicts a ragged ledge of rock standing well above the yeasty torrent marked the middle of the river stephen had been stranded there once just at dusk on a stormy afternoon in spring a jam had broken under the men and stephen having taken too great risks had been caught on the moving mass and leaping from log to log his only chance for life had been to find a footing on gray rock which was nearer than the shore rufus was ill at the time and mrs waterman so anxious and nervous that processions of boys had to be sent up to the river farm giving the frightened mother the latest bulletins of her sons welfare luckily the river was narrow just at the gray rock and it was a quite possible task though no easy one to lash two ladders together and make a narrow bridge on which the drenched and shivering man could reach the shore there were loud cheers when stephen ran lightly across the slender pathway that led to safety ran so fast that the ladders had scarce time to bend beneath his weight he had certainly taken chances but when did he not do that the loggers life is one of moving accidents by flood and field and stephen welcomed with wild exhilaration every hazard that came in his path to him there was never a dull hour from the moment that the first notch was cut in the tree for he sometimes joined the boys in the lumber camp just for a frolic till the later one when the hewn log reached its final destination he knew nothing of tooling a fourinhand through narrow lanes or crowded thoroughfares nothing of guiding a horse over the hedges and through the pitfalls of a stiff bit of hunting country his steed was the rearing plunging kicking log and he rode it like a river god the crowd loves daring and so it welcomed stephen with braves but it knew as he knew that he was only doing his duty by the company only showing the saco that man was master only keeping the old waterman name in good repute ye cant drownd some folks old kennebec had said as he stood in a group on the shore not without you tie sandbags toem an drop em in the great eddy im the same kind i remember when i was stranded on jest sech a rock in the kennebec only they left me there all night for dead an i had to swim the rapids when it come daylight were well acquainted with that rock and them rapids exclaimed one of the riverdrivers to the delight of the company rose had reason to remember stephens adventure for he had clambered up the bank smiling and blushing under the hurrahs of the boys and coming to the wagon where she sat waiting for her grandfather had seized a moment to whisper did you care whether i came across safe rose say you did stephen recalled that question too on this august morning perhaps because this was to be a redletter day and sometime when he had a free moment sometime before supper when he and rose were sitting apart from the others watching the logs he intended again to ask her to marry him this thought trembled in him stirring the deeps of his heart like a great wave almost sweeping him off his feet when he held it too close and let it have full sway it would be the fourth time that he had asked rose this question of all questions but there was no perceptible difference in his excitement for there was always the possible chance that she might change her mind and say yes if only for variety wanting a thing continuously unchangingly unceasingly year after year he thought longing to reach it as the river longed to reach the sea such wanting might in course of time mean having rose drove up to the bridge with the mens luncheon and the under boss came up to take the baskets and boxes from the back of the wagon weve had a reglar tussle this mornin rose he said the logs are determined not to move ike billings thats the hansomest and fluentest allround swearer on the saco has tried his best on the side jam hes all out o cusswords and there haint a log budged now stid o dogwarpin this afternoon an lettin the oxen haul off all them stubborn logs by main force were goin to ask you to set up on the bank and smile at the jam land she can do it says ike a minute ago when rose starts smilin he says there aint a jam nor a bung in me that dont melt like wax and jest float right off same as the logs do when they get into quiet sunny water rose blushed and laughed and drove up the hill to mite shapleys where she put up the horse and waited till the men had eaten their luncheon the drivers slept and had breakfast and supper at the billings house a mile down river but for several years mrs wiley had furnished the noon meal sending it down piping hot on the stroke of twelve the boys always said that up or down the whole length of the saco there was no such cooking as the wileys and much of this praise was earned by roses serving it was the old grandmother who burnished the tin plates and dippers till they looked like silver for crotchety and sharptongued as she was she never allowed rose to spoil her hands with soft soap and sand but it was rose who planned and packed rose who hemmed squares of old white tablecloths and sheets to line the baskets and keep things daintily separate rose also whose tarts and cakes were the pride and admiration of church sociables and sewing societies where could such smoking pots of beans be found a murmur of ecstatic approval ran through the crowd when the covers were removed pieces of sweet homefed pork glistened like varnished mahogany on the top of the beans and underneath were such deeps of fragrant juice as come only from slow fires and long quiet hours in brick ovens who else could steam and bake such mealy leaves of brown bread brown as plumpudding yet with no suspicion of sogginess who such sodabiscuits big feathery tasting of cream and hardly needing butter and greenapple pies could such candied lower crusts be found elsewhere or more delectable filling or such rich nutty doughnuts doughnuts that had spurned the hot fat which is the ruin of so many and risen from its waves like goldenbrown venuses by the great seleckmen ejaculated jed towle as he swallowed his fourth id like to hev a wife two daughters and four sisters like them wileys and jest set still on the riverbank an hev em cook victuals for me id hev nothin to wish for then but a mouth as big as the sacos and i wish this custard pie was the size o bonnie eagle pond said ike billings id like to fall into the middle of it and eat my way out look at that bunch o chiny asters tied on t the bail o that biscuitpail said ivory dunn thats the girls doins you bet womenfolks dont seem to make no boquets after they git married lets divide em up an wear em drivin this afternoon mebbe theyll ketch the eye sot our rags wont show so bad land its lucky my hundred days is about up if i dont git home soon i shall be arrested for goin without cloes i set upbout all night puttin these blue patches in my pants an tryin to piece together a couple of old redflannel shirts to make one whole one thats the worst o drivin in these places where the pretty girls make a habit of comin down to the bridge to see the fun you hev to keep rigged up jest so stylish you cant git no chance at the rum bottle an you even hev to go a leetle mite light on swearin blasphemious swearin steve watermans an awful nice feller exclaimed ivory dunn just then stephen had been looking intently across the river watching the shapleys side door from which rose might issue at any moment and at this point in the discussion he had lounged away from the group and moving toward the bridge began to throw pebbles idly into the water hes an awful smart driver for one that dont foiler drivin the year round continued ivory and hes the awfullest cleanspoken softspoken feller i ever see theres ben two black sheep in his family aready an steve kind o feels as if hed ought to be extry white remarked jed towle you fellers that belonged to the old drive remember pretty quick waterman well enough steves mother brought him up yes most of them remembered the waterman twins stephens cousins now both dead slow waterman so moderate in his steps and actions that you had to fix a landmark somewhere near him to see if he moved and pretty quick who shone by comparison with his twin id kind o forgot that pretty quick waterman was cousin to steve said the under boss he never worked with me much but he want cut off the same piece o goods as the other watermans great hemlock but he kep a cussin dictionary pretty quick did whenever he heard any new words he must a writ em down an then studied em all up in the wintertime to use in the spring drive swearins a habit that hed ought to be practiced with turrible caution observed old mr wiley when the drivers had finished luncheon and taken out their pipes theres three kinds o swearin plain swearin profane swearin an blasphemious swearin logs air jest like mules theres times when a man cant seem to rip up a jam in good style thout a few words thats too strong for the infant classes in sundayschools but a man hednt ought to tempt providence when hes ridin a log near the falls at high water or cuttin the keylog in a jam he aint in no place for blasphemious swearin jest a little easy perlitedamn is bout all he can resk if he dont want to git drownded an hev his ghost walkin the riverbanks till kingdom come you an i long was the only ones that seen pretty quick go want we continued old kennebec glancing at long abe dennett cousin to short abe who lay on his back in the grass the smokewreaths rising from his pipe and the steel spikes in his heavy calkedsole boots shining in the sun there was folks on the bridge long answered but we was the only ones near enough to see an hear it was so onexpected an so soon over that them as was watchin upstream where the men was to work on the falls wouldnt a hed time to see him go down but i did an nobody aint heard me swear sence though its ten years ago i allers said it was rum an bravadder that killed pretty quick waterman that day the boys hednt give him a dare that he hednt took up he seemed like he was possessed an the logs was the same way they was fairly wild leapin around in the maddest kind o water you ever see the river was bilin high that spring it was an awful stubborn jam an pretty quick hed ben workin on it sence dinner he clumb up the bank moren once to have a pull at the bottle that was hid in the bushes interpolated mr wiley like as not that was his failin well most o the boys were on the other side o the river workin above the bridge an the boss hed called pretty quick to come off an leave the jam till mornin when theyd get horses an dogwarp it off log by log but when the boss got out o sight pretty quick jest stood right still swingin his axe an blasphemin so t would freeze your blood vowin he wouldnt move till the logs did if he stayed there till the crack o doom jest then a great ponderous log that hed ben churnin up an down in the falls for a week got free an come blunderin an thunderin downriver land it was chockfull o water an looked bout as big as a church it come straight along buttend foremost an struck that jam full force sot every log in it shivered there was a crack the crack o doom sure enough for pretty quick an one o the logs lep right out an struck him jest where he stood with his axe in the air blasphemin the jam kind o melted an crumbled up an in a second pretty quick was whirlin in the white water he never riz at least where we could see him an we didnt find him for a week thats the whole story an i guess steve takes it as a warnin any way he aint no friend to rum nor swearin steve aint he knows pretty quicks ways shortened his mothers life an you notice what a sharp lookout he keeps on rufus he needs it ike billings commented tersely some men seem to lose their wits when theyre workin on logs observed mr wiley who had deeply resented long dennetts telling of a story which he knew fully as well and could have told much better now natrally ive seen things on the kennebec three cheers for the saco hats off boys shouted jed towle and his directions were followed with a will as i was sayin continued the old man peacefully ive seen things on the kennebec that wouldnt happen on a small river an ive ben in turrible places an taken turrible resks resks that would a turned a saco river mans hair white but them is the times when my wits work the quickest i remember once i was smokin my pipe when a jam broke under me t was a small jam or what we call a small jam on the kennebec only about three hundred thousand pine logs the first thing i knowed i was shootin back an forth in the bilin foam hangin on t the end of a log like a spider my hands was clasped round the log and i never lost control o my pipe they said i smoked right along jest as cool an placid as a pondlily whyd you quit drivin inquired ivory my strength want ekal to it mr wiley responded sadly i was all skin bones an nerve the compny wouldnt part with me altogether so they give me a place in the office down on the wharves that want so bad said jed towle why didnt you hang on to it sos to keep in sight o the kennebec i found i couldnt be confined under cover my liver give all out my appetite failed me an i want wuth a days wages id learned engineerin when i was a boy an i thought id try runnin on the road a spell but it didnt suit my constitution my kidneys aint turrible strong an the doctors said id have brights disease if i didnt git some kind o work where there want no vibrations hard to find mr wiley hard to find said jed towle youre right responded the old man feelingly ive tried all kinds o labor some of em dont suit my liver some disagrees with my stomach and the rest of em has vibrations so here i set high an dry on the banks of life you might say like a stranded log as this wellknown simile fell upon the ear there was a general stir in the group for turrible wiley when rhetorical sometimes grew tearful and this was a mood not to be encouraged all right boss called ike billings winking to the boys well be there in a jiffy for the luncheon hour had flown and the work of the afternoon was waiting for them you make a chalkmark where you left off mr wiley an well hear the rest tomorrer only dont you forgit nothin remembert was the kennebec you was talkin about i will indeed responded the old man as i was sayin when interrupted i may be a stranded log but im proud that the mark o the gardner lumber compny is on me sot when i git to my journeys end theyll know where i belong and send me back to the kennebec before im sawed up id like to forgit this triflin brook in the sight of a goodsized river an rest my eyes on some fullgrown logsstead o these little damn pipestems you boys are playin with the game of jackstraws there was a roar of laughter at the old mans boast but in a moment all was activity the men ran hither and thither like ants gathering their tools there were some oldfashioned pickpoles straight heavy levers without any dog and there were modern pickpoles and peaveys for every river has its favorite equipment in these things there was no dynamite in those days to make the stubborn jams yield and the dogwarp was in general use horses or oxen sometimes a line of men stood on the riverbank a long rope was attached by means of a steel spike to one log after another and it was dragged from the tangled mass sometimes after unloading the top logs those at the bottom would rise and make the task easier sometimes the work would go on for hours with no perceptible progress and mr wiley would have opportunity to tell the bystanders of a turrible jam on the kennebec that had cost the lumber company ten thousand dollars to break there would be great arguments on shore among the villagers as well as among the experts as to the particular log which might be a key to the position the boss would study the problem from various standpoints and the drivers themselves would pass from heated discussion into long consultations theyre paid by the day old kennebec would philosophize to the doctor an when theyre consultin they dont hev to be doggin which is a turrible sight harder work rose had created a small sensation on one occasion by pointing out to the under boss the keylog in a jam she was past mistress of the pretty game of jackstraws much in vogue at that time the delicate little lengths of polished wood or bone were shaken together and emptied on the table each jackstraw had one of its ends fashioned in the shape of some sort of implement a rake hoe spade fork or mallet all the pieces were intertwined by the shaking process and they lay as they fell in a hopeless tangle the task consisted in taking a tiny pickpole scarcely bigger than a match and with the bit of curved wire on the end lifting off the jackstraws one by one without stirring the pile or making it tremble when this occurred you gave place to your opponent who relinquished his turn to you when ill fortune descended upon him the game which was a kind of riverdriving and jampicking in miniature being decided by the number of pieces captured and their value no wonder that the under boss asked roses advice as to the keylog she had a fairys hand and her cunning at deciding the pieces to be moved and her skill at extricating and lifting them from the heap were looked upon in edgewood as little less than supernatural it was a favorite pastime and although a mans hand is ill adapted to it being overlarge and heavy the game has obvious advantages for a lover in bringing his head very close to that of his beloved adversary the jackstraws have to be watched with a hawks eagerness since the trembling can be discerned only by a keen eye but there were moments when stephen was willing to risk the loss of a battle if he could watch roses drooping eyelashes the delicate down on her pink cheek and the feathery curls that broke away from her hair he was looking at her now from a distance for she and mite shapley were assisting jed towle to pile up the tin plates and tie the tin dippers together next she peered into one of the beanpots and seemed pleased that there was still something in its depths then she gathered the fragments neatly together in a basket and followed by her friend clambered down the banks to a shady spot where the boomshers otherwise known as the crambry family were lined up expectantly it is not difficult to find a single fool in any community however small but a family of fools is fortunately somewhat rarer every county however can boast of one foolfamily and itork county is always in the fashion with fools as with everything else the unique muchquoted and undesirable boomshers could not be claimed as indigenous to the saco valley for this branch was an offshoot of a still larger tribe inhabiting a distant township its beginnings were shrouded in mystery there was a frenchcanadian ancestor somewhere and a gipsy or indian grandmother they had always intermarried from time immemorial when one of the selectmen of their native place had been asked why the boomshers always married cousins and why the habit was not discouraged he replied that he really didnt know he sposed they felt it would be kind of odd to go right out and marry a stranger lest boomsher seem an unusual surname it must be explained that the actual name was french and could not be coped with by edgewood or pleasant river being something quite as impossible to spell as to pronounce as the family had lived for the last few years somewhere near the killick cranberry meadows they were called and completely described in the calling the crambry foolfamily a talented and much traveled gentleman who once stayed over night at the edgewood tavern proclaimed it his opinion that boomsher had been gradually corrupted from beaumarchais when he wrote the word on his visiting card and showed it to mr wiley old kennebec had replied that in the judgment of a man who had lived in large places and seen a turrible lot o life such a name could never have been given either to a christian or a heathen family that the way in which the letters was thrown together into it and the way in which they was sounded when read out loud was entirely agin reason it was true he said that beaumarchais bein such a fool name might a ben invented apurpose for a fool family but he wouldnt hold even with callin em boomsher crambry was well enough forem an a sight easier to speak stephen knew a good deal about the crambrys for he passed their socalled habitation in going to one of his woodlots it was only a month before that he had found them all sitting outside their brokendown fence surrounded by decrepit chairs sofas tables bedsteads bits of carpet and stoves whats the matter he called out from his wagon there aint nothin the matter said alcestis crambry fathers dead an were dividin up the furnerchure alcestis was the pride of the crambrys and the list of his attainments used often to be on his proud fathers lips it was he who was the largest for his size in the family he who could tell his brothers paul and arcadus by their looks he who knew a sour apple from a sweet one the minute he bit it he who at the early age of ten was bright enough to point to the cupboard and say puddin dad alcestis had enjoyed in consequence of his unusual intellectual powers some educational privileges and the killick schoolmistress well remembered his first day at the village seat of learning reports of what took place in this classic temple from day to day may have been wafted to the dull ears of the boy who was not thought ready for school until he had attained the ripe age of twelve it may even have been that specific rumors of the signs symbols and hieroglyphics used in educational institutions had reached him in the obscurity of his cranberry meadows at all events when confronted by the alphabet chart whose huge black capitals were intended to capture the wandering eyes of the infant class alcestis exhibited unusual almost unnatural excitement that is a my boy said the teacher genially as she pointed to the first character on the chart good god is that a exclaimed alcestis sitting down heavily on the nearest bench and neither teacher nor scholars could discover whether he was agreeably surprised or disappointed in the letter whether he had expected if he ever encountered it to find it writhing in coils on the floor of a cage or whether it simply bore no resemblance to the ideal already established in his mind mrs wiley had once tried to make something of mercy the oldest daughter of the family but at the end of six weeks she announced that a girl who couldnt tell whether the clock was going forrards or backwards and who rubbed a pocket handkerchief as long as she did a sheet would be no help in her household the crambrys had daily walked the five or six miles from their home to the edgewood bridge during the progress of the drive not only for the social and intellectual advantages to be gained from the company present but for the more solid compensation of a good meal they all adored rose partly because she gave them food and partly because she was sparkling and pretty and wore pink dresses that caught their dull eyes the afternoon proved a lively one in the first place one of the younger men slipped into the water between two logs part of a lot chained together waiting to be let out of the boom the weight of the mass higher up and the force of the current wedged him in rather tightly and when he had been pried out he declared that he felt like an apple after it had been squeezed in the cidermill so he drove home and rufus waterman took his place two hours hard work followed this incident and at the end of that time the bung that reached from the shore to watermans ledge the rock where pretty quick met his fate was broken up and the logs that composed it were started down river there remained now only the great sidejam at gray rock this had been allowed to grow gathering logs as they drifted past thus making higher water and a stronger current on the other side of the rock and allowing an easier passage for the logs at that point all was excitement now for this particular piece of work accomplished the boom above the falls would be turned out and the river would once more be clear and clean at the edgewood bridge small boys perching on the rocks with their heels hanging hands and mouths full of red astrakhan apples cheered their favorites to the echo while the drivers shouted to one another and watched the signs and signals of the boss who could communicate with them only in that way so great was the roar of the water the jam refused to yield to ordinary measures it was a difficult problem for the rocky riverbed held many a snare and pitfall there was a certain ledge under the water so artfully placed that every log striking under its projecting edges would wedge itself firmly there attracting others by its evil example that galootboss ought to hev shoved his crew down to that jam this mornin grumbled old kennebec to alcestis crambry who was always his most loyal and attentive listener but he wouldnt take no advice not if pharaoh nor boat nor herod nor nicodemus come right out o the bible an give it to him the logs air contrary today sometimes theyll go along as easy as an old shoe an other times theyll do nothin but bung bung bung theres a log nestlin down in the middle o that jam that ive ben watchin for a week its a curous one to begin with an then it has a mark on it that you can reconize it by did ye ever hear tell o george the third king of england alcestis or aint he known over to the crambry medders well once upon a time men used to go through the forests over here an slash a mark on the trunks o the biggest trees that was the royal sign as you might say an meant that the tree was to be taken over to england to make masts an yardarms for the kings ships what made me think of it now is that the kings mark was an arrer an its an arrer thats on that there log im showin ye well sir i seen it fust at millikens mills a monday it was in trouble then anits ben in trouble ever sence thats allers the way therell be one pesky crooked contrary consarned log that cant go anywheres without gittin into difficulties you can yank it out an set it afloat an before you hardly git your doggin iron off of it itll be snarled up agin in some new place from the time its chopped down to the day it gets to saco it costs the compny bout ten times its pesky valler as lumber now theyve sent over to bensons for a team of horses an i bate ye they cant gitem i wish i was the boss on this river alcestis i wish i was echoed the boy well your headfillin aint the right kind for a boss alcestis an youd better stick to dry land you set right down here while i go back a piece an git the pipe out o my coat pocket i guess nothin aint goin to happen for a few minutes the surmise about the horses unlike most of old kennebecs proved to be true bensons pair had gone to portland with a load of hay accordingly the tackle was brought the rope was adjusted to a log and five of the drivers standing on the riverbank attempted to drag it from its intrenched position it refused to yield the fraction of an inch rufus and stephen joined the five men and the augmented crew of seven were putting all their strength on the rope when a cry went up from the watchers on the bridge the dog had loosened suddenly and the men were flung violently to the ground for a second they were stunned both by the surprise and by the shock of the blow but in the same moment the cry of the crowd swelled louder alcestis crambry had stolen all unoticed to the rope and had attempted to use his feeble powers for the common good when then blow came he fell backward and making no effort to control the situation slid over the bank and into the water the other crambrys not realizing the danger laughed audibly but there was no jeering from the bridge stephan had seen alcestis slip and in the fraction of a moment had taken off his boots and was coasting down the slippery rocks behind him in a twinkling he was in the water almost as soon as the boy himself doggoned idjut exclaimed old kennebec tearfully wuth the hull fool family if i hednt a ben so old id a jumped in myself for you cant drownd a wiley not without you tie nailkegs to their head an feet an drop em in the falls alcestis who had neither brains courage nor experience had better still the luck that follows the witless he was carried swiftly down the current but only fifty feet away a long slender log wedged between two low rocks on the shore jutted out over the water almost touching its surface the boys clothes were admirably adapted to the situation being full of enormous rents in some way the end of the log caught in the rags of alcestiss coat and held him just seconds enough to enable stephen to swim to him to seize him by the nape of the neck to lift him on the log and thence to the shore it was a particularly bad place for a landing and there was nothing to do but to lower ropes and drag the drenched men to the high ground above alcestis came to his senses in ten or fifteen minutes and seemed as bright as usual with a kind of added swagger at being the central figure in a dramatic situation i wonder you hednt stove your brains out when you landed so turrible suddent on that rock at the foot of the bank said mr wiley to him i should but i took good care to light on my head responded alcestis a cryptic remark which so puzzled old kennebec that he mused over it for some hours hearts and other hearts stephen had brought a change of clothes as he had a habit of being ducked once at least during the day and since there was a halt in the proceedings and no need of his services for an hour or two he found rose and walked with her to a secluded spot where they could watch the logs and not be seen by the people you frightened everybody almost to death jumping into the river chided rose stephen laughed they thought i was a fool to save a fool i suppose perhaps not as bad as that but it did seem reckless i know and the boy no doubt would be better off dead but so should i be if i could have let him die rose regarded this strange point of view for a moment and then silently acquiesced in it she was constantly doing this and she often felt that her mental horizon broadened in the act but she could not be sure that stephen grew any dearer to her because of his moral altitudes besides stephen argued i happened to be nearest to the river and it was my job how do you always happen to be nearest to the people in trouble and why is it always your job if there are any rewards for good conduct being distributed im right in line with my hand stretched out stephen replied with meaning in his voice rose blushed under her flowery hat as he led the way to a bench under a sycamore tree that overhung the water she had almost convinced herself that she was as much in love with stephen waterman as it was in her nature to be with anybody he was handsome in his big way kind generous temperate well educated and welltodo no fault could be found with his family for his mother had been a teacher and his father though a farmer a college graduate stephen himself had had one year at bowdoin but had been recalled as the head of the house when his father died that was a severe blow but his mothers death three years after was a grief never to be quite forgotten rose too was the child of a gently bred mother and all her instincts were refined yes stephen in himself satisfied her in all the larger wants of her nature but she had an unsatisfied hunger for the world the world of portland where her cousins lived or better still the world of boston of which she heard through mrs wealthy brooks whose nephew claude often came to visit her in edgewood life on a farm a mile and a half distant from postoffice and stores life in the house with rufus who was rumored to be somewhat wild and unsteady this prospect seemed a trifle dull and uneventful to the trivial part of her though to the better part it was enough the better part of her loved stephen waterman dimly feeling the richness of his nature the tenderness of his affection the strength of his character rose was not destitute either of imagination or sentiment she did not relish this constant weighing of stephen in the balance he was too good to be weighed and considered she longed to be carried out of herself on a wave of rapturous assent but something seemed to hold her back some seed of discontent with the mans environment and circumstances some germ of longing for a gayer brighter more varied life no amount of selfsearching or argument could change the situation she always loved stephen more or less more when he was away from her because she never approved his collars nor the set of his shirt bosom and as he naturally wore these despised articles of apparel whenever he proposed to her she was always lukewarm about marrying him and settling down on the river farm still today she discovered in herself with positive gratitude a warmer feeling for him than she had experienced before he wore a new and becoming gray flannel shirt with the soft turnover collar that belonged to it and a blue tie the color of his kind eyes she knew that he had shaved his beard at her request not long ago and that when she did not like the effect as much as she had hoped he had meekly grown a mustache for her sake it did seem as if a man could hardly do more to please an exacting ladylove and she had admired him unreservedly when he pulled off his boots and jumped into the river to save alcestis crambrys life without giving a single thought to his own and was there ever after all such a noble devoted unselfish fellow or a better brother and would she not despise herself for rejecting him simply because he was countrified and because she longed to see the world of the fashionplates in the magazines the logs are so like people she exclaimed as they sat down i could name nearly every one of them for somebody in the village look at mite shapley that dancing little one slipping over the falls and skimming along the top of the water keeping out of all the deep places and never once touching the rocks stephen fell into her mood theres squire anderson coming down crosswise and bumping everything in reach you know hes always buying lumber and logs without knowing what he is going to do with them they just lie and rot by the roadside the boys always say that a toadstool is the old squires mark on a log and that stout clumsy one is short dennett what are you doing stephen only building a fence round this clump of harebells stephen replied theyve just got well rooted and if the boys come skidding down the bank with their spiked shoes the poor things will never hold up their heads again now theyre safe oh look rose there come the minister and his wife a portly couple of peeled logs exactly matched in size came ponderously over the falls together rose within a second of each other joined again and swept under the bridge side by side and oh oh dr and mrs cram just after them isnt that funny laughed rose as a very long slender pair of pines swam down as close to each other as if they had been glued in that position rose thought as she watched them who but stephen would have cared what became of the clump of delicate harebells how gentle such a man would be to a woman how tender his touch would be if she were ill or in trouble several single logs followed crooked ones stolid ones adventurous ones feeble swimmers deep divers some of them tried to start a small jam on their own account others stranded themselves for good and all as rose and stephen sat there side by side with little dan cupid for an invisible third on the bench there never was anything so like people rose repeated leaning forward excitedly and upon my word the minister and doctor couples are still together i wonder if theyll get as far as the falls at union that would be an odd place to part wouldnt it union stephen saw his opportunity and seized it theres a reason rose why two logs go down stream better than one and get into less trouble they make a wider path create more force and a better current its the same way with men and women oh rose there isnt a man in the world thats loved you as long or knows how to love you any better than i do youre just like a white birch sapling and im a great clumsy fir tree but if youll only trust yourself to me rose ill take you safely down river stephens big hand closed on roses little one she returned its pressure softly and gave him the kiss that with her as with him meant a promise for all the years to come the truth and passion in the man had broken the girls bonds for the moment her vision was clearer and realizing the treasures of love and fidelity that were being offered her she accepted them half unconscious that she was not returning them in kind how is the belle of two villages to learn that she should thank heaven fasting for a good mans love and stephen he went home in the dusk not knowing whether his feet were touching the solid earth or whether he was treading upon rainbows roses pink calico seemed to brush him as he walked in the path that was wide enough only for one his solitude was peopled again when he fed the cattle for roses face smiled at him from the haymow and when he strained the milk rose held the pans his nightly tasks over he went out and took his favorite seat under the apple tree all was still save for the crickets ceaseless chirp the soft thud of an august sweeting dropping in the grass and the swishswash of the water against his boat tethered in the willow cove he remembered when he first saw rose for that must have been when he began to love her though he was only fourteen and quite unconscious that the first seed had been dropped in the rich soil of his boyish heart he was seated on the kerosene barrel in the edgewood postoffice which was also the general country store where newspapers letters molasses nails salt codfish hairpins sugar liver pills canned goods beans and ginghams dwelt in genial proximity when she entered just a little pinkandwhite slip of a thing with a tin pail in her hand and a sunbonnet falling off her wavy hair stephen suddenly stopped swinging his feet she gravely announced her wants reading them from a bit of paper quart molasses package ginger lb cheese pairs shoe laces card shirt buttons while the storekeeper drew off the molasses she exchanged shy looks with stephen who clean welldressed and carefully mothered as he was felt all at once uncouth and awkward rather as if he were some clumsy lout pitchforked into the presence of a fairy queen he offered her the little bunch of bachelors buttons he held in his hand augury of the future had he known it and she accepted them with a smile she dropped her memorandum he picked it up and she smiled again doing still more fatal damage than in the first instance no words were spoken but rose even at ten had less need of them than most of her sex for her dimples aided by dancing eyes length of lashes and curve of lips quite took the place of conversation the dimples tempted assented denied corroborated deplored protested sympathized while the intoxicated beholder cudgeled his brain for words or deeds which should provoke and evoke more and more dimples the storekeeper hung the molasses pail over roses right arm and tucked the packages under her left and as he opened the mosquito netting door to let her pass out she looked back at stephen perched on the kerosene barrel just a little girl a little glance a little dimple and stephen was never quite the same again the years went on and the boy became man yet no other image had ever troubled the deep placid waters of his heart now after many denials the hopes and longings of his nature had been answered and rose had promised to marry him he would sacrifice his passion for logging and driving in the future and become a staid farmer and man of affairs only giving himself a river holiday now and then how still and peaceful it was under the trees and how glad his mother would be to think that the old farm would wake from its sleep and a womans light foot be heard in the sunny kitchen heaven was full of silent stars and there was a moonglade on the water that stretched almost from him to rose his heart embarked on that golden pathway and sailed on it to the farther shore the river was free of logs and under the light of the moon it shone like a silver mirror the soft wind among the fir branches breathed roses name the river rippling against the shore sang rose and as stephen sat there dreaming of the future his dreams too could have been voiced in one word and that word rose the little house the autumn days flew past like shuttles in a loom the river reflected the yellow foliage of the white birch and the scarlet of the maples the wayside was bright with goldenrod with the red tassels of the sumac with the purple frostflower and feathery clematis if rose was not as happy as stephen she was quietly content and felt that she had more to be grateful for than most girls for stephen surprised her with first one evidence and then another of thoughtful generosity in his heart of hearts he felt that rose was not wholly his that she reserved withheld something and it was the subjugation of this rebellious province that he sought he and rose had agreed to wait a year for their marriage in which time roses cousin would finish school and be ready to live with the old people meanwhile stephen had learned that his maiden aunt would be glad to come and keep house for rufus the work at the river farm was too hard for a girl so he had persuaded himself of late and the house was so far from the village that rose was sure to be lonely he owned a couple of acres between his place and the edgewood bridge and here one afternoon only a month after their engagement he took rose to see the foundations of a little house he was building for her it was to be only a storyandahalf cottage of six small rooms the two upper chambers to be finished off later on stephen had placed it well back from the road leaving space in front for what was to be a most wonderful arrangement of flowerbeds yet keeping a strip at the back on the riverbrink for a small vegetable garden there had been a house there years before so many years that the blackened ruins were entirely overgrown but a few elms and an old appleorchard remained to shade the new dwelling and give welcome to the coming inmates stephen had fifteen hundred dollars in bank he could turn his hand to almost anything and his love was so deep that roses plumbline had never sounded bottom accordingly he was able with the help of two steady workers to have the roof on before the first of november the weather was clear and fine and by thanksgiving clapboards shingles two coats of brown paint and even the blinds had all been added this exhibition of reckless energy on stephens part did not wholly commend itself to the neighborhood steves too turrible spry said roses grandfather hell trip himself up some o these times you never will remarked his better half sagely the resks in life come along fast enough without runnin to meet em continued the old man theres good dough in rose but it aint moren half riz let somebody come along an drop in a little more yeast or set the dish a little mite nearer the stove an youll see whatll happen steves kept house for himself some time an i guess he knows more about breadmakin than you do there dont nobody know moren i do about nothin when my pipes drawin real good an nobodys thornin me to go to work replied mr wiley but nobodys willin to take the advice of a man thats seen the world an lived in large places an the risin generation is in a turrible hurry i don know how t is young folks air allers settin the clock forrard an the old ones puttin it back did you ketch anything for dinner when you was out this mornin asked his wife no i fished an fished till i was about ready to drop an i did git a few shiners but land they want as big as the worms i was ketchin em with so i pitched em back in the water an quit during the progress of these remarks mr wiley opened the door under the sink and from beneath a huge iron pot drew a round tray loaded with a glass pitcher and half a dozen tumblers which he placed carefully on the kitchen table this is the last days option ive got on this lemonadeset he said an if im gointo biddeford tomorrer ive got to make up my mind here an now with this observation he took off his shoes climbed in his stocking feet to the vantage ground of a kitchen chair and lifted a stone china pitcher from a corner of the highest cupboard shelf where it had been hidden this lemonades gittin kind o dusty he complained i callated to hev a kind of a spree on it when i got through choosin roses weddin present but i guess the pigll hev to help me out the old man filled one of the glasses from the pitcher pulled up the kitchen shades to the top put both hands in his pockets and walked solemnly round the table gazing at his offering from every possible point of view there had been three lemonade sets in the window of a biddeford crockery store when mr wiley chanced to pass by and he had brought home the blue and green one on approval to the casual eye it would have appeared as quite uniquely hideous until the red and yellow or the purple and orange ones had been seen after that no human being could have made a decision where each was so unparalleled in its ugliness and old kennebecs confusion of mind would have been perfectly understood by the connoisseur how do you like it with the lemonade in mother he inquired eagerly the thing that plagues me most is that the red an yaller one i hed home last week lights up bettern this an i believe ill settle on that for as i was thinkin last night in bed lemonade is mostly an evenin drink an rose wont be usin the set much by daylight root beer looks the hansomest in this purple set but rose loves lemonade bettern beer so i guess ill pack up this one an change it tomorrer mebbe when i get it out o sight an give the lemonade to the pig ill be easier in my mind in the opinion of the community at large stephens forehandedness in the matter of preparations for his marriage was imprudence and his desire for neatness and beauty flagrant extravagance the house itself was a foolish idea it was thought but there were extenuating circumstances for the maiden aunt really needed a home and rufus was likely to marry before long and take his wife to the river farm it was to be hoped in his case that he would avoid the snares of beauty and choose a good stout girl who would bring the dairy back to what it was in mrs watermans time all winter long stephen labored on the inside of the cottage mostly by himself he learned all trades in succession love being his only master he had many odd days to spare from his farm work and if he had not found days he would have taken nights scarcely a nail was driven without roses advice and when the plastering was hard and dry the wallpapers were the result of weeks of consultation among the quiet joys of life there is probably no other so deep so sweet so full of trembling hope and delight as the building and making of a home a home where two lives are to be merged in one and flow on together a home full of mysterious and delicious possibilities hidden in a future which is always rosecolored roses sweet little nature broadened under stephens influence but she had her moments of discontent and unrest always followed quickly by remorse at the thanksgiving sociable some one had observed her turquoise engagement ring some one who said that such a hand was worthy of a diamond that turquoises were a pretty color but that there was only one stone for an engagement ring and that was a diamond at the christmas dance the same some one had said her waltzing would make her all the rage in boston she wondered if it were true and wondered whether if she had not promised to marry stephen some splendid being from a city would have descended from his heights bearing diamonds in his hand not that she would have accepted them she only wondered these disloyal thoughts came seldom and she put them resolutely away devoting herself with all the greater assiduity to her muslin curtains and ruffled pillowshams stephen too had his momentary pangs there were times when he could calm his doubts only by working on the little house the mere sight of the beloved floors and walls and ceilings comforted his heart and brought him good cheer the winter was a cold one so bitterly cold that even the rapid water at the gray rock was a mass of curdled yellow ice something that had only occurred once or twice before within the memory of the oldest inhabitant it was also a very gay season for pleasant river and edgewood never had there been so many cardparties sleigh rides and tavern dances and never such wonderful skating the river was one gleaming glittering thoroughfare of ice from millikens mills to the dam at the edgewood bridge at sundown bonfires were built here and there on the mirror like surface and all the young people from the neighboring villages gathered on the ice while detachments of merry rosycheeked boys and girls those who preferred coasting met at the top of brigadier hill from which one could get a longer and more perilous slide than from any other point in the township claude merrill in his occasional visits from boston was very much in evidence at the saturday evening ice parties he was not an artist at the sport himself but he was especially proficient in the art of strapping on a ladys skates and murmuring as he adjusted the last buckle the prettiest foot and ankle on the river it cannot be denied that this compliment gave secret pleasure to the fair village maidens who received it but it was a pleasure accompanied by electric shocks of excitement a girls foot might perhaps be mentioned if a fellow were daring enough but the line was rigidly drawn at the ankle which was not a part of the human frame ever alluded to in the polite society of edgewood at that time rose in her red linseywoolsey dress and her squirrel furs and cap was the life of every gathering and when stephen took her hand and they glided up stream alone together in the crowd he used to wish that they might skate on and on up the crystal icepath of the river to the moon itself whither it seemed to lead them the garden of eden but the saco all this time was meditating of its surprises the snapping cold weather and the depth to which the water was frozen were aiding it in its preparation for the greatest event of the season on a certain gray saturday in march after a week of mild temperature it began to rain as if after months of snowing it really enjoyed a new form of entertainment sunday dawned with the very floodgates of heaven opening so it seemed all day long the river was rising under its miles of unbroken ice rising at the threatening rate of four inches an hour edgewood went to bed as usual that night for the bridge at that point was set too high to be carried away by freshets but at other villages whose bridges were in less secure position there was little sleep and much anxiety at midnight a cry was heard from the men watching at millikens mills the great ice jam had parted from rolfes island and was swinging out into the open pushing everything before it all the ablebodied men in the village turned out of bed and with lanterns in hand began to clear the stores and mills for it seemed that everything near the river banks must go before that avalanche of ice stephen and rufus were there helping to save the property of their friends and neighbors rose and mite shapley had stayed the night with a friend and all three girls were shivering with fear and excitement as they stood near the bridge watching the nevertobeforgtten sight it is needless to say that the crambry family was on hand for whatever instincts they may have lacked the instinct for being on the spot when anything was happening was present in them to the most remarkable extent the town was supporting them in modest winter quarters somewhat nearer than killick to the centre of civilization and the first alarm brought them promptly to the scene mrs crambry remarking at intervals if id known thered be so many out id ought to have worn my bunnit but i aint got no bunnit an if i had they say i aint got no head to wear it on by the time the jam neared the falls it had grown with its accumulations until it was made up of tier after tier of huge ice cakes piled side by side and one upon another with heaps of trees and branches and drifting lumber holding them in place some of the blocks stood erect and towered like icebergs and these glittering in the lights of the twinkling lanterns pushed solemnly forward cracking crushing and cutting everything in their way when the great mass neared the planing mill on the east shore the girls covered their eyes expecting to hear the crash of the falling building but impelled by the force of some mysterious current it shook itself ponderously and then with one magnificent movement slid up the river bank tier following tier in grand confusion this left a water way for the main drift the ice broke in every direction and down down down from bonnie eagle and moderation swept the harvest of the winter freezing it came thundering over the dam bringing boats farming implements posts supports and every sort of floating lumber with it and cutting under the flour mill tipped it cleverly over on its side and went crashing on its way down river at edgewood it pushed colossal blocks of ice up the banks into the roadway piling them end upon end ten feet in air then tearing and rumbling and booming through the narrows it covered the intervale at pleasant point and made a huge ice bridge below union falls a bridge so solid that it stood there for days a sight for all the neighboring villages this exciting event would have forever set apart this winter from all others in stephens memory even had it not been also the winter when he was building a house for his future wife but afterwards in looking back on the wild night of the ice freshet stephen remembered that roses manner was strained and cold and evasive and that when he had seen her talking with claude merrill it had seemed to him that that whippersnapper had looked at her as no honorable man in edgewood ever looked at an engaged girl he recalled his throb of gratitude that claude lived at a safe distance and his subsequent pang of remorse at doubting for an instant roses fidelity so at length april came the saco was still high turbid and angry and the boys were waiting at limington falls for the ossipee drive to begin stephen joined them there for he was restless and the river called him as it did every spring each stubborn log that he encountered gave him new courage and power of overcoming the rush of the water the noise and roar and dash the exposure and danger all made the blood run in his veins like new wine when he came back to the farm all the cobwebs had been blown from his brain and his first interview with rose was so intoxicating that he went immediately to portland and bought in a kind of secret penitence for his former fears a pale pinkflowered wallpaper for the bedroom in the new home it had once been voted down by the entire advisory committee mrs wiley said pink was foolish and was always sure to fade and the border being a mass of solid roses was five cents a yard virtually a prohibitive price mr wiley said he should hate to hev a spell of sickness an lay abed in a room where there was things growin all over the place he thought roughplastered walls where you could lay an count the spots where the roof leaked was the most entertainin in sickness rose had longed for the lovely pattern but had sided dutifully with the prudent majority so that it was with a feeling of unauthorized and illegitimate joy that stephen papered the room at night a few strips at a time on the third evening when he had removed all signs of his work he lighted two kerosene lamps and two candles finding the effect under this illumination almost too brilliant and beautiful for belief rose should never see it now he determined until the furniture was in place they had already chosen the kitchen and bedroom things though they would not be needed for some months but the rest was to wait until summer when there would be the haymoney to spend stephen did not go back to the river farm till one oclock that night the pink bedroom held him in fetters too powerful to break it looked like the garden of eden he thought to be sure it was only fifteen feet square eden might have been a little larger possibly but otherwise the pink bedroom had every advantage the pattern of roses growing on a frellis was brighter than any flowerbed in june and the border well if the border had been five dollars a foot stephen would not have grudged the money when he saw the twenty running yards of rosy bloom rioting under the white ceiling before he blew out the last light he raised it high above his head and took one fond final look its the only place i ever saw he thought that is pretty enough for her she will look just as if she was growing here with all the other flowers and i shall always think of it as the garden of eden i wonder if i got the license and the ring and took her by surprise whether shed be married in june instead of august i could be all ready if i could only persuade her at this moment stephen touched the summit of happiness and it is a curious coincidence that as he was dreaming in his garden of eden the serpent having just arrived at edgewood was sleeping peacefully at the house of mrs brooks it was the serpents fourth visit that season and he explained to inquiring friends that his former employer had sold the business and that the new management while reorganizing had determined to enlarge the premises the three clerks who had been retained having two weeks vacation with half pay it is extraordinary how frequently wise serpents are retained by the management on half or even full salary while the services of the harmless doves are dispensed with and they are set free to flutter where they will the serpent rose wiley had the brightest eyes in edgewood it was impossible to look at her without realizing that her physical sight was perfect what mysterious species of blindness is it that descends now and then upon human creatures and renders them incapable of judgment or discrimination claude merrill was a glove salesman in a boston fancygoods store the calling itself is undoubtedly respectable and it is quite conceivable that a man can sell gloves and still be a man but claude merrill was a manikin he inhabited a very narrow space behind a very short counter but to him it seemed the earth and the fullness thereof when irreproachably neat and even exquisite in dress he gave a napoleonic glance at his array of gloveboxes to see if the female assistant had put them in proper order for the day when with that wonderful eye for detail that had wafted him to his present height of power he pounced upon the powdersprinklers and found them as he expected empty when with masterly judgment he had made up and ticketed a basket of misfits and odd sizes to attract the eyes of women who were their human counterparts he felt himself bursting with the pride and pomp of circumstance his cambric handkerchief adjusted in his coat with the monogram corner well displayed a last touch to the carefully trained lock on his forehead and he was ready for his customers six did you say miss i should have thought five and three quarters attend to that gentleman miss dir please i am very busy sixandahalf gray suede here they are an exquisite shade shall i try them on the right hand if you will perhaps youd better remove your elegant ring i shouldnt like to have anything catch in the setting miss dir sixandahalf black glace upper shelf third box for this lady shes in a hurry we shall see you often after this i hope madam no we dont keep silk or lisle gloves we have no call for them our customers prefer kid oh but he was in his element was claude merrill though the glamour that surrounded him in the minds of the edgewood girls did not emanate wholly from his finicky little person something of it was the glamour that belonged to boston remote fashionable gay rich almost inaccessible boston which none could see without the expenditure of five or six dollars in railway fare with the added extravagance of a night in a hotel if one would explore it thoroughly and come home possessed of all its illimitable treasures of wisdom and experience when claude came to edgewood for a sunday or to spend a vacation with his aunt he brought with him something of the magic of a metropolis suddenly to roses eye stephen looked larger and clumsier his shoes were not the proper sort his clothes were ordinary his neckties were years behind the fashion stephens dancing compared with claudes was as the deliberate motion of an ox to the hopping of a neat little robin when claude took a girls hand in the grand rightandleft it was as if he were about to try on a delicate glove the manner in which he held his lady in the polka or schottische made her seem a queen mite shapley was so affected by it that when rufus attempted to encircle her for the mazurka she exclaimed dont act as if you were spearing logs rufus of the two men stephen had more to say but claude said more he was thought brilliant in conversation but what wonder when one considered his advantages and his dazzling experiences he had customers who were worth their thousands ladies whose fingers never touched dishwater ladies who wouldnt buy a glove of anybody else if they went barehanded to the grave he lived with his sister maude arthurlena in a house where there were twentytwo other boarders who could be seated at meals all at the same time so immense was the diningroom he ate his dinner at a restaurant daily and expended twentyfive cents for it without blenching he went to the theatre once a week and was often accompanied by lady friends who were elegant dressers in a moment of wrath stephen had called him a counterjumper but it was a libel so short and rough a means of exit from his place of power was wholly beneath claudes dignity it was with a pardon me miss dir that the noon hour having arrived he squeezed by that slave and victim and raising the hinged board that separated his kingdom from that of the ribbon department passed out of the store hat in hand serene in the consciousness that though other clerks might nibble luncheon from a brown paper bag he would speedily be indulging in an expensive repast and miss dir knew it and it was a part of his almost invincible attraction for her it seemed flying in the face of providence to decline the attentions of such a gorgeous butterfly of fashion simply because one was engaged to marry another man at some distant day all edgewood femininity united in saying that there never was such a perfect gentleman as claude merrill and during the time when his popularity was at its height rose lost sight of the fact that stephen could have furnished the stuff for a dozen claudes and have had enough left for an ordinary man besides april gave place to may and a veil hung between the lovers an intangible gossamerlike thing not to be seen with the naked eye but oh so plainly to be felt rose hid herself thankfully behind it while stephen had not courage to lift a corner she had twice been seen driving with claude merrill that stephen knew but she had explained that there were errands to be done that her grandfather had taken the horse and that mr merrills escort had been both opportune and convenient for these practical reasons claude was everywhere present the centre of attraction the observed of all observers he was irresistible contagious almost epidemic rose was now gay now silent now affectionate now distant now coquettish in fine everything that was capricious mysterious agitating incomprehensible one morning alcestis crambry went to the postoffice for stephen and brought him back the newspapers and letters he had hung about the river farm so much that stephen finally gave him bed and food in exchange for numberless small errands rufus was temporarily confined in a dark room with some strange pain and trouble in his eyes and alcestis proved of use in many ways he had always been roses slave and had often brought messages and notes from the brier neighborhood so that when stephen saw a folded note among the papers his heart gave a throb of anticipation the note was brief and when he had glanced through it he said this is not mine alcestis it belongs to miss rose go straight back and give it to her as you were told and another time keep your wits about you or ill send you back to killick alcestis crambrys ideas on all subjects were extremely vague claude merrill had given him a letter for rose but his notion was that anything that belonged to her belonged to stephen and the waterman place was much nearer than the wileys particularly at dinnertime when the boy had slouched away stephen sat under the apple tree now a mass of roseate bloom and buried his face in his hands it was not precisely a loveletter that he had read nevertheless it blackened the light of the sun for him claude asked rose to meet him anywhere on the road to the station and to take a little walk as he was leaving that afternoon and could not bear to say goodby to her in the presence of her grandmother under the circumstances he wrote deeply underlining the words i cannot remain a moment longer in edgewood where i have been so happy and so miserable he did not refer to the fact that the time limit on his returnticket expired that day for his dramatic instinct told him that such sordid matters have no place in heroics stephen sat motionless under the tree for an hour deciding on some plan of action he had work at the little house but he did not dare go there lest he should see the face of dead love looking from the windows of the pink bedroom dead love cold sad merciless his cheeks burned as he thought of the marriage license and the gold ring hidden away upstairs in the drawer of his shaving stand what a romantic fool he had been to think he could hasten the glad day by a single moment what a piece of boyish folly it had been and how it shamed him in his own eyes when train time drew near he took his boat and paddled down stream if for the finland lovers reindeer there was but one path in all the world and that the one that led to her so it was for stephens canoe which had it been set free on the river by day or by night might have floated straight to rose he landed at the usual place a bit of sandy shore near the wiley house and walked drearily up the bank through the woods under the shade of the pines the white stars of the hepatica glistened and the pale anemones were coming into bloom partridgeberries glowed red under their glossy leaves and clumps of violets sweetened the air squirrels chattered woodpeckers tapped thrushes sang but stephen was blind and deaf to all the sweet harbingers of spring just then he heard voices realizing with a throb of delight that at any rate rose had not left home to meet claude as he had asked her to do looking through the branches he saw the two standing together mrs brookss horse with the offensive trunk in the back of the wagon being hitched to a tree near by there was nothing in the tableau to stir stephen to fury but he read between the lines and suffered as he read suffered and determined to sacrifice himself if he must so that rose could have what she wanted this miserable apology for a man he had never been the husband for rose she must take her place in a larger community worthy of her beauty and charm claude was talking and gesticulating ardently roses head was bent and the tears were rolling down her cheeks suddenly claude raised his hat and with a passionate gesture of renunciation walked swiftly to the wagon and looking back once drove off with the utmost speed of which the brookss horse was capable rose waving him a farewell with one hand and wiping her eyes with the other the turquoise ring stephen stood absolutely still in front of the opening in the trees and as rose turned she met him face to face she had never dreamed his eyes could be so stern his mouth so hard and she gave a sob like a child you seem to be in trouble stephen said in a voice so cold she thought it could not be his i am not in trouble exactly rose stammered concealing her discomfiture as well as possible i am a little unhappy because i have made some one else unhappy and now that you know it you will be unhappy too and angry besides i suppose though youve seen everything there was to see there is no occasion for sorrow stephen said i didnt mean to break in on any interview i came over to give you back your freedom if you ever cared enough for me to marry me the time has gone by i am willing to own that i overpersuaded you but i am not the man to take a girl against her inclinations so we will say goodby and end the thing here and now i can only wish here his smothered rage at fate almost choked him that when you were selecting another husband you had chosen a whole man rose quivered with the scorn of his tone size isnt everything she blazed not in bodies perhaps but it counts for something in hearts and brains and it is convenient to have a sense of honor thats at least as big as a grain of mustardseed claude merrill is not dishonorable rose exclaimed impetuously or at least he isnt as bad as you think he has never asked me to marry him then he probably was not quite ready to speak or perhaps you were not quite ready to hear retorted stephen bitterly but dont let us have words therell be enough to regret without adding those i have seen ever since new years that you were not really happy or contented only i wouldnt allow it to myself i kept hoping against hope that i was mistaken there have been times when i would have married you willing or unwilling but i didnt love you so well then and now that theres another man in the case its different and im strong enough to do the right thing follow your heart and be happy in a year or two i shall be glad i had the grit to tell you so goodby rose rose pale with amazement summoned all her pride and drawing the turquoise engagement ring from her finger handed it silently to stephen hiding her face as he flung it vehemently down the riverbank his dull eyes followed it and half uncomprehendingly saw it settle and glisten in a nest of brown pineneedles then he put out his hand for a last clasp and strode away without a word presently rose heard first the scrape of his boat on the sand then the soft sound of his paddles against the water then nothing but the squirrels and the woodpeckers and the thrushes then not even these nothing but the beating of her own heart she sat down heavily feeling as if she were wide awake for the first time in many weeks how had things come to this pass with her claude merrill had flattered her vanity and given her some moments of restlessness and dissatisfaction with her lot but he had not until today really touched her heart or tempted her even momentarily from her allegiance to stephen his eyes had always looked unspeakable things his voice had seemed to breathe feelings that he had never dared put in words but today he had really stirred her for although he had still been vague it was easy to see that his love for her had passed all bounds of discretion she remembered his impassioned farewells his despair his doubt as to whether he could forget her by plunging into the vortex of business or whether he had better end it all in the river as so many other brokenhearted fellows had done she had been touched by his misery even against her better judgment and she had intended to confess it all to stephen sometime telling him that she should never again accept attentions from a stranger lest a tragedy like this should happen twice in a lifetime she had imagined that stephen would be his largeminded greathearted magnanimous self and beg her to forget this fascinating willothewisp by resting in his deeper serener love she had meant to be contrite and faithful praying nightly that poor claude might live down his present anguish of which she had been the innocent cause instead what had happened she had been put altogether in the wrong stephen had almost cast her off and that too without argument he had given her her liberty before she had asked for it taking it for granted without question that she desired to be rid of him instead of comforting her in her remorse or sympathizing with her for so nobly refusing to shine in claudes larger world of boston stephen had assumed that she was disloyal in every particular and pray how was she to cope with such a disagreeable and complicated situation it would not be long before the gossips rolled under their tongues the delicious morsel of a broken engagement and sooner or later she must brave the displeasure of her grandmother and the little house that was worse than anything her tears flowed faster as she thought of stephens joy in it of his faithful labor of the savings he had invested in it she hated and despised her self when she thought of the house and for the first time in her life she realized the limitations of her nature the poverty of her ideals what should she do she had lost stephen and ruined his life now in order that she need not blight a second career must she contrive to return claudes love to be sure she thought it seemed indecent to marry any other man than stephen when they had built a house together and chosen wallpapers and a kitchen stove and diningroom chairs but was it not the only way to evade the difficulties suppose that stephen in a fit of pique should ask somebody else to share the new cottage as this dreadful possibility came into view roses sobs actually frightened the birds and the squirrels she paced back and forth under the trees wondering how she could have been engaged to a man for eight months and know so little about him as she seemed to know about stephen waterman today who would have believed he could be so autocratic so severe so unapproachable who could have foreseen that she rose wiley would ever be given up to another man handed over as coolly as if she had been a bale of cotton she wanted to return claude merrills love because it was the only way out of the tangle but at the moment she almost hated him for making so much trouble for hurting stephen for abasing her in her own eyes and above all for giving her rustic lover the chance of impersonating an injured emperor it did not simplify the situation to have mite shapley come in during the evening and run upstairs uninvited to sit on the toot of her bed and chatter rose had closed her blinds and lay in the dark pleading a headache mite was in high feather she had met claude merrill going to the station that afternoon he was much too early for the train which the station agent reported to be behind time so he had asked her to take a drive she didnt know how it happened for he looked at his watch every now and then but anyway they got to laughing and carrying on and when they came back to the station the train had gone wasnt that the greatest joke of the season what did rose suppose they did next rose didnt know and didnt care her head ached too badly well they had driven to wareham and claude had hired a livery team there and had been taken into portland with his trunk and she had brought mrs brookss horse back to edgewood wasnt that ridiculous and hadnt she cut out rose where she least expected rose was distinctly apathetic and mite shapley departed after a very brief call leaving behind her an entirely new train of thought if claude merrill were so loveblighted that he could only by the greatest selfcontrol keep from flinging himself into the river how could he conceal his sufferings so completely from mite shapley little shallowpated scheming coquette so that pretty merrill feller has gone has he mother inquired old kennebec that night as he took off his wet shoes and warmed his feet at the kitchen oven well it aint a mite too soon i allers distrust that pinkanwhite rosyposy kind of a man one of the most turrible things that ever happened in gardner was brought about by jest sech a feller mothers hednt hardly ought to name their boy babies claude without they expect em to play the dickens with the girls i don know nothin bout the fust claude there aint none of em in the bible air they but whoever he was i bate ye he hed a deceivin tongue if it hednt ben for me that claude in gardner would a run away with my brothers fust wife an ill tell ye jest how i contrived to put a spoke in his wheel but mrs wiley being already somewhat familiar with the circumstances had taken her candle and retired to her virtuous couch rose sees the world was this the world after all rose asked herself and if so what was amiss with it and where was the charm the bewilderment the intoxication the glamour she had been glad to come to boston for the last two weeks in edgewood had proved intolerable she had always been a favorite heretofore from the days when the boys fought for the privilege of dragging her sled up the hills and filling her tiny mitten with peppermints down to the year when she came home from the wareham female seminary an acknowledged belle and beauty suddenly she had felt her popularity dwindling there was no real change in the demeanor of her acquaintances but there was a certain subtle difference of atmosphere everybody sympathized tacitly with stephen and she did not wonder for there were times when she secretly took his part against herself only a few candid friends had referred to the rupture openly in conversation but these had been bluntin their disapproval it seemed part of her ill fortune that just at this time rufus should be threatened with partial blindness and that stephens heart already sore should be torn with new anxieties she could hardly bear to see the doctors carriage drive by day after day and hear night after night that rufus was unresigned melancholy half mad while stephen as the doctor said was brother mother and father in one as gentle as a woman as firm as gibraltar these foes to her peace of mind all came from within but without was the hourly reproach of her grandmother whose scorching tongue touched every sensitive spot in the girls nature and burned it like fire finally a way of escape opened mrs wealthy brooks who had always been rheumatic grew suddenly worse she had heard of a magnetic physician in boston also of one who used electricity with wonderful effect and she announced her intention of taking both treatments impartially and alternately the neighbors were quite willing that wealthy ann brooks should spend the deceased ezras money in any way she pleased she had earned it goodness knows by living with him for twentyfive years but before the day for her departure arrived her right arm and knee became so much more painful that it was impossible for her to travel alone at this juncture rose was called upon to act as nurse and companion in a friendly way she seized the opportunity hungrily as a way out of her present trouble but knowing what mrs brookss temper was in time of health she could see clearly what it was likely to prove when pain and anguish wrung the brow rose had been in boston now for some weeks and she was sitting in the joy street boardinghouse joy street forsooth it was nearly bedtime and she was looking out upon a huddle of roofs and back yards upon a landscape filled with clotheslines ashbarrels and illfed cats there were no sleek country tabbies with the memory in their eyes of tasted cream nothing but cityborn citybred thin despairing cats of the pavement cats no more forlorn than rose herself she had seen boston for she had accompanied mrs brooks in the horsecars daily to the two different temples of healing where that lady worshipped and offered sacrifices she had also gone with maude arthurlena to claude merrills store to buy pair of gloves and had overheard miss dir the fashionable ladyassistant before mentioned say to miss brackett of the ribbon department that she thought mr merrill must have worn his blinders that time he stayed so long in edgewood this bit of polished irony was unintelligible to rose at first but she mastered it after an hours reflection she wasnt looking her best that day she knew the cotton dresses that seemed so pretty at home were common and countrified here and her best black cashmere looked cheap and shapeless beside miss dirs brilliantine miss dirs figure was her strong point and her dressmaker was particularly skillful in the arts of suggestion concealment and revelation beauty has its chosen backgrounds rose in white dimity standing knee deep in her blossoming brier bushes the river running at her feet dark pine trees behind her graceful head sounded depths and touched heights of harmony forever beyond the reach of the modish miss dir but she was out of her element and suffered accordingly rose had gone to walk with claude one evening when she first arrived he had shown her the state house and the park street church and sat with her on one of the benches in the common until nearly ten she knew that mrs brooks had told her nephew of the broken engagement but he made no reference to the matter save to congratulate her that she was rid of a man who was so clumsy so dull and behind the times as stephen waterman saying that he had always marveled she could engage herself to anybody who could insult her by offering her a turquoise ring claude was very interesting that evening rose thought but rather gloomy and unlike his former self he referred to his grave responsibilities to the frail health of maude arthurlena and to the vicissitudes of business he vaguely intimated that his daily life in the store was not so pleasant as it had been formerly that there were those he would speak no more plainly who embarrassed him with undesired attentions those who without the smallest shadow of right vexed him with petty jealousies rose dared not ask questions on so delicate a topic but she remembered in a flash miss dirs heavy eyebrows snapping eyes and high color claude seemed very happy that rose had come to boston though he was surprised knowing what a trial his aunt must be now that she was so helpless it was unfortunate also that rose could not go on excursions without leaving his aunt alone or he should have been glad to offer his escort he pressed her hand when he left her at her door telling her she could never realize what a comfort her friendship was to him could never imagine how thankful he was that she had courageously freed herself from ties that in time would have made her wretched his heart was full he said of feelings he dared not utter but in the near future when certain clouds had rolled by he would unlock its treasures and then but no more tonight he could not trust himself rose felt as if she were assuming one of the characters in a mysterious romance such as unfolded itself only in books or in boston but thrilling as it was it was nevertheless extremely unsatisfactory convinced that claude merrill was passionately in love with her one of her reasons for coming to boston had been to fall more deeply in love with him and thus heal some at least of the wounds she had inflicted it may have been a foolish idea but after three weeks it seemed still worse a useless one for after several interviews she felt herself drifting farther and farther from claude and if he felt any burning ambition to make her his own he certainly concealed it with admirable art given up with the most offensive magnanimity by stephen and not greatly desired by claude that seemed the present status of proud rose wiley of the brier neighborhood it was june she remembered as she leaned out of the open window at least it was june in edgewood and she supposed for conveniences sake they called it june in boston not that it mattered much what the poor city prisoners called it how beautiful the river would be at home with the trees along the banks in full leaf how she hungered and thirsted for the river to see it sparkle in the sunlight to watch the moonglade stretching from one bank to the other to hear the soft lap of the water on the shore and the distant murmur of the falls at the bridge and the brier neighborhood would be at its loveliest for the wild roses were in blossom by now and the little house how sweet it must look under the shade of the elms with the saco rippling at the back was poor rufus still lying in a darkened room and was stephen nursing him disappointed stephen dear noble old stephen gold and pinchbeck just then mrs brooks groaned in the next room and called rose who went in to minister to her real needs or to condole with her fancied ones whichever course of action appeared to be the more agreeable at the moment mrs brooks desired conversation it seemed or at least she desired an audience for a monologue for she recognized no antiphonal obligations on the part of her listeners the doctors were not doing her a speck of good and she was just squandering money in a miserable boardinghouse when she might be enjoying poor health in her own home and she didnt believe her hens were receiving proper care and she had forgotten to pull down the shades in the spare room and the sun would fade the carpet out all white before she got back and she didnt believe dr smiths magnetism was any more use than a cats foot nor dr robinsons electricity any better than a bumblebees buzz and she had a great mind to go home and try dr lord from bonnie eagle and there was a letter for rose on the bureau which had come before supper but the shiftless lazy worthless landlady had forgotten to send it up till just now the letter was from mite shapley but rose could read only half of it to mrs brooks little beside the news that the waterman barn the finest barn in the whole township had been struck by lightning and burned to the ground stephen was away at the time having taken rufus to portland where an operation on his eyes would shortly be performed at the hospital and one of the neighbors was sleeping at the river farm and taking care of the cattle still the house might not have been saved but for one of alcestis crambrys sudden bursts of common sense which occurred now quite regularly he succeeded not only in getting the horses out of the stalls but gave the alarm so promptly that the whole neighborhood was soon on the scene of action stephen was the only man mite reminded rose who ever had any patience with or took any pains to teach alcestis but he never could have expected to be rewarded in this practical way the barn was only partly insured and when she had met stephen at the station next day and condoled with him on his loss he had said oh well mite a little more or less doesnt make much difference just now the rest wouldnt interest you mrs brooks said rose precipitately preparing to leave the room something about claude i suppose ventured that astute lady i think mite kind of fancied him i dont believe he ever gave her any real encouragement but hed make love to a pump claude merrill would and so would his father before him how my sister abby made out to land him we never knew for they said hed proposed to every woman in the town of bingham not excepting the wooden indian girl in front of the cigar store and not one of em but our abby ever got a chance to name the day abby was as set as the everlastin hills and if shed made up her mind to have a man he couldnt wriggle away from her nohow in the world it beats all how girls do run after these slickhaired sweettongued miss nancy kind o fellers that aint but little good as beaux an worth less than nothing as husbands rose scarcely noticed what mrs brooks said she was too anxious to read the rest of mite shapleys letter in the quiet of her own room stephen looks thin and pale so it ran on but he does not allow anybody to sympathize with him i think you ought to know something that i havent told you before for fear of hurting your feelings but if i were in your place id like to hear everything and then youll know how to act when you come home just after you left stephen plowed up all the land in front of your new house every inch of it all up and down the road between the fence and the front doorstep and then he planted corn where you were going to have your flowerbeds he has closed all the blinds and hung a to let sign on the large elm at the gate stephen never was spiteful in his life but this looks a little like spite perhaps he only wanted to save his selfrespect and let people know that everything between you was over forever perhaps he thought it would stop talk once and for all but you wont mind you lucky girl staying nearly three months in boston so almira purled on in violet ink with shaded letters how i wish it had come my way though im not good at rubbing rheumatic patients even when they are his aunt is he as devoted as ever and when will it be how do you like the theatre mother thinks you wont attend but by what he used to say i am sure church members in boston always go to amusements your loving friend almira shapley ps they say rufuss doctors bills here and the operation and hospital expenses in portland will mount up to five hundred dollars of course stephen will be dreadfully hampered by the loss of his barn and maybe he wants to let your house that was to be because he really needs money in that case the dooryard wont be very attractive to tenants with corn planted right up to the steps and no path left its two feet tall now and by august just when you were intending to move in it will hide the front windows not that youll care with a diamond on your engagement finger the letter was more than flesh and blood could stand and rose flung herself on her bed to think and regret and repent and if possible to sob herself to sleep she knew now that she had never admired and respected stephen so much as at the moment when under the reproach of his eyes she had given him back his ring when she left edgewood and parted with him forever she had really loved him better than when she had promised to marry him claude merrill on his native boston heath did not appear the romantic inspiring figure he had once been in her eyes a week ago she distrusted him tonight she despised him what had happened to rose was the dilation of her vision she saw things under a wider sky and in a clearer light above all her heart was wrung with pity for stephen stephen with no comforting womans hand to help him in his sore trouble stephen bearing his losses alone his burdens and anxieties alone his nursing and daily work alone oh how she felt herself needed needed that was the magic word that unlocked her better nature darkness is the time for making roots and establishing plants whether of the soil or of the soul and all at once rose had become a woman a little one perhaps but a whole woman and a bit of an angel too with healing in her wings when and how had this metamorphosis come about last summer the fragile brierrose had hung over the river and looked at its pretty reflection in the placid surface of the water its few buds and blossoms were so lovely it sighed for nothing more the changes in the plant had been wrought secretly and silently in some mysterious way as common to soul as to plant life the roots had gathered in more nourishment from the earth they had stored up strength and force and all at once there was a marvelous fructifying of the plant hardiness of stalk new shoots everywhere vigorous leafage and a shower of blossoms but everything was awry boston was a failure claude was a weakling and a flirt her turquoise ring was lying on the riverbank stephen did not love her any longer her flowerbeds were plowed up and planted in corn and the cottage that stephen had built and she had furnished that beloved cottage was to let she was in boston but what did that amount to after all what was the state house to a bleeding heart or the old south church to a pride wounded like hers at last she fell asleep but it was only by stopping her ears to the noises of the city streets and making herself imagine the sound of the river rippling under her bedroom windows at home the back yards of boston faded and in their place came the banks of the saco strewn with pine needles fragrant with wild flowers then there was the bit of sunny beach where stephen moored his boat she could hear the sound of his paddle boston lovers came acourting in the horsecars but hers had floated down stream to her just at dusk in a birchbark canoe or sometimes in the moonlight on a couple of logs rafted together but it was all over now and she could see only stephens stern face as he flung the despised turquoise ring down the river bank a country chevalier it was early in august when mrs wealthy brooks announced her speedy return from boston to edgewood its jest as well rose is comin back said mr wiley to his wife i never favored her goin to boston where that rosyposy claude feller is when he was down here he was kep kind o tied up in a boxstall but there hes caperin loose round the pastur i should think rose would be ashamed to come back after the way shes carried on remarked mrs wiley but if she needed punishment i guess shes got it bein compnykeeper to wealthy ann brooks bein a church member in good an reglar standin i spose wealthy annll go to heaven but i can only say that it would be a sight pleasanter place for a good many if she didnt rose has ben foolish an flirty an wrongheaded allowed her grandfather but it wont do no good to treat her like a hardened criminile sames you did afore she went away she aint hardly got her wisdom teeth cut in love affairs she aint broke the laws of the state o maine nor any o the ten commandments she aint disgraced the family an theres a chance for her to reform seein as how she aint twenty year old yet i was turrible wild an hotheaded myself afore you ketched me an tamed me down you aint so tame now as i wish you was mrs wiley replied testily if you could smoke a clay pipe twould calm your nerves mother an help you to git some philosophy inter you you need a little philosophy turrible bad i need patience considable more was mrs wileys withering retort thats the way with folks said old kennebec reflectively as he went on peacefully puffing if you try to indoose em to take an intrest in a brannew virtue they wont look at it but theyll run down a side street an buy half a yard more o some turrible old shopworn trait o character that theyve kep in stock all their lives an that everybodys sick to death of there was a man in gardner but alas the experiences of the gardiner man though told in the same delightful fashion that had won mrs wileys heart many years before now fell upon the empty air in these years of old kennebecs anecdotage his pipe was his best listener and his truest confidant mr wileys constant intercessions with his wife made roses homecoming somewhat easier and the sight of her own room and belongings soothed her troubled spirit but the days went on and nothing happened to change the situation she had lost a lover that was all and there were plenty more to choose from or there always had been but the only one she wanted was the one who made no sign she used to think that she could twist stephen around her little finger that she had only to beckon to him and he would follow her to the ends of the earth now fear had entered her heart she no longer felt sure because she no longer felt worthy of him and feeling both uncertainty and unworthiness her lips were sealed and she was rendered incapable of making any bid for forgiveness so the little world of pleasant river went on to all outward seeming as it had ever gone on one side of the stream a girls heart was longing and pining and sickening with hope deferred and growing too with such astonishing rapidity that the very angels marveled and on the other a mans whole vision of life and duty was widening and deepening under the fructifying influence of his sorrow the corn waved high and green in front of the vacant riverside cottage but stephen sent no word or message to rose he had seen her once but only from a distance she seemed paler and thinner he thought the result probably of her metropolitan gayeties he heard no rumor of any engagement and he wondered if it were possible that her love for claude merrill had not after all been returned in kind this seemed a wild impossibility his mind refused to entertain the supposition that any man on earth could resist falling in love with rose or having fallen in that he could ever contrive to climb out so he worked on at his farm harder than ever and grew soberer and more careworn daily rufus had never seemed so near and dear to him as in these weeks when he had lived under the shadow of threatened blindness the burning of the barn and the strain upon their slender property brought the brothers together shoulder to shoulder if you lose your girl steve said the boy and i lose my eyesight and we both lose the barn why tll be us two against the world for a spell the to let sign on the little house was an arrant piece of hypocrisy nothing but the direst extremity could have caused him to allow an alien step on that sacred threshold the plowing up of the flowerbeds and planting of the corn had served a double purpose it showed the too curious public the finality of his break with rose and her absolute freedom it also prevented them from suspecting that he still entered the place his visits were not many but he could not bear to let the dust settle on the furniture that he and rose had chosen together and whenever he locked the door and went back to the river farm he thought of a verse in the bible therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken it was now friday of the last week in august the river was full of logs thousands upon thousands of them covering the surface of the water from the bridge almost up to the brier neighborhood the edgewood drive was late owing to a long drought and low water but it was to begin on the following monday and lije dennett and his under boss were looking over the situation and planning the campaign as they leaned over the bridgerail they saw mr wiley driving down the river road when he caught sight of them he hitched the old white horse at the corner and walked toward them filling his pipe the while in his usual leisurely manner were not busy this forenoon said lije dennett spose we stand right here and let old kennebec have his say out for once weve never heard the end of one of his stories an hes ben talkin for twenty years all right rejoined his companion with a broad grin at the idea im willin if you are but whos goin to tell our famlies the reason weve deserted em i bate yer we shant budge till the crack o doom the road commissionerll come along once a year and mend the bridge under our feet but old kennebecll talk straight on till the day o jedgment mr wiley had one of the most enjoyable mornings of his life and felt that after half a century of neglect his powers were at last appreciated by his fellowcitizens he proposed numerous strategic movements to be made upon the logs whereby they would move more swiftly than usual he described several successful drives on the kennebec when the logs had melted down the river almost by magic owing to his generalship and he paid a tribute in passing to the docility of the boss who on that occasion had never moved a single log without asking his advice from this topic he proceeded genially to narrate the lifehistories of the boss the under boss and several indians belonging to the crew histories in which he himself played a gallant and conspicuous part the conversation then drifted naturally to the exploits of riverdrivers in general and mr wiley narrated the sorts of feats in logriding pickpolethrowing and the shooting of rapids that he had done in his youth these stories were such as had seldom been heard by the ear of man and as they passed into circulation instantaneously we are probably enjoying some of them to this day they were still being told when a crambry child appeared on the bridge bearing a note for the old man upon reading it he moved off rapidly in the direction of the store ejaculating bless my soul i clean forgot that saleratus and mothers settin at the kitchen table with the bowl in her lap waitin for it got so intrested in your listnin i never thought o the time the connubial discussion that followed this breach of discipline began on the arrival of the saleratus and lasted through supper and rose went to bed almost immediately afterward for very dullness and apathy her life stretched out before her in the most aimless and monotonous fashion she saw nothing but heartache in the future and that she richly deserved it made it none the easier to bear feeling feverish and sleepless she slipped on her gray shaker cloak and stole quietly downstairs for a breath of air her grandfather and grandmother were talking on the piazza and good humor seemed to have been restored i was over to the tavern tonight she heard him say as she sat down at a little distance i was over to the tavern tonight an a feller from gorham got to talkin an braggin bout what a stock o goods they kep in the store over there ansays i i bate ye dollars to doughnuts that there haint a darn thing ye can ask for at bill pikes store at pleasant river that he cant go down cellar or up attic or out in the barn chamber an git for ye well sir he took me up an i borrered the money of joe dennett who held the stakes an we went right over to bill pikes with all the boys follerin on behind an the gorham man never let on what he was goin to ask for till the hull crowd of us got inside the store then says he as plite as a basket o chips mr pike id like to buy a pulpit if you can oblige me with one bill scratched his head an i held my breath then says he pears to me id ought to hev a pulpit or two if i can jest remember where i keep em i dont never callate to be out o pulpits but im so plagued for room i cant keep em in here with the grocries jim thats his new store boy you jest take a lantern an run out in the far corner o the shed at the end o the hickory woodpile an see how many pulpits weve got in stock well jim run out an when he come back he says weve got two mr pike shall i bring one of em in at that the boys all bust out laughin an hollerin an tauntin the gorham man an he paid up with a good will i tell ye i dont approve of bettin said mrs wiley grimly but ill try to sanctify the money by usin it for a new washboiler the fact is explained old kennebec somewhat confused that the boys made me spend every cent of it then an there rose heard her grandmothers caustic reply and then paid no further attention until her keen ear caught the sound of stephens name it was a part of her unhappiness that since her broken engagement no one would ever allude to him and she longed to hear him mentioned so that perchance she could get some inkling of his movements i met stephen tonight for the first time in a week said mr wiley he kind o keeps out o my way lately hes goin to drive his span into portland tomorrow mornin and bring rufus home from the hospital sunday afternoon the doctors think theyve made a success of their job but rufus has got to be bandaged up a spell longer stephen is goin to join the drive monday mornin at the bridge here so ill get the latest news o the boy land ill be turrible glad if he gets out with his eyesight if its only for steves sake hes a turrible good fellow steve is he said something tonight that made me set more store by him than ever i told you i hednt heard an unkind word agin rose sence she come home from boston an no more i hev till this evenin there was two or three fellers talkin in the postoffice an they didnt suspicion i was settin on the steps outside the screen door that jim jenkins that rose so everlastinly snubbed at the tavern dance spoke up an says he this time last year rose wiley could a hed the choice of any man on the river an now i bet ye she cant get nary one steve was there jest goin out the door with some bags o coffee an sugar under his arm i guess youre mistaken about that he says speakin up jest like lightnin so long as stephen watermans alive rose wiley can have him for one and that everybodys welcome to know he spoke right out loud an plain jest as if he was readin the declaration of independence i expected the boys would everlastinly poke fun at him but they never said a word i guess his eyes flashed for he come out the screen door slammin it after him and stalked by me as if he was too worked up to notice anything or anybody i didnt foiler him for his long legs git over the ground too fast for me but thinks i mebbe ill hev some use for my lemonadeset after all i hope to the land you will responded mrs wiley for im about sick o movin it round when i sweep under my bed and i shall be glad if rose an stephen do make it up for wealthy ann brookss gossip is too much for a christian woman to stand housebreaking where was the pale rose the faded rose that crept noiselessly down from her room wanting neither to speak nor to be spoken to nobody ever knew she vanished forever and in her place a thing of sparkles and dimples flashed up the stairway and closed the door softly there was a streak of moonshine lying across the bare floor and a merry ghost with dressinggown held prettily away from bare feet danced a gay fandango among the yellow moonbeams there were breathless flights to the open window and kisses thrown in the direction of the river farm there were impressive declamations at the lookingglass where a radiant creature pointed to her reflection and whispered worthless little pig he loves you after all then when quiet joy had taken the place of mad delight there was a swoop down upon the floor an impetuous hiding of brimming eyes in the white counterpane and a dozen impassioned promises to herself and to something higher than herself to be a better girl the mood lasted and deepened and still rose did not move her heart was on its knees before stephens faithful love his chivalry his strength her troubled spirit like a frail boat tossed about in the rapids seemed entering a quiet harbor where there were protecting shores and a still still evening star her sails were all torn and drooping but the harbor was in sight and the poor little weatherbeaten craft could rest in peace a period of grave reflection now ensued under the bedclothes where one could think better suddenly an inspiration seized her an inspiration so original so delicious and above all so humble and praiseworthy that it brought her head from her pillow and she sat bolt upright clapping her hands like a child the very thing she whispered to herself gleefully it will take courage but im sure of my ground after what he said before them all and ill do it grandma in biddeford buying church carpets stephen in portland was ever such a chance the same glowing rose came downstairs two steps at a time next morning bade her grandmother goodby with suspicious pleasure and sent her grandfather away on an errand which with attendant conversation would consume half the day then bundles after bundles and baskets after baskets were packed into the wagon behind the seat beneath the seat and finally under the laprobe she gave a dramatic flourish to the whip drove across the bridge went through pleasant river village and up the leafy road to the little house stared the to let sign scornfully in the eye alighted and ran like a deer through the aisles of waving corn past the kitchen windows to the back door if he has kept the big key in the old place under the stone where we both used to find it then he hasnt forgotten me or anything thought rose the key was there and rose lifted it with a sob of gratitude it was but five minutes work to carry all the bundles from the wagon to the back steps and another five to lead old tom across the road into the woods and tie him to a tree quite out of the sight of any passerby when after running back she turned the key in the lock her heart gave a leap almost of terror and she started at the sound of her own footfall through the open door the sunlight streamed into the dark room she flew to tables and chairs and gave a rapid sweep of the hand over their surfaces he has been dusting here and within a few days too she thought triumphantly the kitchen was perfection as she always knew it would be with one door opening to the shaded road and the other looking on the river windows too framing the appleorchard and the elms she had chosen the furniture but how differently it looked now that it was actually in place the tiny shed had piles of split wood with great boxes of kindlings and shavings all in readiness for the bride who would do her own cooking who but stephen would have made the very wood ready for a womans homecoming and why had he done so much in may when they were not to be married until august then the door of the bedroom was stealthily opened and here rose sat down and cried for joy and shame and hope and fear the very flowered paper she had refused as too expensive how lovely it looked with the white chamber set she brought in her simple wedding outfit of blankets bedlinen and counterpanes and folded them softly in the closet and then for the rest of the morning she went from room to room doing all that could remain undiscovered even to laying a fire in the new kitchen stove this was the plan stephen must pass the house on his way from the river farm to the bridge where he was to join the riverdrivers on monday morning she would be out of bed by the earliest peep of dawn put on stephens favorite pink calico leave a note for her grandmother run like a hare down her side of the river and up stephens steal into the house open blinds and windows light the fire and set the kettle boiling then with a sharp knife she would cut down two rows of corn and thus make a green pathway from the front kitchen steps to the road next the false and insulting to let sign would be forcibly tweaked from the tree and thrown into the grass she would then lay the table in the kitchen and make ready the nicest breakfast that two people ever sat down to and oh would two people sit down to it or would one go off in a rage and the other die of grief and disappointment then having done all she would wait and palpitate and palpitate and wait until stephen came surely no propertyowner in the universe could drive along a road observe his corn leveled to the earth his sign removed his house open and smoke issuing from his chimney without going in to surprise the rogue and villain who could be guilty of such vandalism and when he came in oh she had all day sunday in which to forecast with mingled dread and gladness and suspense that allimportant alldecisive first moment all day sunday to frame and unframe penitent speeches all day sunday would it ever be monday if so what would tuesday bring would the sun rise on happy mrs stephen waterman of pleasant river or on miserable miss rose wiley of the prier neighborhood the dream room long ago when stephen was a boy of fourteen or fifteen he had gone with his father to a distant town to spend the night after an early breakfast next morning his father had driven off for a business interview and left the boy to walk about during his absence he wandered aimlessly along a quiet side street and threw himself down on the grass outside a pretty garden to amuse himself as best he could after a few minutes he heard voices and turning peeped through the bars of the gate in idle boyish curiosity it was a small brown house the kitchen door was open and a table spread with a white cloth was set in the middle of the room there was a cradle in a far corner and a man was seated at the table as though he might be waiting for his breakfast there is a kind of sentiment about the kitchen in new england a kind of sentiment not provoked by other rooms here the farmer drops in to spend a few minutes when he comes back from the barn or field on an errand here in the great clean sweet comfortable place the busy housewife lives sometimes rocking the cradle sometimes opening and shutting the oven door sometimes stirring the pot darning stockings paring vegetables or mixing goodies in a yellow bowl the children sit on the steps stringing beans shelling peas or hulling berries the cat sleeps on the floor near the woodbox and the visitor feels exiled if he stays in sittingroom or parlor for here where the mother is always busy is the heart of the farmhouse there was an open back door to this kitchen a door framed in morningglories and the woman or was she only girl standing at the stove was pretty oh so pretty in stephens eyes his boyish heart went out to her on the instant she poured a cup of coffee and walked with it to the table then an unexpected interesting thing happened something the boy ought not to have seen and never forgot the man putting out his hand to take the cup looked up at the pretty woman with a smile and she stooped and kissed him stephen was fifteen as he looked on the instant he became a man with a mans hopes desires ambitions he looked eagerly hungrily and the scene burned itself on the sensitive plate of his young heart so that as he grew older he could take the picture out in the dark from time to time and look at it again when he first met rose he did not know precisely what she was to mean to him but before long when he closed his eyes and the old familiar picture swam into his field of vision behold by some spiritual chemistry the pretty womans face had given place to that of rose all such teasing visions had been sternly banished during this sorrowful summer and it was a thoughtful sober stephen who drove along the road on this mellow august morning the dust was deep the goldenrod waved its imperial plumes making the humble waysides gorgeous the river chattered and sparkled till it met the logs at the brier neighorhood and then lapsing into silence flowed steadily under them till it found a vent for its spirits in the dashing and splashing of the falls haying was over logging was to begin that day then harvesting then woodcutting then eternal successions of plowing sowing reaping haying logging harvesting and so on to the endless end of his days here and there a red or a yellow branch painted only yesterday caught his eye and made him shiver he was not ready for winter his heart still craved the summer it had missed hello what was that cornstalks prone on the earth sign torn down and lying flat in the grass blinds open fire in the chimney he leaped from the wagon and hinging the reins to alcestis crambry said stay right here out of sight and dont you move till i call you and striding up the green pathway hung open the kitchen door a forest of corn waving in the doorway at the back morningglories clambering round and round the windowframes table with shining white cloth kettle humming and steaming something bubbling in a pan on the stove fire throwing out sweet little gleams of welcome through the open damper all this was taken in with one incredulous rapturous twinkle of an eye but something else too rose of all roses rose of the river rose of the world standing behind a chair her hand pressed against her heart her lips parted her breath coming and going she was glowing like a jewel glowing with the extraordinary brilliancy that emotion gives to some women she used to be happy in a gay sparkling way like the shallow part of the stream as it chotters over white pebbles and bright sands now it was a broad steady full happiness like the deeps of the river under the sun dont speak stephen till you hear what i have to say it takes a good deal of courage for a girl to do as i am doing but i want to show how sorry i am and its the only way she was trembling and the words came faster and faster ive been very wrong and foolish and made you very unhappy but i havent done what you would have hated most i havent been engaged to claude merrill he hasnt so much as asked me i am here to beg you to forgive me to eat breakfast with me to drive me to the ministers and marry me quickly quickly before anything happens to prevent us and then to bring me home here to live all the days of my life oh stephen dear honestly honestly you havent lost anything in all this long miserable summer ive suffered too and im better worth loving than i was will you take me back rose had a tremendous power of provoking and holding love and stephen of loving his was too generous a nature for revilings and complaints and reproaches the shores of his heart were strewn with the wreckage of the troubled summer but if the tide of love is high enough it washes such things out of remembrance he just opened his arms and took rose to his heart faults and all with joy and gratitude and she was as happy as a child who has escaped the scolding it richly deserved and who determines for very thankfulness sake never to be naughty again you dont know what youve done for me stephen she whispered with her face hidden on his shoulder i was just a common little prickly rosebush when you came along like a good gardener and grafted in something better the something better was your love stephen dear and its made everything different the silly rose you were engaged to long ago has disappeared somewhere i hope you wont be able to find her under the new leaves she was all i wanted said stephen you thought she was the girl answered because you didnt see the prickles but youd have felt them sometime the old rose was a selfish thing not good enough for you the new rose is going to be your wife and rufuss sister and your mothers daughter all in one then such a breakfast was spread as stephen in his sorry years of bachelor existence had forgotten could exist but before he broke his fast he ran out to the wagon and served the astonished alcestis with his wedding refreshments then and there bidding him drive back to the river farm and bring him a package that lay in the drawer of his shavingstand package placed there when hot youth and love and longing had inspired him to hurry on the marriage day theres an envelope alcestis he cried a long envelope way way back in the corner and a small box on top of it bring them both and my wallet too and if you find them all and get them to me safely you shall be bridesmaid and groomsman and best man and usher and maid of honor at a wedding in less than an hour off with you drive straight and use the whip on dolly when he reentered the kitchen flushed with joy and excitement rose put the various good things on the table and he almost tremblingly took his seat fearing that contact with the solid wood might wake him from this entrancing vision id like to put you in your chair like a queen and wait on you he said with a soft boyish stammer but i am too dazed with happiness to be of any use its my turn to wait upon you and i oh how i love to have you dazed rose answered ill be at the table presently myself but we have been housekeeping only three minutes and we have nothing but the tin coffeepot this morning so ill pour the coffee from the stove she filled a cup with housewifely care and brought it to stephens side as she set it down and was turning she caught his look a look so full of longing that no loving woman however busy could have resisted it then she stooped and kissed him fondly fervently stephen put his arm about her and drawing her down to his knee rested his head against her soft shoulder with a sigh of comfort like that of a tired child he had waited for it ten years and at last the dreamroom had come true
