spying on heaven edgar million spying on heaven published by edgar million at smashwords copyright edgar million quit questioning god and start trusting him joel osteen god is a vicious little fucker a voice announced waking bogumil with a start dark eyes blinking in the hot urban sun trying to work out where he was and who was speaking with such a voice deep booming seeming to shake the tarmacked roof which he sat upon then it continued and on the odd day he can be be honest with himself he knows it will this be one of those days though asked another voice gentle foreign sounding the boy twisted and looked around reloading his surroundings two empty tins of beer snuck out of the box dad kept on the floor by the fridge crumpled onto the rough surface a greggs sausage roll the wrapper anyway discarded on the floor along with a magazine borrowed from a box dad kept on top of the wardrobe the one he thought no one knew about pictures of plump naked women printed on thick matt paper images maybe thirty years old surrounded by writing he couldnt read wearing poses he hadnt experienced yet he was sitting on a flat roof the roof bogumils favourite hiding place when he wanted some space some freedom from his two brothers and their fists and their taunts the space was accessible through a gap in his back fence up a series of plastic drain pipes it was his secret kingdom the voices were drifting up through a thin slit of open skylight so he crept across fragments of the tarmac cracking and scraping his bare legs to sneak a look there were two men standing by the sink in the little community hall where all the alkies and druggies met for their support groups one was the biggest toughest looking bloke bogumil had ever seen and he towered over a fat little asian fella for some reason wearing a thick knitted christmas jumper on a hot day in june the fat man bogumil thought from his perched had a pleasant face with an expression like a calm day in spring hes hard work the manmountain continued the fat one looked sideways at the big guy and bog could tell he agreed but he said nothing bog pressed his head onto the glass and could just make out the scrawny figure they called god who appeared to be more concerned with trying to make himself comfortable on the hard plastic chair than with their discussion of his failings it seemed to be prodding and stabbing his bony rear no matter how he arranged himself and he looked agitated and volatle the community centre echoed with the sound of cups and saucers clinking coffee and tea being prepared by a strange grey looking figure who bogumil couldnt quite make out partly because of the posts and sections of roof obstructing his view of the show and partly because he just seemed hard to focus on bog just couldnt seem to focus on him properly he busied himself or herself even with the refreshments table moving bourbons and ginger nuts about a tray picking off custard creams here and there okay dearies called a voice originating from a person bogumil couldnt see time to join the circle of trust bogumil bog to his school friends liked these little sessions you heard so much life discussed all the things grownups normally kept secret their loves and their weaknesses their fears and their desperation often they would talk about the worst things in their lives their lowest ebb he heard the expression rock bottom again and again and was baffled by some of the stories strange almost demented encounters and betrayals but hed never seen this lot before they were new they tramped over to the centre of the room so bog tiptoed across to the main skylights for a proper view of their circle of ten or eleven figures mostly men but a couple of ladies as well they were healthier looking than the usual types who held meetings like this not ravaged by their addictions and he wondered what their thing would be so said the woman in a plummy lilting voice which made bog think of rivers and orchards and flowers a plump friendly looking lady in a summer dress who is going to kick us off today there were murmurings but no one seemed keen to go first in the absence of a volunteer maybe i could ask you to speak first please god its been a while since you joined us bog peered through glass streaked with the dust of a city which had known no rain for weeks and made out the shape of a skinny figure scrawny even who appeared to be wearing some sort of a shop assistants uniform who started as if stung looked unwilling but spoke as requested nonetheless in a flat monotone voice hi my name is god and i am attending this group because i need to learn not to be so violent with my world welcome back god the group chorused and please remind the group why you come to these sessions to try and learn how to treat her my woman my world right again because if i dont well shes not going to take it much longer the man ran a hand through thinning hair a little greasy look i didnt really want to come but she insists and unless i want our trial separation to be made permanent i attend and i dont i really dont go on i love her you see he told them looking to a green cloaked dwarf for reassurance even if she never knows how much i do love her god lifted a chipped cup coffee to his lips breathing in the sour aroma of instant coffee then sipped wincing as the liquid touched his lips part of the problem is i just get so jealous when i think of her he said that i find myself just dishing out these little punishments even when i knew deep down shes done nothing to deserve it little punishments someone asked god shifted again muttering about the bloody chair to no one in particular nothing really he told the group a tidal wave here a nuclear explosion there shes my planet so she needs to know whos in charge but she says i need to respect her more you judge these er correctives to be small transgressions then it was nothing really his voice rising just a touch the global equivalent of a black eye but the problem is the beatings well theyre not having the right effect anymore more and more she doubts me god lifted his slender arms towards the ceiling revealing damp patches on his nylon shirt then explained that the bacterial cells which formed her had become sentient and less forgiving of his whims and his admonitions look out the window see what theyve built theyre losing faith bog glanced over his shoulder at the city of london in the distance new buildings springing up all the time it was an impressive sight the fat man leant back in his own chair looking comfortable on the small plastic despite his enormous girth closing his eyes as the christmas jumper strained the snowman adorning his stomach growing enormous you will not be punished for your anger he told him you will be punished by your anger thanks buddha thats deep did you get it off of the deep thought for the day on twitter the man shook his head seriously the grownups are talking now the man hed called buddha cracked his knuckles the noise echoing off of the bare walls of the community centre god you know i preach peace its the only true path but you do rather test my patience old chap god glances at buddha looking surprised at the sharpness of the rebuke then he continued look back in the beginning god continued but stopped his eyes clouding over for a moment other worlds and places visible in them ha how i love that phrase in the beginning in the beginning i was a god we all were dude said an american guy in a shiny jumpsuit no biggie dont dude me you were a minstrel there was no glory in that then ignoring the mans wounded expression he continued you know what its like with a woman early on you promise her everything to take care of the her of the little cells which form her the people she call them i gave her so much a beautiful garden lovely food livestock in the millions trust in me ill see you alright just do as youre told sounds like a fine deal the big man agreed i did my best he told the room sure sometimes she was forced to go without in life well the extra sweet chocolate topping on the mocha would be life everlasting if she put up with it mansions clouds reunions with long lost loved ones the whole kit and kaboodle she bought it then thor asked shaking his head a stupid grin on his face yep thats the girl i remember very trusting god looked up at the big man a nasty look in his eyes but he didnt say anything just continued i made her a promise see unbreakable a life after death deal i promised her and the cells that if they were good obedient then they would all come back live forever with us in heaven then she touched my face and told me she trusted me that i had a truly kind heart i wept that night god lifted his coffee cup back to his lips discovered hed drained it then placed it onto the floor with a clink i was committed to the promise too id bring every single one of those creatures back i told her well the ones that worshipped me at least i was certainly going to try my best the plump woman frowned how does that work then god stared down at the linoleum shaking his head dunno still trying to work out the details not had time to work out the technicalities of the retrievals yet he said then grinned a mean piggy look in his eyes which reminded bog of his dad on a friday night after too much beer at the club well since ive not set the date for what they call judgement day well ive got some wiggle room it sounds very clever the fat one said i was trying to instigate a cyclical system along similar lines how are you going to manage doing them all at once dunno he repeated to be honest i cant totally remember where they all are some days i can barely keep track of the living beings let alone the location of dusty decayed remnants of the long dead another coffee the big man asked patting him on the shoulder thanks thor four sugars please the one hed called thor disappeared then returned with a couple of fresh mugs of instant coffee and some sachets of sugar and milk most of things i promised her were just shit i made up after i let her down again he admitted a way to wipe the look of sadness from her eyes where does that sadness come from god the plump woman asked and god glanced at her twisting again on the hard plastic chair not answering the pointed question itll all come right i told her though i warned her not to rile me up so much she knows ive got a bit of a temper way back when back in the beginning she would have said sorry said she hadnt meant to upset me but now she just stares me down this cold look in her eyes which makes me want to weep thor he said looking at the big man you understand right you had a few rage issues yourself in the past you know its not easy these are different times now he responded im a different god these days this group has helped though god said the woman have you got anything that youd like to add how have you been treating her recently i gave her a new disease last week god stared at the floor looking both guilty and proud did she do something to cause this kinda what happened did she hurt you somehow some of the minions he looked round at the group the cells well they keep putting videos on this youtube thing saying stuff like i dont exist and even though a whole other bunch of them say its wrong and say im there for them just have faith i get so mad so i made aids airborne itll take a while to kick in but theyll get the message what message to love only me i suppose id had a few glasses of brandy see he concentrated hard on the lino like he was gathering his thoughts and looked over at thor you know i get a bit maudlin after ive been drinking and id had a couple of spliffs and i was just so sick of her shit so you blame her for the nonbelievers god took a sip of the coffee well she could do more to keep them in line in the old days when she believed id created them shed have never put up with people badmouthing me but then she started going through my jacket pockets in a manner of speaking and found all this stuff out about the dinosaurs and evolution and everything and suddenly shes considerably less certain of me little miss doubtful what does it matter though if the atheists dont believe she still loves you even with all the shit youve pulled god shook his head from side to side it bugs me i guess i worry im not enough for her i mean back in the day she had a bit of a rep looking accusingly round the room half you guys took her for a spin back then so i made the rules clear me and me only and for the longest time she understood the deal me and me only and id look out for her true but you still put her through some things even then interjected a welldressed man floods pestilence and the like and she was on her knees just trying to please you spare the rod rama spoil the child god responded gruffly thats what my old man used to say dont i know it too god appeared to reflexively put a hand to his back as if remembering some long ago asswhooping and bog had a sudden flash of his own father in a friday night fever stinking of whiskey black leather belt gripped in his bony fist and rubbed his own back on sympathy a pudgy dark haired god spoke up and tried a different tack have you considered that you might start to see other worlds again or even be nonexclusive ive seen the way you are with that little planet on the horsehead nebula she seems nice god smiled at this and bog had a sense that this woman had been more than nice to him but that he was less keen on the missus sharing the same freedom he had to roam she just needs to do as shes told he said blankly one of the others spoke up the grey one with the custards creams who from this angle appeared to have more arms that the usual probably a trick of the glass distortion look from what youre saying im not sure shes the exclusive type hung for a long time with zeus and his mob not to mention here he glanced nervously over at thor well you guys were pretty close back in the day shes a very friendly girl god clenched his nicotine stained fingers tightly into a fist as though he was considering pounding it into the mans face for reminding him that thor had been there first but appeared to think better of it thor coughed what do you care if the atheists dont believe asked thor you still hold infinite sway over their lives and deaths youre still all omnipotent and omnipresent though thats a bit of a headache at times dont know if youre coming or going half the time so what do you care if even half dont believe screw them dunno it makes me feel good when they all like me god looked sadly at the faded linoleum floor patterned with green and flecks of what might once have been white but which now was more yellow or grey and i worry that maybe the atheists are right i am nothing well they just make me anxious dude youre all three major religions on the planet a shabby street drinking bearded figure told him in a growl she still loves you to bits man even with all your shit but if you keep whoopin her shes bound to lose faith how bout a good visitation thor suggested get your holy ass down there and find a nice prophet to spread the word always did it for me its not so easy though these days time was id pick out a nice prophet sincere receptive and present myself to him so he could spread the word god waved a hand to demonstrate the ease with which this used to work for him then hed go off to spread my word and all would be cool again but now when i present myself to one of the minions he goes off to tell everyone of my decrees and quicksmart they lock him up in a mental hospital dope him up to the eyeballs start taking pictures of the inside of his brain god stopped for a second as if contemplating this development did you know they can do that now he asked the group take pictures of the inside of their brains so they can almost see what each other is thinking i dont really know how they god trailed off looking impressed despite himself at the level of education and independence his planet had achieved dont you think thats amazing the woman asked the things theyve achieved doesnt that make you proud it should momma e i know it should but it doesnt he said eyes wet with tears but it just makes me think the day when she doesnt need me or any of us is getting even closer it scares me bog watched this strange conversation from above so he wondered what was their thing not booze or gambling the usual wifebeaters group met on thursdays and the meeting for the victims of spousal abuse was on mondays but this lot they were something else again with their odd delusional asides i even sent jesus back you know god told the group and bog saw a tall and ancient looking african man and momma e exchange a knowing glance as he continued not that the ungrateful little shit wanted to go well they did nail him to that cross thing the man said in a precise nigerian accent wincing and you wouldnt help him he was in counselling for years after that what happened when he went back this time did they nail him to something else well shango i picked a nice religious country called america for the second coming and i warned the little hippy none of that peace and love shit not like last time hellfire and damnation is the message i want you to take back he waved his hands in the air dramatically tell them this time were back and about to go all old testament on their arses unless they fall into line what happened the feebies the american police they shot him god had retracted into himself and begun to pick at his fingernails with a small pearl bladed flick knife hed retrieved from his shirt pocket with a click click click sound just audible up on the roof of the community centre then they burned down his compound then made it look like an accident bastards but surely he was a martyr asked shango thats a big deal they used to love all that stuff barely anyone even registered it the news reports just said he was a nutter a cult leader they called him god looked off into space for an age and the group was about to move on to the next member when he continued the boy my boy he hasnt spoken to me since says hes got his own life to live and that hes met this nice prehistoric planet who he thinks hes got a future with says he wants to learn from his daddys mistakes and treat her nice seems like a nice sentiment said momma e seriously maybe shes not right for you said thor maybe you should both see other er people you would say that wouldnt you you never got over her anyway god stared with building rage at thor but then seemed to simmer down when he noticed thor bristle and flex his muscles jesus god are you still on about that thor shook his head ive moved on already then momma e interjected really god oh seriously do i really have to keep calling you that look god she was a very friendly girl in her formative millennia she had a number of acquaintances but she trusted you implicitly then you had to fill her head with all that nonsense everlasting life eternal like you could do that anyway like any of us could god muttered something the group couldnt hear you need to stay in the comfort zone man said a handsome green skinned young man in speedos and a hawaiian shirt dont promise what you cant deliver what we do with these planets its all smoke and mirrors and eventually if were not straight with them they work it out a woman will take the odd slap or two because she loves you and some like your girl will put up with it longer still but they all get there in the end and if you dont at least consider treating her nice then thor there will be the least of your worries she loves me though she loves me anyway momma e spoke up now id like to thank joe i mean god for being so very open with us here in the group today and would like you to give him a big round of applause i think hes made real progress tonight the circle clapped warmly and the surfer dude patted him on the shoulder and they moved onto some of the others the surfer dude talked about trust issues and buddha complained his new squeeze kept trying to get him on a diet as if being vegetarian wasnt bad enough thor stared at god throughout the rest of the meeting silent as a tower block as the rest of the gods shared their own woes and bog wondered what he was thinking about from the expression on his face it he thought it might not end well for this man who called himself god the group finished and drifted about the room readying to leave and when god popped into the toilet leading off the room bog heard thor whisper to buddha about how he reckoned she still burnt a candle for him they even made a film about me recently the guy in it was a bit ugly compared to me but still it shows she hasnt forgotten what do you reckon about his boy buddha asked seems a decent sort of a chap to me thor looked at buddha like he was thinking little jesus might be just as bad as his daddy chip off the old block he said might come across all peace and love but theres something in his manner which tells me its only a matter of time before he follows in daddys footsteps youre too hard hes a lovely guy trust me all that me and only me shits unhealthy theres something about him youll see buddha hushed him as god returned then mother earth spoke the closing address to the group i am really grateful you agreed to convene here today i do like earth although we must pick somewhere different next time thanks for the venue god thanks god the group chorused in agreement one thing though god called a scratchy animalistic voice a voice from underground and bog was surprised the see the indistinct grey figure the one he still couldnt make out had spoken for the first time god looked surprised yeah the boy up on the roof listening it said and bogs stomach threatened to empty at mention of him but held his nerve well since it is your planet you need to decide what happens to him is he allowed to tell what he saw if this world is as sceptical as you claim then its not too much of an issue i suppose but it is your decision bog leapt back from the window but knew in his heart the game was up so he crept back to peer over the rim onto the gathering he saw a look of grim satisfaction on gods face which made him long to be small again away from all of this wrapped in his mothers embrace one last time its already in hand he said hes going to fall from the roof when he tries to get down the fall will break his neck buddha spoke first now really god is that entirely necessary not really he shrugged and would entertain no further discussion of the matter bog stood in the edge of the roof and watched the gods disperse in the street below disappearing into the coming shadows of night without a glance back up at his hiding place transporting themselves by various means all seemingly unworthy of the of their deified status thor was on a skateboard for pities sake although bog thought he could probably have used it as a surfboard such was the size of the thing it raged and clattered along the uneven east london street as he disappeared into the distance god himself appeared to be reattaching some kind of corporate name badge to his shirt and momma e seemed to be trying to force him into a hug but he writhed and resisted bog wondered about gods prophecy what a load of rubbish he told the coming night he had climbed down from his kingdom numerous times without even a scratch so he knew he shouldnt worry too much about what god had said hed be fine he gave the heavy plastic piping which he used to descend a sharp tug and it felt solid enough he grabbed his dads dirty mag hed truly be murdered if that didnt go back to its hiding place gripped the edge then lifted himself over the edge hanging in space epilogue pawla knelt ahead of the altar and looked up at the cross the smelt of burning candles sharp and chemical in her nostrils shed been here almost every day now since the fall weeping for her boy dear beautiful bogumil her baby her little one the one she had so wanted so much to be a baby girl hed been thirteen last birthday hed be thirteen forever now no wife of his own no babies of his own she looked up at the altar face drenched with tears and she cried out in pain filled with the deepest misery why god why did you take my boy from me she cried out to god she screamed at his son pinned and wretched on the cross she asked him why why why but
