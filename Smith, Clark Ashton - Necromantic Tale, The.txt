the necromantic tale clark ashton smith in one sense it is a mere truism to speak of the evocative power of words the olden efficacy of subtly woven spells of magic formulas and incantations has long become a literary metaphor though the terrible reality which once underlay and may still underlie such concepts has been forgotten however the necromancy of language is more than a metaphor to sir roderick hagdon the scars of fire on his ankles are things which no one could possibly regard as having their origin in a figure of speech sir roderick hagdon came to his title and his estate with no definite expectation of inheriting them nor any firsthand knowledge of the sort of life and surroundings entailed by his inheritance he had been born in australia and though he had known that his father was the younger brother of sir john hagdon he had formed only the vaguest idea of the ancestral manor and the interest that he felt therein was even vaguer his surprize was little short of consternation when the deaths of his father of sir john hagdon and sir johns only son all occurring within less than a year left clear his own succession and brought a letter from the family lawyers informing him of this fact which otherwise might have escaped his attention his mother too was dead and he was unmarried so leaving the australian sheeprange in charge of a competent overseer he had sailed immediately for england to assume his hereditary privileges it was a strange experience for him and strangest of all in view of the fact that he had never before visited england was the inexplicable feeling of familiarity aroused by his first sight of the hagdon manor he seemed to know the farmlands the cottages of the tenants the wood of ancient oaks with their burdens of druidic mistletoe and the old manorhouse half hidden among gigantic yews as if he had seen them all in some period that was past recollection being of an analytic trend he attributed all this to that imperfect sitmultaneousness in the action of the brainhemispheres by which psychologists account for such phenomena but the feeling remained and grew upon him and he yielded more and more to its halfsinister charm as he explored his property and delved in the family archives he felt also an unexpected kinship with his ancestors a feeling which had lain wholly dormant during his australian youth their portraits peering upon him from the neverdissipated shadows of the long hall wherein they hung were like wellknown faces the manorhouse it was said had been built in the reign of henry the seventh it was mossed and lichened with antiquity and there was a hint of beginning dilapidation in the timeworn stone of the walls the formal garden had gone a little wild from neglect the trimmed hedges and trees had taken on fantastic sprawling shapes and evil poisonous weeds had invaded the flowerbeds there were statues of cracked marble and verdigriseaten bronze amid the shrubbery there were fountains that had long ceased to flow and dials on which the foliageintercepted sun no longer fell about it all there hung an air of shadowladen time and subtle decadence but though he had never known anything but the primitive australian environment hagdon found himself quite at home in this atmosphere of old world complexities an atmosphere that was made from the dissolving phantoms of a thousand years from the breathings of dead men and women from loves and hates that had gone down to dust contrary to his anticipations he felt no nostalgia whatever for the remote land of his birth and upbringing sir roderick came to love the sunless gardens and the overtowering yews but above and beyond these he was fascinated by the manorhouse itself by the hall of ancestral portraits and the dark dusty library in which he found an amazing medley of rare tomes and manuscripts there were many first editions of elizabethan poets and dramatists and mingled with these in a quaint disorder were antique books on astrology and conjuration on demonism and magic sir rodereck shivered a little he knew not why as he turned the leaves of some of these latter volumes from whose ancient vellum and parchment arose to his nostrils an odor that was like the mustiness of tombs he dosed them hastily and the first editions were unable to detain him but he lingered long over certain genealogies and manuscript records of the hagdon family filled with a strange eagerness to learn as much as he could concerning these shadowy forbears of his in going through the records he was struck by the brevity of the mention accorded to a former sir roderick hagdon who had lived in the early seventeenth century all other members of the direct line had been dealt with at some length their deeds their marriages and their various claims to distinction were usually set forth with a wellnigh vainglorious unction but concerning sir roderick nothing more was given than the bare dates of his birth and death and the fact that he was the father of one sir ralph hagdon no mention whatever was made of his wife though there was no obvious reason for more than a passing surmise the present sir roderick wondered and speculated much over these singular and perhaps sinister omissions his curiosity increased when he found that there was no portrait of sir roderick in the gallery and none of his mysterious unnamed lady there was not even a vacant place between the pictures of sir rodericks father and son to indicate that there ever had been a portrait the new baronet determined to solve the mystery if possible an element of vague but imperative disquietude was now mingled with his curiosity he could not have analyzed his feelings but the life and fate of this unknown ancestor seemed to take on for him a special significance a concern that was incomprehensibly personal and intimate at times he felt that his obsession with this problem was utterly ridiculous and uncalledfor nevertheless he ransacked the manorhouse in the hope of finding some hidden record and he questioned the servants the tenants and the people of the parish to learn if there were any legendry concerning his namesake the manorhouse yielded nothing more to his search and his inquiries met with blank faces and avowals of ignorance no one seemed to have heard of this elusive seventeenth century baronet at last from the family butler james wharton an octogenarian who had served three generations of hagdons sir roderick obtained the clue which he sought wharton who was now on the brink of senility and had grown forgetful and taciturn was seemingly ignorant as the rest but one day after repeated questioning he remembered that he had been told in his youth of a secret closet behind one of the bookshelves in which certain manuscripts and heirlooms had been locked away several hundred years before and which for some unknown reason no hagdon had ever opened since that time here he suggested something might be found that would serve to illumine the dark gap in the family history there was a cunning sardonic gleam in his rheumy eyes as he came forth with this tardy piece of information and sir roderick wondered if the old man were not possessed of more genealogical lore than he was willing to admit all at once he conceived the disquieting idea that perhaps he was on the verge of some abominable discovery on the threshold of things that had been forgotten because they were too dreadful for remembrance however he did not hesitate he was conscious of a veritable compulsion to learn whatever could be learned the bookcase indicated built the halfsenile butler was one which contained most of the volumes of demonism and magic it was now removed and sir roderick went over the uncovered wall inch by inch after much futile fumbling he located mod pressed a hidden spring and the door of the sealed room swung open it was little more than a cupboard though a man could have concealed himself within it in time of need doubtless it had been built primarily for some such purpose from out its narrow gloom the moldiness of dead ages rushed upon sir roderick together with the ghosts of queer exotic perfumes such as might have poured from the burning of unholy censers in satanic rites it was an effluence of mystery and of evil within there were several ponderous brazenbound volumes of mediaeval date a thin manuscript of yellowing parchment and two portraits whose faces had been turned to the wall as if it were unlawful for even the darkness of the sealed door to behold them sir roderick brought the volumes the manuscript and the portraits forth to the light the pictures which he examined first represented a pan and woman who were both in the bloom of life both were attired in seventeenth century costumes and the new sir roderick did not doubt for a moment that they were the mysterious couple concerning whom the family records were so reticent he thrilled with a strange excitement with a feeling of some momentous revelation that he could not wholly comprehend as he looked upon them even at a glance he saw the singular resemblance of the first sir roderick to himself a likeness otherwise unduplicated in the family which tended to an almost antinomian type there were the same falconlike features the same pallor of brow and cheek the same semimorbid luster of eyes the same bloodless lips that seemed to be carven from a marble that had also been chiselled for the long hollow eyelids the majority of the hagdons were broad and sanguine and ruddy but in these two a darker strain had repeated itself across the centuries the main difference was in the expression for the look of the first sir roderick was that of a man who has given himself with a passionate devotion to all things evil and corrupt who has gone down to damnation through some inevitable fatality of his own being sir roderick gazed on the picture with a fascination that was partly horror and partly the stirring of emotions which he could not have named then he turned to the woman and a wild agitation overmastered him before the sullensmiling mouth and the malign oval of the lovely cheeks she too was evil and her beauty was that of lilith she was like some crimsonlipped and honeyscented flower that grows on the brink of hell but sir roderick knew with the terror and fearful rapture of one who longs to fling himself from a precipice that here was the one woman he might have loved if haply he had known her then in a moment of reeling and whirling confusion it seemed to him that he known and loved her though he could not remember when or where the feeling of eery confusion passed and sir roderick began to examine the brassbound volumes they were written in a barbarous decadent latin and dealt mainly with methods and formulas for the evocation of such demons as acheront amaimon asmodi and ashtoreth together with innumerable others sir roderick shuddered at the curious drawings with which they were illuminated but they did not detain him long with a thrill of actual trepidation like one who is about to enter some awful and unhallowed place he took up the manuscript of yellowing parchment it was late afternoon when he began to read and rays of dusty amber were slanting through the low panes of the library windows as he read on he gave no heed to the sinking of the light and the last words were plain as runes of fire when he finished his perusal in the dusk he closed his eyes and could still see them and sir roderick hagdonne was now deemed a moste infamous warlocke and hys ladye elinore a nefandous witche and both were burned at the stake on hagdonne common for their crimes against god and man and their sorcerous deedes and practices were thought so foule a blotte on ye knighthoode of england that no man speaks thereof and no grandam tells the tale to the children at her knee so by god hys mercy the memorie of thys foulnesse shall haply be forgotten for sorely itte were an ill thing that such should be recalled then at the very bottom of the page there was a brief mysterious footnote in a finer hand than the rest there be those amid the thronge who deemed that they saw sir rodericke vanish when the flames leaped high and thys if true is the moste damnable proof of hys compact and hys commerce with the evil one sir roderick sat for a long while in the thickening twilight he was unstrung he was abnormally shaken and distraught by the biographical record he had just read a record that had been written by some unknown hand in a bygone century it was not pleasant for any man to find a tale so dreadful amid the archives of his family history but the fact that the narrative concerned the first sir roderick and his lady elinor was hardly enough to account for all the spiritual turmoil and horror into which he was plunged somehow in a way that was past analysis that was more intimate than his regard for the remote blot on the hagdon name he felt that the thing concerned himself also a terrible nervous perturbation possessed him his very sense of identity was troubled he was adrift in a sea of abominable confusion of disoriented thoughts and capsizing memories in this peculiar state of mind by an automatic impulse he lit the floorlamp beside his chair and began to reread the manuscript almost in the casual manner of a modern tale the story opened with an account of sir rodericks first meeting at the age of twentythree with elinor davenant who was afterward to become his wife this time as he read a peculiar hallucination seized the new baronet it seemed to him that the words of the old writing had begun to waver and change beneath his scrutiny that under the black lines of script on yellowing parchment the picture of an actual place was forming the page expanded the letters grew dim and gigantic they seemed to fade out in midair and the picture behind them was no longer a picture but the very scene of the narrative as if the wording were a necromantic spell the room about him had vanished like the chamber of a dream and he stood in the open sunlight of a windy moor bees were humming around him and the scent of heather was in his nostrils his consciousness was indescribably dual somewhere he knew one part of his brain was still reading the ancient record but the rest of his personality had become identified with that of the first sir roderick hagdon inevitably with no surprize or astonishment he found himself living in a bygone age with the perceptions and memories of an ancestor who was long dead now sir roderick hagdonne being in the flower of hys youth became instantlie enamoured of the beauteous elinore davenant whenas he mette her of an aprile morn on hagdonne heathe sir roderick saw that he was not alone on the moor a woman was coming toward him along the narrow path amid the heather though clad in the conventional gown and bodice of the period she was somehow foreign and exotic to that familiar english landscape she was the woman of the portrait which in a later life as another sir roderick he had found in a sealed room of the manorhouse walking with a languid grace amid the homely blossoms of the heath her beauty was like that of some opulent and sinister lily from saracenic lands he thought that he had never seen any one half so strange and lovely he stood to one side in the stiff growth and bowed before her with a knightly courtesy as she passed she nodded slightly in acknowledgment and gave him an unfathomable smile and an oblique flash of her dark eyes from that time sir roderick was her slave and her devotee he stared after her as she disappeared on the curving slope and felt the mounting of an irresistible flame in his heart and the stirring of hot desires and curiosities he seemed to inhale the spice of a languorous alien perfume with every breath of the homeland air as he walked onward musing with ingenuous rapture on the dark enigmatic beauty of the face he had seen now in that queer necromantic dream sir roderick seemed to live or relive the events of an entire lustrum somewhere in another existence another self was conning briefly the paragraphs which detailed these events but of this he was conscious only at long intervals and then vaguely so complete was his immersion in the progress of the tale that he was untroubled by any prevision of a future known to the sir roderick who sat rereading an old manuscript even as it was written he returned from the moor to hagdon hall with the vision of a fair stranger in his heart he made inquiries concerning her and learned that she was the daughter of sir john davenant who had but recently received his knighthood for diplomatic services and had now taken up his abode on the state near hagdon that went with his title sir roderick was now doubly impelled to call on his new neighbors and his first visit was soon repeated he became an open suitor for the hand of elinor davenant and after a wooing of several months he married her the passionate love with which she had inspired him was only deepened by their life together always her allurement was that of things half understood of momentous revelations eternally half withheld she seemed to love him truly in return but ever her heart and soul were strange to him ever they were mysterious and exotic even as the first sight of her face had been for this mayhap he loved her all the more they were happy together and she bore him one child a son whom they named ralph now in that other life the sir roderick who was reading in the old library came to these words no man knew how it happed but anon there were dreade whispers and foule rumours regarding the ladye elinore and people said that she was a witch and in their time these rumours reached the eare of sir roderick a horror crept upon the happy dream a horror scarce to be comprehended in this modern age there were formless evil wings that came to brood above hagdon hall and the very air was poisoned with malignant murmurs day by day and night by night the baronet was tortured with a vile unholy suspicion of the woman he loved he watched her with a fearful anxiety with eyes that dreaded to discern a new and more ominous meaning in her strange beauty then when he could bear it no longer he taxed her with the infamous things he had heard hoping she would deny them and by virtue of her denial restore fully his former trust and peace of mind to his utter consternation the lady elinor laughed in his face with a soft sirenlike mirth and made open avowal that the charges were true and i trow she added that you love me too well to disown or betray me that for my sake if need be you will become a veritable wizard even as i am a witch and will share with me the infernal sports of the sabbat sir roderick pleaded he cajoled he commanded he threatened but ever she answered him with voluptuous laughter and circean smiles and ever she told him of those delights and privileges which are procurable only through damnation through the perilous aid of demons and succubi till through his exceeding love for her even as she had foretold sir roderick suffered himself to become an initiate in the arts of sorcery and sealed his own pact with the powers of evil that he might in all things be made forever one with her that he loved so dearly it was an age of dark beliefs and of practises that were no less dark and witchcraft and sorcery were rampant throughout the land among all classes but in the lilithlike elinor there was a spirit of soulless depravity beyond that of all others and beneath the seduction of her love the hapless sir roderick fell to depths wherefrom no man could return and made mortgage of his soul and brain and body to satan he learned the varying malefic usages to which a waxen image could be put he memorized the formulas that summon frightful things from their abode in the nethermost night or compel the dead to do the abominable will of necromancers and he was taught the secrets whereof it is unlawful to tell or even hint and came to know the maledictions and invultuations which are lethal to more than the mortal flesh and hagdon hall became the scene of pandemonian revels of rites that were both obscene and blasphemous and the terror and turpitude of hellish things were effluent therefrom on all the countryside and amid her coterie of the damned amid the witches and sorcerers and incubi that fawned upon her the lady elinor exulted openly and sir roderick was her partner in each new enormity or baleful deed and in this atmosphere of noisome things of satanic crime and sacrilege the child ralph was alone innocent being too young to be harmed thereby as yet but anon the scandal of it all was a horror in mens souls that could be endured no longer and the justice of the law which made a felony of witchcraft was called upon by the people of hagdon it was no new thing for members of the nobility to be tried on such a charge before the secular or ecclesiastical courts such cases in which the accusations were often doubtful or prompted by mere malice had sometimes been fought at length but this time the guilt of the defendants was so universally maintained and the reprobation arouse thereby so profound that only the briefest and most perfunctory trial was accorded them they were sentenced to be burnt at the stake the sentence to be carried out on the following day it was a chill dank morning in autumn when sir roderick and lady elinor were borne to the place of execution and were tied to their respective stakes with piles of dry fagots at their feet they were set facing each other so that neither might lose any detail of their mutual agony a crowd was gathered about them thronging the entire common a crowd whose awful silence was unbroken by any outcry or murmur so deep was the terror wrought by this infamous couple that no one dared to execrate or mock them even in the hour of their downfall sir rodericks brain was benumbed by the obloquy and shame and horror of his situation by a realization of the ultimate depths to which he had fallen of the bitter doom that was now imminent he looked at his wife and thought of how she had drawn him down from evil to evil through his surpassing love for her and then he thought of the frightful searing pains that would convulse her soft body and thinking of these he forgot his own fate then in a dim exiguous manner he remembered that somewhere in another century there sat another sir roderick who was reading all this in an old manuscript if he could only break the necromantic spell of the tale and reidentify himself with that other sir roderick he would be saved from the fiery doom that awaited him but if he could not deny the spell he would surely perish even as a falling man who reaches bottom in a dream is said to perish he looked again and met the gaze of the lady elinor she smiled across her bonds and fagots with all the old seduction that had been so fatal to him in the reattained duality of his consciousness it seemed as if she were aware of his intention and had willed to deter him the ache and anguish of a deadly lure was upon him as he closed his eyes and tried very hard to picture the old library and the very sheet of parchment which his other self was now perusing if he could do this the whole diabolical illusion would vanish the process of visualization and sympathetic identification which had been carried to an hallucinative degree would return to that which is normally experienced by the reader of an absorbing tale there was a crackling at his feet for some one had lit the fagots sir roderick opened his eyes a little and saw that the pile at lady elinors feet had likewise been lit threads of smoke were rising from each pile with tiny tongues of flame that grew longer momently he did not lift his eyes to the level of lady elinors face resolutely he closed them again and sought to resummon the written page he was aware of a browing warmth underneath his soles and now with an agonizing flash of pain he felt the licking of the flames about his ankles but somehow by a desperate effort of his will like one who awakens voluntarily from a clutching nightmare he saw before him the written words he was trying to visualize and both were burned at the stake on hagdonne common for their crimes against god and man the words wavered they receded and drew near on a page that was still dim and enormous but the crackling at his feet had ceased the air was no longer dank and chill no longer charged with acrid smoke there was a moment of madly whirling vertigo and confusion and then sir rodericks two selves were reunited and he found that he was sitting in the library chair at hagdon staring with open eyes at the last sentences of the manuscript in his hands he felt as if he had been through some infernal ordeal that had lasted many years and he was still half obsessed by emotions of sorrow and regret and horror that could belong only to a dead progenitor but the whole thing was manifestly a dream albeit terrible and real to a degree that he had never before experienced he must have fallen asleep over the old record but why then if it were only a dream did his ankles still pain him so frightfully as if they had been seared by fire he bent down and examined them beneath the twentieth century hose in which they were attired he found the upwardflaring marks of recent burns
