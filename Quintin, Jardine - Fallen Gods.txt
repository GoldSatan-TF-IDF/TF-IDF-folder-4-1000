the last of a now extinct species of weekly newspaper editor gone to the great case room in the sky he really did write all his copy in green ink with a fountain pen martin fletcher for doing his best to make me better one nobody could remember weather like it in june a sideeffect of el nino the lovely weather woman on bbc breakfast had described the phenomenon on the third morning of the blizzards that swept the scottish mountains a savagely unprecedented sting in the tail of a winter which after seeming for a while to be endless had been interrupted by the wettest spring on record the hardy highlanders had moaned their way through the dark months counting at the same time the money as it flowed into the ski resorts but even they found the summer snows too much to bear on the second day there was a report of a suicide on a remote farm whose tenant had lost more than half of his sheep and then on the fourth day it was over as dramatically as it had begun the clouds disappeared the temperatures rose overnight by as much as eighteen celsius and the snows melted in the course of half a day they poured into the mountain streams which fed into the tributaries which in their turn flowed into the river tay turning it into a sudden raging torrent the people on the north inch of perth knew what was coming many of them had experienced it before and had supposed that it could not happen again even though in their heart of hearts they knew that it could a few piled sandbags in their doorways as high as they could in the vain hope that they would prove an effective dam against the murky rushing water the rest those who had learned the hard lesson moved as much of their furniture and as many of their valuables as they could into the upper floors of their terraced houses and moved out to camp with relatives until the worst was over if they had stayed they would have seen the river rise little by little at first then more swiftly foot by foot until finally it broke out forming a new loch as it swept across the lowlying inch finding the streets and the waiting houses making a mockery of the sandbags as it poured through them finding the lower floors and cellars and filling them to drowning depth some had stayed sitting safe upstairs and even out on their roofs in the blazing sunshine watching the personal disasters unfold and shaking their heads as they did this will never be allowed to happen again the politicians had declared as the north inch householders had cleared away the mud from the last inundation but all too often the attention span of politicians lasts no longer than the next election and so inevitably it had meanwhile three thousand miles to the west two it must have been a hell of a shock for you with your husband just dropping in his tracks like that have you been playing football for long without your helmet sarah grace skinner asked wryly her voice suddenly brittle of course it was a hell of a shock all i could do was scream her mouth set tight for a few seconds bob collapsing at my feet im a damn doctor and all i could do was stand there and scream ron neidholms massive quarterbacks hand enclosed hers hey there he murmured his voice had always struck her as surprisingly gentle in such a big man its contrast with the rest of his physical makeup had always amused her indeed it was that rather than his rugged good looks or the blueness of his eyes which had caused the fluttering in her chest at their first meeting thirteen years earlier dont go taking the guilt on yourself he told her earnestly this is your husband were talking about and at your parents burial into the bargain goddamn right you screamed in your shoes id have done the same thing she glared at him across the small table and then the moment passed and her face creased into a smile oh no you wouldnt she retorted youre a lawyer first youd have checked whether the ground was slippery in case you could sue the funeral company then youd have gone straight home to look out the will he laughed out loud thats what you think of me is it i may have a law degree but ive never practised remember she took her hand from beneath his and reached out to touch his face her fingers tracing its scars gently on his nose and above his left eye then she slipped it inside his opennecked shirt feeling the lump on his collarbone the relic of an old fracture maybe its time you did she whispered maybe it is he admitted with the awkward grin she remembered so well but its just i love football sarah even when i was at college it was my whole life apart from you that is he added quickly it was her turn to laugh i dont think so that damn ball was always more important than me when it came to the crunch pity help the woman who forced you to a choice thats never happened not even with you if you remember when i told you i was going to texas to turn professional you just said fine good luck you didnt give me any argument she leaned forward and looked him in the eye would there have been any point he shook his head no to be honest i was glad when you took it so well i had this idea that id come back from the season whenever it ended and youd be there waiting for me was i ever wrong huh like babs walker said you got bored damn quick her eyes narrowed and her mouth tightened once more yes my dear friend babs devious little bitch that she is i tell you if she wasnt ian walkers wife id have knocked her head clean off her shoulders for what she did i thought it was just going to be the three of us for supper after ians evening church service when i walked in there last night and saw you he grinned again i could tell dont worry when i caught the look on your face i thought oh shit and tried to remember what id done to make you hate me it wasnt you i know that now otherwise i wouldnt have dared suggest we have dinner tonight in that case im glad you understood you never did a thing to make me hate you no it was babs who got under my skin i knew straight away it was all her idea its in her nature shes supposed to be my best friend yet she does things like that shell say shes only looking out for me and i guess she thinks she is but sometimes its her motive i cant stand she hated bob from the start you know id guessed as much he admitted she he was stopped in midsentence by a tap on the shoulder he looked up into the eager face of a middleaged man mr neidholm the intruder burst out he had fine features lank brown hair and wore a formal black suit he was holding a white card and a pen oddly he was wearing white gloves but sarah noticed blotches on his wrists and realised that he suffered from a skin disease im sorry to interrupt you and your companion but im a shameless fan of yours he gushed would you be kind enough to sign this menu for me the big fairhaired foot baller smiled across at sarah apologetically then shrugged his wide shoulders of course he said gimme it here he took the card and the mans mont blanc ballpoint and scrawled a signature thank you so much the man exclaimed youve made my summer he turned to leave then paused may i just say that i desperately hope you play at least one more season will you ron reached up and patted him on the shoulder well see he said in a couple of months ill know for sure that was really nice of you she said as the fan made his way back to his table comes with the territory footballs about guys like him about little men with physical limitations to the point of handicap even more than its about the fat guys with dreams who dress up in the colours and make jackasses of themselves every sunday in the season im always available to someone like him besides he added with a grin if i ever do practise law not that ill need to hell remember it and so will everyone in this restaurant who saw us i dont believe youre that cynical she said i know you mr neidholm you did it because youre nice and for no other reason not everyones as devious as our babs she hesitated you were going to say something about her when that man appeared what was it nothing or something thats probably best left unsaid too late now big boy go on he sighed if you insist i was going to say that she made a point of showing me a photograph of you and a guy she said you had a thing with when you and your husband had marriage problems a while back cow she hissed i told her to get rid of that so that was true yes its true bob and i did break up at one point i came back over here to the states and i did have a relationship with someone but its history and so very definitely is he god she gasped babs really does hate bob doesnt she even now she wont let go forget her he said firmly she was always like that even years ago youre right for a ministers wife shes something of a bitch he picked up the empty bottle of san pellegrino that lay on the table and glanced idly at the label did they ever pin down what happened to him he asked she shuddered his heart stopped just like that makes you think doesnt it there is no superman there is no planet krypton not even the great deputy chief constable bob skinner was invulnerable now lets talk about something else okay but why are you so bitter because hes gone she snapped thats why im bitter im angry with him and im angry with the whole fucking world ron im trying to come to the terms with the fact that my peaceful lovely parents have been robbed and murdered in their peaceful lovely lakeside cabin even now with them both in the ground i can barely make myself believe it i needed bob beside me more than i ever did before and yet hes gone and left me here in goddamned buffalo new york with my three children and the aftermath of all that horror but come on sarah it was hardly his choice tears welled in her eyes yes it was hes gone because of his career his fucking career okay okay okay calm down she took a deep breath and dabbed her eyes briefly with her napkin i will if we talk about something else sure lets do that do you still have much to do to get your parents estate through probate not about that either she said lets talk about you will you play another season like that man asked you ron neidholm sarah graces college lover looked at her across the table in an hotel dining room which seemed suddenly to be empty apart from them honey he said in the soft drawl he had acquired in his texas days i have three superbowl rings and i have been allamerican or probowl quarterback more times than i can even remember that doesnt stop me wanting more glory or more trophy jewellery and the nashville cats are offering me an unbelievable amount of money to throw that damn ball for another season if that guy had asked me a month ago whether id take it id have said too damn right but now im not quite so sure she frowned she had always showed her surprise that way whats making you hesitate all of a sudden you are dr sarah grace skinner you are three paula viareggio looked to her left and saw herself in the big mirror that stretched across the width of the dressing table she saw him too although he was lost somewhere in a dream she slid out from underneath his muscular arm rolled out of the huge sleigh bed and stood up still looking in the mirror she touched herself between her breasts with a fingertip then traced it slowly down to her navel not bad she thought appraising her body in the morning light she did not think of herself as being vain no she was simply proud of her olive skin with its velvet feel of her long supple limbs and of her classic highcheekboned face most of all she was proud of her long cascading hair turned silver from black in her mid twenties helped on its way if truth be told by some judicious colouring by charlie kettles her hairdresser yes not bad for thirtysomething she murmured she heard a muffled grunt behind her as mario mcguire came back to wakefulness where you gone he whispered nowhere she answered come back in here then let me guess she laughed youre going to tell me youre at your best in the mornings something like that he agreed cheerfully as if i didnt know that already she turned towards him facing the bed this cant go on you know he propped himself up on an elbow bloody hell he exclaimed you spend all those years trying to get me into your bed and now youre giving me a hard time over it you know what i mean mario she said heavily this situation cant go on what did you tell your wife this time are you working late in galashiels again i didnt tell her anything things are bad enough between maggie and me without burdening them with unnecessary lies her mouth dropped open for a second or two until she loosed a short sarcastic laugh hah are you going to tell her where youve been then presuming you deign to go home at some point today no im not going to tell her anything and shes not going to ask i promise you that she wont youre kidding yourself maggie will not rock the boat if it was my bloody boat id tip you over the side in fact i think ill do just that she reached out grabbed a corner of the duvet and yanked it away uncovering him go on she said get up get dressed and go on home to your wife and your new family where you belong he smiled up at her if you really mean that i will he rolled out of bed in a single easy movement and headed for the bathroom involuntarily she reached out and caught his wrist before he was halfway there he turned and pulled her towards him enveloping her in his arms pressing her body against his burying his face in her hair no he whispered i didnt think so they moved back to the bed leaving the duvet on the floor listen to me mario said softly stroking her belly with the flat of his right hand a few months ago on any given saturday morning in edinburgh it would have been maggie and me lying like this i loved her no mistake and i wouldnt have looked at another woman i still wouldnt if it werent for you but thats all gone mags has changed and changed for good but why she asked and why so suddenly thats what i dont understand he kissed her on the forehead i dont think i can find the words to tell you no not even you exactly why or how it happened lets just say that all her life shes been fighting this battle with herself about how she relates to men now finally shes lost it he hesitated paulie he asked can i trust you to keep a secret dont be daft you know you can okay he fixed her with his eyes maggie was raped he told her firing the words at her watching her hands go to her mouth in horror waiting as she took it in the man who did it killed himself he went on when she was ready and it was all covered up but thats what her emotional breakdown the one we pretended was flu was about not all but that was a big part of it now in the aftermath even though shes back in control of herself she just cant bear me to touch her she can live with me around the house okay were pleasant to each other we still care for each other but physically our marriage is over paula looked up at him with doubt in her eyes shell get over it in time though wont she no he replied no she wont or at least its very unlikely that she will shes had counselling weve both had counselling and the top guy in the business has told us that in his opinion nothings likely to change but cant she be put on medication he snorted what love potion number nine do you mean no paulie there is no medication that will counter whats wrong with mags shes lost the ability to love and not just to make love either shes withdrawn herself from me arent you even going to try to draw her back turn on the mcguire charm you mean no im not but why not the two of you had so much going for you she frowned i know its a hell of a thing for me to be saying but surely big boy if you really gave it a go yes but thats the point i loved her and i still care for her but i dont love the woman shes become we sleep in separate bedrooms now and one night i heard her locking her door she doesnt need to though ive got no wish to open it but what about the wee boy youre adopting the lad you took in after he was orphaned i thought the idea was that you were going to raise him together he drew in a deep breath we are and until maggie says different we will ill go home this morning and well take rufus out if its as nice a day as yesterday we might take him to the seaside will you be allowed to adopt him though i thought you had to have social workers confirm that you have a stable marriage and all that guff mario hesitated what she asked reading his indecision as he pulled himself up to lean against the high curved headboard of the bed i didnt want to tell you this i didnt want to tell anyone who doesnt have to know but especially not you so promise me again it stays our secret she nodded the thing is he continued we dont need the law to let us adopt rufus hes maggies halfbrother he looked at her as she worked through the implications of what he had told her god she whispered at last god had no hand in it he said grimly magss father may he rot in peace was a real bastard rufuss mother was barely more than a kid but he liked them young liked to hurt them too anyway even if the relationship wasnt there we wouldnt have a problem with the social workers were both detective superintendents of police for fucks sake how could i forget she muttered okay so youve told me thats how things are for you so where does it leave you and me he smiled at her it leaves us cousin as joint trustees of the viareggio family enterprises with compelling business reasons to meet regularly even if i have given a bright young corporate lawyer my power of attorney because of my public position he looked down at her long body and grinned its perfect cover for having it off as well he paused talking about cover you know my mums moving to tuscany pretty soon i was thinking about going out to help her settle into her new place do you fancy coming paula managed to gasp and laugh at the same time are you crazy she exclaimed i may have lusted after your body for most of my adult life mario but the last thing i want is for my auntie christina to find out that ive finally got it the same goes for any other member of our family and maybe for anyone at all if you value your job its a big house that my mothers bought he pointed out and dont forget shes very clever and shes very very shrewd she knows about you and me ill bet even though she hasnt said anything you serious sure im her only son we dont need speech to communicate but whatll she be thinking about it same as me keep it to yourselves which is i suppose the best advice we could have i concede also that going to italy together would be taking it too far from the familys point of view so we wont he paused not that the job is a consideration though she looked surprised once again what is the police force not big enough for you and maggie any more he shook his head no thats not it im not sure that im as committed to it as i need to be not any more at any rate were all still stunned by what happened to bob skinner things just arent what they were without him around yes she agreed that was a shocker what his wife must be feeling to have him collapse just like that in the middle of her parents funeral too right as for me well willie haggerty the assistant chief constable and dan pringle the head of cid may be good guys but put together they dont make one of big bob i just cant get used to the idea of him not being around any more with everything else thats going on in my life the idea of turning it in and running the trust fulltime has its appeal paula drew herself up beside him do you mean that im not sure how would you feel if i did honestly a bit scared the way things are i can handle it when you go home but if we were working together through the day it might be more difficult have you talked to neil about this mcllhenney about us not in so many words but hes nearly as close to me as my mother he knows too not about us you idiot about leaving the force yes he says he feels much the same he was the big fellas executive assistant remember as well as being one of his few real pals but at least he can shut himself away in the special branch office and go home to louise and the kids every night she turned her head and looked him in the eye and you cant can you you poor love all you can do is fit me in whenever the opportunity arises he slid his arm around her shoulders and pulled her down until they were lying side by side once again its a hard old life paulie he said and then he grinned the bright wicked smile she had known for so long and wished for so long to have directed at her all we can do is get on with it he rolled over into her embrace hey he whispered in her ear what i really am at my best in the mornings you know she beamed at him oh i know i know i really do four deputy chief constable andrew martin flexed his heavy shoulders as he walked into the big kitchen feeling the muscles stretch his formal white shirt bob skinner had always disliked wearing his uniform and now that he had attained command rank his closest friend had come to feel the same way however he was still new to the tayside force and understood that he had to be seen in it if for no other reason than that the men under his command would know who he was happily the day promised warmth and he had been able to discard the heavy jacket for the white shirt with shoulderpanels to denote his rank now theres a picture said karen as she turned to look at him you look just like sir james proud in that getup he smiled knowing that it was a copper compliment nobody could wear a uniform like his former chief constable where are you going today his wife asked him she had been up for two hours since the baby had wakened her just after six am demanding her first feed of the day danielle martin was two weeks and two days old and for all that he had had half a year to prepare for her arrival her father was still slightly stunned by her very existence uhh he asked his mind had been on other things are you awake yet she laughed i asked where you were going this morning dundee is it and why on a saturday the football seasons over is it not he blinked sorry love i was just thinking about bob for a second or two karen patted his shoulder as he fed four slices of whole meal bread into the toaster i understand she said quietly it still gets to you i know me too his green eyes flashed as he smiled at her there was a new warmth in them a depth of feeling that had appeared at the moment of danielles birth and had stayed there ever since he nodded towards the infant asleep in her carrycot at least weve got her to take our minds off it he pushed down the lever to start the bread toasting as it happens im not going to dundee no im going down to the north inch the flood waters subsided and its just about dry enough for us to begin the clearup operation in theory its down to the householders but ive detailed fifty officers to help them community policing remember thats part of my remit now karen frowned is there anything that isnt part of your remit his duties were a sore point with her an exdetective sergeant herself she knew how badly her husband had wanted a break from criminal investigation yet during his first month on the tayside force he had come to realise that within the smaller force he had joined there was nothing over which the dcc did not have a level of oversight no he agreed probably not but im enjoying it nonetheless the chief and the senior officers are all firstclass professionals and good to work with and dont tell me you dont like living in perth either i dont know yet whether i do or not she replied fine its prosperous the streets are clean and we have this nice old house up on the hillside but were lucky suppose wed bought that place we looked at in the town centre we might have been flooded out with the rest of those poor sods he laughed but we didnt and we werent so dont damn the whole town because of something that didnt happen anyway it was an absolute freak of nature there were precautions taken after the last time but nobody could have predicted last weeks weather if you didnt believe in global climatic change before believe in it now karen martin frowned so thats what our daughter has to look forward to is it the toaster popped he took out the first slice and began to spread it with honey it wont be that dramatic all the time he replied besides itll be her norm we were brought up during the cold war remember that was ours frightening as it seems now i was at a dinner last month and i met a guy whod flown nuclear bombers he told me that in the world was literally five minutes away from the edge the crews were in their cockpits with sealed envelopes containing the bits of russia they would be expected to find and obliterate you know what else they didnt have enough fuel to get back not that there would have been much to come back to no im glad she hasnt been born into a world like that she hasnt what about september and the aftermath ah but he stopped lets change the subject that wee girl over there represents the start of the finest years of our lives shes a shining light in all the gloom weve had recently lets just focus on the good times and enjoy them thats a deal karen agreed pouring coffee into two mugs we can start with our holiday this summer where are we going to take danielle andy took his two slices of toast and honey and his mug and sat down at the kitchen table well he began broughty ferrys quite nice the baby was still asleep when he left the house fifteen minutes later having agreed with his wifes proposal that they find a rental villa somewhere in france in early september and drive there he climbed into his metallic blue mondeo reversed it carefully out of the driveway and headed into the centre of perth even in the morning traffic it took him less than ten minutes to reach his destination he parked beside a row of five police transport vehicles each one full of officers and stepped out into the morning sunshine he looked out over the flat plain of the north inch the sun of the previous few days had begun to dry it out but it was still muddy and unsightly he dreaded to think what the insides of the houses looked like he glanced around him as he walked towards the terrace that faced the river tay where he knew the worst of the flooding had happened his eye fell on a uniformed inspector in summer dress as was he good morning harry he called out inspector sharp turned and made an involuntary move to attention as he recognised the newcomer he was one of the two senior officers in charge of policing perth and its surrounding area in the larger edinburgh force which martin had just left his opposite number carried a much higher rank hello sir the darkhaired middleaged policeman responded he made to salute but the deputy chief constable waved it away with a smile dont start that for christs sake on my first week in this job i started to get tennis elbow hows it going its not yet sir but then its not quite time as you ordered we contacted all the householders who moved out and told them wed pick them up from their temporary lodgings and get them here for nine he nodded towards two patrol cars that had just drawn up thats them starting to arrive now ive got our boys and girls waiting in the minibuses over there ready to help with the really dirty stuff and with the heavy lifting some of these people have lived here for years and are quite old fine have you got plenty of tools shovels and stuff for shifting mud i guess therell be plenty of it down there therell be all sorts of stuff down there in those cellars sir i was a young constable the last time something like this happened and i was involved in an operation just like this one there was fish rats condoms you name it and this floods been a lot worse he frowned briefly mind you its not quite right to call them cellars with these houses theyre more like basement floors some of them with several rooms their gardens are well below street level and they back on to the houses in the street behind so theyve filled up and the waters come in from there as well as from the front door above how deep has it been martin asked sharp scratched his chin the water was over four feet deep across the inch he replied that means it was above groundfloor level in the houses so it must have been fifteen to eighteen feet inside them anyway bloody hell i understand now what you mean about the mess wed better see for ourselves then go on harry get the show on the road he stood back and watched as inspector sharp went about his business speaking to each of the householders who had been brought to the scene then waving the waiting constables and sergeants some of them smiling no doubt at the prospect of overtime from the transport vehicles they were all wearing overalls and green rubber boots suddenly martin felt gripped by guilt or perhaps it was only the eagerness of a new commander to set an example inspector he called again sharp turned back towards him do you have a spare set of waders and boots my size ten at a pinch or bigger oh yes and a shovel probably sir he shouted bobby he yelled across to a sergeant who seemed to be supervising the helpers see if you can sort out some gear for the dcc the officer nodded and headed off towards the minibuses martin decided that he would be as well to follow to simplify the process the waders and boots that were left in the limited carry space of the vehicles were not unnaturally the dirtiest and scruffiest in the police stockroom fifty officers having had their pick of the rest he grabbed a set that looked as if they would fit him adequately and struggled into them trying not to guess where and why they had last been used when he returned to the terrace he found inspector sharp speaking earnestly to a second group of homeowners who had been brought to the scene there were five of them and from the way they stood together he guessed that they were two couples and one single person an old lady who looked at least seventyfive years old she was whitefaced and her dull grey hair was tied back in a bun from which a few wispy strands had escaped to wave on the morning breeze she was dressed in a long shabby blue coat even on a day that was already fulfilling its promise of warmth but like the other four she had come prepared for her task in that she wore a pair of black anklelength rubber boots over her thick brown stockings she looked apprehensive martin moved towards her almost automatically i was just suggesting to the people sir said sharp as he approached that they might like our officers to go in to their houses first to do what we can to make sure that the stairways are safe before they venture in that seems sensible to me the deputy chief constable agreed he looked round the group is everyone happy with that the male halves of the couples nodded but the old lady pursed her lips and knitted her brow ahll go in ma ain hoose son she said it might not be safe mrs miss she snapped cutting the inspector off short miss bonney wilma bonney ahve been through this before and the last time your lot cleared up for me wi their big feet they broke half my china thatll no happen again ahll be fine goin in there at my age ahve learned to watch my step martin was on the point of suggesting that it might have been the flood that had broken her china when he thought better of it in that case miss bonney he suggested maybe youll let me come in with you just in case some of your furnitures been moved about by the water and has to be shifted she stared at him as if she was weighing up his sincerity or his trustworthiness whatever test she was applying he passed och all right she muttered youll be careful where you put your feet though i promise he smiled at sharp behind her back as he followed wilma bonneys brisk walk across the street he kept close to her for the mud on the roadway was still damp in places and he was afraid that she might slip but she was as surefooted as he was in his clumsy footwear number twelve she announced leading him towards a blue doorway on the far side of a broad flagstone landing just a single step up from the pavement martin looked down and realised that it formed a bridge across a narrow basement yard on to which three barred windows looked the glass in each was broken miss bonney delved deep into her purse and produced a yale key which she used to open the door martin saw that the frame around the keeper of the lock had been repaired and remembered being told by sharp that he had sent carpenters to the scene when the flood had receded sufficiently to secure several houses where the water had smashed its way in oh dear he heard the woman sigh as she looked into her home and he sympathised at once there was a watermark eighteen inches above the floor level the carpet runner in the entry hall lay twisted and filthy embedded in an undercoat of stones mire paper and other detritus ah could dna have expected anything else could ah son no he agreed solemnly i suppose not he stepped into the hall and looked into the living room that opened from it he was both surprised and pleased to see that it was empty of furniture although its fitted carpet whatever colour it had been originally was now almost black ma nephew helped me move my stuff upstairs she said reading his mind or at least as much as he could hes a good boy hed have come wi me this morning but hes at his work what about the basement asked martin he moved what he could but theres some big kitchen furniture and wardrobes and the like that he could dna shift up the stair he moved ma good china the stuff that your lot didna break the last time but all ma usin stuffs still down there and ma washing machine and ma fridge lets go and see it then aright she led him to a steep narrow staircase behind a door at the back of the hall she was about to lead the way down until he stopped her every tread was covered with mud please let me go first i insist she frowned at him but let him go ahead of her he took the stairway slowly as carefully as he could gripping the rails on either side as hard as he could for they too were slippery the walls on either side were sodden and in places the plaster bulged outwards it was only when he got to the foot that he realised she had been following behind him she stepped carefully off the last tread and stood beside him looking around the big room into which they had emerged this is ma kitchen she announced unnecessarily for he could see or at least make out the shapes of a cooker and a tall fridge he glanced down at his feet and saw that he was standing in mud up to his ankles the place was an almost indescribable mess it was strewn with more stones crockery some of it broken he noticed and with tins and packets of food from storage cupboards and from the fridge but it was more than just the mess the place smelled terrible for some reason he remembered a holiday in spain when a truck had come to pump out a blockage in the sewer not far from bob skinners villa he looked at miss bonney she caught his glance and gave him a faint smile there might have been a tear in her eye but then again there might not im very sorry he said sincerely its no your fault son she replied quietly its gods naebody elses but his he heard himself sigh what else is there down here he asked she pointed to her right to a door in the far corner ma laundry rooms through there wi a toilet off it then she nodded to her left through there theres a big bedroom a smaller one and a cupboard ahll just go and see whit theyre like and then ah suppose ahll have to let your folk in after a tae help me clear oot this mud yes he murmured its best he watched her as she squelched across the kitchen towards the door on the far left her boots made a sucking noise with each step she reached the doorway and turned laboriously to step through then without warning as he watched her martin saw her hand fly to her mouth she gave a short gasping cry and stumbled back until she lost her footing and sat down with an audible splash on the muddy riverbed which had invaded her home he did his best to rush over to her but his footwear made haste impossible when he reached her the old lady was trying to push herself up he leaned over her took her gently under the arms and raised her to her feet there now he said hoping to soothe her what happened she neither answered him nor looked at him instead she kept her eyes fixed on the doorway he turned when he saw what held her gaze he almost stumbled himself in the short corridor that led through to the front rooms there lay the body of a man it was on its left side half submerged in the mire looking at it martin knew at once why the smell had been so bad jesus he whispered is that your nephew could he have come back here and been caught in the flood no miss bonney whispered ma nephews a great big lad ahve never seen thon before in ma life the deputy chief constable cursed himself for not having brought a twoway radio then he remembered the cellphone in his trouser pocket he fished inside his waders until he found it his white shirt was unimaginably muddy but he gave it no thought as he dialled the headquarters number this is mr martin he told the switchboard operator as soon as he answered patch me through on the radio to inspector sharp the man obeyed without a word yes sir sharps voice was remarkably clear anything up very much so he answered tersely have we had any missing persons reports in the wake of this flood no sir the inspector replied none at all we had an eye out for them too dont worry well weve missed one hes down here in miss bonneys basement get an ambulance along here will you but tell them no lights and siren i dont want any unnecessary fuss he ended the call and turned back to the old lady can you stand on your own for a bit she gave him a withering look of course in three long strides he stepped over to the door then shuffled his way through until he stood over the body years of experience had taught him to ignore or at least tolerate the smell he crouched down and leaned over to see better it was in a filthy state and there were early signs of decomposition but it was still clearly the corpse of a middleaged man it was clad in what looked like a heavy shirt rough jacket and flannel trousers he glanced along towards the feet and saw socks but no shoes he leaned further across meaning to use the opposite wall to lever himself upright again then paused unusually aware of his contact lenses as his eyes narrowed the body was lying awkwardly and its right arm seemed to have been twisted behind it by the water from this new angle he could see clearly a mark on the wrist it was vivid the kind of groove that could have been left by a ligature bloody hell he murmured then pushed himself to his feet off the wall fumbling for his cellphone once again within a minute he had sharp back on line its on the way sir the inspector reported briskly thats fine now still without causing any fuss i want you to call the head of cid for me get him here with whoevers on duty in the western division office plus a full sceneofcrime team including a medical examiner and do not repeat do not let anyone into this house five busy friday in the borders was it maggie flashed a smile as she asked the question but nothing but indifference showed in her eyes you know what fridays are like detective superintendent rose he answered nothing had been asked directly no lie had been told what about yours my divisions always quiet on a friday all my criminals are out getting drunk she peered at him as he came to stand beside her filling the kettle from the kitchen tap you should keep an electric razor in that office of yours mcguire you need a shave its my new weekend look she sniffed at least you dont need a wash thats a very fetching shower gel youve been using he ignored her jibe wheres rufus he asked she nodded towards the window outside in his den he looked out into the garden and saw that the door of the new summerhouse where the toddler kept his larger toys was open hes happy then i thought we might take him down to north berwick later on if you like his wife muttered as he put the kettle on its stand and switched it on he saw the tension in her jawline mags whats up he asked she turned and stared at him incredulity in her eyes are you serious you come swarming in here at going on eleven on a saturday morning and you ask me whats up mags dont she held up her hands as if to fend him off although he had made no move towards her just dont i know its all my fault i cant be a wife to you any more so how can i expect you to be a husband to me im sorry i shouldnt have got sarky with you things being as they are i suppose i should be grateful that you come home at all ill always come home honey you know that god knows why yes he does because i stood before him and told him i love you whats to love she slapped her abdomen violently theres more to you than that just as well she retorted for i was never very good at it anyway he winced you werent he began but she cut him off dont look at me like that its true that particular part of marriage has always been an effort for me especially since we found out that we couldnt have kids it was difficult enough when there was some point to it i tried for your sake but now i just cant not any more the sound of boiling water reached a crescendo then subsided as the kettle switched itself off okay he said reaching for two mugs ive told you i understand yes and i understand you too here let me do that she brushed him aside and took the mugs from him then spooned coffee granules into each one im sorry for being such a bitch he sighed youre not shop lets talk shop he exclaimed suddenly if you insist she agreed brightly i had a chat with our colleague detective superintendent jay yesterday he and i are thinking about having a joint raid on those saunas your cousin paula owns we have some in each of our divisions he gasped dont you bloody dare he snapped those places are licensed and theyre above reproach her laugh was filled with sarcasm theyre sex shops mario maybe but thats how we control the game in edinburgh and you and greg jay know it paula doesnt take a penny from the women who work there and she makes sure theyre clean and drugfree i know youve told me this before shes really a social worker in her own way he looked at her eyes narrowing youre pulling my chain arent you just a bit he returned her faint smile ive changed my mind you are a bitch anyway shes selling them she is why because i asked her to ah you do find it embarrassing then just a touch but thats not it i dont believe that her ownership of those places is compatible with her position as a trustee of the viareggio businesses that is definitely not a business sector we want to get into or even be associated with by implication her late father thought that too when he was a trustee and she paid no attention to him uncle beppe wasnt thinking about taking the businesses public and you are its an option whose idea is it yours or alexis skinners its alexs but ill take a bit of the credit i asked her to do a report for us on possible ways forward very good she smiled again you know of course that a lot of people are calling you an arsekisser for appointing the bosss daughter to look after your business affairs give me their names he said grimly and ill go and see them one by one or are you one of them no im not she retorted give me credit for knowing you better than that anyway i know how good a lawyer shes become you dont get to be an associate of her firm at her age if youre not she must be costing you though and in travel too with her being based in london its worth it hows she taking what happened to her dad how do you think shes in shock like the rest of us no surprise maggie picked up her coffee walked over to the back door opened it and stepped out into the garden mario slipped off his jacket threw it across the kitchen table and followed hearing them rufus toddled out of his playhouse and waved does alexs firm do family law she asked him as she waved back at her tiny halfbrother he blinked caught by surprise no he replied feeling a sudden lurch in his stomach why do you ask do you want a divorce it was her turn to be taken aback what no dont be daft theres no such thought in my mind for all that ive been bitching you asked me if there was something wrong earlier on when i got tore into you as usual my dear you read me right she reached into the back pocket of her jeans and took out a folded white envelope this came in todays post mario took it from her he looked at it and frowned when he saw that it was addressed to mrs margaret mcguire a name his wife had never adopted he flipped it open and took out the letter inside the heading was the first thing that caught his eye redway chatham solicitors guildford he read aloud what the fucks this he looked at maggie and saw that her earlier tension was back its all in legal language she said and english law at that ill save you the trouble of wading through it ive done that often enough now i understand exactly what it says redway chatham are acting for rufuss greatuncle mr franklin chamberlain of alton hampshire and his wife lydia they are asking us very politely so far to hand him over to them if we refuse they say theyll instruct solicitors up here and counsel if necessary to petition for custody in the scottish court they say that it will be up to me to defend that if i choose and to prove my claim to a blood relationship with rufus if i do itll be for the court to decide between us as potential parents jesus mario exclaimed who is this guy chamberlain do we know what is he his sister rufuss grandmother has a shady background that we do know what if hes from the same school no no bugger that for a game the man is rufuss mothers godfather she told him as well as being her uncle and hes legit very much so ive had him checked out already hes forty years old hes deputy chief executive of a major insurance company and his wife is a county councillor they have two children themselves one only a year older than rufus so what he waved the letter in the air in anger are we poor people are we hell do they think we cant bring him up too bloody right we can who the fuck do they think they are what makes them think the sheriff will find for them or the court of session if it goes that far like i said alexs firm dont handle this sort of stuff but theyll recommend someone the best ill call her now he started for the house but she caught his arm and held him back wait she said softly he looked at her and saw that she was on the edge of tears i cant mario i cant go to court over this if i did id have to prove that my father and his were one and the same man dna would do that beyond doubt but what if chamberlains counsel wouldnt leave it at that what if he asked me questions about our estrangement about why he left and why i never tried to find him even though i was better placed to than most as a police officer and id be under oath i would have to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth can you imagine the press coverage i can and i know that i could not take it im having enough trouble holding myself together as it is if we fought this and if that happened as it would she shook her head slowly from side to side everything would be over my career me everything love if that can of worms gets open theres no telling where theyll burrow he stood there whitefaced where before he had been red with anger knowing that everything she had said was true the chamberlains sound like responsible people she went on they can only be doing this because they care about rufus we have to give him to them marios shoulders slumped and where does that leave us mags what does it leave us it leaves us each other she answered for as long as you want that is he pulled her to him and hugged her but she stiffened in his embrace and he released it at once they stood there awkwardly listening to rufus chattering to his toys in the playhouse they had built for him and then a phone rang the song of a mobile he strained to hear it yours or mine he asked mine she left him and trotted back into the kitchen she returned a minute later her cellphone still in her hand ive got to go theres a fire in the royal scottish academy in princes street and theyre saying its arson maggie looked at her halfbrother who had emerged from his hut and was smiling up at them both you take him to the seaside she told her husband itll probably be the last chance you get six the medical examiner was not best pleased his putting stroke had never been better and he had been looking forward for weeks to the summer meeting at rosemount golf club he looked up at the two men who stood in the doorway of miss bonneys kitchen what can i tell you he exclaimed i can tell you hes bloody dead thats selfevident did you really have to drag me down to this morass to tell you that im sorry doctor duck said detective chief superintendent rod greatorix the tayside head of cid you know its the form in a situation like this it was untypical for the eventempered andy martin to be irked by the doctors attitude but he was the man had moaned from the moment he had come splashing awkwardly down the stairs ive got fifty officers in this street he snapped at him suddenly shovelling all sorts of shit theyre getting paid a hell of a lot less than you so please spare us your troubles the doctor rose to his feet and turned belligerently towards him and just who the hell are you sir he demanded and who do you think youre talking to my shoulderflashes are covered by this sceneofcrime tunic martin replied but if you could see them youd know that im the new deputy chief constable now i dont care frankly whether i get off to a good start with you but youd be well advised to start impressing me i expect the highest standard of professionalism at crime scenes and i will not tolerate anything less from anyone are you questioning my professional competence the man shot back even in the murky cellar martins green eyes seemed to flash dangerously no he said evenly and quietly im telling you to get on with your job dr duck looked at him for a few seconds longer as if he was weighing him up then he squatted down beside the body once again the deputy chief and dcs greatorix backed off and left him to his work is his name really duck martin whispered yes first name howard mmm in that case i can see why he was golfing today rather than shooting gentlemen the doctor called from the corridor ive done as much as i can here it would be helpful if the body could be moved the head of cid looked at martin as if for approval i know i made the call that this is a suspicious death but this is your show rod the dcc assured him answering the unspoken question it was wrong of me to go for the me but he got under my skin i wont interfere again greatorix nodded then spoke quietly to the police photographer whiteclothed like the rest of them okay doc he answered eventually well lift him out for you he moved towards the hall waving to a detective constable to join him careful the doctor warned why the dcs asked warily hes not going to fall apart is he no no not yet at any rate but hes waterlogged and so are his clothes hell be heavy ill help martin volunteered you two take a leg each ill manage his shoulders the detective constable looked at him doubtfully whats up he laughed have you never seen a chief officer lift anything heavier than a pen before ive never seen one offer to do it sir the man replied well you have now ill take the top end you guys take the feet he considered the massive kitchen table which looked as if it had been there since the house was built well plonk him on that the fact that the body was lying on its side in a confined space made their task all the more difficult martin had trouble easing his hands under its trunk but eventually he managed and pulled it clear of the mud it came free with a great sucking sound together the three were able to turn it onto its back and lift it clear of the floor rigor mortis had come and gone so the body was pliable but the trickiness of their footing meant that they had to inch along until finally they were able to lay the burden down on the table face up thank you gentlemen said dr duck i wonder if i could have some water now the detective constable who the dcc had been amused to learn was named martin andrews nodded picked up a bowl from amid the shambles on the floor filled it from the tap in the sink and placed it on the table beside the bodys head the medical examiner thanked him again and took a box of tissues from his case he soaked a handful in the bowl and began to wipe the thick mud from the head and face the police officers watched him work in silence for several minutes until finally he nodded and glanced up at them yes he murmured i thought so he beckoned see here the three moved in their eyes following his pointing finger which drew them to the bodys right temple between the right eye and the top of the right ear the skin was broken and discoloured they focused on it each trying not to look at the rest of the grotesque puffy dead face duck pressed the area firmly his fingers feeling around theres been a severe blow to the head hard enough to cause a fracture id say what i cant say is whether it was sustained before or after the man went into the water theres very little blood but that doesnt mean anything only the pathologist will be able to tell you whether the injury was sustained pre or postmortem its over to him now im afraid take a look at the wrists martin murmured could he have been tied up the examiner frowned but did as he had been asked its possible i suppose he said time of death asked greatorix the me looked distastefully at the victim and sniffed several days ago thats another for the pathologist okay doc fair enough you can head off now give me your statement tomorrow i will dr duck glanced at his watch if im lucky he grumbled i might even find a partner for later in the day they listened as he squelched his way back up the narrow staircase the deputy chief patted the body on the shoulder with a gloved hand inconvenient of you to die he murmured identification said dcs greatorix abruptly andrews dont remove any of his clothing thatll be done at the mortuary but go through his pockets the young man who was in his midtwenties grimaced could that not wait boss he asked it was almost a plea no it cant go on lad just think of the day when youll be able to order people like you to do the really dirty work he turned to martin fancy a breath of air sir do i ever they followed in the doctors footsteps up the steep stair and into miss bonneys hall martin stripped off the allcovering sceneofcrime tunic and threw it on the floor beside the one that the doctor had discarded i wont be going down there again he said he looked down at his white shirt then at his reflection in a mirror that hung on the wall above the level of the flood your wifes going to be pleased when she sees that shirt andy greatorix chuckled what makes you think shes going to see it this ones for the bin he frowned suddenly and savagely i hate it when theyve been in the water rod it doesnt happen very often with homicides thats assuming this is but i had one in edinburgh a year or so back what a fucking mess he was in much worse than that guy its never nice the dcs said his new deputy chief glanced at him privately feeling selfconscious about being higher in rank than such an experienced and clearly capable officer the head of cid was somewhere in his fifties and could have been up to twenty years older than him martin knew that he had been a candidate for his job and guessed that it was only his age that had told against him graham morton the chief constable had made a point of telling him how highly greatorix was rated but he had known that from the grapevine within the superintendents association ive had a few in my time too he continued theyre a bugger to begin with in terms of what you pull out and they can get worse i just hope young martin comes up with a name and address otherwise we could have a problem thats quite a big river over there especially when it floods and without an id we wont have a clue where our guy went in the only thing i can say with any certainty is that he didnt drift upstream christ he neednt necessarily have gone in in our area at all ive got a bad feeling about it already andy i know he was in a state but even at that he looked like a bum he needed a shave and his hair looked as if hed cut it himself and badly at that lets wait for andrews then said the dcs he led the way out of the front door and down on to the pavement there was an ambulance parked nearby its rear doors were open and the crew a man and a woman were sitting inside two cars were parked alongside one belonged to the dcs and the other to the detective constable and his sergeant a woman named joan dunn who was sitting with miss bonney in what she called her sewing room on the upper floor of her home out on the inch he saw a television crew who are they he asked his colleague grampian i think greatorix replied yes i recognise the girl whos talking to harry sharp shes a reporter they cant know what were up to here then not yet theyre probably just filming the clearup and harry wont make her any the wiser but sooner or later shell work out that the ambulance crew arent here for a teabreak do you want to deal with her when she does no like i said this is your show excuse me sirs dc andrews voice came from behind them from the doorway the head of cid waved to him to join them ive been through all his pockets the young officer reported theres not a clue to his identity there was nothing there but three pounds seventyfour in his trouser pocket and this in the inside pocket of his jacket he handed something to greatorix the object was encased in plastic at first andy martin thought it was a driving licence but realised quickly that if it had been it would have borne a name he looked closer and saw that it was a photograph odd the chief superintendent muttered he glanced at it idly for a few seconds then handed it to the deputy chief maybe its him in his younger days martin looked at the plastic packet as he did some control mechanism within him made him stifle the gasp that sprang to his lips and held him straight when he felt like wobbling with its covering the blackandwhite photograph had survived the flood and was clearly recognisable it was that of a young man darkhaired tall and powerfully built but no more he guessed than twentyone or twentytwo years old he was looking solemnly at the camera and he wore a dark suit with broad lapels martin stared at it in silence until he realised that the other two were staring at him the deputy chief constable tucked the likeness into the pocket of his shirt ive been promising you all day that i wont interfere rod he said and i still mean it but i think i can help here with your permission id like to hold on to this for a day or so i dont think this is the man inside but it could help us find out exactly who he is if you can do that sir said the chief superintendent thanks said martin he headed off towards his car ill be in touch he called back over his shoulder as soon as i can seven it takes very little to cause traffic congestion in the centre of edinburgh a major fire alert in the heart of princes street is a recipe for majorleague chaos maggie rose was stuck in it for a while until she called hq and had a motorcycle officer locate her and clear a way for her through the queues she had to concentrate as she followed his lead but still thoughts of rufus and of mario forced their way into her mind she knew that she had no choice but to give the boy up and she knew that her husband realised that also however what he did not know was that even if she could have seen a way to keep him she would probably still have opted to hand him over he was after all her fathers son taking him in had been marios idea not hers and while she had gone along with it it had taken a great effort on her part the truth was she felt nothing for the boy as for mario the core of her feelings for him had not changed she believed that she loved him even if she could no longer force herself to do so physically the act having become completely abhorrent to her she had no illusions about the meaning of his overnight absences at first he had been working late but recently no excuse had been offered and no questions asked her outburst that morning had been a mistake that she regretted already she could guess where he was spending those missing nights and with whom but if that was what it took to keep them together she could handle it she was confident that he was not going to leave her to move in with his cousin and if paula was prepared to feed his appetites on that basis well it was fair enough by her she pushed her musings away as her escort led her into princes street it was closed off from waverley bridge to the west end and two uniformed constables were stationed at the scott monument diverting traffic past jenners and up towards st andrews square her motorcyclist a sergeant spoke to one of them and she was waved through without delay she parked as close to the scene of the incident as she could about one hundred yards away and walked the rest as she approached she counted four fire appliances parked in the roadway outside the pillared entrance to the royal scottish academy with another three drawn up in the paved area to the right at least two dozen firefighters were milling around and beyond them a crowd of spectators were being marshalled by uniformed police as rose looked at the scene she realised to her surprise that no ladders were deployed and no hoses rolled out she frowned and looked for signs of smoke coming from the grey stone building but she saw none she strode past the throng and trotted up the entrance steps there in the open doorway the first person she saw was chief superintendent manny english the uniformed commander of her division wheres the fire she asked him out he replied curtly the staff here fought it successfully with extinguishers all that lot outside are a bit of overkill then said rose perhaps thats true but its better to look overcautious in hindsight than to look negligent she made an effort to keep from smiling within the force english had a reputation for overcaution that bordered on the legendary its your business she said manny yours and the firemasters but what if theres another major incident this afternoon with most of the appliances here and doing nothing and the traffic screwed up good and proper thats a damn good question maggie said a voice from the side she turned to see senior fire officer matt grogan in his white helmet bearing down on her and the divisional commander do you have the gift of second sight he continued weve just had a callout from the exchange district up lothian road theres been a major outbreak in one of the new office blocks up there its just round the corner from the fire station but of course all our bloody appliances are down here arent they i need your people to clear the traffic for us manny and i need them now yes yes ill deploy officers at once english stepped out into princes street shouting orders to a nearby inspector grogan was about to follow him when rose caught his sleeve hold on a second matt she exclaimed what about this incident it was deliberate maggie no doubt about it but my boys have searched the whole place and found no other surprises your man steeles through there hell bring you up to speed on it now i must go from the sound of things weve got a real fire up there unlike this one thanks good luck grogan shouldered his way through the door and broke into a run rose turned and headed up the stairs that led into the main hall of the academy the big room was split into a number of alcoves but she had no trouble locating the scene of the fire a crowd of people one or two in uniform the rest informally dressed stood directly ahead of her all staring into a booth on the left of the gallery she could not see what they were looking at since a wall blocked her view but she could read the shock and distress on their faces maam she turned to see detective inspector stevie steele as he stepped out of an alcove on her right he was tall and goodlooking in his early thirties single and something of a heartthrob she had heard although he tended to keep his private life to himself she knew that he was a former boyfriend of paula viareggio and there had been one other dark rumour about an attraction but rose had always thought that he was too smart to risk that less of the formality stevie she said there are no other ranks around are there no i was in on my own when the shout came in has there been an arrest no it looks as if someone planted an incendiary device on a timer well need backup then ive got technicians on the way were going to need them im expecting a couple of dcs as well to start taking statements why exactly just what is this didnt you see the signs outside no i saw manny english that was enough steele laughed yes i decided to keep well out of his way otherwise i might have found myself on points duty too actually he said what we have here is an exhibition of religious art do you know anything about the subject i wouldnt know a botticelli from a beryl cook she answered truthfully youll find him here the inspector told her but not her youll also find titian and el greco and even dalis cubist christ this is the rsas big summer attraction it pulls together great works from various schools and its scheduled to run all the way into september its being sponsored by the solicitors candela and finch to mark their bicentenary and also the refurbishment of the academy building itself the opening ceremony was just getting under way when the brown stuff hit the fan the people you probably saw outside in the piazza are their guests the problem is that someones torched one of the prize exhibits thats what theyre all staring at over there ive got the academys security staff standing guard over it to make sure no one touches it before arthur dorwards lot get here bloody hell rose exclaimed what is it not the bottiwhatsit i hope no its a work called the holy trinity by a modern chilean artist called isobel vargas its what you would call controversial although some people have gone further and called it blasphemous why so because the blessed trinity are all depicted as female what you mean mother daughter and holy ghostess you got it in three at least thats what it did look like its a bit changed now come and see for yourself he led her over excusing them quietly past the silent onlookers and into the alcove in which the exhibit had been placed it was still hanging there still perfectly lit from above but no longer in the form of the artists vision the gold frame about five feet deep by four feet wide r i rose estimated was largely undamaged although foam from a fire extinguisher still dripped from it in places forming puddles on the floor below but the painting itself had been virtually destroyed it was a mass of blackened hanging threads with a gaping hole in the centre through ill which the scorched wall behind could be seen three of its corners retained colour and shape but even they were badly blistered pretty comprehensive the detective superintendent muttered oh yes steele agreed i havent touched it and neither did the fire boys but grogan said he thought that an incendiary device had been placed behind it in the bottom left corner youll see thats been completely destroyed as i said he thinks well find the remains of a timing device when the technicians look behind it when did it happen i can tell you that a dry cultured voice interrupted rose turned to look up at a tall greyhaired man in a dark business suit with flecks of dandruff about its shoulders and lapels this is mr david candela the senior partner of candela and finch steele explained i thought this was your bicentenary she said to the man he nodded taking her meaning at once it is but theres been a candela in the firm since its foundation were very proud of the family connection its unique in its longevity i believe congratulations said the detective now tell me about the present certainly i was right in the middle of my opening speech standing just there he pointed to a spot in below the botticelli which hung on the far wall when there was a damn great whoosh to my right and the damn thing went up in flames i got quite a shock i can tell you all hell broke loose of course the curator who was standing beside me went into a blue funk and ran off to call a couple of the security johnnies they grabbed fire extinguishers and started to go at the fire it was going like he gave a short braying laugh at an impending joke like blazes i suppose but they got it out eventually by the time they did though it looked like that its a bit of a bugger really were underwriting the insurance costs of this show has your firm upset anyone lately mr candela rose asked my dear lady the man replied affably my firm has been upsetting people for two hundred years now we have developed a style over that time which tends to get right up the noses of the people on the opposite side of disputes in which we become involved kick em bloody hard in the thingamajigs its the only way in litigation and were bloody good at it i can tell you smiling in spite of her dislike of being taken for a dear lady rose nodded towards the wrecked painting can you think of anyone you might have upset enough for them to do that to you mr candela drew himself up seeming to find another couple of inches in height in the process dear lady he began superintendent said maggie affably superintendent then he continued unruffled the people against whom we litigate tend not to be shall i say at that end of the market they went to different schools some of them may be arse holes ill admit but i do not believe that any of them are arsonists go down that road if you choose ill cooperate if only to annoy some of the buggers even more but you wont find your man among them rose sighed im sure youre right mr candela but i cant take that as read its a line of enquiry ill have to follow she turned to steele stevie a word they walked back to the alcove from which they had come in time to see the redhaired inspector arthur dorward the head of the sceneofcrime team slouch glumly into the hall another unhappy copper said rose in greeting its over there we think youll find the remains of a firebomb behind it as usual wed like to know everything about it and wed like to know yesterday if thats not possible later on today will do while youre at that stevie and i will start to go through the basics she pointed up into a corner of the gallery towards a video camera that has to be connected to a tape maybe well get lucky and itll give us a result steele looked at her with something approaching disdain sure maggie sure and maybe god really is a woman wight sarah stood on the porch of the cabin the sun was rising in the sky its light glistening and dancing on the waters of the lake and the day was becoming hot yet she clutched herself as if she was shivering its taken a hell of an effort for you to come here hasnt it ron neidholm murmured from behind her she glanced at him over her shoulder as he leaned against the frame of the open door he was one of the biggest quarterbacks in football history six feet five and two hundred and fortyfive pounds according to the official website and he seemed to fill it oh it has she agreed at first you know i decided that i never wanted to see this place the house where my parents were murdered then gradually i realised that i had to if i was ever going to come to terms with it it was really nice of you to offer to bring me up here i could never have come on my own even with you alongside me it wasnt easy you probably didnt notice but the closer we got along the road the more i was trembling he reached out and touched her shoulder then slipped his fingers through her auburn hair and rubbed her neck gently feeling her tension i noticed all right he said as he moved close behind her she leaned against him her eyes closed as her head fell back against his chest how do you feel now he asked i dont know she whispered i feel that i should cry but i cant at one point i thought id drench the place in gasoline and burn it to the ground in a grand gesture but now that ive seen it i cant do that either its just so beautiful here beautiful and isolated and vulnerable you dont need to remind me feeling a small shudder run through her he slid his arms around her and held her tight im sorry it was stupid of me to say that but then i never did have a way with words she turned in his embrace and looked up at him you didnt need it she said with a smile in her eyes if not on her lips you had other ways i still have honey i still have ill bet you do and plenty of opportunity to use them too ill bet in britain or america you foot ballers are all the same his face took on a mock frown hey im a national figure i cant get up to stuff like that besides when you get past the thirty mark the groupies tend to pass you by more fools them im sure nah they just assume theres a little wife at home thats all most times theyre right too most of my contemporaries have families have you ever been married ron no not even close why not football that cant go on for ever i know what you said the other night about maybe giving up were you serious im always serious sarah especially about you sarah took a deep breath and looked up at him ron things have changed since we had our thing at college apart from everything else i have three kids yeah and great kids they are i hope i can spend a little more time with them when i take you back he glanced around the surrounding woods and out across the water now youve finally seen this place do you think you might keep it for them to enjoy she gave a soft whistle and smiled they might enjoy it but it would be a nightmare for me mark isnt exactly an outdoor boy hes a mathematician and a computer buff and hes happy anywhere with a telephone line but james andrew is action boy personified as soon as i turned my back on him hed be halfway up a tree as for seonaid its early days yet but shes showing signs of turning out the same way no i havent decided what to do with it yet i have been toying with an idea though of giving it or at least making it available to an outfit that works with deprived innercity kids what do you think i think that would be very noble he looked at the heavy logs that formed the walls the structure would make it pretty difficult to spraypaint and theyd probably take their knives away before they brought them up here so you wouldnt have gang symbols carved anywhere cynic she laughed she stepped back from him holding on to his left hand speaking of getting back to buffalo she said as we were how long have we got here when should we be thinking about heading back to the airfield i know youve been flying for a few years now but we dont want to take any chance of doing it after dark your plane isnt that big his face creased into a broad grin you know what the private pilots greatest enemy is fog thats what why you can have what looks like a perfect day just like this yet the temperature can change just a degree or two and great banks of the damn stuff can appear out of nowhere and when they do only the big aircraft can fly without warning he gazed out over the lake then pointed with his free hand hey over there im sure i can see a fog bank cant you she looked out over the shining water no she replied i dont believe i can what the hell he chuckled it was worth a try the stuff is so damned unpredictable after all yes ive heard that and you know what i can be pretty damned unpredictable too she held his hand against her face and kissed it if wed been somewhere else and the moment had been right i might just have seen that fog bank but not here ron not here nine afternoon was turning into evening as martin rang the doorbell and waited he was no longer in uniform but dressed in jeans a white teeshirt and a black bomber jacket that he had owned for years its leather was creased and softened with wear and it was the most comfortable garment he had ever known the day had gone from warm to hot but the air conditioning in his new mondeo was efficient and so he was comfortable despite the seventyfivemile drive rather than the few moments he had expected his wait turned into minutes he rang the bell again frowning finally the heavy front door opened the man who stood there was wearing only shorts and trainers and was glistening with sweat he was taller than martin at around six feet two and looked at least ten years older his face was lined with a deep scar above the nose and his gungrey hair was sticking to his temples and standing up in spikes on top but his body was that of a much younger man wideshouldered narrowwasted with long muscles on his arms and legs and a sixpack that looked rock hard he swung the door open wider and smiled that warm endearing grin that andy knew so well im sorry son he said then stopped listen to me calling you son i should probably call you sir since youre a serving deputy chief constable and theyve got me destined for the scrap heap come on in anyway i was working out in my gym upstairs i thought id have plenty of time before you got here either youve come down that road like a bat out of hell or im slowing up jesus man said martin as he stepped into the house you were out running earlier when i called you on the mobile you shouldnt be going at it this hard bob skinners smile disappeared too fucking right i should he snapped im going to show a few people just how stupid they are you are taking this too personally his friend replied allowing himself to be led into the kitchen theyre just being cautious thats all remember when jimmy had his heart attack it was a while before theyd let him back to work the bigger man sighed as if he was making an effort to be patient listen andy for the umpteenth time i did not have a heart attack i had an incident that turned out to be something called sick sinus syndrome a condition in which your heart rate drops without warning and you pass out they put me on a treadmill in hospital in the states once id recovered with all sorts of monitors attached to me youre supposed to walk steadily on it i ran nearly two miles in the ten minutes of the test the bloody things hereditary my mother had it when she was in middle age and so did my uncle george it passed off with them as they grew older they didnt know what caused it then and they still dont he reached up and touched his chest about four inches above the left nipple if these things had been around then theyd probably have had them fitted as a precaution just as the americans insisted on doing with me martin looked at the area where the pacemaker had been inserted the scar was still fresh but it had begun to fade and had been overgrown already by chest hair the flat lump that he had seen before where the device lay on top of the ribcage had almost disappeared enveloped by renewed muscle i tell you andy skinner insisted i am as fit as i have ever been and probably as a result of this thing fitter than ive been for years i went round gullane one in seventythree yesterday and ive never hit the bloody ball as far doesnt the pacemaker affect you at all no its set to kick in if my pulse rate drops below fiftyfive or if it rises to oneseventyfive even when im running flat out it never gets that high nonetheless said the other man you have to ally a bit of patience to this physical work youre doing rules is rules like they say even for deputy chief constable bob skinner when are you due for your next medical not for another month on the present timetable but im going to do something about that why for fucks sake you havent had a sabbatical in years play bloody golf enjoy yourself go back to sarah in the states stop doing your head in and everyone elses dont mention sarah to me please she actually wants me to chuck the police can you believe that and why the hell should i go to her okay theres legal work to be done tidying up her parents estate but there is such a thing as airmail anything she has to sign could be sent over here and notarised here its a lot of money bob so its her money and how does that affect my career significantly if you choose to look at it that way which i do not skinner opened the big larder fridge in a corner of his kitchen and took out two cans of sevenup he popped them both and handed one to his friend you at least know how i feel about my job he said more quietly sarah seems to have gone native back in buffalo shes moved trish the nanny over there and shes settled herself and the kids comfortably into her parents home shes even sending mark to school over there but she says its temporary doesnt she she says so but i dont think i believe her andy shes turning back into a yank and she wants me and my kids to become yanks too it may be her world over there but it is not mine theres no logic to her anyway her parents died over there tragically and some stuff happened in the aftermath that i cant tell even you about youd have thought she couldnt wait to get back here to our life after all that maybe thats why shes reluctant to come back right now martin suggested maybe she still has some getting over to do and maybe thats why she wants to turn me into a kept man skinner shot back at him dont be daft its not that and you know it whatever you call it you dropped like a stone at her feet and she thought you were dead thats how she put it to me shes a doctor and she thought that it might have turned out to be a freak condition but your heart stopped man for ten to fifteen seconds so she told me of course shes worried about you and she does want you around for all that you say is that so well last time i spoke to her she told me that if i was so devoted to scotland i could and i quote fucking well stay here she told me in a loud voice too when was that last night i called her again at lunchtime and she wasnt even there trish said shes gone off on some sort of trip but she wasnt sure where call her on her mobile shes left it behind shes probably got herself sorted out with a man over there bob skinner glanced at him defensively why not he muttered it wouldnt be the first time all the more reason to go back over there then is it not if thats what youre thinking ah man im not shes just playing me along thats all she thinks im being unreasonable i fucking know that she is he paused to take a swig from his can look ive been obsessive in the past i admit that but this is different i have enemies on the joint police board as you well know councillor agnes maley and her friends have always been afraid of me and they havent gone away jimmy prouds squashed them in the past but he could never get rid of them forget their politics that doesnt have much to do with it there are a couple of them who are friends of or friends of friends of people with whom you and i have had professional dealings in the past thats to say weve banged them up these characters led by agnes have wanted me out for years they tried once before remember without success now theyve plucked up the courage to have another go even as i speak theres a group of them on the manpower subcommittee who are trying to change the rules so that people whove had a range of specified complaints and incidents including the minor heart procedure that ive had must be retired on grounds of ill health theyre saying for example that the chief should have been retired automatically after he had his wobbler its not just about me you see although im the prime target these people want all the power over the police that they can get theyre not an isolated group either that sort of thinking runs pretty high up in the current regime look at these civilian patrols theyve got in some places now fucking crap he paused jimmy prouds fighting it of course but if they bring a positive recommendation to the full committee and put a threeliner on it could go through once im back on duty though theyre stuffed they cant do it retrospectively because id sue them and win and they know it thats why theyve told me i have to have another months recuperation before i have my medical he smiled wickedly so on monday im going to demand a definitive medical now if the force examiners who report to and take their orders from this wee subcommittee try to stick to their timetable ill go to court and interdict them mitchell laidlaw has the petition ready to roll hes acting for me by the way i need the best there is in the circumstances what if you lose i wont mitch never loses but if he breaks his duck this time and you dont succeed will it be the end of your life bob no it wont that is unthinkable pal its not going to happen i wont have my career end just because of a temporary electrical malfunction in my ticker ive got places to go yet as you know that wouldnt scupper your plans though would it if i wasnt a serving officer yes it would martin frowned he was silent for a few seconds as he considered what his friend had said i see he murmured at last bob im sorry ive been so wrapped up in my new job that i didnt realise things were so serious for you i understand now im glad you do there are four people in the world i need to have on my side over this neil mcllhenney you my alex and sarah you make it three for its the one against thats tearing me apart would you like me to call her bob to put your case so to speak skinner smiled gratefully its nice of you to offer son but she has to work it out for herself he drained the can but listen when you said that there was something you wanted to talk to me about i didnt get the impression that it was my bother with the maley tendency on the board no it isnt fine but give me a minute will you im fucking honking i must have a shower or i will start to rot once ive done that well go for a walk on gullane beach and enjoy this fine day and you can tell me what the problem is he left the kitchen on his own andy wandered through to the living area he knew the house well the skinners had built it after their split and reconciliation when they decided to sell both their weekend house and their edinburgh bungalow and bring up their family fulltime in the east lothian village of gullane he looked at the photograph of sarah in its usual spot on the sideboard and began to worry he was slavishly devoted to her remarkably so for she might have become his motherinlaw he had been engaged for a while to alexis bobs daughter from his first marriage the engagement had ended acrimoniously but both he and sarah had made sure that it did not affect their friendship he thought about what bob had said he gave no credence to his suggestion that she might have found someone else but he knew that she was as stubborn as her husband if she had taken up a position she would not give it up easily the living room opened into a big conservatory he wandered through the glass doors and gazed out across gullane bents and over the firth of forth to life he saw three tankers moored in the wide estuary riding high in the water as they waited their turn to take on a cargo of oil at hound point okay then bobs voice snapped him back to the present his hair was still damp from the shower but he was ready to go having changed into light cotton trousers a pale blue polo shirt and timberland sandals they left the house skinner setting the alarm with quick nimble fingers and headed out into the village street one left turn took them down on to the bents down the road that led to the car park thronged as always on a june saturday afternoon wherell we go bob asked then said tides on the way out the nature reserve decision made he led the way half running half walking down the narrow path that led to the sands jumping down from a dune onto the beach he started to head westward then stopped whats up asked andy skinner pointed with his right index finger his friend followed its direction until he saw near the waters edge a big darkhaired man muscular in a shortsleeved shirt and denim cutoffs knocking a brightly coloured ball towards a toddler thats mcguire isnt it skinner muttered yes that must be the kid i heard he and maggie are adopting lets go the other way then marios a good guy but im not in the mood for any more chat about my career prospects without waiting for an answer he turned on his heel and headed off towards the rocks and dunes at the eastward end of the big bay i didnt see maggie there said martin but ive heard the talk how are things with him and detective superintendent rose officially fine but in reality from what neil tells me theyre rocky i didnt press him about it for in truth its none of my business but i think its to do with mario becoming a trustee of the family interests along with his cousin you know his cousin do you paula viareggio stevie steeles ex oh yes i know her all right skinner laughed christ not her too is there a woman in edinburgh you didnt shag when you were single plenty and i didnt know paula in that way i just met her a couple of times shes a deep one she had a way of letting you know right from the off where you stood with her and the answer i got was always no way her and mario is that what theyre saying no theyre cousins remember theyre also italian skinner laughed but mario doesnt run the trust on a daytoday basis hes appointed a lawyer to do most of the work for him so that hes handsoff he only takes decisions on her advice her alex my kids getting on in the world glad to hear it how is she very well and before you ask she isnt behind mcguires problem with maggie either shes still based in london theres an actor bloke in tow i believe but ive still to meet him anyway enough of all that how about you hows karen hows the baby lovely both of them bob i wish i could ask you and sarah to be godparents but i think you have to be catholics dont worry about it im the wrong guy to ask anyway god and i are barely on speaking terms most of the time theres not much point asking sarah and me to do something together either but lets not get into that again tell me about the job how are you liking tayside martin smiled its excellent bob it really is sure compared to ours yours i should say its a pocketsized force but im coming to think of that as an advantage the clearup rates are about as good as they could get for a start graham mortons a first class chief constable and so are all his officers i can say honestly that since ive been there i havent come across a single piece of dead wood no greg jays then none at all he replied then realised he had been tricked into a comment greg isnt all that bad though he added quickly hes a divisional cid commander after all aye but hes past his sellby date for the job hes lost his spark and the new blood like rose and mcguire are showing him up hes still well short of compulsory retirement though and unless he chooses to go that gives me a problem i think ive solved it though willie haggerty was all for giving maggie manny englishs job when he goes next winter but im planning to put greg in there its uniform its a nominal promotion and it needs a good book operator which he is he paused and his face darkened mind you before i can do that i need to get myself back on the job they walked on in silence for a while until they had left the big bay behind passed freshwater haven and come to another beach this one deserted without a soul on its pale golden sands skinner pointed to a path that led off inland we can take that and get back round the edge of muirfield he said or we can go on and have ourselves a real walk andy martin frowned the short route will do me fine he replied firmly but before we go any further in any direction i want to get down to the thing that brought me here do that by all means im intrigued the younger man stopped beside the ruins of an old stone cottage and took a seat on what was left of a wall skinner followed his lead and perched alongside him on his right youll have heard about the flood we had up in perth he began after all that freak snow melted the el nino thing sure i heard i still find time to watch the telly son in that case you can imagine what the place looks like now that the waters gone down a quagmire id guess right this morning we began the clearup operation in the houses that were flooded out i was warned to expect all sorts in there cats dogs fish and frogs sheep and even a few deer i was not warned to expect what we did find i went with an old lady into her basement where she came upon the body of a man shit washed away by the flood aye with a mark on his wrist that could have been left by a rope and a mark on the side of his head that could have been put there before he went in the river there was enough about it for us to be treating it as a suspicious death dramatic you sure he wasnt the old ladys bideyin miss bonney wouldnt know what a bideyin is bob shes sweet seventysix and probably never been kissed lucky for her so what do you want from me if its advice on the flood patterns of the silvery tay i know fuck all about them if its the loan of some people to help with your investigation youd better talk to haggerty rather than me thats a no to the first as for the second were not at that stage yet and when we are itll be my head of cid who does the asking of dan pringle martin reached for the back pocket of his jeans then paused once the photographer and the doc were finished we went through the mans pockets we he grinned fleetingly okay our young dc did there was no wallet no driving licence no old envelope with his name on it finally his hand completed its journey to his pocket only this he said drawing out the monochrome photograph still in its plastic container and handed it over skinner took it from him as he looked at it martin watched him intently he had never seen a reaction remotely like it not from bob skinner at any rate his eyes widened his mouth fell open he seemed to slip for a moment on his stony seat and he gulped his friend sat listening to the gulls as they broke the silence waiting as he stared at the photograph finally he was able to form a long slow whisper oh my god you see said andy thats you as a young man isnt it it was his turn to be astonished as skinner shook his head slowly you can be forgiven for thinking it my friend yes even you but this is not me no this is a photograph of my father your father sure as god made wee green apples he looked to his left into martins green eyes the man in the river how old was he bob hed been down there for a week and more first in water then half buried in mud i dont want his date of birth son roughly how old was he andy frowned and looked out to sea if i have to guess id say he was mid to late fifties skinner stood up rising off the wall in a single movement come on he was heading up the path towards muirfield golf course even as he spoke taken by surprise martin had to break into a trot to catch up do you think you know who he is he asked im coming back up to perth with you his longstriding friend announced fine but do you think you can identify him im bloody certain of it so let me see him first andy and before the pathologist starts to hack him about too after that ill tell you all about him ten rufus was asleep when mario carried him into the house through the kitchen door maggie was waiting there she looked him up and down couldnt you have rubbed some of that sand off at the beach she complained instead of bringing it in here he gave her a broad innocent smile straight from the irish side of his ancestry you should see the car he replied cheerfully dont worry love ill hoover it all up later itll be well into the carpets by then she grumbled go on get him ready for bed and yourself cleaned up ill get the vacuum out has rufus eaten yes we stopped in the burger king at that big w place how about you no thats good ive got a sitter coming at seven unless youve got other things to do that is she snorted almost to herself even if you have i fancy a saturday night out if it comes to it ill go on my own she took him by surprise but he said nothing as he carried rufus off the boy was coming back to a complaining wakefulness as he climbed the stairs come on chum he whispered in his ear lets get tidied up then you can dream about more sand castles and your sister and i can go out to play or eat at least he turned straight into the bathroom stood rufus on the floor and took off his clothes then stripped off his own shirt and shorts and stepped out of his sandals he turned on the shower above the bath and lifted the boy in they stood together under the warm power spray rufus squealing with renewed pleasure for he loved the water as the last of the sand washed off them and swirled away down the drain finished he took his to welling robe from behind the door and put it on then he took a big bath towel and rubbed the child gently dry okay pal he said straight faced bedtime heavyeyed rufus smiled and nodded good boy the child ran through to his bedroom when mario stepped in afterwards he saw him taking his pyjamas from under the pillow where they were always kept as the big detective helped him put them on he felt a lump rise suddenly in his throat this isnt forever wee man he said quietly as much to himself as to rufus youll have to go and live with someone else soon the boys face fell mario hugged him dont worry wee fella youll love it youll have even more toys and other kids to play with too but when you do go youll come back and visit us every so often wont you reassured he smiled and nodded he was asleep seconds after his blond head hit the pillow mario looked at him for a while and then went through to his own room he selected clothes for the evening brown slacks white shirt and a lightly checked daks jacket with brown leather patches at the elbow but before dressing he picked up his mobile which he had retrieved with his wallet and his keys from his shorts and called paula hi she answered warmly knowing from her telephone readout who was calling had a nice day been to the beach en famille no just me and rufus maggie had to work how about you you had a good one he saw her smile in his minds eye the morning was best she replied but the rests been okay i went to the shops and spent lots of nice money here there was something going on in princes street it was blocked a fire he told her in an art exhibition thats where maggie had to go which one the rsa i think oh no i was going to take you there you probably still can i dont know how bad it was what you doing tonight taking my mum to the pictures why do you want to come shed love that anyway i cant mmm paula was silent for a second whats up love she asked eventually youre not having a guilt trip are you no im having none of that its rufus i think were going to lose him oh no she said how why ill tell you when i see you what are you doing on monday evening from the sound of things im having a visitor is that okay of course if youd made it any later youd have been in trouble will you want to eat that too he replied see you then the sitter arrived just as he was slipping on his jacket freshly shaved and with his thick black hair as carefully brushed as he could manage maggie was finishing her own preparations in what had been their bedroom once upon a time and so he went downstairs to let her in she turned out to be a couple pc harold sauce haddock a probationer from maggies division and his girlfriend imelda he wondered about the name the girl looked pure scottish he guessed that either her parents must have had an interest in filipino politics or her mother must have had an interest in collecting shoes they had sat for them before but he still showed them into the living room as his did so his wife appeared behind him in the doorway hi sauce she said brightly he turned to look at her and felt the flutter that came to him occasionally when she caught him off guard her red hair was shining and she was dressed in a sheathlike green dress and a short matching jacket her eyes seemed to shine too as she took his arm you remember how everything works from the last time dont you telly dvd music all that stuff yes maam the young pc nodded holding up a slim carton weve brought a film con air well leave it for you to watch if you like imelda stayed mute she was even more shy than her boyfriend thanks but weve seen it look rufus is asleep upstairs you wont have any trouble with him because hes been at the seaside this afternoon and hes bushed theres drinks in the fridge and sandwiches in cling film on the work surface help yourselves we wont be late but youve got my mobile number if you need us she took marios arm bye she called as she walked him to the door he said nothing just gave an easy smile that he hoped would confirm the appearance of a normal couple he was a shade nervous about maggies choice of a serving copper as a sitter but she liked the lad and trusted him she released his arm as soon as the front door closed behind them where are we going he asked as they climbed into her car which was parked in the road rather than in their driveway ive booked a table in kublai khan she replied i fancy something exotic and i reckoned mongolian was about as way out as we could get thats okay by me he smiled easily to cover the fact that he was lying her cd player came on with the engine as she turned the key in the ignition maggie was a major fan of mary chapin carpenter state of the heart was playing loud a good choice he thought it was more upbeat and less sorrowful than some of her more recent stuff although it did include a track called never had it so good with a lyric that he found rather pointed in their situation fortunately he thought they reached the restaurant just before mary came to quittintime his private worry was eased as soon as they walked into the leith restaurant the big detective had been there before a week earlier with paula it was one of her favourites fortunately the maitre d was indeed masterful if he recognised his guest and mario was aware that he was not someone who was forgotten easily he gave no sign as he greeted them and showed them to their table he selected a bottle of an unusual canadian red from the wine list and a bottle of still water then glanced at the menu your choice he said to maggie so you pick for us both lets just go for the banquet then she said as the wine waiter returned then sat in silence as her husband approved the wine once they were alone again he looked across the table at her the smile had gone and he saw that her underlying tension was working its way back to the surface how was rufus she asked did he enjoy the beach does santa claus have a beard he answered of course he did and have you thought about it about the situation and that letter of course and do you agree with me about what we have to do hes your brother its your decision theres no decision she retorted plaintively ive got no choice his eyes dropped from hers i know he murmured he looked up again do a deal with the chamberlains tell them we wont contest if they give us visiting rights i reckon theyll accept that rather than risk a court action that they could well lose she looked at him gratefully for reasons which he did not grasp entirely ill try good ill speak to alex about finding an appropriate lawyer to act for us there may be no need she said i may have met one she told him about her business at the royal scottish academy and her meeting with david candela his firm has a twohundredyearold letterhead and he has a simple approach to what he does hes a dry old stick and i dont suppose hell act himself but im sure hell take us on im also pretty confident hell get the result you want we want mags he interrupted the result we want of course she agreed quickly but not quite in the right tone you want rid of him dont you you want him to go no mags love be honest she shook her head i just cant mario im sorry ive tried but its too difficult for me if im being really honest when i got that letter this morning i said to myself thank god he may be my brother and he may be just a child but i cant love him its too much to ask he looked away across the room and gave a huge sigh of course it is he exclaimed so firmly that at first she thought he was angry i really am a stupid selfish insensitive bastard i never asked you did i i just told you that this was what we were going to do i never asked myself either how you would feel bringing up your fathers son i am so sorry mags he told her i had it in my head that rufus would be the cord that would tie us together now i look at it through your eyes i agree with you thank god that these people exist and that they appear to care for him as they do his eyes came back to her so where will it leave us when he goes where do you want it to leave us she hesitated then leaned forward ill ask you this straight out just this one time do you want to leave me and go and live with paula no i want to live with you even though i cant bear you to touch me maybe thatll change mario all our married life and before ive been as good an actress as louise mcllhenney used to be maybe in the future every so often i could get drunk enough to let you get your end away but would you want that i dont have to answer that do i i hope not so whats to keep us together i love your soul mags as much as i love your body if you had motor neurone disease or ms or some other crippling thing i wouldnt leave you and i wouldnt force myself on you either so whys this any different he dazzled her with his sudden smile lets give it a name lets say youre suffering from chronic posttraumatic paralysis of the pussy and leave it at that if theres a miracle cure great if not no matter her face stayed straight but she flashed him a quick grin with her eyes do you really mean that i really do what about paula lets take it as read that i know youre sleeping with her and i dont mind i know what a horny bugger you are and in truth id rather you were going to her than to one of her saunas but does she want you to move in with her no what if she did she wont and you can take that as read too paulie is a truly independent girl nobody could live with her and she knows it do you love her i love her body although not as much as yours as for her soul its too like mine for me ever to love he glanced over her shoulder here comes the waiter get ready to order she gave him their simple order the young man wrote nodded and left as he did she took marios hand in hers if only for a second okay she asked okay he replied just try to believe in miracles thats all i ask do that and you never know ill try but i do know well see lets talk shop i heard a radio report about what happened at the rsa you got a result yet she shook her head no we let all the guests back into the building and we took a lot of statements but they all say the same thing the painting just went up in flames whoosh stevie and i looked at the security videos but there wasnt a single lead on them that we could see arthur dorwards got the debris in the lab im waiting for him to report what do you reckon we have christian fundamentalists too from the reproduction of the ruined picture that i saw in the exhibition catalogue thats what i reckon and youre probably right he paused as the first of their dishes was brought to their table here he continued i almost forgot i took rufus to gullane today instead of north berwick and guess who i saw on the beach bob skinner and andy martin thats who they gave me a bodyswerve too thought i didnt notice them but i did they were doing some serious talking i wonder what it was about big bobs predicament probably how was he looking from what i saw at a distance he was looking very fit do you think hell get back or do you think councillor maleys lot have got him this time they see the chance maggie answered what theyre lacking are brains resources and courage hell get back all right im glad you think so i dont know about you but with him gone i find dan pringle becoming more and more unbearable as head of cid then he smiled as if he was anticipating something pleasant here it strikes me that those characters are lacking something else too whats that foresight they cant imagine whats going to happen after he does get back eleven essentially mortuaries are the same in every town every city every first world country bob skinner had been in a few including recently one in the usa where he had identified the bodies of sarahs parents he knew that if there was a qualitative difference it sprang from the thoughtfulness of the staff in the way they prepared what the viewer was going to see and in the way they prepared him to see it the mortuary at perth royal infirmary was one of the better ones there was a private viewing room and the senior attendant took pains to explain to skinner that the body was still subject to postmortem examination and therefore it had not been possible to prepare it cosmetically for inspection what i see is what i get the big policeman said tersely is that what youre trying to tell me the attendant hesitated well he began skinner put aside his loathing of the aftermath of death and smiled making a conscious effort to respond to what he knew was kindly meant its all right i understand and i appreciate it its okay im ready as a matter of fact now that i think about it i realise that ive been expecting a moment like this for years behind him andy martin frowned but said nothing so just wheel him in and let me have a look certainly the attendant nodded and left the room through big double doors rubbertrimmed to cut down the noise of their crashing together a minute or so later the doors swung open seemingly of their own volition at first but pushed by the attendant as he backed through them pulling a trolley with a younger assistant on the other end until that moment bob skinner had not been aware of the whirring of the fan but he noticed it at the same moment that he smelled what was under the white sheet and he was grateful for it will i turn back the sheet now sir the attendant asked no ill do it skinner replied but id appreciate it if you all left me alone for a minute or two whatever you wish the man pointed to a button on the wall just push that bell when youre finished you dont need to wait for us fine the two staff members left by the double doors while martin withdrew through the door at the other end of what was in effect a corridor left alone skinner took a deep breath and composed himself gathering together thoughts and memories that he had buried for years finally he took a deep breath and drew back the sheet that covered the bulky shape on the trolley he had been expecting to see what he did and he had known who the dead man was from the moment andy had shown him the photograph yet it still made him wince and give a small gasp the body had been stripped and washed clean of mud he pulled the sheet back to the waist and looked down at it from the side the skin was pale and flaccid the hair on its head was still thick and grey although it too had been carefully washed and the dampness made it look darker he guessed than it had been in life the arms were folded across the belly and he could see on the left wrist the mark that martin had mentioned the one that had aroused his suspicions he leaned down and peered at it closely then smiled faintly he walked round to the other side of the trolley and looked at the broken skin on the side of the head where are you when i need you doctor sarah he whispered what would you be telling me now he laughed not to touch him for a start but what would you be looking for he pulled the sheet back completely and examined the body carefully there were several bruises on the arms legs and chest he had learned enough about pathology from his wife to know what normally that would mean he checked for lividity patches but found none finally he took another long look at the dead mans face it had changed in the many years since last he had seen it but not beyond recognition not even in death so long he whispered and covered the body once more then he turned pushed the button on the wall and walked out of the viewing room to rejoin his friend well andy asked there are no signs of blood settlement skinner replied he kept moving leading the way out of the mortuary wing and into the hospital itself he wasnt left lying anywhere for any significant time after death that probably means that he died just before he was put in the water or was hit over the head chucked in and left to drown youll need to wait for the pathologist to tell you that did you look at the other wrist when you found him no skinner shook his head and made a tut ting sound youd kick a dc for missing the obvious mr martin he said there was no mark on the right wrist the one on the left goes all the way round so his friend looked at him sheepishly wristwatch he murmured the man was wearing a watch with a leather strap immersion in water made the body swell until eventually it burst exactly if you go back and have another look in the old ladys basement he said then stopped and moved on as for the rest there appear to be superficial marks to the face and hands sustained after death in the water id say and theres significant bruising all over the body all the damage may have been done after death but its also possible that someone gave him a good going over with some sort of a club a claw hammer maybe he strode on briskly until finally they emerged from the infirmary building into the late midsummer evening and stopped in the car park thats all very useful bob said andy ill pass it on to rod greatorix if youve got any idea where the hammer was bought that would be good too skinner grinned command rank has changed you pal clearly youve taken the senior officers sarcasm course maybe so but im still waiting for the thing that no one else can tell me who is or who was that back there in time his friend replied im still digesting it and i really dont want to go into it here now if youre going to keep your promise and introduce me to your new daughter wed better get going or karenll have put her down to sleep for the night he opened the door of his bmw and nodded towards martins car lead on ill follow while perth likes to think of itself as a city even in scottish terms it is no more than a mediumsized town they arrived at the martins house on the hill in a little under ten minutes karen looked skinner up and down as he stepped into the hall the last of the detective sergeants deference had gone from her now she was every inch the deputy chiefs wife youre supposed to be ill she exclaimed unfit for duty you look like youre in training for the olympics i am in a way bob replied with a grin i go for my gold medal next week i hope you make it i will dont you worry be sure you do more people than you can imagine are missing you not for much longer come on wheres this wee lass of yours she led him into the living room where danielle lay in the modern equivalent of a carrycot she was awake and restless aware somewhere that her last feed of the day was due hey you little beauty said skinner may you have your mothers looks and your mothers brains as someone once said he reached into his jacket pocket and took out a small package which he handed to karen teething ring and a dummy he muttered dont fall for that crap about dummies being bad for them theyre not and theyre great for parents essential weve found then he reached into another pocket and produced an envelope thats for her too from us he passed it to andy then dropped into an armchair what is it his friend asked its a bond for three grand itll mature in eighteen years when danielles university age and there should be enough there by then to keep her out of too much debt bob karen exclaimed shush ive done as much and more for my kids and ill do it for yours its all the more appropriate that i do now he grinned just dont have too many thats all thanks bob andy said from all of us but what did you mean by appropriate skinner sighed sit down and ill tell you this sounds serious karen murmured picking up the carrybasket so while you do im going to feed the baby and put her down for the night then ill feed us bob are you staying if im invited ive brought some kit good she left the room carrying her daughter well asked andy sitting in the spare armchair skinner looked his friend in the eye holding his gaze steady remember when once i said to you that you were like the brother i never had martin nodded well that wasnt quite true he paused opened his mouth to speak again only to let out another deeper sigh he sat there staring straight ahead for countless seconds a cd had been playing in the background unnoticed now eddi readers crystal voice singing of perfection seemed to fill the room finally he blinked and went on that man he said that man you met in miss bonneys basement today he was my brother too and then something happened something that at first amazed andy then filled him with a sudden scary panic something that he had never seen before nor ever imagined he would see bob skinner his mighty impregnable friend buried his face in his hands and began to cry his chest and shoulders heaving in great wracking uncontrollable sobs twelve you sure about this the upstairs room was light and airy the window was open and sunshine poured in they had made good time on the flight back from the lakeside cabin it was still afternoon in buffalo new york sarah lifted the light duvet and looked down at him at this moment you are asking me that its pretty obvious that youre sure ah but hes got a mind of his own and no conscience i have both she moved her hands down and took hold of him gently if were clear that for now all im doing is renewing an acquaintance with an old friend then yes im certain and believe me if you look closely enough in the right places youll find visible evidence of that too so shut up dont try and find the way you never had with words not now nuh he grinned then rolled over covering her and letting her guide him in a single movement she cried out as she felt all of his great length slide slowly and rock hard into her then thrust herself upward forcefully as if she wanted even more he felt her squeeze him inside and almost came but he hung on as she did so keeping perfectly still against the clenching and unclenching of her buttocks as she drove at him feeling her fingers digging into his back as her frenzy grew finally her frantic movement slowed and she began to relax she felt the moistness but realised that it was hers he began his own thrusts then short and slow taking his time keeping his weight off her keeping most of himself out of her concentrating on her pleasure point until she began to come again when she did he was ready for her she swung up her strong legs gripping him as he rode all the way back intc her as they climaxed together heaving gasping crying until at last they were both spent afterwards they lay there side by side once more while their breathing softened and their hearts slowed wow she whispered did you rob a sperm bank i thought you were never going to stop nah he chuckled ive just been saving it for a special occasion that sure of yourself uh i wouldnt say that but ever since i saw you at the walkers last weekend and after i heard how things were with you and your husband ive just had a feeling that this was going to happen dont tell me that you havent she touched his face no i wont it was no more than a twitch in my pants at first but after our date alone on monday i knew it too and today after we got back from the cabin i didnt want to i couldnt wait any longer for which i am eternally thankful they lay in silence for a while until eventually a great hand slid up and cupped a heavy breast i wont ask you whether youll go back he said softly but what if he comes for you am i going to have to fight him for you d you reckon no way she answered even if i decided that i wanted to be with you for good i wouldnt let you anywhere near him he grinned of course you wouldnt i forgot that was a damn silly thing to ask him with heart trouble and all not to mention me having ten years and more on him and a great chunk of weight i promise even if he comes at me i wont hurt him sarah propped herself up on an elbow and looked down at him unsmiling you dont get it do you for a start bob doesnt have heart trouble not as you mean it he has an inherited condition which would probably have passed over in time but which has been treated as a precaution by the fitting of a pacemaker physically theres nothing else wrong with him as a matter of fact for his age hes fitter than anyone ive ever seen all else aside hes at least as fit as you no my darling i wont tell bob about you even if i decide that he and i are split for good not for his safety but for yours uhh incredulous he looked at her and then he laughed she put a finger to his lips silencing him ron she said you may be a professional athlete and you may be as big as you are but my husband could take you apart piece by piece hurt pride showed on his face you what you think i cant look after myself i know you can on the football field but this is not a game and bob does not play he is trained and hes trained himself to fight for his life if necessary there was a time a few years ago when he had to against a real killer a monster a man who was far bigger even than you when the cavalry got there the guy was unconscious he didnt come round until he was in edinburgh royal infirmary believe me taking bob on would be a careerending move your only chance would be to hit him on the pacemaker but i dont think youd get near it he raised an eyebrow so by getting into the sack with me youre putting my life at risk she smiled and shook her head no because hes not going to find out the only person who would tell him would be you and i hope ive persuaded you not to be that stupid what about babs walker shes certainly not going to find out she put us back together remember then ill make sure that she and bob never meet again what if he asks you straight out if youve been a good girl that presupposes im going back to him which is far from certain but even if i do he wont bob and i have been married for a while but he doesnt really know anything about my sexual feelings even when we had our first split he accepted that i had my fling to get even for his because thats what i told him it wasnt entirely true maybe about ten per cent but thats all it happened because i met someone who turned me on just as you do lover and have there been others he asked huskily she slapped him lightly on the chest no there have not she smiled do you think im that easy sure between you and me ending and my meeting bob i had relationships i was even engaged briefly in new york ron i enjoy sex its always been a part of my adult life and it always will be i try to be good at it too you succeed i wasnt fishing for that but thank you anyway kind sir no ive always taken the view that if you aint both getting the most from it you might as well both be doing it alone she grinned again i have to say that this is not a unanimous view among men present company and my husband excepted of course my first fiance gorgeous boy though he was was a sad example of horizontal singlemindedness anyway to answer the question i think you asked since ive been married my infidelities have been limited to you and the other guy i mentioned but even if there had been others and ill admit that theres one guy in bobs force with whom i came close he still starts my juices flowing whenever i look at him she paused why is it only married men she asked that society allows to put themselves about why should their infidelities be taken as excusable while a woman is seen as a whore for following the same urges i wanted to have great sex with you ron thats why i called trish tonight and spun her a story and great sex we have had his face seemed to darken so love doesnt come into it he murmured oh dont take it that way it does in your case i loved you in our college days and even now there are things about you that i love i couldnt sleep with you if there werent i really am not like that and bob oh yes i love him dont think otherwise not for a second even though im here with you now he has his imperfections hes been unfaithful too a couple of times hes a driven man and hes got a hell of a temper he has something else though something i cant put into words that transcends all that and its whats tied me to him through everything from the moment i met him he pushed all my buttons at once without even knowing it but now hes putting his career before me and before his family thats something i could never do and thats what im having big trouble dealing with im angry i feel alienated and that in part although i doubt it would have happened with anyone else but you is whats brought me into your bed in your house bob could retire now justifiably and honourably given all the things hes done financially he and i and our children are well fixed for life after my inheritance and even in his own right hes comfortably off i wanted him to quit maybe just maybe without this trouble hes had i might have persuaded him but the fact that hes been told that he may have to retire thats whats made him explode thats why hes gone back to scotland hes gone to confront the people who think they can tell bob skinner what he can and cant do i feel sorry for them they dont know what theyve turned loose what do you mean sarah frowned theres a dark side to him ive told you how tough he is but its more than that if hes under threat or if those close to him are then god help the people who are doing the threatening are you afraid of him no not even if he found out about you and me no but youre afraid for me im afraid hed beat the crap out of you look if the roles were reversed if you and i were married and i was sleeping with bob and you found out wouldnt you react like that i suppose ron conceded standard caveman behaviour well hes better at it than you thats all he grinned then moved a hand towards her and are there things im better at than him he asked sarah looked him in the eye and patted his approach to one side that is an area she said her voice becoming muffled as she slid below the cover then finally as she found what she was seeking inaudible where i never make com pari thirteen andy martin looked into the future and saw a quandary in the fifteen minutes since he had recovered from his breakdown in the armchair skinner had said not another word other than to apologise repeatedly for his weakness but he was a witness he had information crucial to the progress of a murder investigation and he had to be interviewed regardless of his emotional state andy went through to the kitchen and returned with two bottles of rolling rock beer as he returned the fairground attraction cd came to an end and the changer replaced it with a new peter green blues album normally bob would have reacted typically he would have asked him if it was eric clapton on first hearing he thought that all blues guitarists were eric clapton but as he sat there all he did was nod his thanks as he took his uncapped beer he stared at the carpet as the first two tracks on the album played themselves out then as the horns came in upbeat at the start of track three he put the bottle to his lips and took a long draining swallow when he was finished he laid the empty bottle on the occasional table beside his chair and looked across at his friend right he said abruptly now that ive finished making an arse of myself do you want to take my statement yourself or do you want to get a couple of your guys up here a smile of undisguised relief seemed to flood martins face i reckon youre worth the head of cid ill call him now and ask him to come up skinner frowned no wait thats not fair on karen well go to him he reached out a hand here dont you drink that beer give it to me andy grinned and handed it over fine but karens making dinner then tell your guy to have his as well and well see him afterwards man were still in the early hours of the investigation you know how important the first stages are how long was he in the water about a week where did he go in we havent a clue then lets not risk your happiness and my digestion by spoiling karens excellent dinner im not going to be able to lead you straight to whoever it is youre after his forehead creased and his eyes turned hard and cold even if i could i dont know that i would i might be inclined to pay a call on him myself martin felt himself shiver for christs sake bob dont even think that ah but i do son because im human and because its in my nature then suppress it please andy looked at him with pure concern man you shouldnt be handling this alone let me call sarah in the states and tell her whats happened skinner looked at him as if he was a stranger you do that and ill make you eat your silverbraided hat deputy chief well let me call alex then nor her either she doesnt know she ever had an uncle nor sarah a brotherinlaw ill handle this andy i promise you ill behave myself and tell you everything i know but not here or now ill do it in a formal situation because for my own sake i need to make sure i stay dispassionate about it now are we about ready to eat im fucking starving martin smiled and shrugged his shoulders we should be just about there you finish that beer and ill call rod greatorix to set up a meeting he was heading towards the phone in the hall when skinner called him back hey he said pointing towards the cd player with the rolling rock in his hand if i didnt know that was eric clapton id say it was the guy who used to be in fleetwood mac fourteen they were halfway though the mongolian meal when maggies cellphone played its distinctive tune she looked at mario awkwardly apologetically he grinned and shrugged his shoulders could just as easily have been mine he said go on she flipped the phone open pressed the yes button and answered rose sorry maggie said stevie steele i hope it isnt a bad time but you did say to keep you informed i know i did its not a problem are you still at it afraid so i thought youd have had it wrapped up by now at least as far as you could whats up have you been watching more video tapes i have but it was a waste of time said the inspector i went back far enough to watch the picture being hung on the wall it wasnt tampered with at that point and from the tapes we saw earlier on theres no sign of anyone interfering with it after that so it must have been rigged to go before it was delivered to the gallery not necessarily the exhibits came from all over the place the curator waited until he had them all on the premises before he hung them they were kept in a storage area below the main hall it isnt covered by video cameras so in theory the device could have been planted there steele hesitated tell me maggie he went on eventually did anything strike you as wrong about the notion that it was set off by a timer as her husband looked on rose frowned you could ask why it was i suppose and i guess the answer could be either to give the arsonist time to get well clear or to have the painting go up before an audience as a sort of a statement if that was the case he got it right didnt he our fireraiser bang in the middle of old candelas speech true so unless that was pure coincidence whoever set it must have known the timings and running order of the opening ceremony so youd think steele agreed except he stopped in midsentence what except for the fact that there was no timer maggies eyes widened come again the technicians have finished with the picture they found the remains of a device sure enough it had been laid against the frame and conductors had been attached to the back of the canvas to make sure that it went up fast from the centre then the back of the painting had been covered over with heavy brown paper sealed with gaffer tape theres nothing unusual about that and none of the gallery staff thought twice about it the bomb if you want to call it that was primed and hung on the wall ready to be detonated but when it was there was no ticking clock involved it was set off remotely triggered by a radio signal bloody hell from how far away can they tell up to four hundred yards according to tony davidson the telecommunications guy it could have been blown from anywhere in princes street or from the top of the mound even but was it after all it did happen right in the middle of the speech what does that suggest that whoever did it was actually there in the hall exactly light the blue touch paper and withdraw i reckon and just to put the tin lid on it at five this evening the press association had an anonymous call from a guy claiming responsibility for i quote an act of retribution against blasphemy he didnt name any organisation he just said that much and hung up all the pa reporter was able to say was that he sounded like a teuchter the presbyterian militant wing in other words aye or just as likely a nutter who had nothing to do with it the story was on the radio and television bulletins by the time the call was made oh yes and the call came from a phone box like as not a fruitcake then i agree do we have a list of everyone who was there asked rose we have the complete invitation list steele replied it includes clients other lawyers and professionals the lord and lady provost the chief constable and lady proud who declined by the way a couple of supreme court judges and the media we have a list of all the people who were signed in and given lapel badges with their names on them we have a list of all those guests whose badges were not picked up we have a list of all of the staff on duty but we do not have a list of those people guests or otherwise who simply wandered in and past the registration desk without picking up their badges as some people do at these bashes werent there invitation cards yes but they were taken at the reception desk not at the door there were a couple of security people on the steps who were supposed to look at the invitations but theyve admitted already that it was quite possible for someone to have got past them there were full taxiloads of people arriving five ten at a time no way did they check everyone no listen stevie where are you in the office id better get along there then why mags to do what exactly rose frowned the video tapes from the security cameras well need to check every face against those lists looking for someone who isnt on any of them and we should take that phone call seriously this is borderline terrorism so we should get neil mcllhenney and special branch involved we should tell dan pringle as well ive done some of that already mags ive told neil i agree theres a chance well come up with a face thats on his files ill leave it to you to break into the head of cids saturday night but theres something else we have to face up to as well and this is why i think we should sleep on it apart from the fact that im knackered and crosseyed from looking at tapes if we dont find that face in the crowd and its long odds against that we will then what we have on our hands is a gathering of edinburghs great and good their spouses partners and the rest every one of whom is a suspected arsonist maggie rose let out a whistle loud enough to turn heads at the next table you are right she conceded i must have had too much to drink already get on home stevie or off to wherever youre expected ill see you in the office tomorrow nine am sharp weve got a minefield to find our way through here and no mistake fifteen the car park in front of the perth divisional office was busier than might have been expected even on a saturday night a row of lights blazed in an office suite on the first floor cid martin explained we didnt see any point in setting up a mobile enquiry headquarters just round the corner especially since its no more than a suspicious death and highly unlikely that it happened where the body was found so rod greatorix is running the thing from here im impressed said bob skinner youve got an unidentified victim a bum for all they know yet youre still pulling out all the stops youre making your presence felt already andy no im not this is not the homicide capital of scotland but rod knows how to go about setting up an investigation as well as if not better than i do the older man grunted i suppose he does sorry andy that was pure bloody arrogance on my part i know about greatorix he was head of cid here when i had the job in edinburgh hes sound all right ill make all the right noises when i meet him dont worry how much did you tell him by the way only that i had a positive id on the victim and that he should meet me here at ten i didnt see the point in saying anything about you till we got there he saw skinners grim smile in the dashboard light thatll be a nice surprise for him then his friend murmured lets go and see him martin gripped the door handle then hesitated okay but before that will you do something for me as my closest friend maybe what will you phone sarah pass bob please youve got a hold of yourself now but ive never seen you like you were before im worried about you you think im going to keel over again dont worry i wont i know that but it just seems to me that youve got stress coming at you from all angles just now if you talk to sarah and get everything on an even keel with her its got to help skinner gave a small growl in the darkness martin sometimes you are just full of the naivety of youth but if itll keep you happy it will here you can use my phone dont be daft ive got my own now step outside will you so far tonight youve seen me cry like a baby i dont want you to see me crawl as well andy laughed as he stepped out of the mondeo and closed the door behind him inside the car skinner took out his cellphone and scrolled through the phonebook until he found the number of the buffalo house he pressed the green button and waited the call was answered on the third ring by a scots voice that of trish the nanny im sorry bob she said sarah isnt back from her trip yet she called me to say not to expect her until later on do you know where she is no she said it was to do with the estate thats all okay thanks he closed the line and was about to put the phone back in his pocket when he saw andy standing expectantly in the car park shit he muttered and scrolled through the stored numbers once more until he found sarahs cellphone and dialled it three thousand miles away sarah swung her legs out of ron neidholms bed and picked up her nokia she looked at the incoming number and for a second her thumb hovered over the red offswitch until with a sigh she took the call yes bob she said loud enough for ron to hear her and firmly enough for him to know to keep quiet where are you her husband asked whats this trip trish told me about ive been to the cabin what you told me you never wanted to see it i know but i changed my mind i felt that i had to visit it are you still there no she said truthfully im on my way back she lied how did you get there she thought quickly at the same time picking her shirt from the floor with her free hand and covering her lap with it in an automatic gesture as if he had found them and was standing in the doorway one of the lawyers took me she said in a private plane then in a hire car now why the interrogation im sorry bob replied at once you took me by surprise thats all so were both good at that now what is it need it be anything cant i just be calling you if youre calling to say youre catching the first flight over yes you can if not then what i said yesterday still counts sarah i cant do that okay have your damn medical next week once youre cleared for duty take some family time and come across i cant do that either love somethings come up apart from the job what have you had another incident for the first time she sounded anxious no im fine is it alex is something wrong with her or andy or his baby no none of that im in perth now wee danielles magic really and karens doing great no its something else a personal thing a long involved story that i should have told you a long time ago i cant now though not over the phone sarah i really would like it if youd come home just for a week or so even i need your support hah her laugh was harsh and brittle those words sound familiar last time they were used between us i was saying them to you i needed you bob to help me cope with my parents death to be there when i went through my mothers belongings to help me with questions about the estate and to advise me about things in which youve got much more experience than i have i needed your support then and i begged you for it and what did you do you caught the first fucking plane out of here thats what you did well that is exactly what im not going to do somethings come up for me too and im staying right here she could almost hear him struggle to keep his voice even sarah i need you with me so youll just have to do what i did and tough it out maybe then youll find out what i did all of a sudden i dont fucking need you for anything she jumped up ripped the battery from her cellphone and threw the separate pieces tangled in her shirt across ron neidholms bedroom when she turned back towards him he was there by her side to wrap her in his arms as she exploded into tears back in perth bob skinner stared at his dead phone his face twisted with anger he realised that he was breathing hard and forced himself to bring it back to normal when he was back in control he closed his eyes what do you want man he asked himself aloud maybe shes right maybe you did let her down maybe were both right what the fuck someones got to give so lets just do what she says have the medical see maleys lot off then go over there like she wants he found sarahs number again and called it but it came up unobtainable playing that game eh he muttered his anger flaring once again you can bloody well stay in the states then but not with my kids he shoved the phone roughly back into his pocket and stepped out of the car andy martin looked at him hopefully bad idea andy skinner snapped do you want me to talk to her like i said earlier dont you fucking dare now lets see your colleagues he strode off ahead of his friend towards the police building dcs rod greatorix was standing in the entrance hallway beside the public reception desk a bewildered look spread across his great gruff face as skinner burst through the entrance door he looked at the newcomer and then at martin behind him andy he began lets go somewhere private rod his deputy chief replied by all means through here he led them up a flight of stairs then along a corridor to a small office glasspanelled like the rest of the suite several detectives were working in other rooms one or two glanced at them briefly as they passed would anybody like coffee or tea or something stronger the head of cid asked as the others took seats facing the small desk that was the rooms only furniture im fine thanks said skinner curtly martin shook his head i didnt want to get into this over the phone rod he began and neither did bob whom you know of course of course i do greatorix nodded and smiled its been a year or two sir that course at tulliallan wasnt it that was the last time we met yup we were both lecturing as i recall a distinguished class one of our students is a chief constable now and anothers in the police inspectorate im not here to lecture now though then what is it im here to help you with your enquiries greatorix gave him a look of pure incredulity then he leaned back in his chair and smiled is that right are you going to tell me that it was you who banged that bloke on the head and chucked him in the tay skinner looked him in the eye unsmiling there was a time rod when i wanted to do just that but its long gone no im just going to tell you who he is youd better tape it for the record the tay side detective had switched into serious mode just a minute then he said ill find a recorder from somewhere will we need a second officer present andys the second officer of course greatorix left the room skinner turned to martin ive never told you much about my father have i his friend shook his head no but i dont suppose ive ever told you much about mine ive met your father for christs sake but no its true i havent im not a demonstrative guy andy quicktempered yes but on a personal level im not good at discussing my feelings thats why in my past ive been able to bury things so deep maybe thats why sarah and i are in trouble now im not the sort of person who can just laugh and kiss it off and she isnt either there were all sorts of things i never knew about leo and susannah grace until after id seen them stretched out on mortuary tables and when i think about it there are all sorts of things i dont know about sarah herself when i went to buffalo for the first time without her and met her friends it was like they were talking about someone i hadnt met and now shes back over there with her own agenda its as if the part of her i dont know has come to the surface and taken over she went on about needing me but i cant see for what none of us ever think of ourselves as bad communicators until we realise how little we know ourselves he caught martins eye how about you and karen do you talk to each other about each other andy laughed softly bob before karen and i got together each of us lived our private lives so openly that there was hardly anything about either of us that was news to the other but yes we do we share things i hardly go to church any more but karens my confessional and im hers i wouldnt like to think that id any secrets from her thats good sarah and i should learn from you but then again she may have secrets that i wouldnt want to know about and i dont know if i could bring myself to tell her all of mine thats for you both to judge but at the very least talking about the problem has to help anyway you started to talk about your father what was he like william reid skinner he was a hell of a man all of my life ive tried to live up to him and all of my life ive fallen short most of us think of our fathers that way bob maybe but thats how mine was he was a lawyer like sarahs dad and as successful in his own way by scottish standards he was a quiet man very dignified and very controlled you couldnt make him lose his temper even if you tried he never raised a hand to me in my childhood indeed i dont remember him ever raising his voice i asked him once how he could be like that he told me that he left that part of himself in the war when i asked him what he did he looked away from me and he said i killed people robert when i asked him where he fought he wouldnt tell me at first but i pressed him eventually he said that hed been in france in and later in yugoslavia and greece you know what that meant he frowned when i got involved with mi and such i asked our friend adam arrow in the ministry of defence to find out if there was a file on him anywhere there is its among a batch that are still sealed but adam told me roughly what was in it dyou know he won the george fucking cross andy but he never told me he must have thrown it away because there was no sign of it among his effects after he died nor any reference to it you know what adams like and some of the things hes done well when he told me about my father man there was respect in his voice bordering on the door opened interrupting him sorry to have taken so long said rod greatorix come monday morning the buggers in this office are going to get a message about keeping a stock of tapes at all times he laid a big black twindeck tape recorder on the desk and stretched its lead across to a plug in the wall finally he stripped the clear wrapping from two tapes and inserted them into the waiting slots okay he announced were ready to go ahead i am detective chief superintendent roderick greatorix tayside police also present is deputy chief constable andrew martin of this force and deputy chief constable robert skinner from edinburgh mr skinner is here to volunteer evidence of he stopped in midsentence and glanced at martin identification thanks of identification in respect of the current murder enquiry mr skinner thank you chief superintendent i have to tell you that i have seen the body that was found today in myrtle terrace perth and can identify it as that of michael niven skinner aged fiftysix years greatorix stared at him in surprise what was your relationship to the dead man he asked at last remembering that he was taking a formal statement he was my older brother what do you know of his whereabouts in the period leading up to his death nothing when did you last see him approximately thirty years ago but you are certain of your identification absolutely do you know of any associates he may have had in the period prior to his death no i have had no contact with my brother throughout my adult life was he married not that i know of a gro check will tell you for sure what happened to alienate you for so long i tried to kill him andy martin reached across and switched off the recorder for christs sake bob he exclaimed its true skinner retorted ive lived with it ever since now switch that thing back on martin restarted the recorder interview temporarily interrupted he said but now restarted same three people present thank you as i was saying the last time i saw michael there was a violent dispute between us i was sixteen years old and at home i heard my brother shouting at the top of his voice screaming obscenities i found him in the kitchen and i also found my mother her nose was bleeding michael had demanded money from her and when shie had refused him he had punched her and tried to take it from her purse i wasnt fullgrown but i was a big lad nonetheless i went straight for him as ive said there was about ten years between us in age and my brother had been taught how to look after himself in the army but he wasnt in the best of shape not any more i remember he threw a couple of punches at me but i just walked straight through them and nut ted him he didnt shift off his feet though so i hit him i remember it clear as day straight fingers in the gut and a punch to the left temple that almost broke one of my knuckles he went down then all right he was spark out and i wanted him to stay that way my brother had thumped abused and threatened me for much of my young life but he had run out of time i had outgrown him still i knew what he was capable of if i gave him half a chance so i grabbed him by the tie as he lay there and i hit him again and again and again i reckon id have finished him if it hadnt been for my father he was a very strong man and big as i was he got behind me put a full nelson on me and lifted me clean off michael i struggled for a while but i couldnt move he could have broken my neck with that hold if hed liked eventually when he thought id calmed down he let me go but the thing was id never lost it id known what i was doing all the time the bastard had hit my mother and i was going to kill him at the time i was angry with my father because he didnt react just like i had but later i came to realise that he couldnt let himself feel that way i thought i was a hard boy then but i found out later that i was nothing compared to what he had been i was still ready to do for michael though and my father knew it so he called the police as well as a doctor michael was taken to law hospital he was still unconscious when he left the house but i heard that he came round in the ambulance they kept him in for a couple of days and then he was charged with assaulting my mother my father got one of his partners to represent him it was carved up between him and the fiscal that michael would plead guilty and be remanded for psychiatric reports they showed that he was legally sane but had a serious personality disorder he was also a chronic alcoholic the sheriff read the reports and put him on probation on condition that he enter a psychiatric hospital as a voluntary patient he was in there for six months i dont know what they did to him but im told that it calmed him they couldnt keep him off the drink though i dont think they even tried since that kept him on an even keel too my father found him somewhere to stay a hostel in gourock well away from the family home and well away from me the only order he ever gave me in my life was never to see my brother again he told me that he was afraid for both of us of what might happen if i did michael was looked after financially to a modest extent he was unemployable so my father set up a trust fund for him to keep a roof over his head to feed and clothe him and to keep him in a certain amount of drink enough but not enough to let him drink himself to death and that is how my brother lived out his life for the last thirty years until he fell in the tay and drowned or just maybe until someone hit him over the head and chucked him in the river to die its ironic isnt it that the last two times i saw my brother he was laid out on a stretcher bob skinner looked at martin and greatorix then nodded at the tape recorder you can switch that fucking thing off now he said neither of the other men moved so he reached across himself and pressed the twin stop buttons the head of cid took the tapes from their slots ill go and brief the team he murmured and left the room the silence he left behind was unbroken for around half a minute why did he turn out that way bob martin asked eventually as i said earlier son he was a flawed personality he was weak and he was jealous ive only ever tried to live up to my father but i think that michael had to outdo him mum and dad wanted him to go to university he was bright hed have made it no problem but he insisted on joining the army straight from school i dont know if any strings were pulled but he got into sandhurst he got his commission in the royal engineers when he was twenty he served in germany at first without incident but then he was posted to honduras in support of some counterterrorist operation out there and the trouble began he was drinking pretty heavily by then he had done since he was about sixteen in fact he used to keep a stash of booze in a cupboard in his bedroom i found it one day and he walloped me i was seven at the time but he slapped me crosseyed and broke one of my fingers he did what martin exclaimed you heard he took it and snapped it just like that and he told me that if i didnt keep my mouth shut about it and about his bevvy hed break the fucking lot i believed him i told my mum id slammed it in a door bloody hell it was the first of many he used to beat me up regularly id just take it and keep it all to myself waiting for the day when michael went to the army i started karate classes and i did a bit of boxing too until i gave that up what made you chuck it i hurt a kid one day i was fifteen for a minute i imagined the boy was michael and i just hit him too hard i detached the retina of his right eye that was enough for me i was a boxer not a manhunter i wanted to be ali not marciano there was only one guy i really wanted to damage the fact is if the thing with my mother hadnt happened id have done him anyway probably with no one around to stop me skinner paused anyway back to the army thing like i said he was in honduras a section commander or something his co carpeted him for being unfit for duty once he was given a reprimand a stiff warning with a threat of demotion but from what i gather that just made him sneakier finally there was an incident on a jungle patrol the platoon michael was with was attacked by insurgents there was a firefight and the guerrillas got wasted but two of our guys were killed the trouble was that when they dug the bullets out of them they were found to have come from michaels gun jesus was he charged no no no that would have caused a scandal and it wouldnt have done no they gave the dead boys medals and buried them with full military honours and they gave lieutenant skinner an immediate discharge did your father know asked andy it was my father who told me about it years afterwards one of his old service buddies was in the advocate generals office he called him and tipped him off on the quiet when michael turned up back in mother well he spun everyone a tale about being invalided out but it didnt wash he had no pension for a start no discharge money and what little he had saved went on drink damn quick he was twentyfour when he came home within six months he was the town drunk he broke my mothers heart long before he broke her nose at first my father tried to keep him in check by refusing him money but he just stole stuff from the house the bastard even stole from me so against that history will you tell me andy now that hes dead after thirty years of being cut out of my life at my fathers behest at first but eventually of my own choosing why do i feel so fucking guilty about him and why do i want so badly to avenge his death if it wasnt accidental when back then i wanted to kill him myself because hes your brother i guess its only natural but i never thought of him as a brother only as a thug about the house no i feel guilty because im grateful we did have the same mother same father and we both swam out of the same gene pool yet it was michael niven skinner got the bad seed and robert morgan skinner who grew into the straight arrow and it was a pure fucking accident it could as easily have been the other way round my father never stopped loving him you know i think what he had to do hastened his death but i found no forgiveness i let him rot away in gourock when i could have reached out to him and i did worse than that i kept his existence a secret from his niece and later from his sisterinlaw your first wife must have known about him though she was around then wasnt she sure myra did but she was warned never to mention his name in our house anyway she died before alex was old enough to understand even if she had let anything slip to her about him skinner knitted his forehead until his eyebrows came together i may not have killed him physically andy but i did in every other way whatever there had been between us he was my only brother yet i let him live like a dog and die like one ah man the secrets that we keep sixteen sarah grace skinner looked out of the window as she buttoned her shirt her hair was still damp from the shower and stuck to the collar but she ignored the small inconvenience she was still brooding over the fury of her argument with her husband she and ron had gone back to bed afterwards but the mood had been more than broken it had been shattered like a smashed windscreen so while he had gone downstairs to dig out his rarely used coffee percolator she had set about dressing and restoring herself to a state in which she could face trish and mark if he was still up and about she looked out over ron neidholms front lawn the sounds of the street drifted through the open window a car drove by sedately the kid across the way kicked a soccer ball against his parents garage door the deep voice of celeste polanski sounded from next door as she bellowed the latest in a lifetime of instructions to her meek husband mort the polanskis had lived there for even longer than the neidholms celeste missed nothing ron had always called her the sheriff of sullivan street the house was modest for a sporting icon much smaller than the mansion she had inherited from her parents but then ron was a modest guy also she knew that it was not his only home he had shown her a photograph of his farm in tennessee where he had spent the last seven years of his football career and of his condominium in maui where he passed much of his vacation time and in which he had installed his mother ron and his younger brother jake had been raised in a singleparent household after their fathers departure with a travelling saleslady from tulsa a year after jakes birth crystal neidholm had devoted her life after that to raising her boys and to her job as a teacher in the local elementary school she smiled up from a photograph on the dressing table alongside a more serious study of jake in air force uniform sarah winced as she looked at the younger neidholm she and he had been classmates in high school and had even had a few tentative feelyfumbling dates but jakes overwhelming focus had been on his worship of his older brother and on the real love of his life aeroplanes he had gone straight from school to the us air force and had won himself a pilots seat in a fighter squadron his career and his life had come to a blazing end five years earlier when a prototype bomber had gone out of control over the new mexican desert during a test flight ron had been no more than a name to her until her college days she had seen him around but jake had never introduced them and being in different grades in a large school their paths had never crossed it had taken ian walker to bring them together at a party in his apartment towards the end of sarahs freshman year and after she and ian had moved on from each other the attraction was instant and it had taken no more than a couple of hours for it to translate to action they were at different colleges since ron was a law major and she was in med school but that was no barrier to their relationship which had all the intensity and vigour of youth she had taken him home at an early stage and in turn she had met crystal all round assumptions had been made and then the moment of choice had come rons graduation and with it the prospect of a pro football career under a selection system that would have been illegal in europe and in most other first world countries he had been a firstround draft pick of the seattle seahawks who had traded him at once to dallas the process had come as a bombshell to sarah who innocently had believed that he would be able simply to sign up with his home town team the bills she had been two years short of graduation when it had happened he had asked her to switch colleges and come with him and she had countered by suggesting that he have himself traded again to a new york team or forget football and practise law she had given him no outright ultimatum but when he left she had made a choice nonetheless she would not be anyones camp follower when he returned in triumph at the end of his first pro season she had told him that she was too involved with her studies to become involved in anything else although in truth she had had two relationships over the winter one of which was still active a year after that she had graduated herself and had moved to new york city as an intern and to begin postgraduate study in forensic pathology she had followed rons career with more than a touch of pride but as her own life had developed professionally and personally she had felt no longing for him nor after her marriage had she ever felt the need or the inclination to discuss him with her husband over the years she had come to see him as no more than the prize name on her sexual cv not imagining that they would ever meet again especially when her mother had told her that crystal had left buffalo for hawaii and then barbara walker her dear devious friend babs had thrown them back together in the very moment of sarahs vulnerability she had known damn well what would happen and as usual she had been right for sure an interrogation would follow unconsciously sarahs mouth tightened as she thought about it how you doing ron called upstairs she slipped her feet into her shoes and walked to the door just about there she replied crystal didnt leave a hair drier here did she not that i know of sorry thats okay i guess its still warm outside itll be dry by the time i get home she picked up her bag and her reassembled but inactive cellphone checked that she had left nothing else behind and walked downstairs feeling a tenderness as she moved that took her back to her college days people had often wondered how a quarterback had come to be nicknamed rhino the percolator had run its cycle as she walked into the kitchen she sniffed brazilian colombian ill take that black no with a little milk he chuckled youve been in england too long scotland as my older son would be quick to tell you sorry mark scotland then maybe i have he handed her a mug from what i heard upstairs you aint going back though dont make assumptions she snapped hey i wasnt but you sure put the shoe leather to old bob there you didnt leave much room for doubt maybe not but there are other things to think of my career for a start what career are you kidding my medical career thats what im a practising consultant pathologist with a reputation as one of the best in the business i have a personal investment in scotland thats quite distinct from my marriage yeah he said quietly but they do pathology in the states dont they and a hell of a lot more of it id guess but why should i come back to the states he bowed his head and looked at her from under his heavy eyebrows are you asking me something here ron she challenged maybe i am arent you a couple of assumptions ahead of yourself am i after this afternoon she sighed loudly ron we just made love that was all i was horny so were you i wanted you you wanted me so we had each other but that doesnt wipe out the last dozen years of my life thats in the past not in mine it isnt its a current issue she stared at him ron why did you come back to buffalo to attend your parents funeral sarah was taken by surprise you did yes i was there among the crowd it was hardly surprising that you didnt see me given what happened how did you find out about it i read about it in a newspaper in maui but babs walker called to tell me too ah she murmured and what made you decide to stick around afterwards he shrugged his shoulders after what happened with bob i just thought you might need support you just thought he took a sip of coffee yeah babs suggested it and when she did i agreed good old babs ron do you think we might have been manipulated just a little eh he gasped in surprise how can that be she laughed for such a smart guy you can be so innocent are you trying to say babs set us up to get back together im saying that shes playing games with us and that so far things have gone in line with her plan why the hell would she do that ive told you why she detests bob shes had a down on him since our first separation but it goes deeper than that he terrifies her because of everything he is and isnt babs was brought up to believe in the allamerican hero when we were kids you and i were the ideal couple in the world as she sees it bob on the other hand is as far from the probowl as you can get hes from another planet as far as shes concerned he shares our values but he plays by a completely different set of rules on top of all that he has this charisma lets call it it can radiate from him and to babs it expresses itself as pure danger and what is it to you ron asked quietly excitement theres something about him thats thrilled me from the moment i met him i could say the same about you with you its sheer sexual attraction allied to your sheer unadulterated niceness with him its everything so why because she said cutting him off theres a single mindedness about him that can turn into remoteness and that cannot be deflected bobs about control not simply over me but over his whole life he cant even stand to be a passenger in an automobile anyone who threatens that control or tries to interfere with his life is in for huge trouble its happened now and its pushed even me and the kids into second place i dont know if i can ever get over that dont i give you a reason not to want to sarah sighed then smiled at him i want you to pick up that knife over there she said and make a cut in your left thumb uhh why because if youre even going to start giving me that reason itll be by putting me first i want you to give me a written declaration that you will not leave me behind to go off and play just one more season for the nashville cats and to make me believe it im going to want it signed in your own blood she walked over to the counter beside the sink picked up the knife by the handle and offered it to him go on she said but only if in your heart you really mean it and you know for certain that never in your life will you blame me for making you miss out on the chance of that one last great moment ron took the knife from her and held it to his thumb for a moment she though that he really was going to cut himself open but just as she gasped he laid it back down no he murmured i cant promise you all of that some of it maybe but not the last part she patted his chest see you guys youre both the devils i know and you both say you want me on your terms so the way i see it ive got to figure out which devil im better off with or whether i should leave you both in your different underworlds the giant smiled down at her gently while youre doing that are you going to carry on seeing this horny devil i dont know whether i should i doubt if it would help me think objectively i tell you what he said mom wants me to sell this house for her so im going to stick around for a while he reached into his pocket and brought something out i dont think it would be right for me to be around your kids too much so heres a key to the front door if you feel you want to be with me dont even call just come if im not here the alarm codes eleven ninetyone deal she took the key from his hand no promises but okay if i find i cant resist you any longer ill come but that wont necessarily imply anything understood it might just mean that hell you know what it might just mean he chuckled sure understood right now get me back to my kids seventeen skinner and martin were heading for the stairs when rod greatorix stuck his head out of the door of the main cid office mr skinner he called can i have a word before you go the two stopped and went back to join him in the private room theres a couple of things i need to deal with he began first and foremost well need to announce the identification as soon as weve got the postmortem findings i want to issue a public appeal for information about your brothers movements in the period leading up to his death we need to get a handle on where he was when he went into the river or we cant even start a proper investigation of course skinner agreed how do you want us to handle it i mean i dont have to say that michael was your brother you dont rod thats true but itll get out as sure as god made wee sour apples you need the press working for you on this if they start to dig into the story of the black sheep of my family they might come up with useful information faster than you by and large journalists are better than detectives at asking questions ill talk to them about my estrangement from my brother if they want he frowned theres just one thing though i want to speak to a couple of people before this hits the press theres my daughter for one she has to hear it from me then theres neil mcllhenney after andy here hes my closest friend how much time do you need if you brief the press at midday tomorrow thatll be okay alex is flying up from london tomorrow morning for a business meeting on monday im picking her up at the airport at eleventhirty ill see neil before that theres something else i want to talk to him about anyway okay sir youve got that the press wont be awake much before noon on a sunday anyway thanks now what else did you want id like the name and address of the hostel where your brother lived and the name of the manager hell have to be interviewed and possibly some of the other residents as well its called oak lodge its in gourock like i said and its run by the jesuits thats as much as i can tell you im going to want to talk to them myself though bob martin began its for my own peace of mind andy i have to find out how he was you wont go running your own investigation now will you skinner looked at him wideeyed who me listen a complaint from your chief constable to my police authority about my conduct is just what i dont need right now eighteen maggie rose found the divisional cid office in torphichen place depressing at the best of times on a sunday morning with the normal buzz of the rest of the building reduced to a murmur it seemed to drop to a new level of drabness the faces around her were keen though and in the main fresh stevie steele on her right was as sharp as the razor that had shaved him opposite her across the table detective constable alice cowan sat straightbacked disturbingly young but in no way overawed on either side of her ray wilding and george regan detective sergeants both leaned back in their chairs exchanging glances behind the girls back and in the doorway carrying a tray with six mugs pc sauce haddock looked at least three years older in plain clothes than he did in his baggy uniform okay the detective superintendent began as haddock found a place on the table and began handing round mugs lets get on with it im sorry to pull everyone in on a sunday but this one cant wait till tomorrow its already taken on a high profile and we cant be seen to be holding back on it im giving it priority and so i have to tell you is the head of cid mr pringle would have taken this meeting himself but he had an engagement last night so hes sent ray wilding his exec both as a member of the team and to report back to him the irreverent george regan who had served directly under dan pringle in the past and knew his saturday night habits grinned broadly but she let it pass theres another inhouse consideration wed all do well to remember she continued the chief constable was on the invitation list for yesterdays event as it happened he couldnt go but that doesnt mean that he wont be taking a keener interest than usual in our progress right you all know the gist of what happened yesterday but the forensic people ours and the fire specialists have taken it a bit further detective inspector steele will bring you up to date she leaned back from the table and picked up her mug looking sidelong at steele since his promotion he seemed to have grown in authority every day she knew that bob skinner had marked him out and that the dcc was rarely wrong on a professional level at any rate quickly but comprehensively the di set out the results of the forensic investigation he explained that while there was a possibility of the device having been triggered from outside the gallery the thickness of the royal scottish academys walls and the timing of the detonation made it in his view unlikely too risky the device was an expert job and i dont believe that whoever planted it would have taken any chance that it might not have gone off so what were left with potentially he concluded is a room full of blue chip suspects but before we get there before we start digging into everyones background and interviewing people who might try to make very big waves about it we have to make sure that the perpetrator isnt right before our eyes thanks to the academys security cameras so all of us he glanced at haddock and that means you too young sauce youre not just here as the gopher are in for the job we love to hate identifying people from poor quality security videos and looking for someone who shouldnt be there steele paused and smiled i know i know youre going to tell me that you dont know everybody there so how can you identify them but we do know everyone whos signed in and thanks to the very discreet cooperation of di mcllhenneys friend the scotsman picture editor whos in charge of the biggest photo library in town george and i have come up with a list of mugshots to match most of the people on the guest list not just the signedin list because we have to allow for the possibility of people just walking past the reception table there are those who expect everyone to know them and who wont wear badges for that very reason those whose photos we dont have will be mostly the partners of guests but quite a few of them are on that list as well he stopped as ds wilding raised a hand ray question yes stevie why dont we bring in the organisers to help us spot all the legit guests ill bring in david candela if and when we have to but i dont want to trouble him at this stage and anyway theres no guarantee that hell know every spouse of every business associate we do have one secret weapon though whos that my motherinlaw maggie rose answered with a smile mrs christina mcguire she was on the guest list and although she didnt attend she knows just about everybody whos anybody in edinburgh on a business or social footing shes agreed to look at all the faces we cant identify there wont be many left after that i can promise you in an ideal world steele went on well be left with just one unidentified face correction in a truly ideal world well spot someone who isnt on the list but who is on a special branch file thats why alice cowan is here by the way and well have our prime suspect he leaned forward on the table showing maggie his clean sharp profile and making her think unexpectedly of paula viareggio the tapes were really interested in he said run for about an hour and a half from the arrival of the first guest through the incident and thereafter they come from four different cameras ive had them copied and enhanced as far as is possible which isnt very much and ive split them into six lots well each have a video player well each have a different section of tape and well each have a complete set of mugshots with a name along side it with all of us working at it ms rose and me included its shouldnt take too long so lets get at it and see if we get lucky nineteen bob skinner felt his spirits rise as he saw his daughter walk through the domestic arrivals gateway of the edinburgh airport terminal building towing her cabin luggage behind her on its small wheels she had that effect on him every time he saw her she was a beacon of light within him and had been since the moment of her birth around a quarter of a century before every time they were reunited after a separation he saw something new about her on this occasion he thought of the movie lord of the rings and of liv tyler yes put some bounce into the actresss hair and she definitely had a look of his alexis maybe that was why he had seen the film three times quickly he wondered whether that made him look like ms tylers father but decided that there was no way he would pass for a seventies rock star alex ran up to him and hugged him letting the small suitcase find its feet beside her oh i am so glad to see you she exclaimed i know we had that net meeting chat from the states but i still didnt know how youd be she stood back and gave him an appraising upanddown look and youre great is this pacemaker nuclearpowered or what he laughed if it is its like your tongue shut up girl and let me look at you but i mean it she insisted youre glowing with health ive been working on it he admitted id been getting sloppy before the incident but im back in top shape now so what do these idiots mean saying that you cant go back to work thats what your boss is going to ask the court if they persist in it theyd better not then councillor maley and her pals dont want to mess with the might of curie anthony and jarvis and especially not with mr laidlaw they especially dont want to mess with me but thats tomorrows agenda in the meantime lets go over there and have a coffee theres something i have to talk to you about have you got any other luggage alex shook her head making her shoulderlength hair ripple and shimmer in the neon light of the arrivals hall no ive got the power suit packed in here im only up for a couple of days remember yeah sorry its so brief how are you liking london anyway he picked up her bag by its handle and walked her towards the escalator the cafeteria space on the first floor was always less crowded even on a sunday morning i like the professional atmosphere and the people im with but im not so keen on the city you spoiled me pops bringing me up in the country hows andy she asked abruptly and the baby and karen he reminded her theyre tiptop all three of them andys looking at home in tayside already and karens enjoying being a mum you know i still dont think you were very clever the way you went about it but i reckon that breaking off your engagement has turned out to be the best thing you could have done for him i think i should be offended by that said his daughter they walked towards a table by the window dont be it was the making of you too it was all fine at the time but really you were infatuated and longterm andy was looking for something you werent ready to give him she reached up and patted his cheek as he laid down her bag youre a fine one to be lecturing me about relationships pops he gave a halfsnort halflaugh you could be right cappuccino no latte okay he wandered off to the coffee booth and returned with a cafe latte and a tall beaker of coke for himself so said alex heavily what gives with you and my stepmother i called her last night you know to ask after my various small siblings she sounded strange and awkward in a way that ive never known sarah to be before she and i have always really been two girls together weve got on like a house on fire whatever youve done youve really upset her pops did she say anything to you about us not really i had a feeling that there were things she wanted to say but stopped herself short maybe she thought id automatically take your side and would you yes of course but id try not to let sarah know that come on tell me whats up simple she thinks i should be there supporting her i think she should be here supporting me against the powers of darkness in the shape of councillor maley and her faction thats part of it yes then its rubbish youve never needed anyones support against the likes of her youre just putting it that way to cover your guilt over leaving sarah with the kids in the states and charging back over here like a mad bull did sarah suggest that to you no she didnt have to i know you even better than she does father i know exactly how you feel and how you think but im a woman too so i know what sarahs feeling listen girl he retorted my jobs under threat these people are trying to use my condition to get rid of me what else could i have done but come home to deal with them if you want my legal opinion itll cost you dinner tonight in the roseberry in spite of his indignation bob grinned deal first you could have sought two objective medical opinions in the usa ideally from practitioners who are consultants to the county or state police assuming they certified you fit you could have instructed mitch laidlaw to present them to the police authority and to demand that you be returned to the duty list immediately with a supreme court interdict in his hand if necessary that done you could have phoned uncle jimmy and asked him to put you on compassionate leave mmm and you think that would have worked do you you could have instructed me never mind mr laidlaw and it would have worked if youd passed the medical under the present rules the court would have given you the interdict and maleys lot would have been held in contempt if theyd gone against it its still not too late to change your tactics though she pointed out why not set up a full medical examination by two independent cardiologists up at the murrayfield if they clear you my boss can go to maley and demand your reinstatement or bypass her even and go straight to the chair of the police authority alex smiled and put her hand over his that would be the sensible way of doing it but you are you pops and when it blew up id never have expected you to react in any other way than you did so sarahs right i wont say that because i dont know the whole story didnt she suggest what i just did no she told me i should let them get on with it she told me i should take my collapse as a sign from god and give up my job oh dear alex whispered mistake then again she continued firmly i thought exactly the same thing when she called to tell me youd had an incident and that coming as it did right on top of what happened to your poor friend joe doherty dying so suddenly as well id have thought twice about saying it to your face though and youd have been right what happened to joe and what happened to me are in no way related he looked out of the cafeteria window across the airport car park still i will do what you suggest ill line up a couple of specialists to give me a going over tomorrow if possible and well take it from there but that is tomorrow all that apart the god that sarah mentioned does indeed work in mysterious ways and because i did come back i was on the spot to become involved in something very important and very very personal its really what i have to talk to you about before you hear it on the telly alex raised her eyebrows sounds intriguing im glad i came so am i let me ask you a strange question does the name michael niven skinner mean anything to you in an instant all of the mischief went from her expression looking at her bob imagined he saw her lawyers face ah she exclaimed so thats it yes it does hes my uncle isnt he very few people had the capacity to take skinner completely by surprise but alex had always been one how did you when did you at the third attempt he found words how long have you known about him he gasped since i was sixteen we did a genealogical study at school as part of modern studies some of us were taken up to the general records office and shown how to go about constructing our family trees i knew about you and me so i started with grandpa and grandma skinner i fed in their names to the computer maybe you can imagine how surprised i was when i found our tree had an extra branch and that according to the records it was still alive although not bearing fruit bloody hell he whispered why didnt you ask me about him pops ive always trusted you always i knew that if you had kept his existence a secret from me for sixteen years you must have had a bloody good reason and that you would tell me if and when you were good and ready now you have done theres something i have to ask you straight out something thats been on my mind given what my mum was she hesitated as if she was afraid to utter the words on the tip of her tongue given that we know she had affairs she exclaimed at last he isnt my real father is he it was one of those times bob skinner was taken aback completely god no not a chance you can rest easy on that score you are my daughter you were conceived on holiday in a cottage on mull even if myra had been that way inclined at the time shed have had to walk a bloody long way to find anyone else to do the deed besides every time i look in the mirror i see in me your eyes your mouth and your chin a bit careworn perhaps but yours for sure for a second alexs own chin trembled but she held herself together thanks pops silly or not thats been my private nightmare for a while now so tell me how did my uncle michael become a nonperson and so he told her the same story he had told andy and more he confessed that after michaels expulsion his mother had had a breakdown and that she had become an alcoholic herself neglecting him becoming more and more remote from his father and drinking herself inexorably to an early death im sorry alex he said when he had finished these are all things youve had a right to know i shouldnt have kept them from you yes you should if thats the way you saw it she retorted it hasnt exactly made my morning now you have told me i know that every family has a closet with skeletons in it and i also know that sometimes the best thing to do is to leave the door closed she sipped her latte so whats made you open it was it your neardeath experience in america hell no when i came to in that ambulance all i thought about was sarah you and the kids no its because of michaels realdeath experience in perthshire thats the reason its going to be all over the news bulletins in an hour or so he told her of the discovery in miss bonneys basement and of the photograph in her uncles pocket when he was finished she shivered for all the warmth of the morning the poor man she whispered for all he did that he should die like that or did he have it coming to him she asked maybe he never changed maybe he never stopped behaving like an animal until finally no bob said i may have respected my fathers wish that i never see michael again but that didnt stop me from keeping an eye on him from a distance for the last few years until he moved to edinburgh willie haggertys been giving me reports about him more recently someone else i trust on the strathclyde force has been keeping a discreet eye on him for me hes never been in any trouble all the time hes been living through there then theres the jesuit who brother aidan the superintendent of oak lodge the hostel where your uncle lived once a year he makes a report to the trustee who looks after michaels money letting the family know about his general health and his lifestyle originally the trustee was your grandpa since he died its been me the reports have come through the solicitors who set up the trust andys detectives will start their investigation with him but theyve agreed to let me talk to him first to explain whats happened hes an old man and he might need advance warning so he can think about the last time he saw michael and what he was doing around then so what i plan to do is put you in a taxi and send you home to gullane then after ive paid a call on neil mcllhenney get through to gourock hmmph alex snorted you can forget that for a start if you think you can drop this bombshell on me then leave me behind as you go off to open a can of god knows how many worms well you can think again pops if youre going to gourock then so am i he looked at her and grinned would it work if i ordered you to get in a taxi it never has before why should it now true besides if this story is going to hit the press soon id rather not be in gullane when the phone starts ringing that shouldnt happen ive told andy to say to the press that ive been estranged from michael for the last thirty years and that any enquiries about him should be addressed to my family solicitors but i dont suppose itll hold them all at bay youre right there are bound to be a few calls so you can come with me if for no other reason than that very graciously conceded said alex by the way why do you want to see neil to give him advance warning of whats going to hit the press couldnt you phone him alexs father gave her a look full of intrigue ah but thats not all i want to see him about ive had a thorn in my side for too long its time i got rid of it twenty sarah struggled towards wakefulness wondering where the sound was coming from when it dawned on her that it was the phone ringing beside her bed she mumbled and threw out an arm hoping to prod someone into answering it she was caught in the confused tail of a departing dream she might have been reaching out to bob or possibly to ron but she could not be sure which it was she imagined was lying beside her but the tone trilled on until she came fully to her senses and realised that she was alone she glanced at the time it was eightfifteen since trish was not answering she guessed that she was either in the shower or busy changing seonaid grumbling silently she threw herself across the bed and grabbed the handset hi there came a silvery morning voice dont tell me your household was still asleep with three kids how do you do that sarah often thought that when babs walker was called to the master her husband served it would be because of a terminal case of cheerfulness easy she answered stifling a half yawn i dont waken the poor little things at seven oclock on a sunday morning it might be a working day for you but its rest time for most of us the devil finds work sarah babs chirped got to keep those hands busy speaking of which where were you when i called you yesterday your nanny was rather vague on the subject wherever it was you were behaving yourself i hope you hope no such thing and you damn well know it hey come on of course i do im a ministers wife after all it just so happens that alice bierhoff saw you and a certain large and rugged pro foot baller getting out of a car in his moms driveway yesterday afternoon and standing shall we say rather close together i just hope we didnt break any commandments that all she felt her lips purse babs in spite of herself was her closest girlfriend and they had been sharing most of their secrets since they were twelve but not this one sarah thought or it might go straight to bob at the first opportunity alice bierhoff is crosseyed and cant see much further than the hood of her cadillac she retorted it was probably rons mother that she saw alice wears contacts now and what was rons mother doing putting on her bra in rons bedroom with the shades up when she drove past again a couple of hours later if her friend had been with her she would have seen sarahs face redden barbara she said its too late to tell you to mind your goddamned business but please just for once will you go against your nature and keep your mouth shut about this and tell dear alice that if she doesnt want to have an emergency appendectomy without anaesthetic shed better do the same babs laughed i can deliver on the first of those and i will but im not so sure about the second make yourself sure now what can i do for you surely you didnt call me at this hour just to quiz me about my sex life for all you know you might have been interrupting it her friend chuckled that would have been fun but no i didnt i was wondering whether well be seeing you in church today why are the lutherans starting a confessional a peal of laughter rang down the line maybe we should maybe we should no i was wondering whether you and the children might like to join us for lunch afterwards it would give your girl irish some time off shes having today off anyway i was planning to take the kids to the lake this afternoon were you now does ron still have his boat there i have no idea he wasnt included on the trip well whatever what do you say have you invited anyone else sarah asked i could do if youd like i wouldnt like and with that understood yes thanks well be there well be at ians service too seonaids old enough to behave herself now and james andrew needs a little discipline in his life besides i might see alice bierhoff if i do dont be surprised if i punch her contacts right out of her head twentyone id have come to you you know christina mcguire assured her daughterinlaw as she opened the door of the northumberland street flat which she was soon to leave behind her along with the rest of her edinburgh life not at all said maggie youve got enough on your plate packing up for the move to italy no second thoughts about giving up the recruitment business christina laughed she was a tall imposing woman she looked to be in her early fifties although she was in truth a few years older my son wouldnt allow it even if i did show any signs of changing my mind i shocked him at first when i told him what i was planning but now hes really taken to the idea of me living in tuscany he came to see me earlier on she said leading the way into a big rectangular drawing room he just happened to drop in around lunchtime with rufus and with a damn great pizza i dont know why hes so keen on the things they were never on my table when he was a child she frowned for a second he told me whats happened about the wee boy im really sorry maggie thanks but its for the best hell be very well looked after and hell be among other children too im reconciled to it in fact marios taking it worse than i am is it for the best though what about you two will you be all right well be fine when you leave everything else aside mario and i are the best of friends theres no one id rather live with and i know he feels the same way she was not sure that her motherinlaw understood completely what she meant if she did christina gave no sign thats good she murmured as you know ive never been an interferer but ill leave happier for hearing you say that suddenly her expression became businesslike now she exclaimed what or who do you have for me maggie sat down on a big soft couch in the middle of the room took a file from her document case which she dropped on the floor at her feet her motherinlaw sat beside her as she opened the brown folder not too much she said there are only five faces on the video were stuck with ive had them transferred to photofiles and printed out christina reached out and drew a heavy coffee table across the carpet towards them spread them out there and ill have a look maggie did as she was told the faces of three women and two men looked up from the table one was smiling but the others looked as if they had been taken off guard as indeed they had for none had been aware that they were being filmed one of the men looked particularly fierce christina picked up the a likeness peered at it and then laughed that is undoubtedly the worst photograph i have ever seen she said but maybe he looks like that on the bench thats henry corrigan qc lord corrigan the court of session judge is it maggie exclaimed taking the sheet and peering at it god youre right ive given evidence in his court too but id never have known him from that mind you she added he was in his robes in the mugshot the scotsman gave us ive never seen him without his wig hes an ugly bugger isnt he in every way not a nice man christina picked up another photograph one of the three women this is his unfortunate wife madeline or maidie lady corrigan she laid it aside and picked up the other mans likeness now this is she stopped thinking james woodstein she exclaimed with satisfaction hes a marketing consultant with a smallish client list as i remember it includes david candelas firm we did a headhunting job for him once we found him two excellent candidates but he turned them both down saying they were too expensive and then he refused to pay us twerp she picked up the photo on the left of the five sadie grierson she announced shes a relatively rare bird a female corporate accountant she was with one of the big players in london until she was moved to edinburgh to head up their scottish office shes so new in town that shes obviously not in the scotsman photo library yet but shes a client of my firm i met her at a reception they had to announce her appointment maggie picked up the last of the five head shots it showed a woman not old of indeterminate age with a severe hair arrangement sharp eyes and an even sharper frown what about her she asked one doesnt like to be unkind but what about her indeed who stole her scone do you think i dont know maggie muttered but i wouldnt like to be him when she finds him do you know her would her own mother know her from that likeness no i dont think i can help you with her she laid the photograph back on the table and looked at it again and yet she took a pen from the pocket of her cardigan and laid it across the womans eyes theres a girl about the town an odd lass they say shes very bright to my knowledge she has a first in chemistry she did a teacher training course but that ended when she assaulted a girl who was rude to her after that she worked for a while for one of the childrens charities as a clerk until they got rid of her for sending an offensive letter to one of the patrons then she went to work in the office of a new town hotel but she was moved on from that a resident swore in her hearing and she emptied a vase of flowers over his head after that her father brought her to me in the vain hope that i could find her a job that could be her only she picked up the photograph again took the pen and drew a pair of spectacles roughly over the eyes only when i met her she was wearing big thick glasses thats the girl im sure of it her names andrea strachan and her fathers a lecturer in religious studies at napier where can we find her if i hadnt seen that photograph id have said you could have found her in the royal edinburgh hospital last i heard she was sectioned after she tried to set fire to a church twentytwo pops said he was old alex thought as she looked across the coffee table in the sparsely furnished room but that was an understatement brother aidan the superintendent of oak lodge was an ancient twinkling nutmeg of a man a tiny figure with skin like well worn leather sharp features and sparse wispy flyaway hair looking at him skinners daughter was struck by his resemblance to a character in the star wars series a character depicted by a puppet did it strike you as odd that i offered you a drink he asked her father in vibrant irish tones here of all places where its a problem to so many the big detective grinned now that you mention it i suppose it did nothing odd about it at all my friends who live here dont do so on the basis that they keep off the drink some of them just cant poor souls or they wouldnt be here in the first place how many people do you have here alex asked him up to twentyfive my dear god knows theres a need for more places but we have to strike a balance with the feelings of our neighbours the hostel was situated in a residential suburb on the western side of the clyde coast town on a hillside looking across the firth to dunoon theyre good folks in the main brother aidan went on but if we tried to expand this place one or two of them might object and id understand why too my friends here are all good people too at heart but some of them can get a bit obstreperous from time to time whats the mix among the um residents asked skinner the little priest scratched his chin the mix theyre just men all of them people who would like to live in normal society in a normal home but with problems that make it difficult nay impossible for them to do that with some its mental illness with a few its personality disorders with others its just the drink with one or two like your poor brother michael its both he rocked back in his chair and took a long look at his visitors his sharp gaze finally coming to rest on bob so hes dead then my old friend im afraid so he was here the longest you know i came myself thirtytwo years ago and michael joined us a couple of years after that how was he all that time sure and how do i answer that sad i suppose yes whatever else he was he was always sad at first when he came here from the hospital he was very disturbed he was medicated but there was still a great anger in him what did he have to be angry about skinner blurted out before he could stop himself a great deal brother aidan replied but it was all directed at himself in those early years i had a fear that it might drive him to take his life but gradually that anger faded until only the sadness remained he became id have to say a nice man quiet but popular within our community here eventually if my friends here can be said to have a leader among them thats what he became he had been thrust out of his own family but he had the good fortune to find another here he was a great asset to us as well he had all sorts of skills with his hands from his army days just about all of the maintenance around here he did the priest held up a hand you mustnt take that as criticism my son i understand why your father did what he did it hurt him very deeply but as he saw it he had no choice truth be told thats how i saw it too you met my father of course he came to inspect oak lodge while michael was still in the hospital he was a substantial man right enough with an air about him that i saw in you the moment you walked through the door he smiled at alex and in you too my dear if i may say so michael would have been very proud of his niece had he known of you brother aidan sighed but he never did of course he never once asked me about his family i think he knew that he wouldnt have been able to bear having a running commentary on their lives you told him when my parents died though of course when he learned about your poor mother i thought he really would end himself he locked himself away and cried for a whole day eventually i had to have his door broken in when i told him about your father though i have to say that his reaction was very strange he was every bit as brokenhearted but there was something else too he was afraid for the security of his life here he was convinced that you would wind up his trust and cut off his money god id never have done that i knew you wouldnt and eventually i was able to persuade michael of that still and all though his view of life did change after your fathers death there was always that edge of fear in him fear yes my son he always had a fear of you michael told me about the terrible things he did to you when you were a child he told me what he did to your mother and about what happened after that i am not condemning you here because i know what you saw you were no more than a boy defending his mother the most natural thing in the world but your brothers last memory of you was of you beating him unconscious telling him all the time in a quiet voice that you were going to kill him he came to realise that among his many sins possibly the greatest was to have put such hatred in the heart of one so young he couldnt believe that it could ever leave you and when the years went by without a visit from you or cards on his birthday or at christmas his sadness and his guilt went all the deeper bob skinner stared out of the window of the old priests office im carrying my own guilt now brother michaels dead and i wish that at the very least id written to him or called him if only to wipe away his memory of that hatred and to cleanse him of his guilt it came to me when i looked at him in the mortuary that in my life as a police officer ive dealt with many people who were a hell of a lot worse human beings than my brother ever was and yet ive shown most of them more mercy than i ever showed him he winced as if his pain was physical i can make the ageold excuse of course in not contacting him i was obeying my fathers order i worshipped my dad as did michael in his own very different way it would have been a betrayal for me to have gone against him for me the ultimate disloyalty but now ill go through my life believing that if i had reached out to him maybe he wouldnt have wound up in that fucking river brother aidan nodded you may do so he conceded but even if you had reached out as you put it i doubt very much whether michael would have given up his life here your father put him here because he had a personality disorder and he was alcoholic a christmas card from you might have been nice but it wouldnt have changed that be hard on yourself if you like wearing a hair shirt on occasion is good for any man but dont be too hard bury him where he belongs beside his parents then try to move on alex reached across and took his hand yes dad please skinner let out a low growling sound mmmm time will tell if i can my life seems to be full of guilt and anger just now maybe the best thing i could do is take over michaels bed here you dont qualify said brother aidan brusquely theres a queue from here to glasgow of people who need help before we get round to those who just feel sorry for themselves reproved the policeman smiled true you mentioned a river the little priest continued youve never told me how michael died was that it part of it at least tell me brother did michael leave here often hed go down the shops like everyone else but if you mean did he take a trip somewhere that happened only rarely in fact two weeks ago was the first time he ever went away for any length of time without me michael and i used to go on holiday together he explained i have a nephew in a village near cork and we would visit him every year or two so what happened two weeks ago where did he go glasgow i was told on his own oh no he couldnt have done that not that thered have been anything to stop him mind other than himself my friends here are all free men they can come and go any time they please but many michael among them choose to remain what happened was this a few months ago your brother had a letter out of the blue he said it was from a man called skipper someone hed known a long time ago when he was young skipper said that hed been abroad for many years and that hed only just come back to scotland hed asked around about michael and had been told by a friend of a friend back in mother well that hed gone to live in oak lodge did my uncle write back to him asked alex there was no return address my dear however a couple of weeks later there was a telephone call for michael from the man i didnt think he was going to take it at first apart from once when my nephew called from ireland and he said a quick hello he hadnt spoken on the telephone for thirty years but he plucked up his courage and he did the outcome was that skipper came to visit him shortly afterwards they had a chat then they went out for a drink together did this guy have another name skinner asked thats the only one i know i dont know whether its a surname nickname or whatever in any event he came another couple of times and eventually it was arranged between them that michael would go to stay with him for a couple of weeks the old man sighed the truth be told when you called to say you wanted to see me i thought you were going to tell me that michael wasnt going to be coming back thats just what you did tell me but not in the way i expected sadly not brother aidan can you tell me what this man skipper looked like the jesuit ran his fingers through his sparse hair hed have been about michaels age i suppose in height hed have been around the same but he was fairly thin much more lightly built he wore spectacles with blue lenses sunglasses i suppose they were hair grey like yours a bit greyer maybe does that ring any bells none ill maybe talk to a couple of people in mother well who might have known my brother back in the old days theyll probably be rogues or policemen but some of them will still be around why do you need to trace this man robert brother aidan asked because michaels death may have been either suicide or an accident or something else theres considerable doubt about it he told the priest the rest of the story explaining where and how he had been found as he spoke the old mans mouth formed into a perfect o of horror he crossed himself how terrible he whispered my poor old friend that he should die like that but tell me how did the police make the connection to you the only thing they found on his body was a photograph of my father someone who knew me saw it spotted the likeness between us and came to me ahh brother aidan exclaimed that would be it it was all he had with him when they brought him here and it was all he took with him just over two weeks ago when he went away with skipper for the last time twentythree what do we know about this fireraising thing asked stevie steele its in our records right enough ds george regan replied and so is the girls photograph full face and profile strachan andrea i pulled it and it pretty much matches the face on the video her address is listed as if albany terrace i checked with the probation service shes still there so what happened what did she do how come it means nothing to me it wasnt in our division stevie it happened down in joppa at the back end of last october they called it a church but it was more of a gospel hall one of these baptist handclapping hallelujah places it was near the offices of the charity where she worked and it got to her then the strachan girl seems to be a bit of a christian fundamentalist to her it was sodom and gomorrah all rolled into one big party eventually god talked to her didnt he and he told her that he had chosen her to destroy it schizophrenic asked alice cowan thats what they said afterwards as far as she was concerned though it was the man upstairs all the way giving her his battle orders so her with a chemistry degree and all she made up what would have been a pretty effective incendiary bomb went to one of their services and tried to tape it under one of the pews at the back steele held up a hand did it have a timer aye a wee alarm clock thing it would have worked too why didnt it she might be a clever girl but shes still not all that bright somebody came into the church behind her as she was planting it and saw her she ran for it but they caught her just down the road and called the police court nah the fiscal was persuaded not to proceed on the basis that the lass was clearly disturbed and she hadnt done any damage so she was sectioned for six months under the mental health act and went into the royal edinburgh her probation officer says that shes still going back as an outpatient have you spoken to anyone there asked maggie rose regan shook his head not yet maam i thought id speak to you and inspector steele before i did that just as well well need to play it carefully there the girl may have been committed but shes as entitled to medical confidentiality as the rest of us what else did the probation officer tell you that shes responding to her treatment the medications continuing and there have been no signs of a relapse so far shes doing her best to change the woman said shes wearing contacts now and her wardrobes a lot less like a nun on a weekend pass has she got a job aye she has maam the probation service found her a placement with the church of scotland in george street they had hoped she might have another go at teaching eventually but the medical advice was against that the church of scotland eh the moderator and his wife were guests yesterday werent they aye and the new archbishop but i dont think that any of them are in the frame eh steele frowned lets stay serious george okay right inspector ill get serious why are we sitting about here why dont we just pick her up then what for asked rose the girl might have a genuine interest in religious art it isnt an offence to gate crash a private function no george since youre so keen for action you can get back into those tapes forget everyone else just concentrate on andrea strachan lets see whether we can catch her in the vicinity of the vargas trinity at any time then lets see if we have a shot of her at the moment of the detonation of the device you never know we might get lucky and find a shot of her pulling the trigger and if we dont the sergeant countered then we thats to say you and di steele will make further enquiries tomorrow at the church of scotland to see if the girl might have been there legitimately through them and at candela and finch to check whether they issued informal invitations to anyone else well keep her under surveillance but im only going to move against this girl when all these avenues have been explored shes a schizophrenic arsonist george if they hadnt done the probation deal over the church thing shed probably have gone to the state mental hospital at carstairs if she did torch that painting thats where shes bound this time for sure she could wind up there for a good chunk of the rest of her life so we cannot afford to make any mistakes twentyfour as it happened alice bierhoff was in church on the other side of the central aisle but not too far away for sarah to catch her eye and throw her a look that was meant to say spread gossip about me lady and you ii wish you d never been born but alice a short dumpy woman she probably cant remember the last time she had any excitement in her life thought sarah as she looked at her was either tougher than she looked or had forgotten to put in her contacts for she replied with a small wave and a sweet knowing smile sarah let it go at that for she had enough on her hands with seonaid and a restless fidgety james andrew jazz had not been best pleased when his mother had told him that the trip to the lake had been postponed and he spent much of the service determinedly punching the thigh of his adopted brother mark who had been given the task of trying to keep him under control once or twice as they rose for hymns sarah glanced around her looking for a familiar face but there was no sign of him and he was way too big to be concealing himself among the congregation finally they reached the business end of the hour ian walkers sermon it took sarah a while to take a grip of what he was saying but finally she understood his message was that while society had evolved in ways that only god could have imagined during the two thousand years of christianity the ten commandments still stood at the centre of the faith and still encapsulated the values by which christians should live their lives sarah sat pokerfaced when babs caught her eye she wondered whether the preachers wife had suggested the theme or even if she had let him in on alice bierhoffs chance discovery and if this was his discreet way of registering disapproval if it was she found it more than a little rich she remembered among other things smoking a little grass with ian in her freshman college year while there might not have been a commandment that referred to that specifically she was pretty sure that it was covered somewhere it was on the tip of her tongue to remind him of the occasion as he bade his congregation farewell outside the church but she decided to keep it in reserve by that time jazz was virtually uncontrollable mark was complaining that his leg was numb and even the obedient infant seonaid was becoming restless are you going to behave she hissed at her younger son as babs walker came towards them want to go to the lake james andrew muttered i have told you auntie babs has invited us all for lunch want to go to the lake maybe later then maybe well go for a little while will that make you happy the childs expression softened but only a little he whispered something that she could not hear gratefully she handed seonaid over to babs as she arrived beside her and crouched down beside him what did you say she asked him quietly still his whispered reply was inaudible what she asked again i want dad jazz muttered plaintively on the edge of tears i want my dad sarah felt her heart melt inside her so did i son she said ruffling his hair as she stood so did i but hes had to go away hi guys said babs brightly holding seonaid up in the sunshine my but youre a little beauty the blondehaired child gurgled and smiled at the attention you ready for lunch she asked sarah my boys are looking forward to playing soccer in the yard with your boys sure but mark might opt out of the soccer the only kind he plays is on a computer screen as for james andrew matthew might be able to handle him since hes seven but daniel might find him a little rough rough at soccer they play a slightly different game in scotland and james andrews learned from his father speaking of whom its all right babs broke in forestalling her like i promised there will be no extra lunch guest i did call ron though on reflection i thought id better tell him about alice before he heard from someone else you understand sarah understood very clearly what did he say my dear he used language quite inappropriate for the wife of a lutheran clergyman to repeat and certainly not in front of the children lets just say that his view of alice is in line with your own now come on lets be going ian will be a little while but the rest of us can head on back to the house now lunch at the walkers proved to be a pleasant experience even if the soccer game did come to an abrupt end with jazz still dour and fractious punching matthew the older of his hosts sons im sorry babs said sarah as her friend wiped the tears from his face and the blood from his nose this one she threw james andrew a thunderous look who will incidentally be lucky to get within a hundred miles of the lake after that has been impossible lately hes missing his dad mark explained coming to his brothers defence in a way that touched sarah even through her anger be that as it may she said trying to stay severe he has to learn he kicked me jazz muttered once the peace treaty between the boys had been signed they settled down to a chicken lunch american style although sarah kept tight rein on the size of her childrens portions i enjoyed your sermon ian sarah ventured finally once the four oldest children had been released to watch television the preacher smiled i give them traditional values every so often he said babs suggested it was time for another round indeed what will it be next week keeping god with us on the campus finding him through a haze of marijuana smoke like we used to do babss jaw dropped why ian she exclaimed you never did did you its all right sarah laughed he didnt inhale either her friend read the sign correctly and kept the conversation on safe ground from then on until sarah announced that it was time to go mum jazz called from the back seat as they pulled out of the walkers driveway she knew what was coming okay she answered since you said you were sorry well go to the lake well need to go back to the house first though were all still in our church clothes and seonaid needs changing they were almost home when she saw him driving towards her in his camaro she had teased him about it asking if he had a burt reynolds fixation but he had pointed out that he had trouble fitting into a porsche he did not slow down nor did he seem to notice her until the cars had almost reached each other then a broad easy smile crossed his face as they passed he took his left hand from the wheel and waved she thought that she caught a flash of something white on his thumb that was the man who picked you up yesterday wasnt it said mark the man who was going to fly you to the cabin thats right hes mr neidholm an old college friend and a very famous foot baller rangers jazz announced no said mark severely american hes too big to be one of our foot ballers sarah smiled and wondered whether ron would take that as a compliment then she wondered why he had been there and if he had called to see her why he had driven away one more turn and they had reached the grace mansion she slid the jaguar into the long driveway and on impulse stopped at her mailbox she stepped out of the car and swung it open there was a white envelope inside she took it out slipped it into the pocket of her jacket and got back into the car okay boys she exclaimed as she cancelled the alarm and let them into the house lakeside clothes please shorts shirts and sandals ill take care of us girls and see you down here in ten minutes she carried seonaid upstairs into her own bedroom and laid her on the bed then took the envelope from her pocket and ripped it open it contained a single white a sheet a printed letter she whispered the words as she read it my darling sarah im not going to be a fool again you mean more to me than all the superbowl rings in the world and all the nonsense that goes with them this is my pledge if you will have me i will finish with the game in every aspect here and now i will practice law as you practice your pathology until its time for us to sail off into the sunset together i love you will you marry me she looked at the signature ron it was scrawled roughly in a colour unlike any ink she had ever seen she knew what it was all right shed have known even without seeing the white flash of surgical tape on his left thumb oh damn she whispered feeling her knees go weak as a sudden wave of panic surged through her sarah its choosing time twentyfive of all the excellent restaurants in which she ate regularly alex had to admit that the roseberry was her favourite it was an emotional as much as a culinary thing she had studied in glasgow her professional life had begun in edinburgh and had then taken her to london for a period yet to be determined for all that there was something about the baywindowed bistro on gullanes main street that reminded her where her home really was she still owned her flat in leith although it was rented to a curie anthony and jarvis colleague during her london secondment there she had been found a very pleasant apartment in bustling spitalfields yet she knew within herself that one day she would return to the village in which she had been raised she even knew the house that she would like to buy should the opportunity arise will you be selecting the wine tonight mr skinner asked ronald the roseberrys frontofhouse partner not a chance alex answered him cheerfully i will and well have a bottle of that nice chablis thanks she looked at her father as the waiter headed off towards the kitchen youd better not have anything too heavy tonight if youre having your big medical tomorrow did you get it set up yup i called a cardiologist sarah knows and told him the story he and another consultant are going to give me a total goingover at the murrayfield hospital at five tomorrow evening ive told mitch what im doing he agrees its sensible wed probably have had to do it anyway if the committees doctors had refused to examine me how do the family solicitors feel about you using our firm for this one i havent even told them its none of their business if your firm had a private client department id probably be on its books by now given your connection you dont but this is a litigation matter its like golf who would you choose to hole a tenfoot putt to save your life not you alex laughed thats for sure right youd go for tiger woods in a sense my lifes at stake but the game here is litigation so by the same token im going for mitchell laidlaw then youll win youre the man mitch she exclaimed gallerystyle then paused but pops just suppose the consultants find an underlying abnormality suppose they decide they cant pass you fit to go back to work what would you do thats not going to happen answer the question bob looked down at the menu on the table as if he was studying it i dont know he murmured ive never contemplated retirement ive never imagined a life outside the police ive got a professional future thats mapped out for oh the next fifteen years anyway and ive never given any thought to the idea of it being taken away come on pops you must plan on living beyond sixtyfive what will you do then he looked up and shrugged i dunno maybe ill write maybe ill just join the seniors section and play golf every day till eventually they carry me off the course he frowned or maybe and this is something that has floated through my mind on occasion i could find a visiting chair in criminology at some university or other pops you could do that now without any difficulty in britain and probably in the states as well and maybe just maybe you understand you should think about it youve given more to the police service in little over half a career than almost any other man has in a whole lifetime but its taken you over nothing and no one gets in its way not even your marriage i want to see you fulfilled and happy as you grow older not lonely bitter and driven youre telling me to chuck it too no im telling you to be broad minded enough to embrace the possibility alex ive got things to do yet like being chief constable you mean pops you couldnt sit in uncle jimmys chair for more than six months and you know it yes i do but there are other things other avenues you mean like the inspectorate maybe i dont know if i can imagine you as her majestys inspector of constabulary fortunately my darling youre not the queen he laughed not yet at any rate he made to go on but ronald arrived with a bottle of chablis he opened it and poured a little for bob to taste he nodded and the waiter filled both glasses ready to order he asked another five minutes sure what were you going to say alex asked as he left that ill make you a deal ill retire in twelve years maximum sooner if i feel that im burned out and i will think more about the university idea i promise but first i have to get through this medical and i have to crush these bastards who are trying to get me out of my job now lets eat he nodded to the hovering ronald who made a smooth landing at their table they ordered starters of haggis parcels then baked sea bass you realise said bob as he left that weve talked about nothing but me and my poor dead disowned brother since you got off that plane this morning what about you what about this actor another time alex answered abruptly well keep on talking about you for now why have you got something to hide is this guy someone id know or is he someone id disapprove of she picked up her napkin and bunched it as if she was going to throw it at him pops there is no actor there is no one that was just a story i made up to stop being endlessly quizzed about my sex life whos been quizzing you not me sarah for a start and various friends i got fed up with it after a while so i came up with an imaginary lover just to keep them at bay im trying celibacy for a while as a way of life its fun too theres something nice about being unattainable you can really get involved in the conversation at dinner parties for a start without smouldering across the table at some bloke been there done that thrown away the teeshirt she spread her napkin on her lap and leaned back as ronald served the starter so she went on as she picked up her first knife and fork to get back to this afternoon are you still planning to go through to mother well tomorrow yup should you be doing that what harm am i doing i called rod greatorix before we came out and told him everything we learned from brother aidan this afternoon and ill do the same if i get anything tomorrow im not keeping anyone out of the loop if any formal statements need to be taken the tayside boys can follow up and take care of it i havent heard any howls of protest so far this is shaping up to be a complex investigation and they dont have the biggest cid in scotland lucky tayside eh having bob skinner helping them out how does it feel to be reporting to andy im not exactly but listen kid just about everybodyll be reporting to andy one day he was into the second of his haggis parcels when his cellphone rang an elderly diner frowned at him across the restaurant he shrugged a halfapology and took the call bob sarahs voice was so clear that she could have been calling from the phone in the roseberrys cloakroom hi he said cautiously even a little curtly remembering their last conversation how are you fine she replied he focused on her tone there was no trace of anger there but there was something nonetheless a distance between them that had nothing to do with geography were going to the lake for a while but jazz wanted to say hello first here he is there was a pause a couple of seconds no more before a young bright and heartbreakingly familiar voice came on line dad james andrew shouted hello dad hello son bob said grinning inanely as alex looked at him across the table are you still enjoying america im going to the lake so your mum told me have you been behaving yourself no said jazz cheerfully what punched matthew walker made his nose bleed he kicked me first though bob stifled a laugh still son thats no excuse christ hes the ministers son did you say sorry yes mom made me the americanism registered with skinner disturbing him well dont do it again or youll have me to deal with you be a good boy from now on now put your mother back on hes just made it to the lake by the skin of his teeth said sarah as she reclaimed the phone mark says hello too hell send you an email he heard her take a breath bob we need to talk yes he agreed we do theres something i have to tell you yeah i have something to say to you too without shouting at each other yes that would be nice for a change where are you he told her that wont do she said no hardly ill call you from home when i can soon it cant be before tomorrow night i have things to do tomorrow through till seven okay call me when youre ready ill make sure im here all afternoon fine he was about to end the call when he heard her speak again sorry he said putting the phone back to his ear i asked how your pacemakers doing that was all fine the wound itches every so often but otherwise i dont know its there thats good thats the way it should be when do you see the doctors tomorrow youll sail through i know you will so do i bob she asked do you miss me even a little her tone was even matteroffact suddenly he felt as if the glass wall between them had become steel honey he replied thats a question i force myself not to dwell on if i did theres no telling where it would end lets speak tomorrow as he put the phone back in his pocket he became aware of his daughter frowning at him across the table what was wrong with that conversation she asked i dont know what do you mean i mean three words i didnt hear i love you twentysix if pressed neil mcllhenney would admit that he had preferred his former job as bob skinners executive assistant to his new role in special branch but he knew that nothing was forever and so when the move had come about following mario mcguires promotion to head the borders cid division he had taken it in his stride the death of olive his first wife still hung over him like a black cloud it was his constant companion and he knew he would never shake it off but to offset it he had his totally unexpected romance and his second marriage still new fresh and to him astonishing he knew from personal experience bitter and sweet that nothing in life was to be taken for granted and when he thought about it he realised that he was better at his job as a result alice cowan was behind her desk as usual when he swept into his office suite she was a keen one that girl however early neil came to work he never seemed to beat her to the punch morning constable he said brightly morning inspector she replied returning his friendly smile how did your wee bit of overtime go yesterday then money for old rope boss we found a face we got a name and shes got nothing to do with us no but is she someone we should have known about i wouldnt say so she seems to be a sad lass with a screw loose when it comes to religion but not someone who represents any threat to the fabric of the state is that right he exclaimed with raised eyebrows does the name alqaeda mean anything to you cowan smiled this girls strictly a lone operator sir if she has the skill to make and plant a device like the one that torched the vargas painting she could manage to stuff her trainers with explosives and get on a jet not at edinburgh she couldnt not since we started them examining the soles of their shoes at the barrier check maybe not alice but just as all knowledge is power every small gap in knowledge is a potential weakness just you keep an eye on the progress of ms roses investigation and if this woman turns out to be the one lets have a file on her in fact does she have form for this sort of thing attempted yes then open a file anyway very good sir he walked over to the coffee machine which like alice was always fired up and waiting whenever he came into the office and poured himself a mug before you do that though he said grab yourself a coffee and come into my room the strapping young woman declined the coffee and followed him through into his private office taking her usual seat beside his desk ive got a job for you he told her he reached into his jacket drew out a sheet of paper laid it face up on his desk and slid it across to her i want you to dig out the files we hold on all of these people cowan picked up the paper and saw a list of eight names she looked at the first and gasped then scanned her way down the rest councillor maley she began boss these people are all on the joint police authority should we be doing this mcllhenney smiled at her again but this time there was no humour in it were special branch kid we can do what we bloody well like but these are politicians and im not stupid i know what theyre about right now wouldnt we be abusing our position thats just what i suspect these people have been doing if they have im going to find out when i do im going to rein them in twentyseven not being an adherent of any faith stevie steele had admired the grey sandstone building that housed the church of scotland headquarters but he had never before thought of stepping inside much of the ground floor was actually retail space selling a fairly broad range of products appropriate to the nature of the church walking past steele saw cliff richards face smiling up at him from a rack of cds he found the reception desk and announced himself and the sergeant using names rather than ranks when he had made the appointment it had been agreed that its nature should be kept off the office grapevine if possible steeles police training had taught him to avoid preconceptions and so he was less surprised than he might have been by the appearance of the principal clerk to the moderator of scotlands established church or indeed by his name the reverend cahal oreilly an ordained minister of the church of scotland looked to be in his early forties or perhaps even a few years younger he greeted the detectives at the door of his panelled office dressed in tight black trousers and a shortsleeved ralph lauren polo shirt open at the neck and tieless morning chaps he said steele tried to detect an accent but could hear none good morning mr oreilly im steven steele we spoke earlier this is my colleague george regan the principal clerk stood aside to usher them into his room grab a seat he told them pointing towards a meeting table im afraid this is a smoke and coffeefree zone but i can offer you chilled water still or sparkling im fine thanks the inspector replied you george regan who had a major caffeine habit shook his head so said oreilly as he sat in a highbacked chair at the head of the table what have we been up to which one of the fathers and brethren have strayed from the straight and narrow and how far is the stuff going to spread off the fan the sergeants eyes widened slightly but he held his pokerfaced expression in contrast a broad grin spread across stevie steeles face which of the shepherds has been getting among the sheep do you mean he replied you can relax its nothing like that are you aware of the exhibition of religious art which opened on saturday in a blaze you might say sure i know about it i helped organise the damn thing you did yes i wasnt alone you understand my opposite numbers in other christian churches and in other faiths were involved too you dont make it sound like a labour of love pain in the arse would be a better description oreilly said with a rueful frown and its a particularly sore point with me actually id assumed thats what you wanted to see me about all joking apart im just not clear why you wanted to keep your visit hushhush given the publicity the things had well get to that mr oreilly cahal please fine cahal but can you fill us in on the background to the event sure it started off as a glory trip some bright boy in the scottish arts council dreamed up the idea he thought it would be a good leadin to the papal visit and sold the sponsorship to candela and finch then they discovered they didnt really know how to go about organising it all that c and f know about art is that you can write it off against tax and the sac boy found that it wasnt as easy as hed thought to persuade galleries around the world to part with their priceless works so nike baseball cap in hand he had to come to me to the roman catholic church and to various others to ask for our support we wound up making a joint pitch for most of the major works on show over there in one or two cases we had to visit curators to win them over what about the vargas oreilly grimaced thats my sore point its cost me a lot of grief on the telephone this weekend that was my baby the catholics didnt veto it but given its lets say controversial nature they didnt want to be seen to be involved in negotiations so i got to go by myself to the guggenheim in bilbao which owns it to secure the piece some building i tell you you think our parliaments something its a wendy house compared to that seeing it was the only saving grace of the whole show as far as i was concerned we had to make all sorts of promises of course among them we had to take personal responsibility for the reception and storage of each piece and we had to be present when they were hung to ensure that the positioning and lighting matched the specification of the owner gallery so you were there when the vargas arrived i saw it unpacked how did it look when it came out of the crate perfect in perfect condition that is personally i thought it was a load of crap but everyone to their own taste and all that im no art critic did you see the back of the picture george regan asked i suppose i did why can you describe it oreilly frowned how do you describe the back of a picture frame canvas thats it it looked like a sack stretched tight will that do very well indeed said steele when it was hung on the wall the back was covered over with brown paper while it was in storage downstairs between the arrival and the hanging someone placed an incendiary device inside the frame and then taped paper over to cover it thats what happened was it i read someone had claimed responsibility someone usually does cahal we dont always believe them though i have to ask you something when you went to the academy to receive the picture did you go alone the principal clerk leaned against the high back of his chair no i thought there was an outside chance that the couriers would actually expect us to remove the thing physically so i took jan laing my secretary you spoke to her earlier and andrea our clerk with me andrea andrea strachan she asked if she could come with us for a sneak preview of the pictures shes with us on a sort of temporary basis we pay her a little but shes more or less a volunteer jerome strachan her father even if he is a bit rightwing in presbyterian terms is a friend of mine he lectures in religion up at napier the girls had emotional problems and he asked if i could fit her in somewhere as a sort of therapy shes a nice lass pretty serious but very helpful and keen almost overkeen at times do you know the nature of those emotional problems jerome told me shes been treated for schizophrenia if thats what you mean thats all he said yes and i didnt press him should i have not the way i see it hes your friend so why should you steele glanced across at a fridge in a corner of the big office do you think i could have some of that water you were offering earlier he asked sure oreilly rose to his feet still or fizzy still and dont bother with a glass by the neck will be fine the principal clerk took three bottles of mineral water from the fridge and brought them back to the table he opened one himself and handed the others to steele and regan as he took his the sergeant smiled for the first time why were you guys not on the list for the opening since you did so much work he asked if i was interested george that would be another sore point with me all us organisers were thanked very effusively by the boy at the arts council and were told very apologetically that space at the opening bash would be limited and that only the moderator and the archbishop would be invited no one else from any of the executives the mod did his nut i have to tell you he was going to decline but i persuaded him that my saturday would be more ruined if he did that than if i missed out i was sorry jan and andrea didnt get in on the act but as far as i was concerned hed drawn the short straw id seen the exhibition and i dont like champagne even when its free what about the boy with the nike baseball cap asked regan casually cahal oreilly frowned then his face split into a grin oh he was there all right dont you worry twentyeight youve fair taken my breath away robert i dont mind telling you the old man beamed as he handed a cup of tea to his visitor when you called it was like hearing a voice from the past im just glad you remember me said bob skinner remember you remember you pale blue eyes twinkled in a bald wrinkled head i remember you all right and even if i didnt i only have to look at you to know who you are youre william skinners son and no mistake i remember him well and your grandfather mr michael skinner before him the old man lowered himself gently into an armchair im just astonished that you remember me dont be daft man the whole bloody town remembers you nicol falkirk cbe the editor of the mother well times for the best part of the last century not quite the best part his host corrected him but a good bit of it nonetheless how old are you now if you dont mind my asking eightyfour and starting to feel it but not look it said skinner deferentially i passed by hope street when i was driving round town i guess the paper isnt printed there any more nor has it been for a long time they turn it out on a big web offset press somewhere well out of the town im glad im not part of it any more i was an old school editor i wrote my copy in fountain ink and it was set in hot lead by craftsmen then made up into page form by hand by people who in the main lived in the town which they were serving thats what a local newspaper should be robert truly local thats what it was like when you worked there as a young man in your holidays remember just before it was sold and everything changed worked is maybe an exaggeration nicol copyboy they called me not a bit of it you did your share in the months you were there you could write better than some of my regular reporters ill tell you they were always trying to copy the tabloid style so they could move on to bigger jobs in glasgow more than a few of them did of course most of my trainees wound up with their own bylines on the herald the scotsman the mail and so on the venerable editor laughed i always liked the football reports you wrote robert they were as partisan as anything he wheezed you understood without being told that being unbiased is not the business of a local reporter the readers expect you to be on the side of the home team they needed all the help they could get bob muttered they still do ach thats changed too i was never a football man myself but i dont approve of all these damn foreigners we have these days this county of lanark produced the likes of matt busby jimmy johnstone and ian st john what chance does a boy have today come on nicol times change maybe but your father would have agreed with me he usually did apart from one time when was that when i told him that i had hopes you might become a journalist after you left university he said to me that if i put that idea in your head hed hang me up by the thumbs until the rest of me dropped off them bob looked astonished my father said something like that he certainly did those were his exact words at a civic centre reception too and do you know what i think he meant them your father was dead set on you going on to do law after you finished your arts degree and following him into the firm he wasnt best pleased at first when you went into the police he did his best not to show it but i remembered that brush that we had and i knew so did i skinner murmured but he got over it eventually i was sorry to hear about your wife robert the old man said quietly i remember young myra very well it was just too bad that she should die so young the motor cars a blessing but a curse too thats why ive never had one aye a girl of spirit she was sure and then some that was a long time ago though i suppose it was he mused thats the thing about getting old your timeframe gets jumbled up he smiled and hows your daughter he asked hows she getting on my older daughter you mean very well im glad to say now alexis would have made her grandfather happy she is a lawyer and showing promise at it too you have another daughter yes wee seonaid shes coming up for a year then theres james andrew whos four and a handful and mark whos going on nine my my you have been busy not that busy marks adopted busy enough mr falkirk picked up his neglected tea took a sip screwed up his face and put it down now robert he said charmed as i am to see you i know that you havent come all this way to pay me a casual visit what can i do for you you can write an obituary for me and persuade your successors to run it in the mother well times oh surely not whose you havent seen a paper today the old journalist shook his head i dont bother with them any more theyre full of nonsense true i have to read them though today especially the obituarys for my brother michael he was found dead at the weekend theres no one but you that id trust to do it the twinkle had gone from nicol falkirks eyes oh dear me he sighed i wrote your fathers i wrote your mothers and long before that i wrote your grandfathers when a journalist comes round to writing three generations of obituaries he knows hes lived too long of course ill do it and ill make sure it gets a good show in the paper i have emeritus status you know do you remember michael most certainly and before you ask i know the story robert your father told me what had happened he wanted to make sure that nothing appeared in the paper he was the companys solicitor and so he had influence with the proprietors but if hed been any man off the street id have done as he asked it is not the function of a newspaper to pry into the private grief of any family he pushed himself up slowly from his chair and walked over to a bureau beside the bay window of his bungalow skinner looked out through the lace curtains the day had begun brightly in the east but now the sky was overcast by grey cloud it was mother well as he remembered it mr falkirk fumbled around in his desk until he found a thick wellthumbed reporters notebook and a fountain pen a flash of memory came back to bob from his copyboy days as he watched the old editor resume his seat he always wrote in green ink just give me the basics mr falkirk instructed suddenly there was a professional tone in his voice i know your family background well enough what was your brothers full name michael niven skinner after my grandfather age fiftysix hed have been educated at knowetop primary and dalziel high wouldnt he yes he played rugby for the school and he won the english prize in his sixth year thank you ill mention both of those he wouldnt have had far to walk to dalziel mr falkirk grunted as he made the notes since your house was just across the road in crawford street and after that he continued he was awarded a place at sandhurst thats right isnt it yes he went straight from school i was only about eight then skinner mused i remember him coming home on leave with this wee swagger stick he winced inwardly but declined to mention that he had often been beaten with the same stick where did he serve after he was commissioned at home initially then germany and finally honduras he saw action there yes i remember your father telling me that it had a telling effect on him he resigned his commission after that didnt he and came home yes but he couldnt settle down could he the old man probed gently no he was a lost and troubled soul i know i used to see him hanging around mother well cross with his cronies going in and out of the horseshoe bar or into the bookmakers across from my office and i used to grieve for your poor parents ill gloss over that part of his life dont worry ill just say that he moved to where was it again i only knew from your father that he was committed for a while gourock he spent the last thirty years of his life in a jesuit hostel in gourock overlooking the clyde bob felt the great sadness grip him again and how did he die we dont know for sure yet his body was found in perth on saturday he had been in the river the police there are treating his death as suspicious for the moment pending postmortem findings he managed to find some sort of peace in gourock he managed to find true friends and he lived there in what passed with him for happiness until someone from his past turned up and lured him away my but thats awful do they know who this person was the one he went away with no they do not nicol or rather we do not but you can be damned sure were going to find out skinner looked across at the veteran those cronies you mentioned can you put names to them im sure i can let me see there was cammy winters and willie day our printing press men and wee benny crainey and waggy roughhead they called him that because of the way his head bobbed when he walked then there was jim fletcher the expoliceman and pat smith the bookies son are they still about the town mr falkirk scratched his chin lets see cammy and willie are dead i know that so is fletcher benny and waggy are still around but theyre old men now and no threat id say to anyone pat smith sold his betting shop as soon as his father died and went off to canada with the girl who used to work behind the counter he left his wife more or less penniless if he ever comes back her brothers will do for him a rough lot they were does the name skipper mean anything to you the old man frowned with the effort of recollection skipper skipper yes of course he exclaimed there was skipper williamson do you not remember him he was a foot baller played for mother well in the reserves mostly unless they had a lot of injuries skinner sent his mind scanning through the lineups of early nineteenseventies football teams centrehalf he asked good in the air but not too great on the ground thats him i think his real name was cecil but everyone called him skipper after they made him captain of the reserves he liked a drink too but not in the pubs the foot ballers used to go to the exservicemens club they thought it was more discreet and come to think of it that was another of your brothers hangouts is he still around very much so but hes not in mother well any more other than at home games in the hospitality box he keeps at fir park he was a parttimer and had a good job in the steel works so he was able to save up all his football money like a lot of players in those days when he retired he bought a pub the old gaslight bar in windmillhill street he refitted it changed the name to the bluenose lounge and attracted all the rangers fans in the town since there are far more of them than there are mother well supporters he made a fortune so he bought another old pub in wishaw this time and did the same again eventually about fifteen years ago he sold both places to one of the big brewers and bought a hotel hes done very well in that too i hear do you know where pitlochry skinner felt a tiny chill ripple down his spine he wont find many bluenoses up there he murmured oh he isnt after that crowd any more hes gone upmarket these days his clients are fishermen twentynine as i see it maggie we dont have anywhere else to go after this said stevie steele keeping his voice low even though he and the detective superintendent were alone in the small waiting room the girl was there when the picture was unpacked she was there when the device was ignited even though she hadnt been invited to the ceremony as george regan has just confirmed with the practice manager at candela and finch okay we dont actually have her on camera pushing the button on the remote but weve got solid grounds for bringing her in regardless of what this guys going to say to us maybe so no certainly youre right she answered but for safetys sake i still want to speak to him the girls still an outpatient in terms of the mental health act if this thing ever does wind up in court i want to make sure theres no chance of our being accused of ignoring her rights as such and theres something else too whats that im not a onehundredpercent book operator stevie i have instincts and i pay heed to them until they prove unfounded my instinct here is that this solution is too bloody easy i cannot shake the feeling that theres a bigger picture excuse the bad analogy and that were not seeing it now tell me honestly dont you feel that too the young inspector flicked a white flake of dandruff from the lapel of his blazer show me an angle we havent covered maam he challenged did she have an opportunity to plant the device yes she did once cahal oreilly had verified its arrival in safe condition he and his secretary had to hurry back to george street from the rsa for an evening committee meeting they left andrea there no one at the gallery can remember her leaving or can say for sure that she didnt have access to the picture alone that part of the building isnt covered by cameras either as for the device it wasnt large she could have had it in her handbag and to top it all she asked if she could go to the arrival of the container from bilbao i know all that now answer the question steele gave her a sidelong killer grin yeah okay its on a bloody plate and im like you i get more satisfaction out of working for a living which is what youre really saying but consider this i havent even met this girl yet i feel sorry for her i dont want her to be the one who puts her away maybe for good dont you think that could be true with you as well maybe she conceded as the door opened and a tall man in his late twenties dressed in a white coat bustled into the waiting room sorry to keep you he exclaimed extending a hand to rose in greeting as the detectives stood im adam broadley andreas mentor he grinned okay im her shrink but i prefer to think of myself that way well talk here if its all right with you well get more privacy here fine said the superintendent im maggie rose and this is my colleague steven steele has the probation officer explained to you what it is we want to talk about not in detail but enough and youre okay about this from an ethical viewpoint sure youre police officers so you know andreas history already and you know the circumstances of her sectioning where im slightly uneasy is in talking to you without her being aware of the fact but ill reserve the right to stop if i feel that im going too far thats agreed said rose so lets get straight to it do you know where andrea is working with the church of scotland yes and you approve of that given her history i dont see anything wrong with it broadley answered in fact its probably a positive element in her treatment shes schizophrenic as you know split personality in oldfashioned terms but its a bloody awful description this illness can manifest itself in many ways but in this case the patient hears voices more and more these days people think that their computers are talking to them i call it the software syndrome andreas experience is more of the traditional type her fathers profession may have something to do with it for she gets the word straight from god a bit like joan of arc without the armour but with twentyfirstcentury weaponry instead steele pointed out the young man laughed true if st joan had had nuclear capability it would have shortened the hundred years war thats for sure but andrea strachan fortunately is not a very determined warrior if god was choosing someone for a mission hed look for someone more physically adept than her anyway to answer your question the fact that she is actually working in the hq of an established religion is on balance good for her in that it takes god out of her fantasy world and puts him into her everyday life what put the voice in her head in the first place rose asked what made her attack that church again i think her fathers profession may have something to do with it mr strachan is a very conservative christian he does not approve of un orthodoxy in any form its obvious to me that andreas picked that up from him and that in her mind its taken wings i understand the detective paused at this stage adam i think it would be best if i stopped asking questions and told you something when the holy trinity by isobel vargas went up in flames in the royal scottish academy on saturday andrea was right there in the room adam broadley looked up at the ceiling almost theatrically ohhh dear he said slowly you think its possible then i dont know for sure she responded very well to her early treatment and shes having no problems with her medication but that sort of experience or confrontation would still be pretty dangerous for her did it happen through her work rose nodded he frowned what sort of people is she working with in that case didnt they know of her psychiatric history not in that amount of detail you mean her father didnt tell them when he arranged the placement no he told them in broad terms what her illness was but he didnt tell them about the way in which it manifested itself and of course since the case was dealt with summarily in court and was barely reported there was no way in which they could reasonably have known about it other than from him bloody families broadley exclaimed no matter how enlightened or intelligent they are some of them still treat this illness like it was fucking excuse my french leprosy it makes me so angry he smacked a big fist into the palm of his other hand then grinned im still relatively new in my profession he exclaimed i still have normal emotional reactions i havent become infected by my patients yet listen i think i know what you want to ask me so ill save you the trouble yes i think you should interview andrea as soon as possible but with one proviso that i can be there maggie rose smiled that was going to be my next question she said thanks for volunteering thirty thats fine mr skinner you can ease down and stop now bob ignored the consultants call wearing only shorts and trainers he continued to pound along on the treadmill running on the spot but at fiveminutemile pace i said you can stop now peter patience repeated louder this time over the noise of the treadmill im enjoying this skinner replied sounding barely out of breath i do at least four miles every day good for you but can you please do the rest later my colleague and i need to look at the printouts from the various monitors you have attached to you and to do that wed like to switch the bloody things off okay dripping with sweat the patient nodded and reached out to touch a button on the control panel of the apparatus to ease down its speed he slowed it gradually until after around a minute he came to walking pace then stopped he stepped off the track and allowed hugh hurley the second consultant to strip the monitor pads from his bare torso is that us then he asked just about said patience he pointed to skinners back that scar is that where you were stabbed yes what about the two on your thigh front and back theyre where i was shot entry and exit wounds thats not on your medical history hurley exclaimed with a hint of suspicion no its not want to tell us about it no i do not if there were any aftereffects i wouldnt be able to run freely would i i suppose not okay well keep it off our report you do that now what sort of shape am i in the two consultants exchanged glances then smiles mr skinner patience began as you know very well you are in remarkable condition for a man in his thirties let alone one whos nearer fifty than forty you could and should have been returned to duty on the basis of the medical report which you brought back from america and we are prepared to confirm without reservation that you are fit to resume active duty immediately wed be saying that if you were a soldier never mind a senior police officer whose duties are assumed to be in the main sedentary theyre bloody not skinner grinned what else will your report say it will note that you were diagnosed after your incident in the us as suffering from what is commonly known as sick sinus syndrome in which the sinus node the hearts natural pacemaker malfunctions leading in your case to bradycardia slow heartbeat and loss of consciousness this condition may recur but it is quite possible that even without intervention you would never have had another episode we find no sign of it today in any event that eventuality has been rendered irrelevant by the fitting of a dual chamber pacemaker which is set to maintain your heart rate at a minimum level of fiftyfive beats per minute operating on demand that is only if and when your rate drops to that level youll get around ten years use out of it when the battery runs down a new one will be fitted maybe by then the batteries will last longer and that one will see you through to your eighties as for the rest of you your vision is virtually perfect with maybe a slight touch of astigmatism in your right eye your ears are prone to deposits of wax but otherwise your hearing is normal your urine is free of any diabetic indications your liver function is healthy and your prostate is not enlarged the consultant smiled the bottom line on this is that although were very happy to collect our fee this examination has been entirely unnecessary and demonstrates a significant degree of stupidity on the part of the police authority skinner shook his head not stupidity malice i dont think well go that far in our report its okay i wouldnt want you to or even to include the stupidity line on the face of it i just want to appear grateful for being returned to duty but at the same time pleased that the manpower committee were so concerned about my welfare once im back on the prowl theyll find out how i really feel about it he looked at the two cardiologists youll put all that in writing this evening said hurley and deliver it to mr laidlaw at curie anthony and jarvis first thing in the morning thats fine theres a timetable in place the chief constable has called in the authority chair and the chair of human resources to a meeting in his office at twelve noon when they get there theyll find that im the agenda in that case patience declared youll be back in your office by one pm skinner grinned as he picked up a towel and headed for the changing room only i wont be ive got other plans thirtyone she had fought against it all day she had found distractions insisting on taking mark to school herself to let trish have an easy start to her day taking jazz to the playground for an hour longer than she would normally have allowed him joining vigorously in his games until they were both too tired for more in the afternoon she had gone to collect mark and had spent time helping him with his homework although the reality was that her older son never needed anyones help he had covered in scotland some of the work he was doing at his american school and the rest came easily to him in the evening she had stood down trish for cooking duties even though it was her turn under their informal agreement and had made spaghetti bolognese mafiastyle as she called it as she remembered seeing it done in the godfather trilogy finally she ran out of excuses there was nothing else in her mind except ron and her need to see him it was so strong that she could actually feel it within her as an amputee will feel a phantom limb she waited until the children were asleep and until trish who had developed an unexpected interest in baseball had settled to watch an evening telecast of the yankees on the road at boston only then did she slip into her bathroom shower and make herself ready she chose a black thong a closefitting brown dress and the highheeled shoes that she had bought to match it that was all she didnt expect that she would need anything else she applied only light makeup and a coating of hairspray then slipped downstairs and out of the house both of her cars were standing in the driveway she would have taken her fathers beloved jaguar but she had the keys of the ford explorer in her bag and so she climbed in behind its steering wheel rons house was only ten minutes drive away from hers through the suburban streets of buffalo the daylight was fading and the traffic was light she saw few other vehicles along her route until she turned into sullivan street and saw the modest house just where the road curved it was a pleasant street ordinary in a comforting way the sort of vision that came to her mind in scotland when she allowed herself the luxury of thinking of home the homes were all built on generous but not huge plots of land they belonged to middle managers and professional people to teachers and public service administrators it was multiracial with blacks caucasians and hispanics living happily and harmoniously together she looked around as she drove slowly along past an elderly man walking his dog the movement of a car refocused her it was picking up a child from a house almost opposite rons balloons tied to a tree on its sloping lawn signified a party even in the dying light other children were playing on the grass and a woman was filming them with what she guessed was a camcorder she smiled as she flicked her indicator for all the war on terror her native land could still be a comforting place his flashy camaro was in the driveway at the sight of it she felt a surge of anticipation deep within her she parked the explorer behind it switched off the engine and took a deep breath as she put the car keys in her purse she saw his letter she took it out opened it and read it again it was barely light enough for her to see the page but she knew it off by heart god ron she whispered to herself if you had written this all those years ago where would we be now she frowned divorced probably his drawing a line under a career of success was one thing but she knew that giving it up would have been quite another there would have been another pressure too she would have had to compromise with her own career to limit her horizons to wherever he had practised law and perhaps to general medicine rather than her chosen specialty an ambition which had driven her all the way through med school within herself she knew that it would have been a disaster ron had been right to go to texas she had been right to chalk him up to experience and head for new york and then to her appointment with fate in the hypnotic shape of bob skinner in scotland when she had gone there she had only meant to stay for a couple of years but she had not counted on him no not at all she closed her eyes and for the first time that day bobs face appeared before her yet she could only see him angry as he was when he had left in spite of her pleas that he should stay with her in spite of her threats about the potential consequences of charging back to edinburgh in defence of a job which had almost killed him on more than one occasion where s the difference she thought he had done what ron had done back in the eighties chosen career over everything else wasnt it logical that she should do now as she had done then and let him get on with it and now ron was back back for good he had promised his life fulfilled and hers if she wanted him where there had been bitterness in her parting with bob there had been nothing but tenderness emotional and physical in her reunion with her second lover where bob had been adamant and uncompromising he had been flexible ready to see things her way and make a commitment to her alone and yet that was her husband as he had always been single minded determined courageous professionally outstanding and at the same time on more than one important crucial occasion emotionally blind there was nothing different about him the angry face in her minds eye was that of the man she had married and had been all along would his life ever be fulfilled she thought of ron in their first relationship it had been all excitement now it was all tenderness she thought of the years that would stretch ahead with him peaceful and content with not a ripple on the surface of their smooth waters then she thought of bob and saw towering whitetopped waves sarah stepped out of the explorer and walked up to ron neidholms front door she felt herself shaking in anticipation as she pressed the bell as nervous as she had been on their first encounter in college when she had wanted him with an urgency she had never suspected had lain within her there was no answer evening had given way almost entirely to darkness but she realised that there were no lights within the house ron was either in his den maybe with his headphones on or possibly he had gone for an evening run she peered into her bag once again and found the key he had given her she unlocked the door and opened it eleven ninetyone she said aloud recalling the code he had given her in the expectation that the alarm would need to be deactivated but there was no warning buzz it had not been set ron she called as she stepped inside she listened for his feet on the stairs from above or from the cellar as he rushed to greet her but there was no sound no shouted reply the door to his den lay directly in front of her across the hall she opened it but saw at once that it was in darkness she looked into his living room in case he was asleep in his chair but it was empty she ran upstairs to his bedroom in case he was in the shower but it was neat with no discarded clothes on the floor and no discordant country song coming from the bathroom with more than a touch of frustration she went back downstairs to await his return on impulse she stepped into the kitchen to make herself a coffee throwing open the door and switching on the light in a single movement ron was there he was lying on his back his head almost at her feet he was stretched out massively on the kitchen floor staring sightlessly up at the ceiling the hilt of a knife protruded from his chest all of its blade was embedded in him and most of the front of his yellow polo shirt had been dyed dark red by his blood sarah had seen countless dead people inside and out through her career as had been the case when bob had collapsed none of that counted for anything she threw her hands to her face and screamed as she had in the cemetery there she had been surrounded by friends there had been people to come to her aid here she had nobody to turn to she was gripped by hysteria she screamed again and again until she felt her stomach begin to heave instinct alone made her run to the back door she threw it open and vomited out into the garden from somewhere in the distance she seemed to hear a mans voice hey lady is everything all right over there it asked nervously the hell it is came a loud reply a woman this time move your ass mort call the friggin police thirtytwo have your guys taken a formal statement from brother aidan skinner asked yes andy martin replied rod went to see him himself yesterday afternoon did he sharpen up on his description of the guy skipper i told you about no if anything he was probably vaguer than when you saw him he couldnt swear to a thing about the man other than his age bracket around the same as your brothers have you picked up any other leads up there none the whole things a mass of uncertainties we cant even be certain that michael went into the tay there are various tributaries flowing into it theres the tummel for example that flows through pitlochry when the snows melted and the flood began the whole river system was in spate so he could have been dumped in the water in pitlochry and wound up in perth in theory yes martin admitted not above the hydro dam though he wouldnt have got past that they did open the sluice to increase the flow of water out of the reservoir but a body would have been trapped so what have you got that youre phoning me first thing in the morning if it was just to say hello youd have done it by now ive got the postmortem report the pathologist was a bit slower than id have liked but i agree well have thoroughness before speed every time so whats the verdict you want all of it of course we dont have a homicide investigation of any sort skinner whistled i dont know whether to be happy or sad about that he said eventually he drowned then no what was the cause of death michael died of a heart attack all his main arteries were clogged up to hell and he had a failing valve his liver was also in the sort of condition youd expect from someone whod had an alcohol dependency for at least forty years the pathologist said that he could have died at any moment but that he did just over a week before discovery the condition of the body shows that he was put into the river shortly after death no doubt about that the marks on the body what about them professor hutchison agrees with you about the mark on the wrist that he was probably wearing a leather watch strap and bloating of the body resulting from immersion could have stretched it to breaking point we didnt find a watch at miss bonneys but it could have come off anywhere what about the head wound what about the bruising to the body they were all pre mortem apart from the head wound that was inflicted after death possibly by something he hit in the river the other bruising was largely superficial analysis showed a significant amount of alcohol in the bloodstream joe hutchison says that the bruising could have been caused by him falling while drunk and rolling downhill i asked him about your claw hammer scenario all he would say was maybe stomach contents jesus bob martin exclaimed do you want to go that far yes andy i want to know everything if you insist he ate poached wild salmon haunch of venison well hung mashed potatoes and turnip and rum baba shortly before he died washed down with a significant amount of pretty good claret the prof said that meal alone could have been enough to kill a man in his condition sexual activity are you serious yes bob surely my brother was homosexual andy what if the man who took him away from oak lodge was someone from that area of his past man you were sixteen when he left and you never saw him again how do you know that i just do okay okay there is no mention in the report of any signs of sexual activity or of any sexually transmitted disease or infestation maybe he did go off to live happily every after but theres no evidence of it skinner sighed so what have we got not a murder certainly said martin nor is there any physical evidence that might support a charge of culpable homicide in theory those bruises could have been a beating and he could have had his coronary as a result but the prof said that they were a couple of days old at the time of death could he have fallen in the drink and had his attack as a result did you ask that yes and joe discounted it he said that there would have been some ingestion or inhalation of river water even with that scenario but there wasnt any yeah okay skinners disappointment was clear in his voice he didnt put himself in the river martin continued weve established that but even then all ive got as a potential charge is concealing a death which ranks pretty low on the priority list of cid in a small police force meaning youre scaling down your investigation skinner asked quietly as you would do in the same circumstances true so you wont mind if i go looking for this skipper bloke on my own it was martins turn to heave a sigh and i could stop you could i he exclaimed thirtythree adam broadley was in a consulting room rather than a waiting room when rose and steele returned to the royal edinburgh hospital on tuesday morning they had accepted the clinicians suggestion that rather than risk terrifying his sensitive patient by arriving at her home unannounced he should ask her to come to see him so that he could explain what was going to happen andrea strachan was seated behind a table when broadley led them in to see her she wore a dark twinset and her shoulders were hunched her eyes had a glassy look as she peered up at them she had been with the police before and when he introduced them she was frightened maggie rose tried at once to put her at her ease this is a routine interview miss strachan she began but given your recent illness adam thought that it would be best if it took place in his presence we had no problem agreeing to that normally a discussion like this would be recorded these days but this morning inspector steele will just take notes so if i can explain what its about you dont have to the woman exclaimed in a shrill voice that fell not far short of a screech im mentally ill not mentally deficient i know what this is it has to do with that ridiculous painting going up in smoke this is haul in the loony and pin it on her steele leaned forward and looked her in the eye kindly he hoped no its not andrea he said we dont have a remit to find a scapegoat here if we did youd be in a smelly room in torphichen place not here in adams office she seemed to soften very slightly go on then she muttered what is it about then the inspector looked to rose seated on his right recognising that their subject seemed to respond better to a man she nodded and leaned back in her chair first of all he resumed i want to get some things clear so that you can understand at least whats brought us here is that fair i suppose good first and foremost then you were there when the picture was burned werent you yes and youd seen it before when you went with mr oreilly and mrs laing to take delivery at the academy yes fine thats established next i want to tell you something and then i want to ask you something but i want to make it clear that i am making no accusation just establishing facts what i have to tell you is that the painting was ignited by an incendiary device triggered remotely thats what you would say andrea retorted some of us would say that it was gods punishment steele and rose saw adam broadleys forehead clench in an involuntary frown at her comment but it went unnoticed by the girl who was seated beside him if it was said the inspector with a soft smile he still used an incendiary we found pieces of its casing afterwards for a second he thought that andrea smiled back at him but if she did it was so fleeting that it was gone in less than a second now he continued to what i want to ask you you have an honours in chemistry i know would you have the capability of making such a device in the event that god told me to do it is that what you mean no it was a straight question but you can frame it any way you like she made a small exasperated sound you know i could because i did it before when i tried to burn that holy roller place last year but let me save you a question i didnt i wasnt necessarily going there andrea not much steele grinned in part at the girl but mainly to preserve their fragile rapport well maybe i was but first i was going to ask you what you thought of the vargas trinity some people thought it was blasphemous did you funnily enough i didnt i saw it as a feminist joke thats all god doesnt actually have a sex mankind was made in gods image not just a man yet hes been depicted as male thats more of a blasphemy in a way hes referred to in male terms but thats purely a convenience what vargas was saying was that if you see god as a woman then since christ was made in her image too then all three the holy spirit included had to be women a joke you see a bad joke i admit expressed in an execrably bad painting but not something that would move god to destroy it this time she looked steele in the eye and held his gaze i see he said slowly but what about those holy rollers this is a genuine question by the way andrea no tricks im interested what made them blasphemous in your eyes she seemed to bridle and he thought for a moment that the thread tying them together had snapped the way they carry on of course she answered her voice rising have you seen the pagan way in which these people purport to worship god all that handclapping and wailing and yelling all that calling attention to themselves they are approaching god without any humility as if he was a celebrity of some sort rather than the lord of creation before whom we should all bow down our heads their practices bring him into disrepute and thats why he called me to destroy their temple broadley laid a hand softly on her arm she shook it off oh all right adam she said crossly i accept that i was ill i accept that i still am but you have to accept that gods call was real to me at the time and that it still is just as it was real when he spoke to me again on friday yes i know its part of my illness but it still has reality for me and it is natural for me to obey him the physician looked at the detectives for a second steele thought he was about to intervene and silenced him with a quick chilling glare lets get this straight andrea he continued quietly god spoke to you again on friday you say she looked at him with a calmness that was almost serene a total contrast to her attitude fifteen minutes earlier yes how this time it was on the telephone she told him how did he speak to you before last time it was through the television when it was switched off other times its been through the speakers of my stereo theres nothing odd about him using the phone will you tell me what happened of course i was at home alone as usual when the phone rang or seemed to i picked it up and he was on the other end how did you know it was him she smiled at him and for the first time he noticed that behind all that severity she was actually very pretty do you mean did he say hello andrea this is god no of course not he doesnt need to hes in my head i know that now so when it happens i just accept it okay so what did he say he said that he had a task for me he said that he wanted me to go to the opening of the exhibition on saturday there would be a purpose to it he said i would be his witness what did you say dont be daft inspector you listen to god you dont talk to him sorry so you went to the opening ceremony of course how did you get in without a ticket id been there before the security people all knew me i just waved and went in we saw you on the videotapes you looked apprehensive i was for all i knew we were all going to be smitten with thunderbolts when it happened when the picture went up were you surprised she gave him that smile again this time with her eyes as well as her mouth inspector steele i suppose i was the only person in that room who wasnt but you did not do anything to set off that device and you did not create and plant it no i did not as i told you this time i was only a witness i suppose i was such an awful instrument against the baptists that god felt he couldnt trust me again steele grinned back at her for a few seconds they simply looked at each other saying nothing is that it asked broadley eventually because if it is andrea strachan turned to look at him steele thought of a butterfly emerged from its chrysalis i know adam she said you dont have to say it youd like me to stay with you for a few more weeks the young clinician looked almost grateful id hope it wont be weeks but yes i would like you to spend some time with me if you wish i know better than to argue anyway youre as persuasive as the inspector here can you fetch my medication and some clothes from my place weve got medication here but ill have a nurse get some clothes for you come on ill find you a room she stood and the detectives followed suit just as she was leaving the room steele called out to her andrea just one more thing she stopped and looked back after god had finished speaking to you last friday what happened what do you mean how did the call end he said what he had to say and then he was gone what did you hear after that a dialling tone that was all mmm steele mused in that case didnt it strike you as odd that god should hang up his phone she left them with a shade of doubt in her eyes for the first time since they had met stevie maggie rose exclaimed as the door closed that was most impressive a master class in interviewing well done he blinked and looked at her as if he had heard not a word she had said sorry ah never mind what do you think youre the boss whats your take she probably did it but we have no witnesses to her planting the device or igniting it we could maybe search her home under warrant and find something that could have been the triggering device but wed still be a mile short of making a case as it is shes under psychiatric care again so shes no risk do you agree steele scratched his chin remember what we were saying yesterday about things being too easy he asked her well this is im sorry but i just dont think she did it i am quite sure she had a phone call on friday and im even more certain that it wasnt from god andreas been handed to us on a plate by some clever bastard who doesnt want us to take this investigation any further if you want me to buy that youre going to have to order me but even then i dont think i can rose smiled are you sure you havent just fallen in love maybe i have but thats got nothing to do with it i can still spot a setup when i see one thirtyfour the pervasive example of bob skinner who often said that the uniform was the last thing that had made him join the police service may have made him less of a stickler but sir james proud still enjoyed wearing his he felt that it was part of his rank and also that it let the people under his command know that he had respect for his job and through it for them he prepared himself for his scheduled meeting as always in the private bathroom of his office suite he ran a comb through his crinkly silver hair checked that his tie was straight and finally turned to his uniform jacket he held it up for inspection then spotting a flaw brushed a few specks from the shoulders finally when he was ready he slipped it on he looked in the mirror as he fastened the heavy silver buttons one by one there was a time when he had had to strain to fasten the middle one but the warning shot that nature had fired across his bows a year or two earlier had changed all that now the jacket was too slack if anything he might have to think about having it taken in or maybe even order a new one he would have enough time left in post to get the wear out of it just as well for he wouldnt be handing it on the man who would be his successor was wider in the shoulders than him sir james gave himself one last appraising look although he intended that it would be brief this was a meeting for which he wanted to be at his most impressive yes jimmy he said satisfied at last you are the very model of an oldfashioned chief constable turning sharply on his heel he strode out of his sanctuary and into his office the two lawyers were waiting for him seated at his meeting table mitchell laidlaw representing bob skinner and tom hogg a respected solicitor from a small glasgow firm from which he sought independent legal advice on behalf of the force when the need arose he looked from one to the other as he took his seat behind his desk at hogg small sharpfaced sharpeyed sharpwitted then at laidlaw the physical opposite bulky although it occurred to sir james that he had seen him look more portly round face darkhaired with eyes that seemed never to blink and a gaze which gave the clear message that here was a mind which never worked at less than maximum capacity good morning gentlemen the chief constable greeted his visitors sorry to keep you waiting i was just fixing my makeup are the trains running all right this morning tom he asked the glaswegian i gave up on them long ago the solicitor replied i use the m for all its uncertainties its still a better bet if you have an appointment to keep sad but true eh how about you mitch traffic moving smoothly in edinburgh was it i took a taxi jimmy just to be sure no way did i want to be late for this one your implied criticism is noted he glanced at his watch is your client ready to join us i suppose hes paying his respects to miss mcconnell or checking up on ds mcgurk laidlaw pursed his lips my client will not be joining us jimmy we discussed the matter of his attendance on balance he agreed with my view that it might be better if he did not come face to face with councillor maley im here to present his position and also to do any barking that might be necessary if bob was present himself it might prove hard to restrain him from joining in should there be any resistance to our proposition mind you he was easier to persuade than he might have been had he not been preoccupied with the death of his brother yes that came out of the blue it must be disturbing for bob in all sorts of ways theres this local problem his sir james hesitated as he searched for a suitable word difficulties in the states and then all the old family skeletons this has brought out of the cupboard i never knew bob had a brother laidlaw confessed my firms never handled his family business or i might have alexis did though although not from her father she found out by accident she told me yesterday when i commiserated with her over it he didnt tell sarah i know that said the chief constable as a matter of fact i was one of the few people who knew about him outside the community in which the skinner family lived since michael disappeared from there thirty years ago his existence will have come as a surprise to just about everyone bob chose to tell me when i made him head of cid he said that he felt that as such he could not have any secrets from his chief constable proud jimmy sighed he could from his wife and daughter though which tells you rather a lot about his attitude to his job and the lengths to which hell go to defend it at least we can try to resolve that matter for him today he glanced at his watch lets see if the ladies are here he picked up one of his phones pressed a button and spoke to his civilian secretary gerry crossley are we ready he asked yes sir the young man replied the councillors are waiting in reception thanks ask them to join us please and send in the tea since his health scare sir james had given up coffee it was no longer served in his office and if he had had his way it would have been banned from the senior officers dining room also less than a minute later the door at the far end of the room opened the three men stood as councillors marcia topham and agnes maley entered the contrast between the two women was so marked that it was hard to imagine them as political colleagues councillor topham was middleaged but managed to maintain her elegance in the face of the bulk that proud had watched grow over the years councillor maley was short and squat with short dark hair and distinctly unfeminine eyebrows below a low forehead where the formers manner bordered on diffidence the latters was full of undisguised aggression agnes maley had been a councillor for many years and for most of them she had served on the police authority for a brief dark period in the days of the old regional councils she had been its chair although she had once been famous as a leftwing firebrand she had somehow moved with the times and had held on to her citycentre powerbase despite the revolution within her party proud had succeeded once in having her removed from the authority but after the last round of elections she had engineered a comeback and had infuriated the chief by seizing the chair of the human resources committee by a mix of trickery and intimidation within the majority group the grapevine had it that after the next council polls she would replace the moderate mrs topham as chair of the authority itself she bridled when she saw the two lawyers and would have tackled the chief constable head on had not maisie the dining room waitress forestalled her by rolling in a trolley loaded with cups a big steel teapot and plates of plain biscuits it took only a few minutes for the tea to be poured and distributed and for the biscuits to be passed round as soon as maisie had left the room councillor maley opened fire right chief she demanded brusquely ignoring topham completely whats this about and a good day to you also ms maley said sir james with glacial courtesy and to you marcia he softened visibly as he nodded to the authority chair thank you for coming on short notice this meeting has been called at the request of mr mitchell laidlaw of curie anthony and jarvis who is acting for deputy chief constable skinner tom hoggs here to advise me and you ladies if necessary on the authoritys legal position maley twitched with inner fury at the gender reference councillors please she muttered why wasnt i given notice of the agenda because i chose not to give you any mitchell do you want to open laidlaw nodded thank you sir james he said noticeably more formal than before he took five documents from his briefcase and gave one to each person at the table id like to begin by asking you to read that report carefully its an exhaustive report on the present physical condition of deputy chief constable skinner prepared by mr peter patience and mr hugh hurley consultant cardiologists at edinburgh royal infirmary following an examination which took place yesterday evening at the murrayfield hospital mmm marcia topham murmured nervously the chief gave the lead picking up his copy and beginning to read but maley left hers on the table this isnt relevant she protested the deputy chief constable has to be examined by the forces official medical officer hes said that hes going to give him a month more to recover before he looks at him that is not strictly true councillor proud intervened it was your subcommittee that instructed the mo to wait for a month your minutes may not be publicly accessible but i can see them at any time thank you chief laidlaw said that was my understanding also from my client it is his position that a delay is unnecessary and unreasonable further it is his belief that it has been imposed to give your subcommittee time to rush through changes to local standing orders which would ban arbitrarily any officer who underwent the procedure that he experienced recently from ever returning to work regardless of their physical condition or prognosis he fixed maley with a piercing stare ill be blunt with you if you refuse to read that report im going to ask councillor topham as chair of the authority to assume executive responsibility for this matter and to exclude you from this meeting if she refuses i will be in the court of session at two pm where i will be granted i promise you an interdict compelling the authority to deal with this matter now you cant do that the darkhaired councillor shouted this is a committee matter nonsense said the chief constable sharply this is not an appointment its an administrative matter and either of you have executive power he turned to the other solicitor tom whats your advice on the matter at issue do you think mitch is bluffing when he assures us hell get his interdict hogg picked up the report if this says what i assume it does i think its ninetyfive per cent certain that interdict would be granted ordering you to deal with this now i think it is onehundredandtenper cent certain that the court would forbid you from making any changes in your regulations that might affect mr skinner in advance of receiving a report on his medical condition my advice is read the report now and deal with it now to do otherwise would be seen as perverse and might even lay individuals open to a civil action raised by dcc skinner proud looked directly at councillor topham ignoring agnes maley completely marcia he said youve had independent legal advice now im not asking you to get into the issue of whether the subcommittees decision to defer bob skinners medical might have been motivated by antipathy towards him by certain members we dont really want to go there i am asking you as chair to consider the reputation of the authority and your own position should you find its actions condemned by the supreme court are we going to deal with this matter now mrs topham glanced to her left no councillor the chief exclaimed firmly im asking you alone will you read that report she looked at the document then up at sir james once more i suppose she murmured i suppose we must agnes maley slapped the table ah bugger the report she snapped we all know its a whitewash without even reading it okay councillor okay sir james you reinstate the man but just you remember this my times coming and it wont be in the chair of the police authority either theres a byelection for one of the edinburgh seats in the scottish parliament due next month and guess whos going to be nominated as the labour candidate as soon as its called once im an msp ill sort you buggers out she glared at laidlaw and your client will be top of my list i promise you that she threw the report back across the table and stalked from the room in the echo of the slamming door the chief constable looked at mrs topham is that true marcia he asked is that woman really going to the parliament surely to god your party organisation cant let that happen the councillor was trembling slightly as she replied i dont think it can prevent it james agnes maley has a pretty effective power base in edinburgh none of the new brooms in our headquarters or even in london have been able to sweep her away in theory her selection for the vacancy could be vetoed but it wont be there arent the grounds she pursed her lips agnes is a dangerous woman all right and shell be even more so when she gets to holyrood thirtyfive stevie are you sure about this asked george regan i mean its so bloody obvious that the strachan girls the one for this job she had the opportunity shes a nutter with a religious kink shes got a track record for fireraising and she was there when it happened with a personal invite she says from god but no you dont think she did it are you kidding me or what steele had had enough regan had been complaining for half an hour since they had begun to review all the notes made and interviews transcribed after the royal scottish academy fire no sergeant he said heavily im ordering you to shut the hell up and get on with it if you cant do that feel free to go and see detective superintendent rose and take it up with her shell probably arrange for you to swap jobs with young sauce that would suit me for frankly probationer or not hed be more use to me in here right now and youd be more use to the force in uniform and out on the reception desk regan threw him a daggerfilled look but steele stared him down what are we looking for then he asked grudgingly and still grumpily were after anything that interviewees saw that was odd we were so hot after the girl when we spotted her there that we didnt give these statements any more than a cursory glance im not surprised god talks to the girl stevie steele grinned at his persistence george enough aye okay he picked up a folder we are looking into that by the way the inspector added what gods phone call maggies checking it out shes got his number has she or does her old man they tell me hes got plenty of numbers in his book steele caught a flicker in regans eye if you mean what i think you do george you should make a point of forgetting any rumours youve heard you dont want to mess with mario no way not at all he doesnt bother me dont get in his way or he will and dont let the boss hear you talk about him either in case she takes it personally one of those twos going to be the next head of cid when dan pringle goes you want to remember that so what steele was about to tell him when his phone rang he picked it up with a touch of relief that the conversation had been brought to an end before regan could say any more stevie said a familiar voice its jack detective sergeant jack mcgurk had recently been appointed as bob skinners executive assistant during the dccs absence in the us he sounded excited and steele hoped that he could guess the reason hes back mcgurk exclaimed its official the big man is back in post the chiefs just had me in and told me he was reinstated by the chair of the police authority after a private meeting this morning he saw the buggers off stevie i had a feeling something was going to happen today neil mcllhenney called into my office this morning and warned me to stay close did the chief say anything else no but he had to stop himself from grinning all over his face is he back in the office now not yet it might be a few days before he is given what happened to his brother and everything else steele wondered what everything else might be but he knew better than to ask with george regan within earshot the sergeant looked across at him and raised an eyebrow steele nodded hung up and went through to maggie roses office he knocked on the door and walked in before he could open his mouth she smiled at him i know she said mario just called me he had it from neil five minutes ago batman is back in action which means that very soon we are going to have an anxious dan pringle and maybe even acc haggerty wondering whats going on with the academy investigation good point id better get back and crack the whip even harder over george rose looked up at him from behind her desk she was still smiling do that anyway but ive got some more good news for you ive just had the result of the check i told you i was going to run with bt ive also had adam broadley confirm with andrea that she didnt have any other calls on friday apart from the one from god that is it seems that as the ads used to say hes every onetoone youve ever had when he called andrea he used his mobile and guess what else when hes not presiding over all of creation hes a trainee solicitor with candela and finch thirtysix although he lived by the sea and owned a villa in spain where people cast lines into any stretch of running water bob skinner had never been a fisherman standing thighdeep in water waiting for hours for a shortsighted salmon to make a fatal mistake may have been fine for the queen mother but it had never held any attraction for him his sporting tastes were all much more physical nevertheless he knew how serious a business salmon fishing was in scotland and with the royal connections how powerful a lobby its enthusiasts could be skipper williamson was doing well out of them that was for sure his fishing hotel called fir park lodge a nod skinner knew to the football club that had started him on the road was situated not far north of perth near the town of birnam skinner had found it without difficulty on several of the many websites that attract anglers from around the world to perthshire throughout the salmon season he had driven north in sarahs freelander rather that his own bmw in case there was a need for fourwheeldrive capability but the hotel was easily accessible he had found it without difficulty now sat in a layby on the a he could see it clearly as he looked down through a gap in the trees he trained his binoculars on its main entrance then used their zoom to pan out fir park lodge stood in several acres of ground it was a nineteenthcentury grey stone country house with a turret on each of its four corners there was a wide lawn in front and to the left a car park in which stood two big toyota offroaders and a minibus beyond them skinner saw a rolls royce and a small white mercedes aclass he zoomed in again and saw the house in miniature on a corporate crest on the mercs front door panel from the vehicles he guessed that skipper williamson had guests and that they were probably at lunch before heading back to the river behind the lodge he could see it sparkle his web research had told him that williamson owned rights on that stretch of the tay but that his visitors placed with him by a variety of tour companies were ferried around to other beats and other rivers he sat in the freelander and waited the call from mitch laidlaw had come through on his cellphone an hour earlier but he had forgotten it already now that his job was secure it was no longer his top priority skinner had done some research on cecil skipper williamson through a contact in the general register office introduced to him by his friend jim glossop before his retirement he had learned that he was fiftynine years old and that he had been married briefly in his late thirties and early forties that marriage had ended on grounds of irretrievable breakdown the big detective found himself wondering why he sat in sarahs car with only a very rough plan of action he had thought of simply walking into the hotel and introducing himself to williamson to see if that would trigger a panic in the man but had discarded that if the man had been responsible for his brothers death or even if he had simply disposed of his body for some bizarre reason it was likely that he would be expecting a visit from someone sooner or later he had thought also of interviewing a member of the hotel staff he had run a check that morning through a private contact in the department of social security and knew that fir park lodge had five fulltime employees a resident housekeeper two kitchenmaids a waitress and a handyman his name was angus dabo and a few years before he had done time in perth prison for housebreaking he wondered whether skipper would know that before he braced dabo though if he did there was something he wanted to do first he had visited the mother well times where the helpful editor had found a photograph of skipper williamson from his archives the only one the paper held it was thirtythree years old and it had been on newsprint one of a sea of faces in a preseason team picture the journalist had photocopied it extracted williamson and blown up his image as far as possible but it was still grey and barely recognisable even to someone who had known him in those days he had visited mother well football club itself but had found a modern business whose records did not stretch to reserve sides from the sixties other than in the passport office and it would raise too many questions if he asked there as far as skinner could ascertain there was no uptodate photograph of the man anywhere on the public record before he did anything else he planned to take one and to show it to brother aidan if the old cleric identified him as michaels visitor then he would pick up dabo and put the thumbscrews on him he started the freelander and pulled out on to the a a hundred yards along he made a left turn on to a minor road winding downhill away from birnam a small plain signpost marked the entrance to the lodge grounds he pulled up on the verge and leaned over to recover his camera bag from the back seat he was fairly certain that williamson was at home the rolls was his he had been driving it when he had picked up a fixed penalty six months earlier skinner fitted a telephoto lens to his nikon his plan was to hide in the woods that surrounded the hotel and its lawn and to snatch photographs of every man who showed his face outside hopefully williamson would wave his guests off after lunch and would be easy to spot unless of course he was fishing with them himself which would be the big detective conceded a bit of a bugger he locked the car and slipped into the grounds of fir park lodge past the plain wooden sign he left the drive at once and made his way through the thick untended woodland towards the big house he was almost there when his cellphone rang in his trouser pocket shit he whispered thankful that its sound was muffled because of his pacemaker he no longer carried it in the breast pocket of his shirt where it would have been all too audible he took it out quickly and was about to switch it off when he remembered that he was back on the active list there was just the possibility that it might be the chief he hid behind the thickest tree he could see and answered the voice in his ear sounded not a bit like sir james proud it was american east coast perhaps a trace of massachusetts is that bob skinner it asked yes he answered quietly although there was no one to hear him everyone was still inside the hotel this is clyde oakdale bob skinner frowned oakdale was the acting senior partner of sarahs late fathers law firm he was handling personally the winding up of leo and susannahs joint estate of which skinner himself was coexecutor but there was something in the lawyers voice that told him this call was not about an estate matter at once he saw the future stretching out before him legal separation a property split a custody battle unless he agreed to his children becoming in effect americans and if he did years of shuttling across the atlantic to visit them until it all became too much trouble yes clyde he said wearily bob the lawyer continued heavily i have some very disturbing news for you let me guess its about sarah yes it is how did you guess call it intuition i think maybe you should talk to my solicitor rather than me bob oakdale exclaimed testily i dont know what you mean by that but whatever it is it seems were not connecting up here now just shut up will you by making this call i am breaking a direct client instruction but what the hell you need to know regardless so please listen to me sarah has been arrested you what skinner exploded forgetting for the moment where he was you heard me she is being held by the detective division of the erie county sheriffs department for questioning about the murder of mr ron neidholm ron neidholm that name rings a bell bob frowned as he searched his memory yes babs walker told me about him pro foot baller he and sarah had a thing at college thats the man big ron is quite a local hero hence theres a real shitstorm about his killing ive tried to speak to brad dekker the sheriff but he wont take my calls what happened at about nine yesterday evening the police were called by neighbours to a disturbance in mr neidholms house they found him dead in the kitchen with a knife in his chest and sarah standing over the body when she calmed down she told them that she had found him like that but they arrested her straight away and took her in and shes still there yes theyre talking about charging her where are you youre with her arent you im a civil lawyer bob i have john vranic our firms top courtroom attorney there with her cant he get her released on bail i mean oh this is fucking nonsense the district attorneys office is not being compliant on this one said oakdale the da is a friend of mine so he went a little further with me than they have with john her prints are on the knife bob as clear as day youre kidding me i wish i was as the lawyer paused skinner heard the sound of a door opening across the lawn he ignored it instead he started marching back towards the road bob oakdale went on sarah didnt want me to call you i cant think why but she said she didnt want you involved but i had to call you for the childrens sake if nothing else if necessary i can justify it ethically through your position as coexecutor of her parents will fuck ethics the policeman snarled if you hadnt id have killed you tell your man vranic from me to get her out of there put the whole estate up as a bail bond if you have to but get her released he came to the public road and broke into a run towards the car ill be out there just as soon as i can by tomorrow morning your time at the latest you call dekker or eddie brady his chief of detectives you tell whichever of them you get that i am coming and that when i get there i want to see every scrap of their case against my wife ill do that said oakdale and ill do everything i can to get her bail today even if i have to put her before a judge to do it you just try to stay calm calm fuck calm thats long gone ill work on staying merely angry and you can tell brad dekker that too see you he unlocked the car and slid behind the wheel just as the two toyota landcruisers pulled out of the fir park lodge driveway skinner cast not a glance in their direction he was fully occupied calling up a number on his phone a few seconds later his call was answered neil he said urgently this is bob i should call mcgurk with this but i dont know him well enough besides its more personal than business shit its all personal im in perthshire i have to call in on andy then im back down the road pronto i want you to get on to the travel agent and book me on the first possible flight to new york with onward connection to buffalo economy business class first i dont care just get me on it if you can get my keys from alex shes in her edinburgh office and go out to gullane pick up my passport and pack me some clothes not even when his anger over the threat to his job was at its hottest had neil mcllhenney ever heard his friend so agitated okay bob ill do all that but what is it whats up ill tell you when i see you man right now i dont have the time his voice shook with rage or the selfcontrol better you dont know anyway that way alex cant bully it out of you this is something ill have to tell her in person too thirtyseven i appreciate the urgency of your enquiries superintendent said david candela but couldnt this have waited until close of business couldnt you have interviewed the chap at home i could also have sent my colleague detective sergeant regan maggie rose answered george would have marched straight up to your reception desk flashed his warrant card and demanded to see mr sheringham there and then thats his style i find him quite a useful blunt instrument when im dealing with an awkward customer with you involved though mr candela i thought it would be more appropriate if i came along myself with inspector steele and asked you to arrange for us to speak to the man in private the autocratic senior partner was mollified yes of course he said at once i appreciate your discretion you say this is a purely routine interview it is if it was otherwise wed be seeing him on our premises not yours im sure very well let me show you to one of our conference rooms then ill fetch eric thanks since were being discreet before you do that could you tell us something about him for example is he quiet or extrovert i dont really know a lot about him candela confessed he leaned back in his chair and put his hands behind his head steele glanced around his office taking it in there was a flatscreen computer terminal on a corner of the big desk yet somehow it seemed to be balanced on the other side by a photo of a man in uniform set in an ornate antique frame the total effect was surprisingly traditional in a modern building as if it had been designed to give the feel of twohundredyearold values in a twentyfirstcentury environment young sheringham is one of our last round of graduate recruits that means hell be bright you can assume that because we rarely take lower than a first when we do our university trawl the reason i dont know much about him is that weve put him in our family department so i dont come across his work im a corporate partner myself as well as being top dog around here that is i may have been a late entrant to the firm and there may be the family tradition but ive got into this chair on merit youre still a fullservice firm then asked steele apart from buying and selling houses we got out of that line of work when we moved up here best left to the estate agents and those solicitor firms who are clinging on to traditional offices come on suddenly candela pushed himself to his feet ill install you and fetch the boy he led them out of his office and along a corridor its walls were glazed allowing them to see into a modern openplan office with an imaginative layout which meant that no employee was directly looking on to the desk of another they could see across the floor and through the windows on the far side on the other side of the western approach road steele noticed that several windows on one floor of the block opposite were shattered it was dark and deserted although the floors above and below were bright and buzzing with action whats that he asked casually thats the scene of the other fire on saturday the solicitor told him their bad luck that the academy fire was first and on a saturday candela led them round a corner then stopped at a beech wood door in here he said showing them into a small windowless room with a round meeting table and six chairs and two peter howson prints on the walls wont be a minute said the solicitor closing the door behind him it reopened a few minutes later and a young man came in alone eric sheringham was tall and fairhaired he wore a white shortsleeved shirt and dark trousers that looked as if they were part of a suit the detectives knew that as a graduate trainee he would be no more than in his early twenties but he looked older his eyes were pale blue and very vivid like andy martins maggie thought if another colour she wondered if he too wore contact lenses mr candela said you wanted to see me he began they looked for signs of nervousness but saw none yes mr sheringham please sit down she introduced herself and steele what can i do for you the wouldbe lawyer asked politely stevie steele looked back at him unsmiling were investigating the arson attack that took place on saturday at the opening of the art exhibition that your firm is sponsoring oh that pretty spectacular wasnt it and pretty criminal said rose sharply quite apart from the potential danger to life from panic as much as from the fire that painting was insured for half a million pounds wow that much sheringham looked impressed but not rattled you dont care about it then the superintendent felt herself approaching her annoyance threshold not much ive seen better at the endofyear exhibition at the lauriston art school i dont think ms rose was talking about its artistic merit said steele with a half smile i think she was talking more about the principle of arson are you against that the young man smiled back im against arson in principle but lets just say id get more worked up about some fires than others this one rated pretty low on my personal scale of outrage apart from the fact that i was there of course yes you were werent you we noticed that from the list of interviewees your statement was pretty brief you said you didnt see anything thats right i was on reception i had to stay at my post during the ceremony and mr candelas speech to register any latecomers all i saw were peoples backs do you know a woman called andrea strachan rose asked suddenly eric sheringham blinked she thought she saw the first flicker of uncertainty in his eyes no he answered quietly you sure you were at edinburgh university at the same time you overlapped there for a couple of years he paused rose knew that he was either searching his memory or covering his tracks yes he announced at last sorry i did know an andrea strachan she was a chemist and she used to take part in union debates she dressed like my mothers auntie and she used to stand up and preach at everyone in a funny high voice yet she never spoke to anyone directly apart from then we called her the dormouse like in the mad hatters tea party you remember the dormouse wakes up every so often says something then goes back to sleep is that the woman you mean that sounds like her did she speak to you on saturday at the opening ceremony i never saw her at the ceremony sheringham shot back quickly maybe too quickly steele thought so you didnt slip her into the thing without an invitation he asked no the reply was more considered and firmer thats funny said steele his voice hardening because she says you invited her well shes a liar i dont know her to speak to and i didnt invite her anywhere i dont even know where she lives do you have a telephone directory yes of course well shes in it miss strachan says she had a phone call last friday night inviting her to the academy next day mr sheringham theres a floor full of lawyers here and another above before we go any further would you like one of them to join us for the first time he looked flustered not yet he replied ill know when dont worry okay the thing is sir the call to miss strachan was made from your mobile panic and relief seemed to cross the mans face at the same time ah so thats it he exclaimed my mobile was stolen ive heard that one before somewhere said steele coldly havent you superintendent rose nodded so often that i did a check before we came along here you havent reported a stolen mobile the relief was gone leaving only the panic i didnt bother sa sheringham protested i didnt see the point it was a payasyougo phone and i only had a couple of quid left in the voucher i fancied a new one anyway have you bought one yet no i havent got round to it rose leaned across the table mr sheringham are you telling me the truth yes in that case will you be kind enough to let mr steele search your desk right now or if youd prefer it ill ask mr candelas secretary to do it to avoid you any unnecessary embarrassment oh yes and if we dont find it would you be prepared let me have officers search your home all of this is just to confirm your story you understand would you agree to that the trainee shook his head his complexion had gone several shades paler than when he had entered the room the look of panic in his eyes had given way to one of pure fright no he whispered then slid his right hand into his trouser pocket took out a royal blue ericsson cellphone and laid it on the table steele picked it up he saw that it was switched on and flipped it open quickly he flicked through the menu and selected call list then he stood and walked round the table lets have a look shall we he said he chose the first log entry a name showed on the led readout sonia whos that my girlfriend steele moved on another name hazza my pal sheringham whispered he moved on sonia once more there were six more calls to sonia two to hazza three others to friends called bill marti and brick all logged by name before the first number showed it had an prefix and the call had been made on the previous friday whose is that asked steele i dont know sheringham replied i cant remember well i can said the inspector icily its andrea strachans time for you to shut up sir and get that lawyer in here he turned to rose ill go and speak to mr candela he left the room and headed back down the corridor after a few yards he stopped took out his own cellphone and recalled adam broadleys number is andrea still with you he asked when the psychiatrist answered yes shes fine ill probably release her tomorrow if its okay with you a hundred per cent okay if you decide to discharge her tonight ill even pick her up if she wants meantime ive got some news for the two of you that you can explain however you like it looks like weve found god thirtyeight if skinner had been less preoccupied he would have noticed that andy martins office in the tayside police headquarters building was bigger than his own indeed his friend would probably have pointed this out to him but both had other things on their minds martins forehead was ridged in a frown to match skinners own bob i dont know what to say neither do i so im saying nothing else until i get to buffalo then ill be asking plenty sure just keep it level thats all now is there anything that i can do while youre away bob looked at him gratefully yes there is a couple of things one youll find easy the other maybe not first id like you to keep in regular telephone touch with alex just make sure that shes okay and all that shell be as frantic about this as the rest of us and shes got no one to lean on at this moment sure ill do that ill ask karen to call her once youve broken this to her and headed out of town might be better as you see fit now the other thing when i got oakdales call i was in the middle of a bit of private enterprise involving a man named cecil williamson aka skipper hes a contemporary of michaels hes from mother well and he runs a country house hotel up near birnam its called fir park lodge i was trying to get an uptodate photo of him without alarming the locals to show to old aidan if hed identified him theres a guy on his payroll called dabo whos done a bit of time i was proposing to have a chat with him before i squared up his boss skinner hesitated andy i know the autopsy report knocked the suspicious death investigation on its head but q martin stood up from behind his desk and walked to the window that enquiry may be stood down bob but we still have an interest in finding out how he wound up in the river youve put a name in the frame so ill look into it i wont be as subtle as you either ill pull dabo in straight away thanks mate skinner stood himself and looked across the room at his friend just in case it isnt this skipper it might do no harm to have a list of estate owners on your patch especially those with salmon rivers running through them my brothers last meal wasnt something he knocked up on a fire at the roadside it was rich mans fare if it wasnt williamson although hes a heavy favourite i will find the man who fed it to him ill get someone on it said martin now try and forget it for now you have if i may say so more important things to attend to bob shrugged his shoulders as he headed for the door maybe so son he murmured but i will attend to them both in time mark me on that guilt is one of the strongest motivations there is be it for covering things up or for uncovering them my private dread is that before im finished i might have to do both qo thirtynine this man exclaimed andrea strachan you say he knows me stevie steele nodded he was at university at the same time as you whats his name i cant tell you that im afraid why because i might fall at his feet and worship him steele glanced across to the passenger seat saw her smile and laughed out loud no it wouldnt be like you to worship a false god idolatrys forbidden remember could i forget she exclaimed thats one of the many things my fathers drummed into me over the years how do you get on with your father stevie asked out of the corner of his eye he saw her smile flicker again what is this am i still being interrogated nah he said thats all over it was an idle question thats all well almost idle here i am picking you up from hospital and im taking you home when i might be taking you to your parents just in case i harmed myself you mean no oh christ steele shut up mouth open foot straight in i think just driving would be a good idea maybe but ill let you off the hook and ill overlook the name you just took in vain after my crisis i thought and adam agreed that it would be better for me not to go back to that atmosphere my father holds highly orthodox views which he never ceases to proclaim and we felt that given the nature of my illness it would be easier if i wasnt exposed to them its worked out all right too he looked across at her again her hair was pulled back in a ponytail and he saw that she was wearing lipstick and eye makeup yes pretty q very definitely attractive adam recommended that i wear makeup to let my real personality out he said his diagnosis was that in my schizophrenia my other side had taken me over completely her smile became dazzling of course there is the possibility that this is the real nutter youre looking at now if it is it suits me fine the words were out before he had time to consider them thank you sir he looked at the road ahead can i ask you something else andrea within reason when we saw you on the video tapes and when we began our talk yesterday you looked different why was that she took a deep breath because id stopped taking my medication when i got that call last friday it just did my head in you know what i mean i just screamed inside i thought that it had all been a sham that i wasnt cured or under control at all and that the medicine was all useless so i stopped taking it what you saw was what happened as a result andrea looked across at him how does that make you feel steven she asked it makes me feel like a bit of a cripple still he felt himself frown it makes me angry andrea thats how it makes me feel for the guy who called you did so knowing what it could do to you thats one of the most evil things ive ever come across he wont be doing it again not if i can help it nor if i can ill try to make myself remember from now on god does not use the phone forty walking back into his office in the fettes headquarters building as a serving officer should have been one of the most satisfying moments of bob skinners life let alone his career he had been faced with a threat and he had crushed it normally he would have taken a moment to savour his triumph but he had no moments to spare instead he went straight to his desk and switched on his computer he fidgeted impatiently in his seat as it booted up but eventually he was able to log on using his private password michael he opened the file on which he had stored a number of highly sensitive directline telephone numbers when he had found the one for which he was looking he picked up one of his telephones a black oldfashioned handset and keyed it in a flat emotionless voice answered yes adam its bob hello mate how the fook are you the mans tone had changed in an instant id heard you were ill not that i believed it mind ive never been better things get exaggerated along the way must have been or you wouldnt be calling me on this line what can i do for you a small favour he paused major adam arrow was one of his most trusted friends although the story of their relationship would never be written down arrow was a serving army officer but he worked in the sector of the national security machine that the public do not see he had served undercover in many trouble spots and had seen and done things that would have turned a weaker man into a lifelong insomniac yet he still slept well every night and had risen in the ministry of defence to a position so sensitive that he was responsible only to the secretary of state himself and in extreme circumstances when things had to be politically deniable not even to him remember skinner continued that time you looked into my fathers mod file of course well theres another one id like you to look at one that youll find isnt nearly as distinguished as my dads hes my family secret my brother michael said arrow quietly as it had been with alex bobs surprise was pure reflex how did you know about him a soft laugh came down the secure line are you forgetting who youre talking to mate come to that are you forgetting who you are the first time you ever got involved with the security services you were subjected to top level vetting theres nothing about you that isnt known and on file at my level i have instant access to all of it this line you called me on has a clever little device at my end at least its linked through my computer and whenever theres an incoming call it identifies the person on the other end through the number and pops his file up on screen im looking at it right now is it uptodate though pretty much i know what you were doing in the states a couple of months back i know that your brother was found dead at the weekend and looking at the most recent entry i can guess why you sound in a bit of a rush right now is that current enough for you its so current that its worrying youre top rated mate skinner snorted uhh am i a threat then no youre important and you know things ordinary people dont youre a national fookin treasure robert so we have to know everything about you fuck dont tell me any more will you look into michaels ministry file for me sure not a problem what do you want to know i want to know the truth about what happened in honduras the incident that led to him getting kicked out ill see what it says how soon the usual soon as you can when can i get back to you on this line i dont know im off to the states since youre that clued up youll understand why id like you to courier a report to neil mcllhenney in my special branch office marked for my eyes only on return i dont want this going through my assistant hes too new i dont know him yet okay said arrow good luck in buffalo thanks adam skinner gave a small shudder as he hung up the phone he operated on the fringes of and on occasion deeper inside the secret society but even he could still be surprised by the length of its arm he checked his watch and stood up he thought about stepping along the corridor to say hello to the chief and to jack mcgurk his new executive assistant but that would have cost him time he did not have he was glad that the special branch outer office was empty when he stepped through the door normally he would have been happy to spend time with a bright young copper like alice cowan but at that moment in his life all he wanted to do was to pick up his bag and papers from neil mcllhenney and catch his plane the big inspector was waiting for him in his office there was a small suitcase cabinsized standing beside his desk thanks pal said bob quietly this is above and beyond the call of duty but not friendship dont sit down youre on the fivefifteen shuttle connecting to the seven fortyfive flight to new york that gets you in about eleven us time you have an airport hotel reservation then an early morning flight to buffalo youll be there for halfnine the tickets are ready for collection at the airport he picked up the case and an envelope from his desk come on were obscenely tight for time so lets shift you can tell me on the way what this is about mcllhenney led the way out of his office and down the stairs to the car park behind the fettes headquarters building he drove quickly out on to carrington drive a few turns later they were on queensferry road heading for the barnton roundabout at substantially more than the permitted speed limit right he said as they hit a stretch of straight road his face became more and more solemn and more and more pale as skinner told him the story he was a detective too he knew the conclusion to which the bare facts pointed oh man he whispered as his friend finished oh man the dead man ron neidholm have you met him no until that little bitch babs walker rubbed my nose in his picture id never heard of him im told i should have but gridiron footballs not my game does he mean anything to you yes he does i follow it a bit on television hes not joe montana john ellway or dan marino but hes pretty close hes outlasted all of them too until now skinner grunted mmm he paused our spencers a great american football fan neidholms one of his favourites god knows how hes going to take it then when he finds out that auntie sarahs topped his hero bob for fucks sake mcllhenney shouted you cannot afford even to think like that far less say it out loud skinner flushed at the rebuke and chewed his lip i know pal im sorry but its just that ive had a few hours to think about this now and im going to have a few more until i shuffle into fucking buffalo and from what oakdale told me it looks pretty bleak maybe it does but plant this thought in your head and do not let it waver no way could sarah kill anybody she is not capable of it the big mans eyes dropped ill try neil and its nice of you to say that but you and i both know from professional and personal experience that that isnt true there are always circumstances my friend in which we can do things we never contemplated you know that as well as i do not sarah mcllhenney insisted i know you two have been alienated lately but youre not going to tell me you doubt her in this bob shook his head no im not and i wont i promise you im sorry i even expressed the thought but man this on top of everything else weve all got our breaking point maybe im getting close to mine neil laughed aye sure thatll come when they tighten the screws on your box man even then youll probably kick it open you will get over there and you will get this sorted or youll fire up the local boys to sort it themselves you have faith in me dont you we all do and its justified look at today look at councillor maley who was last seen bustling out of fettes with her spiky tail between her legs sarah did not do this and youll get her clear and if i do what then what do you mean i mean there are other questions only if you choose to ask them they drove on in silence until mcllhenney sped round the approach road to the airport going back to maley he said at last ive got something on her indeed will it keep till i get back probably hes in shorts prison i just need to check out a few things more go and see big lenny if you need to said skinner tell him i sent you and that id trust you with his life hell get the humour in that the inspector nodded as he drew to a halt on a double yellow line in front of the airport two uniformed traffic officers approached as they stepped out of the car mcllhenney flashed his warrant card and frowned at them they backed off skinner took his flight bag from the back seat and his passport from his friends hand thanks man he said sincerely for everything youve done but theres one more thing name it alex id hoped to see her to tell her about this but i just havent had the time its a hell of a job telling her that her stepmothers in the slammer for murder theres only you and andy that id ask to do it and id rather it was done facetoface youll find her at her office she thinks shes waiting for me ill do that and tell her i love her mcllhenney grinned she knows that man aye but tell her anyway fortyone how did we do with sheringham maggie rose asked briskly steele and regan faced her across the desk in her small office he either hides the incriminating evidence in mysterious ways maam the inspector replied or there aint any we went in there with our search warrant at seven oclock and we searched every inch of it but we found nothing explosive or inflammatory apart from a can of hairspray i thought he lived alone he does steele replied but us guys these days were full of surprises the only hairspray in our house is mine but ill take your word for it did you put a sniffer dog in she caught his frown sorry i should have taken that for granted it didnt react to anything then there was a blown condom under the bed but that was all that excited it she must have been in heat regan muttered rose glared at him there was nothing at all absolutely nothing well said steele there was an extra remote the boys a gadget freak hes got a snazzy hifi a big telly dvd player video and all of them work off remotes but there was an extra one is that significant long shot but it could be the technical boys say that it might be possible to trigger an incendiary with a telly remote if you set it up right but wed need to have the detonator to know that and it was pretty much melted in the fire yes damn it so it was she looked at the two men what youre telling me then is that we dont have any grounds for continuing to detain him qs apart from being a little shite no we dont the inspector admitted the phone call isnt enough not nearly even last night once hed had a chance to think about it he was claiming that someone could have taken his phone from his pocket used it then put it back it was made at seventhirty there was a staff drinks party in the candela and finch offices last friday evening part of the bicentenary celebrations so he could be telling the truth yes and if he is that gives us a list of about a hundred and fifty guys to work through if he isnt it makes no bloody difference the phone call alone isnt enough he goes then ill phone his solicitor id better start making soothing noises as well george go down to the cells and get him the sergeant nodded and left the room theres one thing worries me about turning him loose maggie said steele as the door closed i know hes still the main suspect suppose he tries to scare andrea again he needs the fear of himself put in him then just in case no he needs me to advise him and his lawyer politely about the need to make no contact with miss strachan while this enquiry is unresolved and she remains a potential witness sheringhams well advised stevie however personal you might find this thing becoming hell be more afraid of the law society than he is of you she smiled at him but keep an eye on her informally she offered if you want someone made that call and if it wasnt our man downstairs hes still around he knows about andrea and we dont know about him steele nodded i agree ill keep her safe dont worry he looked at rose i like her thats all im saying but theres something about her maggie with her medication stable and her confidence back she really is a completely different personality shes attractive and shes got a dry sense of humour about her that takes you by surprise but shes wounded steve dont forget that i know she is she knows whats happened to her and even though shes fine under treatment she hasnt forgotten it she cant hide her pain completely any more than you can maggie started she looked sharply at him and for a moment he thought that he had said something that would destroy their easy relationship until she turned her face away and looked out of the window that obvious huh she murmured it is to me is the whole force talking about me then she asked about me and my husband not the whole force only those who dont know any better although thats about ninety per cent those who know you both reckon that if youve got problems youre strong enough to sort them out in time while youre doing that they dont change the people you are she turned back to face him leaning back against the edge of her desk we dont have problems stevie she whispered i do marios sleeping with your exgirlfriend his own cousin and i dont mind i wish i did but i dont thats all part of it you see i dont and i cant maggie sorry he exclaimed i shouldnt have said anything i wasnt prying honest i know you werent somebody had to say something eventually id rather it was you than dan pringle or george or some other dipstick you may have a reputation among women as a dangerous guy stevie but as far as im concerned youre a nice bloke you listen and you care so listen to this the thing is im glad that paula and mario are indulging themselves with each other because it takes a big weight off of me understand he put his hands on her shoulders to her inward surprise she did not flinch not pull away i think so he replied now you understand this detective superintendent rose i dont know whats happened to fuck up your head and instinct tells me that i do not want to know but whatever it is however awful it is not big enough to overcome your spirit you are a very attractive woman maggie but youre more than that youre the strongest woman ive ever met and ive admired you through all the time weve worked together you may have given in to selfdoubt and persuaded yourself that you can never overcome this problem and have let it dictate how you live your life if you have you are wrong i dont believe there is anything that you cant face down with whats in here he put a finger against her forehead and in here he tapped the same finger against her chest between her breasts he took her hand in his squeezed it and held it sorry to be a little informal maam he murmured but youre worth it she looked solemnly up at him and realised that for the first time in as long as she could remember she felt no hint of revulsion at the touch of a man she lifted his hand in turn to her face and held it gently against her cheek for a few seconds then let it go forgiven inspector she murmured full of confusion but smiling and thanks for caring what if youre wrong though he raised an eyebrow youre not going to tell me are you that you dont have the courage even to try fortytwo it had been years since neil mcllhenney had seen lenny plenderleith bob skinner had told him that the man had changed during the years of his imprisonment and for the better in many ways but one thing remained he was still as big as ever the giant laughed softly so i can trust you with my life can i he said he hasnt lost his touch has he so youre his man are you whats happened that he cant come to see me himself he always has before mcllhenney was struck by big lennys quiet confidence he had changed indeed from his days as principal enforcer to the late and almost unlamented tony manson the gang leader had been mourned only by his protege a fact which had proved unfortunate to his killers skinner said after lennys imprisonment for the murder that the greatest mistake a man could make was to underestimate him some of those who had were no longer around to regret it hes got problems family things hes in america at the moment trying to sort them out hes got one in scotland that i know about tough luck about his brother winding up in that ladys basement do they know what it was yet did somebody do him he died of a heart attack while he was salmon fishing maybe lenny plenderleith leaned across the shorts prison visiting room table they were alone at mcllhenneys insistence you and i will get on better mr mcllhenney if you dont spin me any more fairy tales nobody goes salmon fishing when a rivers in full spate and bursting its banks especially not as the scotsman informed me an alcoholic whos lived the last thirty years of his life in a jesuit hostel maybe he did die of a heart attack but how did he wind up in the tay we dont know the inspector admitted but he died of natural causes so finding out is not at the top of tayside cids thingstodo list theyd better move it up then or is bob not coming back from the states hell be back all right but im not sure when lenny frowned so whats happened in america thats more important than his brother its a family matter thats all its got nothing to do with this visit i promise you im curious though i read about his inlaws being killed a few months back i even had a look at the new york times website the old man rated quite an obituary he was a friend of the kennedys and the clintons so it said you certainly keep yourself informed mcllhenney observed i have to do something in here ive done my open university degree i did ask if i could get day release from here to do a doctorate at napier but they wouldnt wear it bob said that after id done ten years i should ask again and he might be able to help in the meantime im writing ive done the obligatory reformed lifers autobiography a book about the career of tony manson drug lord with a social conscience etc and another about his murder and what happened after it i wanted to do one about bob skinner too but he wont play so whatll you do instead of that fiction eventually maybe but not yet next i plan to do an academic study of the homicidal mind itll go on to look at people like west dahmer shipman sutcliffe and so on and itll try to give voice to their thoughts as they did what they did what about your own plenderleith looked sternly at his visitor please spare me that although i have killed people i dont have a homicidal mind in that sense i am a sociopath thats allowed me to do what ive done in the past but i am also a clever sociopath i know that i cannot continue to do those things and retain the possibility of ever breathing free air and thanks to my inheritance from tony i wont be under any pressure to do them when im released no one has a problem being left alone with me im probably the safest man in this place he grinned at mcllhenney i do virtually all my research on the internet when im logged on i read a selection of world newspapers to keep up with current affairs theres some interesting stuff out there plenderleith paused and glanced across at the policeman i even read about this actress he said a year or so back who chucked it all to marry some dumb copper in edinburgh lucky bastard that he is sure said the inspector with sudden bitterness so lucky that his first wife died in her prime and left him with two kids but you know about widowhood dont you lenny you killed your wife the giant drew a breath for a while neil thought that the interview was at an end but then he exhaled and glanced across to the window wrong subject for us then he murmured im sorry i didnt know that you must have missed the scotsman that day my olive had a fine obituary bob skinner wrote it we all owe bob then said lenny me as much as anyone he might be the guy who got me banged up in here but he was only doing his job he laughed not that i made it easy for him he wasnt just doing his job though when he put in a word to get me a standard lifers tariff when any other copper you included would have left me here to rot doing a minimum thirty years so how can i help him mcllhenney leaned forward elbows on the table apart from his family things the boss has had another problem lately theres this councillor agnes maley shes had it in for him for years just lately shes really been getting above herself its time she was brought under control lenny shook his huge head smiling black agnes eh you know her oh yes i know her if id read that she had been fished out of a river the other day rather than bobs brother it would have surprised me a lot less but youll need to be nifty on your feet to get anything on her maybe we have been ive been looking into her past and at some of the people shes been associated with about twelve years back there was a nasty murder in edinburgh it involved a rent boy called paul deary yes i know an appropriate name he was found naked in a skip just along from the elsie inglis not just a murder the way he was killed told us that the lad had been made an example of his throat was cut and his balls were stuffed in his mouth the inspector gave an involuntary shudder we leaned on a lot of people and eventually we found out that he had worked in a male brothel right in the middle of the old town under the control of a pimp called jason fargo we raided the place mobhanded and lifted everyone i was in on it myself we found the usual selection of clients but we let them go one of them was a journalist so we were fairly certain it would be covered up instead we concentrated on the boys who were working there the big man led the investigation himself he showed them all photographs of deary at the scene and in the mortuary he asked them to imagine the boys last moments he asked them to consider how safe they would all be if the guy who did it wasnt caught and then he locked them up and waited it only took one night in the cells two of them started talking and eventually they all did they told us that jason fargo had come in the night paul was killed and taken him away hed pulled him out of there screaming by the hair they told us about another kid whod disappeared as well about six months earlier both boys had been freelancing theyd been working the pubs in leith and keeping all their money in fargos place they got a third of what they earned if they were lucky they were slaves we turned jasons flat over looking for forensic traces but there was nothing we were in trouble then because we needed more for the crown office to proceed with a murder charge then one of the boys told us that hed been with jason once and hed stopped at a lockup garage out off causewayside hed gone in come out with a stereo locked it again and driven off the lad had assumed correctly that it was used to store knockoff and had thought no more about it he took us there we opened it under a warrant and went in bingo the kids blood was up the walls and his clothes were in a pile in the corner there was stolen gear all over the place and jasons prints were all over it fargo admitted it it surprised us at the time but he just folded he even took us to the spot in the queens park where hed buried the first lad poor kid i cant even remember his name he told us what we had guessed that he had killed paul like that to scare all the others off private enterprise the crown office threw every possible charge at him murder forcing underage boys into prostitution keeping a disorderly house the lot the judge he drew was a wellknown practising catholic he gave him a minimum twentyfive years he stopped lenny plenderleith applauded silently well told inspector you had me right on the edge of my seat there as a matter of fact i remember the case very well tony was very pleased when mr fargo got stuffed he did not approve of the wee boy business yes ill grant you he was into saunas himself but in edinburgh properly run they can be positively therapeutic your friend mcguire should agree with that tonys estate which i administer sold a number of them to his very attractive cousin kissing cousin from what i hear ms viareggio although some of the purchase price was paid by a cheque signed by mr mcguires mother the giant grinned as he watched mcllhenney fail to mask his surprise theres a lot big mario doesnt tell you eh neil he said on the other hand theres hardly anything that people dont tell me nothing at all when i want to know but im sorry go on with your tale the inspector pulled himself together lenny had been right the news about christina mcguire helping to fund paulas sauna purchase had come as a complete surprise right and this is where maley comes in fargos place was in her council ward at the time and shes like you she knows everything that happens on her patch we didnt pursue that angle at the time it would have been pointless anyway but the other day i went round a few people who were involved in that case one or two of the lads involved have made decent lives for themselves i got a tip from one who can remain nameless he told me that he believed that jason fargo was only able to operate for as long as he did because he was paying backhanders to agnes maley mmm plenderleith murmured almost impatiently so so jason fargos in this very nick lenny i would like to know from him if that is true if it is ill need it in writing signed therell be no comeback on him i promise ill feed the information personally to contacts i have within the labour party itll be enough to put a stop to maleys political career a rumbling sound seemed to emanate from deep in the mans great chest ahh fate can be a bugger eh id have done that for bob jason would not have refused me i may be a smart sociopath with his future mapped out but as far as the boys in here are concerned i am still the man to whom you like to say yes but sadly youre about a month too late he sighed mr fargo is indeed in shorts nick the news is not generally known at this moment in case some of the younger inmates get alarmed but hes in the hospital wing in isolation the man has fullblown aids inspector and it has attacked him here he tapped the side of his head hes fucking brain dead neil the most id get out of him would be a drool shit mcllhenney hissed then he saw that lenny was looking at him in a strangely direct way there was more to come going back to the criminal mind a real criminal mind i mean not mr fargos which was never up to much in the first place even before it went into meltdown the worst thing you guys can ever do is to underrate it what i am going to tell you now will be of absolutely no use to you or bob because i learned it at the time from tony manson whos even deader than fargo so its hearsay sure i could write it down for you but it could never be proved if you tried to feed it to your sources first they wouldnt believe it and second theyd look at the signature lenny plenderleith mass murderer casual observer of the edinburgh scene at the time and unlikely friend of agnes maleys enemy dcc bob skinner wed all probably wind up in the civil courts or worse mcllhenney sighed youre right of course so what is it that we cant use just this and remember that it came from tony manson who knew everything and everyone on the criminal scene in edinburgh as the tabloids had to say he was the godfather of his time the fact is that jason fargo did not pay as you put it backhanders to maley he ran the place paid the kids their pittance took his own wages and gave her what was left black agnes was the boss neil the setup was his idea and the flat was in fargos name but it was bought with cash which she supplied why didnt he shop her then work it out man he knew he wouldnt have lived to stand trial think back to those days and to the way it was in edinburgh there were three teams there was ours there was jackie charles and his lot and there was a third one not as big as us but a grouping nonetheless you knew about jackie and us but you could never get a handle on that third one you were never even sure if it was organised or whether it was just a load of villains picking the scraps off our table well it was and black agnes was at its heart her boys did the stuff we wouldnt protection the wee boy business smuggling cigarettes and all that after fargo got done she realised that she was pushing her luck so she packed everything up and concentrated on being a councillor but when she was in business nobody not you not even bob skinner himself ever had a sniff of her because her tracks were covered too well and because all you could see was what a fucking pain she was as a councillor but she was much more than that neil jason fargo didnt kill those boys off his own bat man he did it on agness orders fortythree youre quite sure im not going to hear from him andrea asked they had found a corner table in the bustling browns only a few yards along from george street and were waiting for the lunch they had ordered to be brought to them as sure as i can be stevie answered maggie superintendent rose spoke to him and his solicitor and advised him that the investigations still open that youre a witness and that hes still a suspect hed be spectacularly stupid to come anywhere near you after having his card marked as clearly as that and i dont think he is do you still think it was him who phoned me to be honest andrea im not sure any more his story now is that someone else must have used his phone to make that call she frowned for a second but if it wasnt him that means he nodded i know what it means but i really dont think you need to worry its our thinking that you were lured along to that exhibition as a fall he paused and smiled girl that hasnt worked fine so what possible reason could the man have to try it on again she looked at the table as she pondered what he had said yes i see the logic in that so youre telling me to forget it altogether keep taking the tablets and get on with my life exactly as a bit of added security ill give you my phone numbers if were wrong and it does happen again you should call me right away okay she looked at him coyly does that mean that therell be no more surprise invitations to lunch he grinned back at her not necessarily i have got a life outside cid you know id like to be your friend andrea instead of your investigating officer id like to get to know you in an ordinary situation her blue eyes flashed at him what both of me you mean i prefer this model but im game for anything ill bet you are you might find getting to know me a frustrating experience im not really one of your modern girls im a virgin you know she frowned severely what he shot back both of you a short snorting laugh exploded from her i may have two personalities but thats as far as it goes sorry to sound so priggish what i meant was that ive never had a proper relationship with a man before you mean an improper one god i cant say a thing to you she put her hand to her mouth and gasped did you hear that i just took his name in vain steven youre having a bad influence on me already sounds promising im promising nothing and im not asking for anything other than to be your friend okay take me to the cinema then what do you want to see lord of the rings deal when tomorrow two dates in one day might be rushing things a bit ill pick you up at seven he took a card from his pocket and handed it to her there stevie steele in your hands thats every phone number ive got office and private the home ones are exdirectory so dont leave it lying about ill keep it in my bible she said casually just to be safe he had to look closely at her to be sure she was joking a sound at their side caught his attention a waiter stood ready with their lunch steven andrea began as he picked up his cutlery about the fire since it wasnt a convenient crazy like me and since youre discounting the man who phoned the newspapers have you any idea who burned the silly picture not a clue so what will you do next well probably look at all the people who could have taken the lads mobile and used it to make the call to you how many to be exact one hundred and fortytwo a hundred and nineteen if we leave the partners out of it how long will that take that depends on a few things on how many of them gave us statements on saturday on how many we have to reinterview on how many officers we use to do it so i might be stood up tomorrow night not a chance even detective inspectors get time off besides theres another factor i didnt mention thats how lucky we get you never know the first person we interview might confess did you think you were lucky when you saw me on those tapes that is not me her oh you know what i mean i know and did we ever think wed got lucky especially when we found out who she was and what shed done are you sorry you werent he laid down his fork reached across and took her hand who says i wasnt a blush came to her cheeks i know i was she whispered the others would just have locked me up wouldnt they it was you who stood up for me wasnt it not alone maggie did too then thank her for me she started to explore her lentil salad and steele turned his attention to his tagliatelle de la casa can i ask you something else she exclaimed when she was near the end could i stop you he countered why are you sure that burning the picture was a religious protest its the only possible motive andrea can you suggest another no i cant but she paused as if she had thought better of whatever it was she had been about to say but what go on och it just seems to me that it was awful well planned thats all someone who does something like that is a fanatic right right do fanatics plan things that well when i she no i did what i did there was no planning involved at all i made the device then wandered like a sore thumb into their service and tried to plant it in what was supposed to be an unobtrusive manner it was a nonsense from the start i was simply driven by my voice telling me to do it what happened in the academy on the other hand was planned like clockwork and executed perfectly if the person who did it is a schizophrenic like me it would have been a shambles you ask adam broadley if you dont believe me i might but not because i dont believe you go on this was done by a clearthinking methodical person with technical knowledge that doesnt fit the fanatic theory as i understand it fanatics are the sort of people who walk into places and blow themselves up this person planted the device in secret triggered it and got away scot free not only that he set me up as as you put it a fall girl so while youre interviewing all these people why dont you ask yourselves at the same time why else this might have been done fortyfour stop here bob skinner told the taxidriver as he approached the drive that led up to the grace mansion he paid him in crisp new us currency fresh from an atm in john f kennedy airport and stepped out into the street it was still short of nine am but the morning was hot nonetheless his scottish summer clothes felt suddenly very heavy he stood at the foot of the path out of sight of the house and took a deep breath he had called his daughter from london and had found her as shocked and disbelieving as he had known she would be he had promised to keep her in touch with developments and then he had tried his level best to block the nightmare from his mind all the way across the atlantic he had fought against the urge to think of this moment to anticipate it to plan for it he had played cds on his walkman all through the flight and on the shuttle to buffalo clapton and king a stones compilation counting crows a live van morrison double set all bought at heathrow and chosen because it was heavy stuff that would force him to listen he had watched television all the way through a short sleepless night in his hotel room finding a channel that seemed to be devoted entirely to showing repeats of the sopranos wondering to himself how long the fictional big tony would have lasted in edinburgh as opposed to lenny plenderleiths late boss the moment had come though he braced himself and thought positively of mark jazz and seonaid and how pleased he would be to see them he picked up his bag from the sidewalk turned the corner and walked up the path he thought the door might open as he approached the house but no one could have been looking out the garage door was open only the jaguar lay inside he stepped up to the entrance and rang the bell he had assumed that it would be trish who would answer when the heavy door opened and he saw sarah standing there he was struck dumb as was she they stood staring at each other neither moving neither seeming to know what to say and then from the hall there came a yell of dad and james andrew charged out past his mother throwing himself up to be caught and hugged to his fathers chest bob felt a sharp sensation as the child bumped his pacemaker but he ignored it in the sheer relief of seeing him again leaving his flight bag abandoned on the step he carried him into the house hello kid he whispered into his ear how much mayhem have you been causing while ive been away then eventually he set his son back on his feet go and play he told him ill see you in a minute i need to talk to your mum jazz ran off towards the kitchen and he guessed to the yard he turned back to face sarah she had recovered her composure he fought for his what are you doing here she asked in a quiet matteroffact voice what the hell do you think im doing honey so clyde called you i told him not to yet he did too bloody right he did bob exclaimed his voice starting to rise before he calmed it there are three kids here and their mother was in jail how could you expect him not to he walked into the kitchen the trip was catching up with him fast he needed coffee badly but fortunately there was a jug on the filter he poured himself a mug went to the fridge and added barely enough milk to turn it brown from black he turned back towards her i guess your name hasnt been linked to the investigation yet he said no media outside no she said sheriff dekker and the da made sure that i was kept completely incommunicado they took me away from rons house very quickly and i was held in the das office not at the police building the press assumed i was there so they camped outside they were only told that a suspect was in custody no name no gender even a remarkable show of discretion in the states she nodded yes i admit thats puzzled me too i can guess the reason he grunted darkly when did they give you bail a judge granted it last night in chambers she set a milliondollar surety but john vranic assured her there was more than enough in the estate its temporary though if im indicted and arraigned itll be considered again then if she winced and looked away no she whispered when john told me to expect to be in open court this afternoon then the whole media thing will explode well see about that bob im lucky it hasnt happened before this she walked over to him you look beat do you want me to make you something to eat wouldnt do any harm eggs bacon that sort of stuff my cholesterols fine remember so youll be glad to hear is everything else you slew your dragon then lets just say shes wounded slayings a bad topic around here im back in post and thats the main thing im glad for you she said quietly as she opened the fridge and took out a box of eggs and a pack of bacon thanks he turned his head and looked out of the window at james andrew as he attacked a climbing frame that had not been there when he left im sorry sarah i got obsessed i admit it i went off at half cock and let it come between us now all this shits come down on you and i feel its my fault its been my week for guilt and no mistake she lit a gas ring under a big frying pan bob she began a catch in her voice i have to he put up a hand dont do that just yet love please just answer me something when you found the guy was the door of his house lying open no in that case since he was dead who opened it for you nobody she whispered i had a key he felt his head swim and for a moment thought that he might be having another attack in spite of his pacemaker but the thump of his heart in his chest told him that he was not okay he said in a flat ok emotionless voice that was a masterpiece of selfcontrol just so as i know when i see the police youre seeing the police this very morning i phoned brad dekker on my way here from the airport and told him to be ready for me with eddie brady at ten oclock bob you cant get involved in this she exclaimed he smiled at her for the first time since she had opened the door who cant fortyfive angus dabo had known many an unexpected visit from the police but he had never rated a detective chief superintendent before so he was understandably rattled as he looked across the bar table at his visitor how did ye ken to find me here he asked nervously youre a creature of habit mr dabo rod greatorix told him our local uniformed officers told me that you have your lunch here in the cannon every day in life he looked at his plate do they do a decent bridie in here by the way i feel a bit peckish myself no bad the man replied the haggis is best though why are you not having it then ah could dna have it every day youre a bloke who believes in a balanced diet then angus dabo shrugged his shoulders ah like what ah like ken theres plenty tae eat up at the lodge ah hae the choice frae the kitchen at night but its a salmon or game the guests that come there dinna expect pie and chips like unless its venison pie and game chips aye thats right he looked down at his plate the baked beans were starting to congeal go on said greatorix get stuck in im in no rush he sipped his ginger ale and watched as the bald nutbrown handyman bolted down his forfar bridie he knew from his file that dabo was fiftytwo years old and that his last conviction had been ten years earlier but he noted that the man still looked fit enough to climb a drainpipe without difficulty he waited as dabo mopped up the last of his beans with the last of his chips how long have you worked at fir park lodge he asked the moment he was finished on three year since mr williamson bought it ahve never been in ony bother like he added defensively im not saying you have does your employer know all about you though does he know youve been in prison dabo blinked nervously he never asked he exclaimed has someone telt him are you goin tae tell him the detective shrugged his shoulders if hes going to hire people without checking them out its not down to me to mark his card relax angus this isnt about you the handyman looked at him as if he required a lot more persuasion if he was going to believe him ive asked about you dont worry greatorix continued the local people vouched for you theyve got their ear to the ground if youd gone back to your old profession they would know well what is it aboot dabo looked only a little less suspicious were making enquiries about a man whose body was found in perth last saturday the mans de fences went back up so quickly that greatorix smiled no angus im not going to ask if you did it this guy died of a heart attack and fell into the river somewhere all were trying to find out is where he was he wasnt reported missing and he was only identified by chance we think he might have been a guest at a big house along the riverbank why no ask mr williamson because were asking you we dont know mr williamson whats he like to work for as a matter of interest hes aright he kens nothing aboot fishin though a lot less than most of the guests he has ah think he only bought the place because he fancied bein a country squire is there a mrs williamson naw theres folk think hes havin it off withe hoosekeeper but hes no what makes you so sure dabo shot him a sudden lascivious grin ah i see greatorix chuckled tell me is the lodge busy it does a right its fu this week but no every week this man im looking for hed have been there about two weeks ago dabo frowned a fortnight since he muttered aye we were quite fu then what would he look like this man hed have looked in his late fifties grey overweight and poorly dressed poorly dressed hell no have been at the lodge then theyre a fuckin bandboxes we get in there greatorix hesitated and then took a decision he reached into an inside pocket of his jacket and took out a photograph it showed a mans head viewed from above and in half profile it was of michael skinner and it had been taken in the mortuary once he had been cleaned up it was presentable but in no way did it look as if he was merely asleep he handed it to dabo are you sure he said that was him the handyman took the photograph and gulped then gagged for a second greatorix thought that bridie beans and chips were about to come flying his way but the initial shock seemed to pass the policeman studied dabos face as he studied the photograph this man was never a guest at the lodge ahim sure o that dabo frowned and scratched his chin and yet ahve got a feelin ahve seen him somewhere he picked up the remains of his shandy and took a drink swilling it around his mouth before he swallowed as if to wash away a bad taste he looked at the photograph again then across to the bar aye he exclaimed that could have been him ahim no certain but it could have been if it was ah saw him the week before last in here yin lunchtime he was wi another bloke aboot the same age as him his eyebrows went up as if a light had been switched on in his head wednesday it was ah ken that because ah had a bridie for ma lunch like the day did you know the other man ah

mr williamson he could dna hae been here he was at his place in florida then he was awa for three weeks and mae the hoosekeeper was runnin the place he only got back last wednesday fortysix you believed him did you asked mario mcguire then he nodded to himself rather than to mcllhenney i suppose you must have or you wouldnt have come bombing down to galashiels to talk to me about it he pulled open a drawer of his desk took out a kitkat biscuit and tossed it across to his friend here chew on that youre looking unnaturally fit these days you on the other hand said neil cheerfully as he unwrapped the biscuit broke off one finger and used it to stir his tea are looking knackered are you not getting enough sleep mcguire glowered at him just because youre my best pal inspector dont think you can push your luck some would say thats what youre doing mario but i wont be one of them ive got to say something serious though as your best pal you have to resolve your situation and sooner rather than later i know how things are with mags and i know shes given you the biggest pink ticket in history but no one else in the force knows the real story not even the big man all they see is you living with your wife and playing away games with paula the grapevine is talking of nothing else these days and thats not good i might be inclined to say fuck the grapevine mario retorted you might but you cant and you know why its not just you whos the subject of the station gossip its maggie as well its one thing you being jack the lad youre not the first copper in this situation but you are the first one whose wifes a senior officer too we all know theres talk of mags leaving cid and going to chief super what sort of command authority is she going to have among the uniforms if theyre all whispering about her behind her back t his friend looked at him for a while as if he was trying to form a reply but when he spoke it was to ask a question so what should i do neil you have to give one of them up man you either keep your relations with paula business only or you leave maggie since youre giving up the wee boy theres really no obstacle in the way of you doing that mcguires face twisted dont want to leave her he protested she wont sleep with me but theres more to us than that then give up paula and embrace the celibate life is that what youre saying i might say it but i know you too well to see it happening he conceded listen i care about you and i care about mags but you have to sort this out get it through your head man i dont want to no you get it through yours you have to its not about what you want its something you have to do for maggies sake for her selfrespect and for the good of her career i have to leave her for her selfrespect yes and you have to tell everyone that shes chucked you out you dont ask much of a friend do you ill ask whatever i think its going to take just talk to her mario please the pair of you have to realise that you are two bloody goldfish swimming about in a bowl with the whole bloody police force or near as damn it looking at you and not just the force he added lenny dropped a big hint this morning that hes heard about it youre kidding no i aint big lennys a remarkable man he knows your mothers a silent partner in paulas saunas for a start mcguires jaw sagged he does yes and its more than i did pal doesnt look too good the head of special branch being taken by surprise by a lifer they bought the things from mansons estate remember effectively that means from lenny your mum didnt cover her tracks very well obviously not i wouldnt want it getting out either dont worry lenny wont tell anyone he regards information as currency and hes not going to spend any without a purpose so hes got a hold over me of a sort but he wont use it if he did the boss would find out and he wouldnt like it for some reason odd since he once tried to kill him lenny values big bobs friendship more than anything else mmm said mcguire you have had an interesting morning especially the bit about maley thats why i came down here i wanted to talk to you about it when you were in my job did you ever take a look at her of course i did for much the same reason you are now because the boss was pissed off at her i couldnt help him though i came up against blank walls everywhere i went no one would tell me anything about her that i could use he smiled the chief braced her once mind you in a meeting he dropped a hint that he had a file on her mcllhenney looked amazed proud jimmy did yup it shut her up for a while too until she realised that he was bluffing in the light of what lenny told you she must also have realised that if he really had had a file on her shed have been up to her ears in it so mate whats your advice knowing what i know what should i do next mario spun in his chair thats a good one all i can tell you is what i would do and that is nothing i dont think theres any chance of proving what lenny told you unlike my dear mum maley must have covered her tracks completely for weve never had a sniff of her being a real villain from any of our intelligence sources i think you have to watch and wait the classic cid approach watch everything she does from now on and wait for her to do something that you can use to bring her down you might not have too much time though if she gets this holyrood seat shes after we might all find that shes after us with a vengeance fortyseven what did the barman say asked andy martin bar woman greatorix replied the guy behind the bar today wasnt on two weeks ago he was sick and the licensee was away so his the licensees wife had to pull the pints as well as dish the grub she remembered michael skinner but only because he was pissed what about the man he was with the only thing she could say for certain was that he wasnt a regular but she didnt think shed ever seen him before she was harassed that day she said but she struck me as the sort that finds everything too much trouble her description wasnt any better than dabos far as she could recall probably because all her attention was on mr skinner getting himself skunked did you show her the photograph the head of cid smiled with grim satisfaction the licensee wasnt too happy with me afterwards but i did she wasnt a hundred per cent but she pretty well confirmed the identification she said that he looked much the same two weeks ago when his friend huck led him out of her pub thats something at least martin exclaimed in fact apart from the identification its the first positive thing thats happened in this investigation bobs skipper might have been a false lead but we got a result out of it by accident maybe but how do we take it forward ive got someone compiling a list of estate owners on our patch maybe we can pick the people off that who might fit the vague description we have for michael skinners companion source their photographs and show them to dabo and your landlord maybe well even find one who answers to the name of skipper as mr williamson doesnt by the way greatorix told him my man dabo and the local uniforms who know the man had never heard of that nickname hes known up there as cecil and thats it he must have left skipper behind in mother well but andy can we justify this the head of cid looked his deputy chief in the eye i had a breakin to an office in montrose last night the safe was done and quite a bit of cash was taken ive also got a drugs operation under way in dundee its going to take manpower to pursue this skinner thing and for what he died of natural causes maybe he had his heart attack as a result of falling in the river after wandering off while he was drunk if we do find his pal and he did dispose of the body thats probably what hes going to claim i have to prioritise thats the way it is here youre new here so maybe you dont understand that yet not fully at any rate but if the chief constable was sitting in on this discussion i know what he would say martin sighed he could have ordered greatorix to proceed and if he had read a threat to take the matter to the chief forbidden him to do so but the last thing he wanted was an argument with a valued and experienced colleague particularly when he knew the man was in the right and so do i he admitted put it on the shelf rod as far as cid is concerned ill brief the uniformed branch to ask around in the general area of birnam and see if we can come up with other sightings of michael and his mate but thats as far as ill take it if bob wants to crank it up when he gets back from the states ill wont stop him but until then lets just wind it down fortyeight for all that he was a politician rather than a policeman bob skinner had learned to respect bradford dekker the elected sheriff of erie county the district of which buffalo was the heart he had no illusions that he was an investigator and had never tried to represent himself as such to the scot he knew that his responsibility to the people was to maintain public order and safety by putting the right men and women in place to run an efficient force however their earlier dealings following the deaths of sarahs parents had never required him to take a view of that efficiency he had met eddie brady the chief of erie detectives but he had never before observed his department at work as the three men sat round a table in dekkers office skinner looked at brady appraising him openly he could sense hostility in the man something that he had never encountered before he felt impatience stir within him the sheriff read his mind id better tell you bob he began that eddie is not completely on side with this meeting he doesnt feel that its appropriate for us to be sitting down with the husband of the only suspect in a bigprofile homicide normally id be uncomfortable with it myself the visitor turned his eyes towards him the sheriff was in his midforties as was brady but where the detective had a creased rumpled look about him he was immaculate in a suit made of a sheer material that undoubtedly looked great on television sure brad skinner acknowledged steadily i hear what youre saying for my part all i can tell you is that if i had eddies wife or your wife for that matter on remand in edinburgh and i was about to charge her with nicking a pair of knickers from marks and spencer never mind with an indictable offence id invite you to meet with me as a sheer professional courtesy but that apart lets you and i get eddie sorted on this youve ordered him to meet me for the same reason you and the da have gone to extraordinary lengths to keep sarahs identity a secret up to now you know that i still have access to her fathers political friends among whom as youd expect i did some quick research before i came here brad your term of office and the das run out next year hes standing for reelection but youre looking to take the next step up the ladder to the new york state senate so you do not want any more political flak than you will encounter in the normal course of events and especially you do not want me making trouble for you within your own party there is also the fact that leo grace got you your start and even though hes dead you owe him bradford dekker gave him a thin smile everything you say is true bob skinner turned to brady so lets cut the shit eddie id like you to run through the evidence against my wife forget the politics thats what got me through the door what im after now is professional courtesy the american frowned then shrugged his shoulders okay he conceded not quite amiably but with no sign of any continuing grudge you aint going to like any of it though a ringbound folder lay on the table in front of him he pushed it across towards the scot those are the sceneofcrime and autopsy photographs skinner picked it up and opened it hoping that his distaste did not show the first shot had been taken he guessed with the photographer on a chair it looked down on the body from high above neidholm had been wearing a polo shirt when he died it was yellow in colour apart from the dark stain across his chest the foot baller was staring up at nothing through dull eyes and his mouth hung open in the manner of death a look that no movie could ever mimic the policeman looked at the face if it had any expression left it was pure surprise as he studied it he realised that he felt nothing at all no pity but no antipathy no anger either he could just make out the handle of the knife against the stain the blade had been thrust at an upwards angle and had sunk entirely into the victims chest there must have been a lot of force behind the blow he murmured absently the blade was razorsharp brady said a woman any woman and not just a strong lady like your wife could have shoved in it as far as that skinner flipped over to the next photograph it showed the same scene from a different angle as did the next and the next and several after that so that the change of location and subject took him by surprise at first he wondered what it was until he realised that he was looking at a sheet the photo was an extreme closeup focused on a hair it would appear simply fair to the casual observer but bob knew exactly what colour it was there were other shots of neidholms bed some showing more hairs others from a greater distance away recording faint stains he turned from page to page rapidly until he came to the first of the autopsy shots they had been put together in sequence he knew for the victim was intact naked on a slab with the knife still embedded in him in life skinner mused he surely had been a massive man in every respect without warning he closed the folder and put it back on the table autopsy report please he snapped brady picked up a slim document and passed it over bob took it and read through it slowly and carefully when he was finished he laid it beside the photographs okay he said dryly so hes really dead talk me through it theres not much to tell bob brady replied we took a call from the neighbour mr polanski saying that hed heard screaming from the neidholm house and that hed seen a lady at the back door in a distressed state distressed hysterical even there was a patrol car a block away it was there literally in a minute one officer went to the front door the other went round the back and found your wife standing in the kitchen over the body with a glass of water in her hand officer said she turned to him and asked what kept you he took the glass from her and cuffed her did she protest her innocence no she became violent she struggled and started to yell what did she yell to be specific she yelled what are you doing you asshole thats what the officer said hah skinner barked doesnt that sound to you like a protestation of innocence it sounds to me like abusive language the da will not challenge my interpretation eddie will he brad the sheriff looked at him cautiously but eventually shook his head i dont think so for a minute bob carry on eddie yes sir the patrol officers called for detectives fortunately the first man on the scene sergeant dick madigan is a capable and experienced guy he knew your wife and the victim from high school he called the sheriff directly and told him what had happened and i told him to take sarah straight away to the das office and hold her there said dekker she was off the scene long before the first media got there is madigan a lieutenant yet skinner asked with the faintest of smiles no but he will be soon eddie brady nodded after that we put a forensic team in and gave the place a total going over here i get embarrassed he said because i gotta be blunt bob your wife was all over that house we printed the knife while it was still in the body the victims prints were on it because it was his one of a set of kitchen knives absolutely the only other traces on the handle were your wifes some were mixed in with neidholms but we were able to separate enough she had a full grip of the knife he made a motion with his hand in exactly the same way as youd hold it to stab someone like the victim was stabbed has she given you an explanation for that shes made no statement yet other than to declare her innocence john vranic reserved her position quite right go on if you insist like i said we went over the whole place we found forensic evidence of her presence in the house in several locations there were fingerprints in the living room the den the main bathroom and the ensuite bathroom attached to the victims bedroom we found hair from her head on a chair in the drawing room in a brush on neidholms dressing table and on the back of a pillow we found her pubic hairs in the shower trap and in the victims bed we matched these against samples that she provided voluntarily we also found brady stopped you want more skinner glared at him go on he hissed we found stains on the bedsheet body fluids analysis so far shows two blood types the victims and your wifes we dont have full dna test results yet but but i know what theyll show the scot conceded with a grimace okay eddie youve proved that my wife had sex with ron neidholm youve proved that she found his body he paused and rapped his knuckles on the table but where have you proved that she killed him was his blood on her we found traces on her shoes from the kitchen floor that means nothing how about her clothes her shirt slacks whatever she was wearing were there blood splashes on them no but the pathologist said that death was almost instantaneous there didnt have to be any come on man were talking about a massive knife wound that ripped straight up under the sternum and into the heart of course there were blood splashes have you ever seen a fatal stabbing where there werent our guy says there neednt have been any and our guys as many as we need to convince a jury will say there must have been forget it can you prove that she was in the house for any longer than she says her story is that she let herself in with a key neidholm had given her went into the kitchen and found him there have you got a time of death he was still fresh when the sceneofcrime doc got there hed barely started to cool but thats not an issue the length of time she was in the house could be the autopsy report found no signs of intercourse on the body so you cant argue that she had sex with him then no brady admitted those stains were a couple of days old exactly so you have no physical evidence of her being there other than at or immediately after the time of death and you have no physical evidence of her killing him christ bob we have her prints on the knife you also have his plus youve proved that she was in the house days before the killing she must have handled the knife then thats all the prints prove that she handled it evidentially the knife will support the proposition that neidholm killed himself why the hell would he do that the american protested the guys rich hes a sporting hero plus hes just got back together with the love of his life by that token why the hell would sarah want to kill him skinner shot back show me a scrap of evidence that says she might chief brady shifted in his chair he glanced at dekker then back at bob eventually he reached into a folder on the table and took out a sheet of paper encased in a clear evidence envelope carefully he passed it across that was in her purse he said skinner took ron neidholms letter of proposal to his wife his face was impassive as he read it once twice three times when he had finished studying the words he held it closer and peered at the signature its his blood brady told him remember the autopsy report mentions a healing cut on his left thumb the guy sliced himself open and signed it in blood thats how serious he was about her the big scot shook his head this might be evidence against me eddie but not sarah surely if id been in buffalo and had found that it might have made me think about fucking killing him the chief of detectives drew himself up in his chair its our contention that your wife went to confront him about this letter we reckon she went to turn him down he got heavy about it things turned nasty and she panicked and stabbed him the only reason we aint charged her yet is because the da wants to talk to vranic about taking a guilty plea to second degree homicide hell also accept a plea to involuntary manslaughter bob said sheriff dekker the chief shot him an exasperated look she could get a pretty light sentence no way skinner muttered think about it please ron neidholm was a local hero if this case goes to a jury any jury need i spell it out you heard me brad no way my wife did not kill this bastard he turned back to the detective so far eddie youve told me about the crime scene thats all tell me about the rest of your investigation what investigation we caught her in the act or as good as you did no such fucking thing because she didnt do it your guys got there before she had time to get herself together and call them herself thats all are you actually telling me you dont have any supporting witnesses to the relationship or anything else no im not we have two witnesses friends of your wife who have testified that she and ron were intimate during their college days they say that when he went off to play football sarah dumped him and went to new york then scotland where she met you he never married or had any longterm relationships when they met again recently the witnesses say he was ecstatic how did they meet again at the home of one of the witnesses babs bloody walker skinner exclaimed brady looked alarmed i cant tell you that you dont have to man i know her all too well the little bitch put them together and she did it with malice in her mind sarah never talked to me about neidholm until babs told me the whole story embellished i dare say you put her on the stand and under oath i will have vranic crucify her whos your other witness he demanded again the chief protested i cant give you her name i will tell you that she drove past neidholms house last saturday and saw them get out of his car she says that they appeared very affectionate towards each other later she drove past in the other direction on her way home she saw sarah through a bedroom window she was naked did she tell anyone about this apart from you she told the first witness then you might as well give me her name for you can bet that babs walker will have told sarah she was seen and by whom dekker nodded to his detective might as well ed if you say so the womans name is alice bierhoff so who else did dear alice tell about my wife and big ron the football stud brady blinked i dont know you mean you didnt ask her bob exclaimed hell no how would it have been relevant if you cant fucking see that he retorted it would introduce someone else who knew about the relationship another woman say another woman who had designs on neidholm herself sheriff dekker held up a hand hold on bob youre getting ahead of yourself maybe so brad but you get my point this case has not been properly investigated eddie he snapped did your forensic team search for the presence of anyone else in the house there were no prints other than those of neidholm and your wife killers often wipe them man but what they cant do is pick up every single body hair that might fall off them or every single soil sample they might bring on to the scene on their shoes did you search for extraneous samples or did you simply settle for what was on the bed we saw no need to do more than we did do you see it now skinner fixed his eyes on brady hard unblinking intimidating the man tried to look away but found that he was unable to do so if itll satisfy you he replied eventually the words came out as a croak satisfy me what sort of a fucking investigator are you eddie every miscarriage of justice that i can think of came about because of coppers like you people who went for the first obvious solution and because the facts seemed to fit didnt bother to look any further a detective has a public duty to carry out a complete exhaustive investigation of every case whatever the circumstances there is no such thing as enough evidence especially when there is the slightest possibility that some of it might actually disprove the guilt of your obvious culprit he stabbed the air with his index finger aiming it straight at brady so yes you get your forensic team back on the job if they havent contaminated the whole damn scene and get them looking for traces of someone else the person who actually killed ron neidholm and as for the bierhoff woman if you wont interview her properly then i will now wait a goddamned minute brady squealed you cannot do that ill arrest you if you try skinner glared at him until the man flinched visibly bring help he murmured lots of it now gentlemen please dekker exclaimed lets cool our tempers here bob you have made your point there are things that need to be done in this investigation that havent been they will be though ill see to that however he continued i have to say as a lawyer as well as sheriff that i still see a pretty good case against sarah on the basis of what we have now we have to proceed you mentioned politics a while back given the victim if we just let her walk on this the flak would be unbelievable were going to need more than alternative theories to keep this away from a jury ill go as far with you as i can but give me twentyfour hours skinner asked his voice calm once more until you charge and arraign her and keep her name secret till then plus i want to go with eddie as an observer when he reinterviews the bierhoff woman ive never met her he doesnt have to tell her who i am and i want her and babs walker warned that there will be consequences if they leak sarahs name to the media before any charges have been laid dekker nodded you can have all of that the last parts already been done the da himself laid down the law to the wits about talking to the press he turned to the chief eddie when will you see bierhoff whats wrong with now skinner rumbled the clocks ticking already fortynine weve got to take a decision on this stevie there was a degree of impatience in george regans tone but steele tolerated it partly because he liked the gruff detective sergeant but mainly because this time he knew that he was right go on then he conceded talk it through okay weve been through the candela and finch staff lists concentrating on males because whatever the vargas woman might have put in her picture the god who made that windup call to andrea strachan was definitely a man weve still got sheringham in the frame as a suspect but without any supporting evidence that puts him in possession of the materials it took to make the incendiary device thats all hell ever be plus though he accepts that the call to the girl was made from his phone he maintains someone else nicked it and made it and that steele interjected could only have happened during the staff party right that gives us a list if we leave in the partners of one hundred and thirtyseven males one hundred and nineteen if we take them out take away sheringham and weve got a hundred and eighteen but were they all there ive asked mr candela that he checked and told me that eleven staff members were out of town on business last friday evening so weve got a hundred and seven men potentially in the frame after the incident on saturday we interviewed all the staff members who were there and all eighteen partners of the staff people we spoke to twentythree of them were males not counting sheringham but can we rule out the possibility that the bomb was triggered from outside the building no but if we take this further we go there second id say we must concentrate on the people who were actually inside the room even at that though stevie if were going to be thorough and not rule out people on grounds of importance weve got a list of fortyone ive got all their statements sorted out for us to go through in detail but ive had a quick shuftie through them and nothing jumped out at me none of them even mentioned andrea so how will anyone have spotted someone less noticeable steele nodded i take your point i dont expect to get anything from the statements either but theyre all weve got we cant get search warrants for fortyone people fortyone bloody lawyers at that and we cant exactly ask all of them to talk to andrea on a mobile phone and say hello dear this is god its a nice idea he chuckled and it might even be good therapy for andrea but its not on no george i agree with you well probably have to go through these statements again and maybe even reinterview a few people but its all just to show the bosses that we havent stopped trying this investigation is stalled stuck stone cold regan sighed still best get on with it and keep dan pringle happy he reached for a pile of statements on his desk do you want to split these down the middle he glanced at the inspector and saw that he was staring ahead at nothing with a frown on his face stevie what oh sorry george i was away for a minute thinking of something andrea said to me at lunch and what it might mean his eyes narrowed as he looked at his colleague what if our getting bogged down in this was the whole idea fifty bob skinner had often wondered exactly what a soccer mom was as he looked at alice bierhoff across her comfortable wellfurnished living room he began to understand she was a classically pretty woman and had an outdoor look about her well scrubbed and with an allembracing enthusiasm shining from her eyes and a smile permanently on her face there were pictures of her son byron all over the room in various stages of growth from infancy to twelve understanding moved a step closer for skinner when he saw that the most recent showed him in his football kit as is true of most scots soccer was an alien term to him there were no photographs of mr bierhoff they must have been removed bob guessed after the stockbroker shocked the neighbourhood by moving in with a cheerleader from a college basketball team eddie brady was still seething quietly at his presence but dekker had stood firm skinner had been included on the interview with brady and sergeant madigan he had been introduced simply as a colleague from another agency bizarrely alice bierhoffs bland nod and smile at the description had made the image of johnny rotten flash before his eyes as he looked at her the chorus of the sex pistols pretty vacant ran through his brain he stood by the window as she served tea to the two erie detectives he had declined he had drunk enough american tea in his time so youre chief of detectives mr brady alice twinkled as she sat opposite them i guess im honoured what can i do for you brady sipped his tea and gave a short spluttering cough sergeant madigan and i he began when he had recovered would like to go over a couple of points in the statement you gave our colleagues after mr neidholms death his murder you mean she exclaimed i suppose although technically we havent yet ruled out suicide ron she exclaimed kill himself you have to be kidding like i said its a theoretical possibility thats all i should think so alice chuckled but what about my deposition it was all true every word of it i saw sarah grace and ron necking at his front door and later when i drove past i saw her through his window she was smiling like in a you know contented to be polite way and she was putting on her bra although she didnt seem to be in too much of a hurry about it you must have driven past pretty slowly said madigan with an apparently amiable smile mrs bierhoff missed the point i always do i never exceed the speed limit in the neighbourhood or anywhere for that matter she added hurriedly but of course having seen what i saw earlier i was naturally curious when i drove back are you sure dr grace didnt see you asked brady absolutely from the look on her face she was only seeing one thing poor ron she sighed a finger going to her eyelashes wiping away a nonexistent tear he was a bit of a legend at school and at college you know all the girls were jealous of sarah when she landed him and we were so surprised when she dumped him are they still jealous asked madigan weve all moved on since then said alice in a tone that was almost matronly its sarahs husband i feel sorry for having been in the same position myself i was out of town when it happened but i heard about him collapsing at the funeral next thing almost as soon as the poor mans recovered and gone back to his job in scotland shes making whoopee with her old boyfriend the poor man she paused and gasped as a thought came to her hey you dont think it could have been him killed ron do you i wish thought skinner by the window absolutely not said brady chief skinner was in scotland when it happened to get back to your deposition mrs bierhoff he continued hurriedly wed like to add to it by asking you who you might have told about what you saw but that was in my statement i told babs walker i mean i felt that i had to shes sarahs best friend and always has been i thought that she might be able to talk some sense into her or at least to tell her to be more discreet when you get down to it i suppose you can hardly blame her ron is such a stud and sarahs husbands quite a bit older than she is but still poor man watching brady skinner could see that the back of his neck had gone red i suppose babs maybe told ian alice went on although that might have been awkward why asked madigan because he was there before ron of course she said ian and sarah were close all through school and then when they got to college before he ever took up with babs of course they got even closer as close as you can get in fact sarah left ian for ron he put a brave face on it at the time but i could tell the poor boy was hurting so maybe it wouldnt have been the kindest thing for babs to tell him they were back together again skinner stood impassive listening he wanted to ask the next question but he knew that he could not let her hear his accent even alice would make four out of that but apart from mrs walker madigan went on did you tell anyone else alice frowned the wrinkling of her forehead seemed to age her five years in an instant no i dont think so she paused i told mary maggs my cleaning lady but she doesnt know anyone around here plus shes seventyone years old and i told candy brew at the library but candys discretion personified and thats it honest injun brady nodded put his hands on his knees and pushed himself to his feet madigan took the cue and rose also in that case said the chief we wont occupy any more of your time a pleasure alice answered vacuously she glanced at her watch my its almost time for me to go pick up byron she showed them to the door smiling briefly at skinner on the way out he gave her a blank expressionless stare in return her eyes flickered uncertainly but she said nothing holding the door open for them and waving a quick goodbye as she closed it on them well bob asked as they walked down the drive to bradys car walker i dont think so for a minute there you go assuming again eddie the scot snapped its a new line of enquiry will you follow it up or will i okay okay well look at it and what about this candy brew did neidholm have any history with her both detectives laughed you can forget that sir said madigan candy is short for candrace hes a guy fiftyone maggie glanced at her watch as the livingroom door opened and he came in it showed a minute or two after seventhirty straight home or via leith she asked he frowned i thought you werent going to ask questions like that any more yes i know you did but the thing is in spite of everything im still a woman and you know us girlies mario we can be fickle as it happens straight home he told her brusquely i had a late briefing with the team you mean you took them for a pint something like that i had an unexpected visitor earlier on that knocked my schedule for the rest of the day poor you well now youre here grab yourself a beer and sit down ive got something to tell you he looked at her his curiosity aroused almost for the first time he noticed that she was wearing her pale blue silk dressing gown and that the hair at the back of her neck was wet from the shower he threw his jacket across a chair and headed for the kitchen only to pause at the door can i get you something he asked she picked up an empty glass from the floor and held it out for him you can get me another g and t if you like and remember no lemon i know you dont take lemon maggie smiled cheerfully sorry i said it just in case you got me confused with someone else the thought crossed his mind that she might be having more than her second drink but he took the heavy tumbler from her without comment he was back in less than a minute a tin of stella artois in one hand and his wifes gin and tonic in the other he handed it to her and settled on to the couch beside her okay he said what have you got to tell me a few things but first things first i had a call late this afternoon from our very efficient solicitor the deal is done with the chamberlains weve agreed to surrender custody and theyve agreed without prompting that rufus can spend four weeks out of every year outside the school terms of course with his big sister and brotherinlaw in spite of himself mario let the pang of regret that shot through him show on his face that was quick he muttered no point in hanging about it wouldnt have been fair to keep the child in limbo when theyre driving up on saturday theyll come to pick him up on sunday morning and go straight back to hampshire that means you can still take him out this weekend no he countered it means we can well both take him somewhere give him a treat work permitting fuck work some things are more important maggie drained a third of her gin and tonic bloody hell she exclaimed was that mario mcguire who just said that the next head ofcid whats got into you tonight he asked smiling for the first time since he had come in apart from half a bottle of gin that is hope you put the wee fella to bed the right way up maggie chuckled hes fine dont you worry sound asleep so i guess im making the dinner somehow without him noticing the distance between them on the couch had closed what he did notice was that her robe had loosened and that her right breast had slipped loose maybe ive got other plans she whispered holding her glass steady she stood up the sash of her dressing gown untangled and the garment fell open someone i like very much gave me a peptalk today and some very sound advice too ive decided to follow it and have you got to get drunk to do it he asked as he looked up at her if thats what it takes wont it be worth it come on she turned and walked steadily and purposefully towards the door mario rose and followed her when he reached what had become her bedroom the silk gown was on the floor and the glass was on the bedside cabinet empty she stood there naked as fullbodied and surprisingly provocative as ever she had been as he gazed at her she moved towards him and began to unbutton his shirt he saw that her hand was trembling the drink had not dulled her fear of what they were about to do he held it and stilled it then ripped off his tie with one hand and then their eyes met you dont really want this do you she asked with the hint of a sob in her voice he shook his head no and neither do you even if the thing itself was nothing to you you wouldnt really want to not with me isnt that true she nodded it is she exclaimed with a great sadness its got nothing to do with paula either its you mario its in your eyes when you look at me you know all there is to know about me and what happened to me and because of it you cant keep distaste from showing in your eyes youll try if i really ask you because you care for me and youre a good man but itll always be there and youll never be able to help it im not the same person i was to you before and i never can be again he looked at her saying nothing but admitting with his eyes the truth of what she said but its me too she went on for exactly the same reason because you know you cant ever be the same person to me again either no he muttered at last i cant were done mags he stepped over to what had been their bed and sat on it heavily i had a peptalk myself today he said neil was the unexpected visitor i mentioned he came to see me about something hes working on but then he got ripped into me about the way ive been behaving about the way people have seen me treat you he made me realise that i was fooling myself thinking we could go on as we were not you alone she told him but us i thought id be fine with the way it was i was even going to send paula flowers and a thank you note hah shed have loved that no mags if i was a bit short when i came in tonight it was because id worked myself up to tell you that im leaving as soon as rufus goes for a moment there i thought there was a glimmer but youre right its gone too far for us both what i really wanted you to believe though and i still do is that im doing it for the reason neil more or less battered into me im doing it for your sake and for the sake of your career she sat beside him and took his hand i do believe you she whispered like i said youre a good guy she paused will you go to paula he shook his head at once no that would be as wrong as if i stayed im not being seen to leave you and move in with another woman will you keep seeing her would it bother you not a bit and why should it if it hasnt up to now then to be honest with myself as well as you i probably will it might fizzle out or it might go on for thirty years who knows but i dont think well ever live together i dont know if i ever told you but the family trust owns uncle beppes place auntie sophias going to live with nana viareggio for good so its going begging ill move in there and you can stay on in this house if you want to dont you want your share of it he grinned and shook his head i dont need it honey anyway youll have this and more coming in a property split no her vehemence surprised him you give me this house and thatll do me i dont want any more i owe you mario i owe you my life and ill never forget it im not going to stay here for long though i can understand that thats a deal then ill clear off whats left of the mortgage and you can sell it he paused of course maybe if we both moved somewhere else together she squeezed his hand and gave him a sad smile you dont really believe that any more than i do you said it earlier were done it wasnt all bad though was it no it was not in fact i have to tell you that if you were like you say faking it all along you had your act honed to perfection you gave me plenty of practice she was suddenly aware of her nakedness she picked up the silk robe and put it on so you want to go and get a takeaway she asked matteroffact you must be starving he stood up from the bed and retrieved his tie yeah okay pizza kebab or curry fish and chips he laughed trust you to be difficult he put his hand on the door knob then stopped mags tell me something when did it all go down the pan she took a quick breath when i told you about myself all about myself i think we were done from then on if id done it at the very start maybe wed never have got married and then wed have been spared the grief in that case he replied im glad you didnt for the good times we had the griefs been well worth it fiftytwo bob you have to head brady off before he embarrasses himself sarah protested he cant possibly imagine that ian walker could have had anything to do with rons death how the hell could i do that even if i wanted to bob retorted i kickstarted this bloody investigation when he was happy to send you straight down the river i cant turn around and tell him to rein it in besides he needs to be checked out after your loosetongued friend mrs bierhoff stuck him well in the frame no friend of mine thank christ you see that if only youd seen the same about dear babs ive always known what babs was like but in spite of everything shes always been my friend i cant help it well see if that survives her old man being interviewed by the police but why she exclaimed what possible reason could ian have had to harm ron theyre looking at the possibility that he might have held a grudge against him for a long time over you in fact alice told them that you chucked him for ron when you were in college is that true no it isnt ian and i were more friends than anything else we had a relationship sure but we never made a commitment to each other it wasnt a case of me chucking him at all alice suggested that ian might have seen it that way well the bitch is wrong said sarah angrily you sure about that did you ever talk it through with him no but bob this is ancient history that may be but theres been a new chapter written lately what if ian heard about it and didnt like it not a chance i just dont believe it skinner shrugged his shoulders for what its worth neither do i but bierhoff made the suggestion and the police have to look into it well lets hope they do it discreetly brady will dont worry sarah frowned its your discretion thats worrying me what do you mean i mean that you havent said a word about ron and me she exclaimed her voice rising i keep waiting for you to explode but its not happening all i see is icy calm or is it just indifference is our marriage already over as far as youre concerned he looked at her unsmiling my only purpose at this minute he answered is to prove that you didnt kill neidholm i dont actually care who did but given the circumstantial evidence against you the only way i can clear you is by finding that person once ive done that you and i will deal with us she bit her lip and sat forward in the big drawingroom chair tugging nervously at her hair as bob stared at her he noticed for the first time the dark circles under her eyes and the lines around them that seemed not to have been there before thats something i suppose she conceded it would be easy for you simply to let me go to jail easy he retorted do you think i want my kids visiting their mother in the slammer she frowned in other words dont make any assumptions sarah if you like dont you feel anything finally he allowed himself a smile but it was not one that she enjoyed sure he said i feel bloody pleased that your lovers dead it takes a great weight off my shoulders and a great temptation away from me he looked good on the slab though it was obvious what you saw in him no it wasnt she answered quietly for one thing he was here for me the barb got to him and he winced touche no lets not get into this now lets just concentrate on the job at hand does the name candrace brew mean anything to you no should it not necessarily but hes heard of you all right he was on alices gossip list she told him all about you and ron sarah shuddered ugh it makes me feel soiled knowing that cows been telling the town about me who is this person brew hes the librarian the librarian my god our librarys always been an information exchange itll be all over town honey said bob quietly if bradys investigation doesnt get a result by this time tomorrow itll be all over good morning bloody america dont remind me please im scared enough as it is the truth of that showed in her eyes he sighed it was the first sign of tenderness he had shown towards her since his arrival you must be im sorry i shouldnt have said that he smiled at her again but more kindly this time lets do something about it then i want you to think back to the time when you arrived at neidholms house then i want you to describe what you saw she leaned back in her chair frowning i cant remember bob she whispered after a few seconds all i can see in my minds eye is ron lying there dead on the floor of course you can remember just close your eyes and concentrate tell me what you saw she did as he said he watched her as she concentrated there was a man walking a dog she said at last an old black man walking an old black dog did you recognise him no but i would if i saw him again good now what about cars did you see any cars she hesitated there was one a blue dodge peoplecarrier the driver was a woman she was collecting a kid from where from a party in the house across the street from rons how did you know it was a party there were balloons tied to a tree in the yard and there were still a couple of children playing outside even though it was nearly dark good anything else no after that i pulled into rons driveway she opened her eyes does any of that help no in that you didnt see the real killer driving away he said but maybe the old man with the dog did or maybe the woman in the dodge van did the police can find them and ask them if theyd done a proper job from the start theyd have traced them by now he frowned a party eh he mused what do you do at a party these days play if youre a kid drink beer if youre you what else you take photographs sarah sat upright suddenly or you film it she exclaimed showing her first sign of excitement bob there was a lady filming the kids when i drove up it was nearly dark but thats no problem to a modern movie camera instantly skinner was as excited as his wife in that case lets hope she took plenty of footage he jumped to his feet come on tell trish to pick up mark from school when its time you and i are going out why are we going to see brady bugger him he laughed were going to find the woman with the camera fiftythree the young steven steele had been brought up in dunfermline and it had gone against the grain with his police superintendent father when he had applied to join the force across the river rather than his own life constabulary he had dug his heels in nevertheless refusing to consider a move that would have led to comparisons between them for years ahead in edinburgh stevie had never felt himself to be involved in a race to match his dads progress up the promotion ladder and indeed that of his father before him in life that is exactly how his career would have been seen as it happened he had made inspector at thirtytwo five years faster than steele senior he believed that his success owed a lot to the understanding of the police culture that had been built into him in the family home it had made him less in awe of senior officers than other young coppers made it easier for him to relate to them and consequently for them to notice him just as he had never paced himself against superintendent steele in life neither had he picked any of his fellow officers in edinburgh as a benchmark however he had on occasion looked at maggie rose as an example she had taken longer than him to break out of the mass of constables with potential but as far as he knew there was no police tradition in her family once she had though her ability had been recognised with a series of promotions steele knew that he and maggie worked well together because they brought the same skills to the job and because intellectually they were well matched okay he was a couple of rungs below her on the ladder but time would take care of that he had wondered on occasion about her family she never spoke of anyone other than mario his speculation was that she had been an orphan perhaps she had lost her parents in an accident for there was an unexplained hurt within her that he could see their exchange the day before had been the first time they had ever spoken of personal matters until then it had always been work or the occasional piece of social nonsense over an afterhours drink with other colleagues there had been a spark between them it had been very faint no more than a firefly on a cold night yet he had felt it he had the sense to know though that she was territory beyond his limits not just because of the formidable dangerous mario mcguire but because he sensed that there were depths to her that no one would ever reach or be allowed anywhere near as he stood on the stone landing outside the albany terrace flat it occurred to him that margaret rose and andrea strachan had two things in common they were both troubled women and maybe he suspected maggies problems ran deeper than andreas also neither of them seemed to have any grasp of how attractive they were to a normal healthy male like detective inspector steven steele copperabouttown as he pondered them both thoughts of a third woman came to him someone with whom a few months before he had shared a bottle of pesquera in sombre mood in a dark winebar after a postmortem examination which he had witnessed and which she had carried out sarah skinner had her troubles too she had not spoken of them but they had been there to see and he had known lonely women before unlike maggie and andrea however the deputy chief constables wife knew exactly how attractive she was and was in no way afraid of herself he still was not sure what had made him kiss her or whether it was she who had kissed him he only knew that it had happened and that for her as for him it had been the opening of a door it had only been pure abject cowardice that had made him close it again without stepping through by offering her the excuse of coffee at his place he wondered whether if they ever had the opportunity to play the same scene again he would be braver he frowned and put the thought out of his mind as he pressed andreas doorbell he heard her footfall lightly on the other side of the door grinning he put his eye to the spyglass for a moment then stepped back so that she could see who he was she was smiling when she opened the door and he felt his heart lift he had seen the woman who lived on the other side of this andrea for a moment he wondered if he would have the same feeling every time they met she seemed smaller than before and he realised that she was barefoot wearing jeans that were frayed at the hems and a university sweatshirt that he was sure did not date back to her dowdy student days her brown hair was tied back from her face in a ponytail have i missed something here she asked glancing at her watch did we decide to make it tonight for the pictures no said stevie brightly ive been thinking about what you said at lunch weve hit the wall with our investigation and i wanted to talk to you some more about it he sensed her tense a little youre not coming back to me as a suspect are you she was still smiling but some of the light seemed to have gone out of her eyes absolutely not he said at once if we were it wouldnt be me who came to see you why not he grinned at her work it out ahh she exclaimed so the police are a bit like doctors not allowed to get personal with the clients youll have to forgive me stevie i really am naive in these areas you sure are when are you going to invite me in she started with a tiny jump and put a hand to her mouth oh im sorry she laughed and threw the door open wide straight through there he followed her pointing finger and stepped from the tiny hall into a square living room with two big windows that reached almost from ceiling to floor they were uncurtained but still had their original wooden shutters a popular feature with the georgian and victorian architects who designed the new town andreas flat faced northwest and the room was bathed in the warm light of the evening summer sun he looked around as she closed the door and joined him the room was a strange mix of austerity and colour the two armchairs were upholstered in stiff oldfashioned imitation leather with brass studs on their facings and the sideboard and occasional tables were dark dull things in contrast there were bright primarycoloured cushions scattered around and vivid landscapes on the walls with not a hint of van gogh about them a vase of fresh cut flowers stood on the sideboard and alongside it a compact sony hifi was playing something breezy by jools holland get rid of the furniture he murmured as she came to stand behind him i know what you mean she confessed but it was my grannys then donate it to age concern and get some new stuff she wont mind you didnt know my granny waste not want not that was her motto actually it should just have been waste not she believed that wanting was a sin granny strachan was firmly on the zealot side of my family what about grandpa where was he well out of it in a cemetery on the isle of lewis he died about fifty years ago in the background jools ended with a flourish and the cd changer switched to a surprising piece of bluegrass by someone who sounded to steele like dolly parton with a voice as clear and sharp as her chest was rounded so what is it inspector that you want to talk to me about asked andrea sit down she insisted pushing him towards one of the uncomfortable chairs let me get you a drink would orange juice or cola be all right i dont have anything alcoholic anything she opened a door to his left he followed her with his eyes into a small kitchen a fridge door swung open and he heard canopening sounds she reappeared with a tin of red cola in each hand will it do like this she asked all my glasses are in the dishwasher he grinned as he took it from her letting his hand brush hers for a second longer than necessary and noting that like maggie rose the day before she did not flinch from his touch youre getting more decadent by the day andrea he chuckled good she said firmly and folded herself into the other chair tucking her feet under her and managing somehow to make the thing look comfortable now what is it or were you just looking for an excuse to see me again i probably was he admitted but i wanted to speak to a chemist and youre the only one i know ive had some daft thoughts running about in my head and some questions i need answering about what bombs specifically incendiary devices that wouldnt leave a trace after theyd done what they were meant to do and you think im a specialist do you she gave him what he hoped was a mock frown no not at all like i said youre a chemist with special experience she added dryly with a raised eyebrow chuck it ill go if you like she smiled like a rainbow through a shower no i like you being here youre the first man to come through that door who hasnt been a relation or a doctor okay this bomb of yours how would you set it off remotely with either a device triggered by a radio signal or a simple timer i dont see how you could do it then youd have to use combustible materials to start your fire their reaction wouldnt make their elements disappear id expect there still to be a residue an oxidisation that could be traced afterwards what if you used a material that would be natural at the scene like oil in a garage or paper in an office any traces that were found wouldnt seem unusual no andrea agreed but what about your trigger device that wouldnt disappear into thin air either suppose you simply lit a blue touch paper and retired that would leave a trace of what it had been before it was consumed she laughed you cant do it stevie youd be talking spontaneous combustion and thats not a very efficient way of starting a fire at least not the sort youre talking about what sort might it work on he asked casually she smiled again pure rainbow this time no shower in sight strictly speaking this is physics not chemistry so im just guessing you understand but maybe theres me for a start by the nature of the phenomenon though youll have to stick around till it happens if youre interested that is she stretched her hand out towards him and he took it oh im interested all right he murmured grinning back at her what do i do if you show signs of bursting into flames as i told you she replied its never happened before but id guess you throw a blanket over us and do what you have to to keep them from getting out of control i have been told though that it might be more interesting if you just let me burn she unwound herself from her chair and stood up it could take some time though a few weeks months even so while were waiting ill just make us a nice salad fiftyfour thats the house said sarah he drew the jag to a halt and looked across the street to where she was pointing a single deflated balloon still hung from a tree in the yard okay he muttered lets see if the ladys at home he opened the car door and swung it open do you want me to come she asked bob paused better not he replied after a couple of seconds of thought im pushing my luck with brady as it is let me talk to her if theres anything i think you need to hear or see ill come back and get you he stepped out on to the road and started to walk the fifty yards towards the house as he neared it he looked to his right the sheriffs departments crime scene tape was still stretched across ron neidholms front door it spoiled the look of the place skinner could see personality in houses without the tape this one would have looked friendly and welcoming sometimes he thought he could see their history also he looked at an upstairs window and pictured sarah framed in it with a dreamy look in her eye as she dressed he snapped his gaze away and turned in to the driveway of the house across the street he had always been struck by the size of the plots on which even the most modest of american houses are built this is a bigass country my man his poor dead friend joe doherty had said to him once we aint stingy with our land like you brits he guessed that the acreage on which he stood was around the same as that of his own home in gullane and wondered how much less it had cost the front door opened before he reached it a strawhaired woman appeared leaning against the frame and frowning at him as he approached she looked to be in her early thirties around sarahs age and was dressed much as his wife did at home in jeans teeshirt and trainers can i help you she asked skinner smiled at her her expression softened a little but suspicion remained in her eyes i hope so he replied he took out his warrant card and held it up for her to see at home or abroad he never went anywhere without it im a police officer im not from around here but ive been working with the erie county sheriff in the investigation of ron neidholms death there are a couple of things id like to ask you the woman gasped involuntarily oh yeah she exclaimed poor ron how awful he was such a nice man for all that he was a big sports star he was so ordinary and so pleasant i just cant imagine him being killed like they said right in the middle of my little boys birthday party too why i spoke to him that very afternoon he came across to say hello she paused and gave him an appraising look skinner found himself reminded of alex when he had taken her to edinburgh zoo as an eightyearold she had peered at the pygmy hippos in exactly the same way youre scottish arent you she asked i am indeed he replied from lanarkshire originally but now from edinburgh how interesting im scottish too she tittered not that youd know it to listen to me actually im canadian but my parents emigrated from scotland to toronto about forty years ago they came from bellshill thats in lanarkshire isnt it it sure is my mother was brought up there hey small world wont you come in my names elaine by the way elaine aitchison my husbands scottish too well scottish from hamilton ontario his job moved us down here nice to meet you he replied my names bob skinner if you couldnt read it on my card she led the way into a house that would have seemed large in scotland but which by american standards was modest in size he followed her through into a reception room that was furnished as traditionally as anything he had ever seen threepiece fabricupholstered suite set facing a big fireplace with a console television beside it the room had windows to the front and back in the yard he could see a playpen in which a child was kicking a ball on unsteady legs thats ally my younger son said mrs aitchison hes just two ryan my older boy turned seven on monday it was his birthday party we were having when poor ron was killed you said you spoke to him just before he died yeah he saw the party balloons and once the kids had arrived he came across to wish ryan happy birthday he brought him a football and hed signed it too did you know him very well asked skinner well enough francis my husband thought it was great having a football star for a neighbour but ron might as well have been a shoe salesman by the way he acted did you talk to him for long on monday not really i was in the middle of the party but he stayed long enough to organise a touch football game for the boys and we spoke then i asked him about his girlfriend id seen him with her at the weekend she was new actually i dont recall seeing him with a girl on any of his visits before what did he say about her mrs aitchison sighed he lit up like a christmas tree the poor man he said she was someone hed met up with again after a long time someone hed never stopped loving he told me that shed just split with her husband and that he hoped shed settle down with him since hed decided to quit football for good was he expecting company on monday i think he was expecting her he said he had to go because he thought hed be having a visitor that evening and he wanted to get ready he said he didnt know when but he was pretty sure shed come when i think about it again it could only have been her he was talking about did you see her arrive no i saw the police take her away then drive her car away that was all did you see anyone else come to the house before that no but then i wasnt looking i was feeding eighteen kids and getting them all to the bathroom and such skinner frowned elaine he asked did anyone from the sheriffs detective bureau speak to you on monday the woman shook her head no has anyone since then not at all youre the first she looked at him how exactly are you involved with them mr skinner you could say im running a quality control check on their investigative techniques how are they doing badly he said grimly so no ones approached you at all about monday a television reporter did but i didnt like her so i told her id seen nothing and to get her crew the hell out of my driveway skinner grinned good for you i cant stand it either when they get intrusive he paused can you remember he continued whether anyone did any filming during the party sure she answered at once i did it wasnt what youd call filming though i have a digital camera that takes still shots and very short video clips do you still have the pictures you took sure theyre on a memory stick would you like to look at them yes please come through to the kitchen then ill connect the camera through my laptop and youll see the images bigger fine he followed her out of the living room the kitchen was much brighter he could see why she kept her computer there even though it was a toshiba portable he waited while she linked the camera a small sony through a port in the back of the laptop case then booted it up while the machine readied itself she poured two mugs of coffee from a jug and handed one to him he took it automatically without even thinking about it okay she announced as the images on the screen became fixed lets go she clicked an icon and waited for a new window to open then clicked again a photographic image appeared it showed a small boy with freckles and a gaptoothed smile standing beside the playpen in the back yard leaning on it he was wearing black trousers and a buffalo bills replica shirt elaine aitchison stood aside you drive if you like she offered just click the button below the trackpad to advance the pictures thanks he stood in from of the toshiba and found the button then began to click another shot of ryan appeared and another then one of him with his younger brother a dozen photographs into the stick bob stopped there was a man in the image on the screen hefting ryan up to his shoulder the boy held a brown football with nfl markings and gaped wideeyed at the camera as if he could not quite believe what was happening thats ron his mother murmured and just think a couple of hours later her voice tailed off into a shiver ryans heartbroken you know i think every little boy in buffalo must be if his girlfriend did it like theyre saying then god help her she didnt do it said skinner quietly you know this asked elaine for sure for sure he clicked his way on through the photos on the memory stick quickly losing count as all of them seemed to have been taken around the barbecue in the back yard and out of sight of neidholms drive but at last the scene changed he reached an image of ryan and four other boys in the front of the house ryan had thrown his football in ron neidholm style and his friends were jumping to catch it the background was wrong though it showed only the garden and nothing on the other side of the street he clicked again and again and again and again and stopped he was looking at a photograph of ryan running down the yard to retrieve the brown ball ron neidholms driveway was in the background and in it there were two cars parked a red sporty job a camaro or a trans am he guessed and before it blocking it in a white saloon wow he whispered you got something mrs aitchison asked i think so he moved on to the next image ryan had recovered the ball and the car was still there in the next shot he was throwing it again his body blocked out the white vehicle but in the further distance in neidholms doorway he thought that he could see a tiny figure back to camera either entering or leaving the house he glanced to the side elaine he asked can you zoom in on these images to be specific on that doorway sure she replied let me show you she picked up the camera made an adjustment and pressed a button the figure in the doorway grew larger but as it did it lost all clarity and became no more than a black blur take me back to the last image please skinner murmured and see if you can focus in on the number plate on that white car she did as he requested together they looked at the screen as the car grew larger as they watched letters became clear and legible bobs grin widened until eventually it was as if it stretched from ear to ear as he looked at the licence plate he felt almost consumed by a huge feeling of relief jesus he laughed talk about signing your name everywhere you go fiftyfive so thats it paula exclaimed youve actually moved out he nodded im in the process of yes youre not giving yourself time for second thoughts youre not just giving yourself a bit of breathing space no neither of us needs any breathing space we both know its over but why has this happened all of a sudden mario you told me what your problems were but you said you were handling them and that you and maggie were content to go on the way you were god i never felt like a whore before but i do now she turned away from him but he put his hands on her shoulders and brought her back to face him once more you can stop that right now he said firmly this has got nothing to do with you you can say that but the rest of bloody edinburgh wont see it that way i suppose im a bit late to be thinking of that now the rest of bloody edinburgh can think what it will but i can tell you this they wont hear it from maggie and they sure as hell wont say it in my hearing paulie the things that killed our marriage have nothing to do with you and me they were covered up for too long now theyve got out of the box and we cant handle them losing custody of rufus might have been the catalyst for this but in a way its been a blessing too but you were so fond of that wee guy yeah i know but hes going to be much better off with his uncles family he wrinkled his nose hell i can always get a puppy and whats maggie going to do on her own shes going to do her job get on with her career as for being on her own shes been that way since she was a kid even when we were married there was a part of her that i could never get near theres a part of me youll never get near too i hope you realise that he grinned hell i wouldnt want to get any where near her shes a dangerous woman youd better believe it she said in mock warning but this part of me isnt she slid her arms around his waist and pressed herself against him burying her face in his chest this parts just a selfish bitch shes glad that youre out of it and if its been wrong all along i suppose i should be glad for maggie too you never know maybe shell find the right man in time maybe she will but it sure as hell aint me when paula looked up at him she was frowning that should worry me you know she whispered maybe youll find the right woman maybe ive found her he replied maybe shes been there all along maybe this is the way it should be me in your mum and dads old place you here living our lives and getting together when we feel like it and maybe you should stop trying to see the future look at your friend neil you could never have guessed what would happen to him after his wife died thats true but there arent too many women like lou around anyway you have to be looking to land one and was neil he frowned no he said slowly there you are then dont you tell me that you dont know a single woman that you fancy a bit he ran his fingers through her silver hair i will tell you that i dont know a single woman or a married one for that matter that i fancy as much as you aye paula murmured doubtfully lets see if it stays that way speaking of neil she continued hows he going to take you and maggie splitting up hes close to her as well as you isnt he neil was more or less the detonator that set off the explosion he told her he sat me down and talked to me and made me see the whole thing the way it really was your ex stevie did something similar for maggie at around the same time stevie eh she mused hes a deep one that you think im secretive hes a kind bloke though too gentle for me in the end but those big soft eyes of his oh they have an effect i can tell you he needs to watch who he looks at then mario muttered darkly what do you mean remember alice cowan the girl who worked for me in sb yeah she shops in my deli what about her she saw stevie in a wine bar with someone he definitely should not have been with a married lady knowing him it was probably perfectly innocent he was probably counselling her not the way alice told it paulas eyes widened she smiled oh dear she said its not like stevieboy to be indiscreet did you talk to him about it no danger im not getting into that if he wants to shaft his career he can get on with it no i filed it away mentally and i told alice to forget what she had seen for ever and will she for sure wont she tell neil now shes working for him god no anyone but neil paulas eyes widened even further it wasnt his wife was it of course not id have fucking killed stevie myself if it had been im intrigued dont be im telling you no more i shouldnt have let that much slip in that case its forgotten already honest but speaking of neil and his wife now that were sort of legit will i get to meet her probably ill let the smoke clear then maybe invite them to dinner at the new place by that time neil may have solved his problem what problem a woman called agnes maley black agnes whats she been up to i thought shed cut her links with the shady side of edinburgh he threw his arms wide in a dramatic gesture and his head back jesus he laughed you know about that too police intelligence a contradiction like they say im from leith mario paula reminded him and im in the sauna business so what about agnes shes been making trouble for the boss thats all now it looks as if shes about to get a holyrood seat neil wants to fix her wagon before that happens hes going to have trouble then agnes covers her tracks plus shes got a lot of friends how does a female scumbag like her have friends she helps people they remember it not least because agnes never lets them forget i heard a story about her the other day as it happens she paused lets have it then he said impatiently okay hold your horses do you know a woman called joanne virtue mario laughed joanne virtue the big easy every copper in edinburgh knows her one or two have known her intimately as well so they say true enough your colleague superintendent jay for one from what i hear joanne was on the game for years but she was an honest worker no drugs no clap a couple of years ago she hung up her gstring and got a job as manager of a sauna at the bottom end of the new town a few weeks back the neighbours started giving her trouble its in a halfposh district and there were one or two noisy incidents they sent a petition to the council asking for the licence to be withdrawn this would not have been happy news for the owner and might have had consequences for joanne so she was really worried im not surprised what did she do she went to see agnes the place isnt in her ward or anywhere near it and the local labour councillor had even signed the petition so youd have thought that would have been that but no agnes said leave it with me a few days later the petition came up before the committee and the labour members voted against it en masse agnes had taken it to the group and told them she wasnt having the girls who work there forced on to the street mario stared at her but why would she do that its not that long since agnes had a sauna in her own ward closed on just those grounds dont ask me thats as much of the story as i was told if you or neil want to hear the rest youd better ask joanne fiftysix so youve got bugger all detective chief superintendent dan pringle pronounced thats the sum total of what youre telling me is it maggie youre almost a week into this investigation and youve got no suspects and no positive lines of enquiry i wouldnt quite a voice from his left intervened it was still short often am and the head of cid was not in one of his sunnier morning moods he glowered at stevie steele you shut up inspector i was talking to your divisional commander not you he turned his hostile gaze back on rose well i wouldnt quite say that sir she snapped back weve been pursuing this investigation diligently since the incident happened we identified a potential suspect almost immediately someone who had access to the picture and who was a schizophrenic with a history of religious freakery aye you said so why isnt she still in the frame because she was eliminated at an early stage she was set up whoever boobytrapped the trinity lured her along there so she could take the blame how do you know that she told us she had a phone call a voice telling her to go as gods witness we established that she did have a call at the time she said but from a mobile belonging to someone in candela and finchs office so what about him why isnt he banged up he was said rose impatiently but we had to release him he denied making the call and said that someone must have borrowed his phone without his knowledge did you dust it of course we did and did you find any prints other than the suspects no was the girl known to the suspect they were at university at the same time well its not enough who else have you got no one rose sighed exasperated and glared at pringle dan whats got up your shirt were doing our bloody best here youre trying too bloody hard then youve got clear evidence that this schizo girl was enticed along so shed be there on a plate for you youve got a suspect with knowledge of her condition no theres no evidence that he knew her history or that he didnt and whats his motive dan why should this trainee bloody lawyer whose interests dont seem to run beyond the local wine bar decide to firebomb a work of art maybe he was paid oh come on maybe he was but what does it matter youve got a case against this guy whats his name sheringham sheringham thats all that need concern you for now send it to the fiscal what you heard clear your tray send the papers on mr sheringham to the procurator fiscal and let crown office take the decision on whether to prosecute i dont see the difficulty in that he seemed to soften a little look maggie i know that you and mario are on the rocks and im sorry about it but maybe your private lifes been dulling your professional eye so to speak she gasped in outraged protest but he held up a hand to cut her off to answer your slightly impudent question acc haggerty has been getting up my shirt not bigtime yet but its heading that way the big fella could be back at any minute and willies going to want him to find a clean desk so you clean it for him savvy you send a report on sheringham to the pf pronto so that i can tell him weve got a result thats not a suggestion its an order so get on with it ill look like an idiot rose snapped no the fiscal will if he doesnt prosecute do it the head of cid pushed himself up from his perch on the corner of roses desk and headed for the door he was almost there when stevie steele stepped across and blocked his way im sorry sir he said quietly but im not wearing that youre not wearing what son pringle boomed youll be wearing a fucking uniform if youre insubordinate with me dont threaten me sir the inspectors voice was steady and icy calm and dont ever shout at me again or tell me to shut up ill be on this force long after youve gone and dont you forget it maggies my boss and youre not going to come in here and walk on her like that you owe her two apologies one for doubting her judgement and the other for even thinking that it might be affected by whats happening at home and you aint leaving this room till she has them stevie rose interposed let it drop aye son pringle rumbled you do that no way he answered evenly ive been making the running on this investigation its mine more than superintendent roses and i am telling you that we cannot report sheringham for prosecution the chief superintendent seemed to back off fractionally why not because ive been into his background and his movements in the period he doesnt have the ability to make the sort of device that destroyed the picture and he hasnt been in contact with anyone who might have if the fiscal asked me whether i could give evidence under oath as to this lads guilt my answer would have to be a great big no ill grant you that theres a chance that he might be guilty of making a stupid call to a vulnerable girl that triggered a renewed episode of schizophrenia but as far as i know being a meanminded little arse hole is not an offence punishable under scots criminal law for the first time since he had come into roses office the belligerence started to fade from dan pringles eyes if youre feeling mr haggertys hot breath on your neck sir steele continued send him along here and let him talk to us but dont tell us to do something thats eminently fucking stupid just to placate him instead can we have a sensible discussion about the future of this investigation rather than just a shouting match the two men stood facing each other pringles agitation contrasting with the inspectors calm finally the head of cid turned and resumed his seat on roses desk he glanced at her youve got two apologies maggie accepted she replied he looked back at steele and you son have probably earned a place in my bad books for the rest of my career or for the rest of the week at least lets have this sensible discussion the inspector nodded and sat back down on his hard wooden chair very good sir ive been doing some private brainstorming and ive reached a conclusion about this investigation were not going to get a result here not until we clear up another enquiry which enquiry asked rose puzzled one that we dont even know about yet i was on my way to talk to you about this maggie he explained when mr pringle arrived he looked at the two senior officers lets consider this for a minute why would anybody really want to blow up a twobit work of art for the reason we thought andrea wanted to the superintendent replied misplaced religious zeal and cover it up you dont really believe that do you i dont not any more look at the precedents zealots dont mind being caught the september the eleventh hijackers all thought they were going to paradise in a blaze of glory there was no attempt at concealment after the event ive done some research closer to home too leaving aside the sectarian vandalism that happens occasionally in scotland the most famous incident here was back in the fifties when a man attacked dalis christ of st john on the cross in the kelvingrove art gallery in glasgow there was nothing subtle about that he just walked up to it and started ripping it up with a blade aye and look at the venus de milo muttered pringle his normal humour returning someone knocked the arms right off that he was never caught steele shot back lets stay serious though last saturdays incident was carefully planned to the extent that we were even provided with a dead cert suspect that we could grab without question one who wouldnt even be prosecuted but shipped back to the funny farm case closed all that just to burn a dodgy picture and get away with it i dont think so an insurance job then pringle muttered whod benefit only the owner and thats the guggenheim in bilbao so you can forget that in this case there wouldnt be a benefit anyway since im told that the painting would almost certainly have fetched more at auction than its insured value which relates to the original purchase price no ive got another question instead of asking what the benefit of the crime might be lets ask ourselves what was its effect he looked at rose and saw a smile cross her face what was it then asked the head of cid steele looked up at him it tied up just about every fire appliance in edinburgh when the roads were at their busiest so when there was a second outbreak in the city centre very shortly after the academy incident the fire services were unable to turn out in sufficient strength to prevent major damage being done to the building but that wasnt a suspicious fire maggie countered if it had been the brigade would have alerted us right away how many major fires are there in edinburgh city centre in the course of the year half a dozen in a bad year thats the answer yet last saturday we had two the one at the rsa and a second in an empty office building in the exchange no more than half an hour later if thats not suspicious i dont know what is have you spoken to matt grogan asked pringle steele nodded this morning he told me that it was an electrical fire probably starting in a piece of equipment that had been left on and spreading rapidly through the wiring of the computer network there were sprinklers but they were ineffective because of the type of fire it was there was also an automatic alarm system that alerted the security staff right away normally the fountainbridge station would have responded inside three minutes and the fire would have been contained but all their appliances and those from macdonald road had been despatched to the relatively small fire at the academy it took them twenty minutes to turn out given the traffic situation by that time all they could do was stop it spreading up or down the floor where it started was melted the head of cid tugged at his moustache but you said it was empty not unoccupied though its the head office of tubau gordon a major investment manager and heres something else thats interesting normally there would have been people in on a saturday far east traders following up on hong kong deals last weekend though there was a general holiday in china so there was no one there the inspector looked at pringle what does that tell you sir the ageing crumpled detective grunted that i was a fucking idiot for telling you to shut up apart from that it tells me youd better look into that firm right away to see if you can find a connection between them and the exhibition fire i have done sir their chief executive was on the invitation list signed in too when the picture went up in flames he was right there better go and see him then i plan to sir just be careful then stevie if theres anything in this then unlike me hes a right clever bugger fifty seven neil mcllhenney smiled at the woman as she led him through to what passed for her office in the new town basement i never thought of you as a businesswoman joanne he said what are you talking about man she retorted ive been in this business for years maybe he agreed but on the shop floor not in management what happened she shrugged her broad shoulders she looked much different from the last time he had seen her when she was working the streets and had picked up the wrong customer joanne virtue was still a striking woman but the blonde dye and heavy makeup had gone her hair was back to what he had guessed was its natural brown and her face was scrubbed and fresh he had wondered on occasion about her age now without the cosmetic coverup he could see that she was in her early forties a little younger than he had imagined too many close calls she admitted i can take care of myself but every night you go out on the game you push your luck a bit id been at it too long and i was getting nervous a guy said the wrong thing to me once and i had a knife at his throat in a second he nearly pissed himself then he started raising bloody hell i wound up having to give him money to stop him calling the polis would he not have settled for a freebie what would he have used joanne asked dryly ahd scared all the lead out of his pencil mcllhenney grinned so how did you get this job or do you own this place christ no i manage it for an exclient a bloke called kenny bass from falkirk officially hes in the scrap metal business but hes got other things too like this place and another one in broxburn hes a nice enough guy kenny but sure he can get a bit severe if hes crossed the inspector nodded i know kenny bass i know what he owns and i know how close to the edge he comes but hes nothing if he ever gives you any bother joanne just you tell me thanks mr mcllhenney ill bear that in mind not that ive got any problems with him though for a while i thought i might have but i got it sorted she reached to her left and pulled open the top drawer of a metal filing cabinet do you want a whisky she asked his eyebrows shot up hell no its not even midday yet she glanced at her watch its only a minute or two short anyway that never stopped you before times have changed and mountains have moved eh so what did you want to talk to me about about your recent bit of bother but first i want to ask you about something else ive fallen by some information that you might have had shall we say professional dealings in the past with a colleague of mine detective superintendent jay is that true jo you dont really want to know that do you too damn right i do said mcllhenney ive got a new job now one that means i want to know everything ah she exclaimed you have have you i heard big mariod been moved right enough some boy him his uncles barely deid and he starts ridin his cousin not that ive got anything against paula mind shes got a touch of the saint about her has that girl never mind that theyre only business partners anyway so what about jay joanne nodded once briefly yes she whispered he was only an inspector then though he used to call by when i was working and if there was no one about wed do a bit of business you mean he paid you dont be daft you mean he accepted sexual favours in exchange for what nothing neil he never asked for anything and i was never stupid enough to ask him for money i never had any police bother around that time though so i put it down to expenses so to speak do you still hear from him no not since he got his big job down in leith she looked at him nervously what are you going to do with that she asked nothing at all he told her unless i need to why would you need to if there was ever any thought that he might be promoted again i couldnt have that just keep my name out of it then no worries on that score now this other business the angry residents versus the white rabbit sauna some name that by the way better than a sign of the zodiac like most of them he laughed i understand he went on that the local petition got knocked back by the council against the run of play so they said i dont know about that as i understand it the committee just told them tae wind their necks in its no that bad here neil she protested i run this place properly the guys that were making the trouble came from the pub on the corner no here my customers are as quiet as mice when they leave here the last thing any of them want is to draw attention to themselves ill accept that mcllhenney conceded but youve left out a bit of the story havent you the bit about you asking agnes maley for help joanne virtue flushed i never did she exclaimed the inspector frowned have you just been bitten by the stupidity fly or something he asked because thats what lying to me would be downright bloody stupid im not suggesting that you went to agnes i know that you did what i want you to tell me is why this place isnt even in her council ward yet she laid down the law in the labour group to have it kept open when shes had other places shut on her own patch so please dont piss me about i dont have time for that just tell me the story he said the whole bloody story why agnes she took a bottle of bells and a glass from the filing cabinet drawer poured herself a double and knocked it back because shes a customer she replied what you mean she comes here for a sauna joanne looked at him scornfully i think that flys bitten you now she chuckled shes a lesbian a dyke a daddy dyke at that to be fairly polite about it shes discreet though keeps it well away from home theres one girl working here whos prepared to entertain her i dont like it but i put up with it because if i didnt id be shut down in a minute and that would piss off kenny mcllhenney did not even try to stop the grin from spreading across his face is she a regular visitor monday evenings and thursday evenings regular as clockwork couldnt be better said the detective what time do your girls start to arrive about four oclock fine that gives us time to set up to set up what a hidden camera what she shrieked fear showing instantly on her face you cant do that i wont let you ill bet you will but shell kill me or shell go to kenny and he really will none of these things will happen i wont im telling you i wont the grin vanished in a flash mcllhenney reached out a massive hand and seized the woman by the chin twisting her face round until she was looking into his eyes there was none of his usual amiability in them only a look that went right into her bones i want you to think about something jo he whispered who scares you the most agnes maley or kenny bass or me fiftyeight are you going to tell me now bob bradford dekker asked why are we here skinner was smiling as he twisted round in the front passenger seat of richard madigans car to look at the erie county sheriff in the back the sergeant sat stiffly behind the wheel almost at attention with his boss as a passenger because i want to show you something brad he replied quite a few things in fact and thanks for agreeing to do this and give me the chance i must admit that its against my better judgement in a way said dekker i dont feel comfortable without eddie brady here if bradys doing what you told him to do hes serving this investigation and a damn sight better than he has in the past for example look at that he took a folder from his lap and took out a sheet of a paper which he handed across to the sheriff he looked at it for a few seconds frowning thats a blowup from a photograph taken by the woman who lives across the road from ron neidholms house youll see that its timed and dated it was taken less than half an hour before your officers found my wife in ron neidholms kitchen in a state of shock after discovering her lovers body that shot is crucial evidence brad its always been available to you but it took me to find it because the guy in charge of your investigation was so fucking sure of himself that he didnt bother to order his detectives to interview potential witnesses who might just have seen something else the sheriff took a quick deep breath and exhaled but said nothing skinner reached across and tapped the paper in his hands as youll see the photo shows a car licence plate empire state type the vehicle was parked in ron neidholms driveway he took another photograph from his folder and handed it across as that wider shot proves the number on the plate is a vanity registration forming the word libris did you study latin at school brad dekker shook his head no but i know roughly what it means books isnt it near enough he produced a document and gave it to dekker thats the registration document it names the owner of the vehicle as mr candrace brew of oregon way buffalo mr brew is employed by buffalo and erie county public library service as librarian in waterside branch library fivezerotwo wanaganda street mr brew was also named by the witness alice bierhoff as one of the three people she told about seeing my wife in an intimate situation through the open window of ron neidholms bedroom skinner took the last item from his folder and handed it over thats a photograph of mr brew sergeant madigan obtained it from the library services human resources department ive shown it to my wife she recognised mr brew at once she and neidholm were having dinner last week in a lakeside restaurant called the lazy lobster or some such when he approached their table and asked him for his autograph she described the man as effusive embarrassingly so for someone of his age and just a little bit spooky she also recalled that he appeared to be suffering from a skin condition she could see a symptomatic rash on his wrist and he was wearing white surgical gloves those things dont leave prints on knife handles brad skinner smiled again are you feeling the buzz yet sheriff he asked ive got nothing against elected police chiefs if the system runs counter to my culture fair enough its worked in your country for a long time but ive often wondered whether guys like you dont get envious of the real policemen they command whether they dont itch to get out there on the street with them at home in my rank im finding it harder and harder to do that and there are times when it does my head in so i guess you must feel it a bit too dekker nodded and gave a small grin as he leaned back in his seat yes youre right ive always been envious of guys like richard here ive always been a political realist though if i did that and an investigation went sour id be gone at the next election in that case im going to make your day said skinner he nodded in the direction of a building across the leafy street hes in there in waterside library just waiting for you see that white car over there in the park at the side thats his its your big moment bradford elected or not youre an officer of the law so get across there you and your sergeant and make the arrest in person youll be a bloody hero man you could run for governor of new york and get elected dekker looked doubtful have we got enough to do that he asked skinner nodded youve got some ts to cross but youve got him richards been working with the technicos since they were sent back in to do a proper job havent you son the sergeant turned in his seat yes sir the sceneofcrime team identified dirt samples through the hall and in the kitchen that do not belong on that site they also found on the kitchen floor materials specifically hairs from a human head and minute flakes of what appear to be dried dead skin that were neither from the victim nor from dr grace identical hairs were adhering to the hygienic plaster on the victims left thumb the scientists now hypothesise that when he was stabbed mr neidholm snatched at his assailant in a reflex gesture and detached them at that point you take a hair sample from brew said skinner as soon as you get him back to headquarters and your case will be closed trust me on that the american looked at him from the back seat this investigation has indeed been flawed from the outset hasnt it bob im sorry for the embarrassment it caused your wife dont be he replied grimly she put herself in the situation nevertheless what am i going to do about brady if he was mine id retire him quietly youve got a relatively small detective department brad to get the best out of it its leadership has to be exceptional not just adequate even if that means going down the ranks to identify someone like richard here then hauling him up the ladder fast he grinned thats tomorrows problem though he opened the passenger door and put his right foot out on to the sidewalk im going to walk home from here much as id like to i cant be in on the action its your big moment sheriff get on in there and get your man fiftynine where does the name come from asked stevie steele the man behind the desk looked across at him as if his attention had been wandering before their conversation had even begun eh sorry you took me by surprise said francis dolan he was a trim man with sharp blue eyes and sunbleached hair and could have been aged anywhere between fifty and sixty the company was originally a scottishspanish partnership it was set up twelve years ago and those are the names of the founders were no longer a partnership though three years ago we incorporated and floated on the stock exchange at that stage i went from partner to chief executive are the founders still involved in the business sir allan gordons still the chairman but alfonso tubau cashed in his stake soon after the flotation and retired to make wine on his farm near sitges actually the incorporation was a neat way of divesting ourselves of the spanish end it never did very well since the closure of the madrid office our share price has risen steadily were doing so nicely that weve become a takeover target for an american firm welcome not very there have been feelers but so far the board do not regard the price quoted as being acceptable what if they raised it if they raised it by enough and wrote in some safeguards for existing investors the directors would have a duty to recommend acceptance all thats academic though because of the fire dolan pursed his lips not quite because of the consequences would be a more accurate summation he frowned at steele tell me inspector are you prescient or do you have insider knowledge the detective stared back it was his turn to be taken by surprise neither why because when you called me and asked for this meeting i was on the point of telephoning sir james proud and asking him to send a senior officer to see me am i senior enough then for the moment you are you can decide whether to refer what im going to tell you up your chain of command but first maybe youd like to tell me why you wanted to see me certainly steele replied im investigating the outbreak of fire at the royal scottish academy on saturday its being treated as a case of arson as a witness dolan exclaimed i have to tell you that that was selfevident at the time can you describe what happened i described it to one of your officers in the aftermath i know but id be grateful if youd do it again its not uncommon for things to be recalled that might have been overlooked in the panic after the outbreak the lean tanned businessman shrugged swinging to and fro in his swivel chair very well but theres still not much to tell david candela was halfway through his speech when there was a whoosh and the picture burst into flames what happened next dolan smiled i suppose you might call it davids finest hour for all his army background ive always thought of him as a dry lackadaisical character but he took command on the spot and ordered everyone out of the building clear the gallery i remember him shouting clear the gallery no time for heroes we did clear it too damn quick david ordered his staff to gather us together at the side of the building and hold us there until the fire engines arrived and the blaze was under control did it seem out of control not at that point but david was concerned that there might have been more than one device steele nodded you cant argue with that thinking he conceded who called the fire brigade im not certain it could have been the curator it could have been david it could have been anyone i was legging it out of there by that time we werent outside for all that long the fire was contained pretty quickly from what i gathered and the firefighters checked everything else after that we were allowed back in for the champagne and whatnots and to be interviewed by your people now that i think about it i remember seeing you there and thats it specifically you dont remember seeing anyone doing anything out of the ordinary at the time the picture went up in flames no not a soul that really is all i can tell you fair enough it doesnt take us any further but to be honest i doubt if were going to get any further so what about your fire and your problems at least youre still able to operate from what i can see on these two floors yes we are dolan agreed one thing they get right in modern buildings is the integrity of each level in extreme conditions how has your business been affected asked the detective before i answer that the other man replied let me explain a little of what we do and of our structure we are investment trust managers pure and simple more or less we dont get involved in the unit trust end of the business never have never will we offer services to high networth individuals for whom we believe that its are a far more reliable and efficient vehicle unit trusts have their place theyre okay for smaller investors but thats not our market i have a friend who runs a restaurant which he describes as strictly for fat people thats us in a way were the fat cats fund manager investment trusts are companies which exist purely to make money the only business they have is buying and selling shares in other companies as an investor in an investment trust youre a shareholder in that company and your shares will rise or fall in value as the investments held by the trust rise or fall their beauty as a vehicle is that they allow you to spread risk by holding a very wide portfolio without the hassle of monitoring and trading them all individually their management charges are lower than units and these days theyre taxeffective because you can invest in them through investment savings accounts tubau gordon invests in three sectors the uk for proven steady performance european markets which are developing rapidly and the far east which may have lost some of its sparkle but which remains pretty sexy in the long term if a little riskier than it was each of those sectors operates as a separate business within a business each has its own staff its own analysts and its own decisionmakers reporting back to a responsible director who reports in turn to the main board of which he or she is a member and to me each business is or was located on one of our three floors the fifth floor where were sitting now accommodates tubau gordon europe and the executive offices the seventh floor houses our uk business the sixth floor which no longer exists was where our far east trusts were located dolan stopped and looked at steele with me so far the detective nodded yes ive got some shares in its even though i might not be that fat a cat the fund manager smiled good choice as long as youre not with tubau gordon oriental he pulled his chair closer to his desk in the financial world confidentiality is everything we take that to extremes here we have no crossover between the staff in each of our divisions each operates completely separately with no interchange of information to avoid the temptation of insider dealing to ensure this each division has a completely separate information technology setup theres no way you can cut into seventh floor data from this level and theres no way that i as a corporate manager can access any of it directly im beginning to guess the consequences of the fire said steele im sure you are the damage upstairs was total the entire it system of tubau gordon oriental has been destroyed and with it all of our computer records for its current financial year which has been running since january the first dont you back up we back up on to a separate mainframe outside the network but that was also located on the sixth floor its gone too paper records yes and all reduced to muddy ashes the only paper that survived the fire was in rolls in the staff toilets so what have you lost as i said weve lost everything the current investment position of every one of the clients of tubau gordon oriental wed have to go back as best we can and rebuild every transaction to the beginning of the calendar year that would take god knows how long and even then wed only have an approximation we will have to ask every company in which were invested to issue duplicate share certificates but with the settlement system well never know what was in the pipeline since we do our own trading its impossible in practice all that we can do is credit everyone with everything they had at the time of the last audit and take it from there its a disaster of unthinkable proportions what about previous years has all that gone too r dolan looked up to the ceiling no thank god once our audits are all completed we archive the records of each year in a secure data warehouse on top of that we archive our computer records on a sixmonthly basis had it not been for the fire that would have happened on tuesday steele felt a flutter in the pit of his stomach but kept it to himself how many far east trusts were there he asked three public japanese chinese and new markets three public you said yes there was also one private trust located upstairs and managed under our corporate umbrella its a family trust not a unique situation this one belongs to the candela family as in yes its davids it used to be managed within candela and finch but he switched it here a few years back because he liked our security systems and our inhouse trading facility ironic is it not it sure is steele conceded impassively when you began he continued you said that investment trusts were more or less all you did what else is there we have a currency section said the chief executive speculating on the global money markets that was on the sixth floor its gone too never rains eh thats what we find the policeman waited until he felt that he had all of dolans attention once more so why were you about to pick up the phone the silence continued for several seconds because came the reply at last i have just finished a reconciliation of our total assets investments and cash in the bank and in transit its difficult given the missing oriental portfolios but by my calculation were thirty million out on the downside bloody hell steele exclaimed thats an understatement will it finish you no it wont but it will send our share price floorwards and make us a snip for any predators that are out there dolan stood up and walked to the window of his office he gazed along the western approach road at nothing in particular so inspector he asked are you going to call in the cavalry im going to call in the fire brigade first off i have done already and ive called in independent experts i did that on sunday they both agree that the fire started in a computer terminal that was left on over the weekend to receive incoming faxes a normal procedure and that there is no evidence of it being deliberate someone seems to have been dead lucky mr steele so far the policeman retorted im going to need a list of every person employed on the sixth floor with the skill to make thirty million disappear without being caught obviously that will include the manager of the candela family trust i wouldnt bother with that inspector david manages it personally its another of his many skills sixty howd you like to stay in buffalo and be my chief of detectives asked bradford dekker no offence sheriff skinner replied but if i stayed here id be after your job elected people trying to manage policemen are the bane of my life back home if i lived here the only way i could handle it would be to become one myself if the voters of erie county knew all thats happened over the last couple of days you could run as the taleban candidate and still get elected bob pulled over a kitchen stool and sat on it glancing out of the window with the phone to his ear he could see jazz playing in the garden with trish watching over him so its over is it he asked yes poor old candy brew is downstairs right now in conference with his attorney thats if the woman can get him to stop sobbing for long enough to listen to what shes got to tell him when madigan and i walked into his office he looked at us and burst into tears and hes been like that most of the time since dekker sounded elated understandably the hair and skin samples matched his he continued like you said they would but we didnt need to throw that at him we didnt need to throw anything at him in fact he told us the whole story as soon as we sat him down in the interview room hero worship can be a deadly thing bob when it goes to extremes mr brew had more than a crush on ron neidholm he was downright in love with him his house is like a shrine an absolute shrine hes from chicago originally but he volunteered to us that he took a job in buffalo because it was rons home town his obsession was no secret either it was a standing joke among the staff in waterside library and among some of the borrowers as well weve reinterviewed the bierhoff woman she admitted that she didnt just happen to mention sarah and ron to him she did it to wind him up bitch skinner snarled and how she drove brew right off the rails he admitted to us that he went to neidholms house to ask him if it was true and if it meant that he wouldnt play football any more the victim invited him in and took him through to the kitchen because he said he was about to start fixing a salad he said that he was expecting company candys story is that when he confronted him asked him straight out ron was evasive at first suggested very politely that it was none of his damn business but he persisted and finally the big guy lost his cool he told him that he had had a lifetime of guys like him who thought that football was the only thing in the world and that finally he had had enough he wanted a normal life among real people with a wife and kids and no more freaks like brew dekker was excited now in full flow at last he paused for breath while he was yelling this according to candy he reached out and grabbed him by the hair with his left hand that ties in with the samples that were found on the sticking plaster the guy thought he was going to slug him with the other one and he got terrified the knife was lying on the counter beside him he says he doesnt remember picking it up none of them ever remember said skinner quietly ill bow to your experience on that anyway he says there was this blank moment and next thing he knew ron was on the floor at his feet with the knife in his chest he just ran for it then out of the house got in his car and drove home he sat there for two days doing nothing waiting for us to come for him only we didnt after a while he plucked up the courage to switch on television and he saw a report it said that we had a prime suspect a woman and that charges were expected imminently he knew they must have meant sarah and he began to relax he was going to let her take the blame without a second thought he believed in fact he still does that she deserved it in his mind if it hadnt been for her throwing herself at neidholm as he put it life would just have gone on as it was thats why he approached him in the restaurant hed never had the nerve to do that before or to write to him or anything else he only worshipped him from as close as he could get neidholm never had a public relationship you see half of america thought he was gay as for candy he just assumed it so when he saw him there with sarah he experienced a flash of pure terror he could tell how easy they were with each other and he had this sense that everything was going to change that all his fantasies were going to be taken from him by this woman whoever she was he fretted about it from that point on until alice bierhoff told him her story and the poor guy just went nuts will he go for an insanity plea i dont know yet the das offered him a plea deal to second degree homicide thats what his attorneys trying to talk to him about if he takes it then sarah wont have to testify if he doesnt im not so sure you might try telling him from me that if he puts my wife on the witness stand and makes her admit to an affair in public he really will be fucking crazy hes never met you dekker chuckled so he wouldnt understand but ill do what i can to keep that from happening so whats our position now asked skinner sarah has her passport back she can leave buffalo any time she likes whens this going to hit the fan brews attorney wont go public while were still negotiating but i cant hold it beyond tomorrow midday if he hasnt accepted the das deal by then hell be arraigned on a charge of first degree murder punishable by in theory death but we wont go for that if you did bierhoff should be on a table alongside him i agree but theres nothing she can be charged with ive already made sure that shell live from now on with the knowledge that her tongue got a man killed if this does go to trial the whole of america will know it he heard dekker draw a breath bob i want to thank you again for this dont please in a way im to blame for it all if i hadnt gone charging back to scotland it would never have happened neidholm and sarah i mean sure brew might have gone off the rails eventually but probably not can you say that for certain skinner blinked at dekkers quiet question then thought about it can i say that my wife wouldnt have had a fling with the guy even if i had been here he murmured into the phone maybe i dont want to know the answer to that brad no maybe you dont he paused so what are you going to do now im going to shuffle out of fucking buffalo thats what im going to do if i can ill get us on a plane to new york tonight then back home tomorrow ill call clyde oakdale and ask his office to put everything in place good luck to you then sir should sarah be required to testify ill contact you directly you may not have to see you brad gook luck in the elections not that youll need it now he hung up then called oakdale at his law firm and gave him brief terse instructions when he was finished he walked upstairs sarah was in the nursery playing with seonaid she looked at him over her shoulder as he came into the room she tried to read his expression but failed well she asked who was that the county sheriff he told her youre in the clear she turned and handed their daughter to him then gave a huge sigh of unfettered relief thank you she whispered her eyes moistening thank you so much maybe you should thank her he said kissing seonaid on the forehead and the boys no ill thank you no one else could have done it eddie brady should have done it he replied sarah rubbed a tear from her cheek so that little man actually killed ron stone fucking dead honey you know what they say the harder they come the bigger they fall or something like that he looked her in the eye but its not over now you have something else to face im taking the kids back to scotland were leaving as soon as clyde can get us on a flight i wont have them here to be filmed and photographed when this thing breaks in the media and what about me she asked quietly thats your choice love ive told oakdale to book a seat for you too its up to you whether youre in it when the plane takes off what do you want he laid the wriggling seonaid on the floor and let her crawl towards a toy if i was going to kick you out id hardly have got you that seat would i listen sarah when i went back home to defend my job i rejected you and not for the first time either when you coupled with neidholm you were rejecting me all i have to say to you is that i regret what i did now i didnt consider what effect it might have had on you and i apologise for that as for what you did im not going to ask whether you regret that and im not going to make it a precondition of coming home its your life and your decision but when you make it be in no doubt that i want you to come he reached out a hand and touched her face for the first time since his return ive taken you for granted im sorry for it he smiled faintly i cant promise that it wont happen again but if it does ill be sorry then too sarah took hold of his fingers and held them to her cheek for a second or two then twined her own with them whether you believe this is up to you but when i went to see ron at his place when i found him i went there to tell him that i was turning him down and going back to you id made my choice then and its the same one i make now im coming home good he murmured he looked at her solemnly theres something i know ill ask you sooner or later so it might as well be now if the bierhoff creature hadnt seen you with your tits out if candy brew had never existed and neidholm was still alive would you have told me about what happened sarah looked back at him unblinking i dont know and thats the truth as for regret i dont know about that yet either ill always feel guilt that what happened between us led to his death but not too much because if it hadnt been me it could just as well have been someone else but regret ron was here you had rejected me like you said he was kind he was good he was gentle he was old familiar ground and i found myself wanting him so i cant work out whether theres anything there to regret as for things not happening again if you cant promise i wont either not if the same circumstances arose but i certainly dont plan on it he nodded fair enough lets pack and get the kids ready with luck we can pick up mark from school and head straight for the airport he turned to leave but she caught his arm hey i almost forgot something when you were out alex called to see how things were we talked for a while and during our conversation she said something really weird about your brother a puzzled look crossed her face what brother its a long story ill tell you all about it over the atlantic how was alex with you incidentally he asked her shes been friendlier i have to say but at least she didnt call me a twotiming tart or any other choice descriptions she wouldnt she told me some truths about me though for a moment all his hurt showed in his face and she felt his pain within her bob she said breaking the silence so were not the golden couple the world thinks we are and when this comes out in court the worlds going to know it too but were still pretty formidable and weve still got more going for us than at least eight out of another ten remember that and remember this too theres one thing more than anything other more than the kids even thats taking me back to scotland and thats the fact that i love you he looked at her and gave a long slow smile one that she had not seen she realised since the day that seonaid had been born and for the avoidance of doubt honey he told her i love you too i never had any doubt sarah whispered come on lets get ready yes he bent to scoop up the baby in his arms by the way do you want to phone friend babs before we leave sarah looked at him and snorted like hell i do sixtyone this must be an unusual experience for you said andrea what do you mean saying goodnight to your date on her doorstep and not being invited in stevie gave her a wounded look having a dates an unusual experience for me these days thatll be right im not so innocent ill believe that are you disappointed that the evening ends here no honestly you set the pace i told you that and i meant it in that case let me tell you something the pace might hot up quite significantly when i stop feeling that the policeman in you is still interviewing me about that damn fire all night charming as youve been ive had the feeling that there are still questions you want to ask me but dont like to since this evenings meant to be just about us and nothing else youve also if i may say so looked remarkably smug as if youve just done something very clever and cant wait to tell me steele leaned against the wall beside her front door and smiled at her theres not much subtlety about me is there youve got two out of three right where youre wrong about is that i cant tell you not yet at any rate two out of threes not bad andrea conceded so what is it that you want to ask me i dont need to at all actually i could find out from other sources but it would be quicker if i got it from you go ahead then okay if youre happy when you were in trouble for trying to burn down the baptists and you appeared in court who acted for you a woman called davina chapin of candela and finch theyre our familys lawyers mmm steele muttered trying to sound matteroffact and succeeding thanks you mean thats it she exclaimed thats all yup he assured her i promise thats the last question i will ever ask you about this investigation in the event that we do need to talk to you about it again itll be maggie rose who does it ill be nowhere near promise promise ill declare a personal interest andrea took his hand and tugged him gently off the wall in that case she said id best make an honest copper of you would you like to come in just for a coffee you understand sixtytwo i hope youre grateful said neil mcllhenney as he pushed a video cassette across bob skinners rosewood desk i took thursday night off the football to get that for you i had to frighten joanne virtue to do it as well i wasnt very happy about that you must have been impressive if you could scare big jo whats on the tape a virtuoso performance signifying the end of the career of black agnes maley you can watch it if you like but i wouldnt recommend it id like it back afterwards if you do it belongs in my safe just tell me then what have we got on her improper use of influence in return for sexual favours mcllhenney replied that sums it up as politely as i can and joanne virtue helped the big easy herself yup good for her as of now shes on the list of those to whom we owe favours can we prosecute maley not for whats on the video what theyre doing isnt against the law no moneys seen to change hands and all three of them are of age in theory theres corruption but wed never make it stick anyway we dont need to skinner tapped the cassette box i take it theres another copy yes its in the possession of the first ministers security adviser jock govan hes laced up as tight as they come mcllhenney nodded and laughed he was just about sick when he saw it i dont know whether he showed it to his boss or not but its had its effect maleys off the list for holyrood and her resignation as a councillor will be tendered formally to the lord provost this morning shes gone for good and weve got a criminal intelligence file on her as well big jo is safe is she maleys been warned off dont worry the dcc beamed happy mondays then thanks a million neil i never expected a result like this when i set you on the woman the smile vanished abruptly i never thought youd have to get your hands so dirty either i know it cant have been pleasant i wont forget it you do exactly that boss forget it when it comes to favours exchanged between you and me youre still well in credit he picked up the tape ill take this if you dont want to see it do that mcllhenney nodded then held out a big padded envelope which had been tucked under his left arm this was delivered to me on friday morning he said from your sinister pal arrow skinner took it from him theres nothing sinister about adam he chuckled what you see is what gets you thanks again no problem the big inspector looked down at his friend back in his accustomed chair good to see you there at last he said you got a result in the states then the man was in court while we were still on the runway at jfk on friday hell plead to manslaughter therell be no trial for which i am profoundly grateful and you and sarah did you get a result there too she came back with me let that speak for itself ive learned a lot neil about her and about me ill change or at least ill do my best youve helped in that too mate whatever you say if there was ever an account between you and me its tilted well back to you youll be at the football in north berwick on thursday then asked mcllhenney count on it about bloody time too weve been a man light for weeks now he turned and walked out of the dccs office as soon as the door had closed skinner picked up the package on his desk ripped it open and tipped out the contents three documents fell on to the desk one of them he saw immediately was a note from adam arrow he had just picked it up when his internal telephone buzzed he picked it up jack he said knowing that his exec would be on the line sir said detective sergeant mcgurk briskly the head of cids been on hes got superintendent rose and inspector steele in his office and hed like to bring them along he wants to brief you on an investigation theyve had running in your absence tell dan to hold on for a bit please jack theres something i have to read up on first ill call them when im ready he hung up and turned back to the contents of adam arrows package he read through them slowly and carefully once or twice he raised an eyebrow but for most of the time his expression remained impassive finally he finished the last of the three documents returned them to the jiffy bag in which they had been delivered and stored it in a deep drawer in his desk when he was finished he picked up the phone once more and called mcgurk okay jack he announced im ready wheel them in you come in too most things i hear you can hear as well very good sir will you need coffee if anyones desperate ive got a filter machine here thats rarely empty im not running a cafeteria though two minutes later his door opened and detective superintendent rose stepped in followed by steele pringle and mcgurk maggie had been the dccs exec on her way up the ladder he knew her well and gave her an appraising look as she sat on one of the sofas that he used for informal meetings he was pleased to see that the tension she had been showing the last time they had met seemed to have gone she looked purposeful and relaxed in contrast pringle looked gloomy and preoccupied he wondered whether it was just another of dans famous monday mornings or if there was something more good to see you all skinner began once everyone was settled comfortably or in mcgurks case as comfortably as anyone of his height could on the low furniture its bloody good to be back i dont mind telling you now what have you lot been up to while ive been away youre going to need to start from scratch im afraid a few things have happened to me lately i feel more out of touch than ive ever been in my life he saw rose glance at pringle he caught the head of cids brief nod for her to proceed this has all built up in the last week sir she said it began last saturday with a fire at an exhibition of religious art in the royal scottish academy a picture went up in the middle of the opening speech by the chief sponsor mr david candela who asked skinner david candela hes senior partner of candela and finch the lawyers mmm okay it was clear from the start that an incendiary device had been planted the building was cleared the fire services turned out en masse the fire was extinguished the rest of the exhibition was checked out and cleared and the guests were allowed back in a storm in a champagne flute the dcc murmured rose smiled thats what we thought we attended we interviewed everyone present and we conducted a thorough investigation this led us to a suspect a young woman who was present at the opening even though she hadnt been invited and whod had access to the picture before the event this person was an obvious suspect last year she was involved in an incident of attempted religious fireraising and underwent psychiatric treatment as a result the girl strachan skinner interrupted yes i remember hearing about the case the treatment didnt work then thats just the point sir it did we were fed the girl she was meant to take the blame someone made a malicious call to her told her that god was calling her again and that she should go to the exhibition given her recent history she just flipped you pulled her in though yes of course we might have bought her as the culprit too but for stevie she glanced at steele and he saw a trace of a smile cross her face he thought to check her phone records and he traced the mobile from which the call had been made good but standard procedure nonetheless so you had another suspect yes a trainee lawyer employed by candela and finch but he denied making the call he claimed that someone could have borrowed his phone and used it during an office party we had no way of disproving that so we had to release him did he know the girl they were at university at the same time but theres no evidence of an acquaintanceship however when she appeared in court last year she was represented by dav chapin of candela and finch so anyone in the firm could have known of her okay so your investigation was rubbered or did you have a way forward no sir said rose sideways stevie took a broader look at the whole situation and came up with a completely different scenario as a result we believe that the fire at the academy had nothing to do with protests or religion we believe it was staged deliberately to engage the fire services they were barely there before there was a second outbreak in the empty office of tubau gordon pica fund manager up in the exchange district by the time the firemen got up there a whole floor had been completely destroyed and was this fire deliberately started theres no evidence of that sir but an entire division of the company was wiped out its records all the way back to january were totally destroyed when the chief executive of the company did a financial reconciliation he discovered a loss of thirty million pounds so it was deliberately started rose smiled as i said theres no evidence of that the fire service and independent people conducted a complete investigation everyones agreed that it was an electrical fire caused by overheating in a computer which was routinely left switched on the experts say that as far as they can see it was an accident skinner grinned but were not as bloody stupid as them are we we dont ignore the obvious rose returned his smile no boss we do not she turned to steele stevie would you like to take this up the inspector nodded yes maam the obvious sir is that these two fires were both spontaneous outbreaks but there was evidence of detonation in one and not in the other the experts view is that if theres no forensic evidence of fireraising theres no case but what if the computer where the fire started was the timer what if it was rigged to set it off itself at a specific time there would be no forensic evidence would there none you could see thats for sure so were down to circumstances lets consider the loss tubau gordon is an investment trust manager and a good one theres no way even a bad investment manager could blow thirty mil within an it without it starting to showing up to his colleagues from the start so as i see it the loss must have been generated in the companys secondary business which is currency speculation steele replied and guess what the computer where the blaze began was the one used for that activity but why go to all the trouble of holding up the fire brigade even with an automatic call out system the computer would be gone by the time the firefighters got there because the backup computer and all the paper records had to be destroyed as well and it had to be done that weekend three days later those records would have been archived offsite skinner smiled and punched the air in a mock gesture clever boy stevie so whos the link david candela his family has a private investment trust which uses the dealing services of tubau gordon its located on the oriental floor where the currency division was also housed mr candela manages his trust himself all the instructions to the brokers come from him he enjoys roundtheclock access to the building and hes a regular attender at weekends the security log shows that further investigation over the weekend has revealed that mr candela was a regular client of the maybury casino hes a heavy gambler and frequently complains about the house limit even when hes losing to sum up sir my belief is that mr candela has extended his gambling by dealing privately on the currency markets but he hasnt been using his own assets hes been using those of tubau gordon hes been getting into the currency department and running a private account protected no doubt by a code word known only to him and one that no one could enter by accident a bank audit over the weekend shows that the loss has been run up over the last couple of months it would have been spotted this week thats why the lot had to go up in flames last saturday skinner nodded he glanced at the lugubrious pringle then back at steele so why arent you turning cartwheels stevie why do i sense that theres a big but coming because we cant prove a bloody thing boss exclaimed the inspector tersely all the solid evidence there might have been is melted any one of seventy people could have had access to that computer and could have run up the loss the only thing we have to link in candela is that phoney fire in the academy which for sure he triggered himself at the exact moment he planned and we have no way of proving either that he planted the device or triggered it skinner pushed himself up from the sofa walked over to his window and gazed out on to fettes avenue after a minute he turned and looked back at his colleagues so what youre telling me boys and girl he said is that weve got some clever fucking lawyer in edinburgh whos committed the perfect crime thats about it sir said rose we know its him but theres no way well ever touch him for it it looks as if hes done just that the deputy chief constable stretched his arms above his head a wave of jetlag caught up with him he stifled a yawn he grinned a smile that they were all used to and that some of them had thought they would never see in that room again no mags he said he only thinks he has sixtythree the place was understated if anything it was a very plain house conservative in its design without the ramparts and turrets found all too often in folly dwellings of its age built from locally quarried stone and smaller than might have been expected in such extensive grounds and yet there was something about it that reeked of money and old money at that maybe two hundred years old andy martins staff had established that it had been in the same familys ownership since they had built it in the late nineteenth century bob skinner stopped his bmw just where the driveway opened out into a wide garden area in front of the mansion he was blocking the narrow road but that did not worry him in fact it suited his purpose it was well into the evening but the day had been fine and the summer sun was still bright as he looked around the grounds they reminded him of fir park lodge but these were kept better he could see the stripes on the close mown lawn and appreciate the neatness of the flower beds and the careful way in which the shrubs and bushes had been trimmed off to the back and to the left he saw outbuildings stables once upon a time no doubt but now garaging for a russetcoloured range rover which stood gleaming outside he stood for a moment and listened from somewhere not far away came the splashes of a river running even though the spate was over it still sounded full and fast a small sign on the lawn asked him to keep off the grass but he ignored it and marched straight across towards the grey granite house he was several yards short of the heavy brown front door when it opened a tall thin man appeared he was wearing grey corduroy trousers from an age when fashion meant nothing a green pullover with suede patches on the shoulders and elbows and he was glaring at his visitor cant you read man he barked as skinner approached and look where youve parked your car sure i can read the policeman answered english spanish and french in fact but sometimes i like to ignore rules if i think theyre stupid theres a bit of a rebel in me you see as for my car i left it there because i didnt want it to disfigure your charming house he walked on unbidden through the wide doorway and into a panelled hall he stopped and looked around very nice he said amiably get to hell out of there the other man exploded just who the hell are you and what do you think youre doing here skinner beamed at him just imagine that im michael aspel that this jiffy bag ive got under my arm is a big red book and im saying david candela this is your life lets start off there candela made a furious exasperated sound youre a lunatic he exclaimed a welldressed lunatic but a lunatic nonetheless im calling the police suddenly skinner seemed a little less amiable i wouldnt do that i am the police in that case ill complain to your inspector youd be several ranks too low if you did that candela blinked then stepped into the hall himself heading for a small silver box on the wall beside a grandfather clock dont do that either his visitor advised i know what that is its a panic button linked to your alarm system it would only be an inconvenience to your monitoring station if you activated it there wouldnt be a response the lawyer stopped very well he said a little uncertainty had crept into his voice but he was still in control of himself and showing no sign of alarm if this is an official visit youd better come through to the drawing room ive seen a few of you people over the last ten days or so i have to say they were all a damn sight more polite than you skinner smiled at him cheerily this is me being polite mr candela he exclaimed im nowhere near being rude not yet and rudes only a step along the way to nasty bloody lunatic candela muttered as he led the way into a long room oakpanelled like the hall it was furnished with big soft armchairs in flowery fabrics a refectory table stood near the door and three portraits each carefully lit from above were suspended from a rail along one wall windows looked out and down towards the river and a double patio door opened out on to the grounds nice place the policeman commented a sincere compliment i suppose its been in your family since the nineteenth century yes we built it the lawyer snapped impatiently look do i know you you should if you were serious about your precious firm and not just a fucking dilettante youd know me all right you know my family though candela and finch has represented it for about thirty years and of course you have a personal connection with us candela frowned would you like to explain that ill explain it by asking you something how did my brother michael die the colour drained from the thin mans face in an instant he looked towards the patio door as if he was about to run for it skinner forestalled any attempt by taking a step to his right blocking the way youre he gasped im bob skinner said the policeman im pretty well known in edinburgh but youre not really interested in the city are you youre interested in the casino and in playing up here for all you pretend your position as senior partner is written into your firms constitution you dont actually manage it one of the other guys does that he took the padded envelope from under his arm it really is all in here you know your whole exciting life candela had gathered his thoughts i know nothing about your brother he exclaimed i read about his death in the newspapers but thats all oh dont be fucking silly skinner retorted i wouldnt have brought it up if i didnt know for certain before i came here i spoke to a man called angus dabo in birnam i showed him your photograph he tapped the envelope and he identified you right away as the man who came into his local with michael a few days before he died mike got completely trousered and you carted him off before i spoke to dabo i faxed the same photo to brother aidan at oak lodge he clocked you too old as he is he identified you as the man my brother called skipper the man who took him away from his home and never brought him back the dcc grinned he was taking a deadly enjoyment from the account skipper was your nickname in the army mr candela he said then saw the mans eyes narrow yes ive got your service file in here too i had it sent up to me by secure fax this morning ive got michaels as well of course they tell me that the two of you served together in honduras you were a company commander in the scots guards and he was a lieutenant in the sappers when you went out on patrol he and his guys would often go with you in case something needed blowing up the policeman paused a corner of his mouth flicked upwards a strange gesture when he spoke again there was a catch in his voice there was so much i never knew about my brother candela because i never asked i did as my father wanted and i left him to live out the rest of his life away from me at first because i couldnt trust myself near him then eventually because i didnt see the point of reminding him of the old hatred between us rodney windows in case you dont know him either hes one of your partners in candela and finch sent me reports on him every year but that was all i ever knew about him when i read his army file this morning though i found out a hell of a lot for example he was some sort of a fucking genius at demolition you guys were on special ops down there werent you he wasnt there just to clear fallen palm trees in the jungle you were setting traps for the insurgents boobytrapping their supply dumps setting remote devices in their villages all sorts of brutal stuff that never got reported anywhere mike was so good at it that for a while your co and his turned a blind eye to his drinking until the firefight incident that is skinner held up the jiffy bag and took a single step towards the other man it really is all in here candela everything including the answer to something thats always niggled me when my father eventually told me about michaels discharge from the army he said that he was spared prosecution for manslaughter because of my dads own military record if he told me that then thats what he believed but as a policeman i always doubted it and i was right the two guys who were killed were shot by his weapon all right but there was no evidence of him actually firing it more than that some of his guys the other royal engineer lads with the unit testified that when you ambushed those rebels and the firefight happened he was so crosseyed drunk that he couldnt have fired anything they said that he wasnt even there he was flat on his back at your camp in the jungle the policeman took another step towards candela then theres this the two guys who were killed had duties with the quartermasters unit there had been major stock discrepancies from that unit in the days leading up to the incident you had orders to arrest those two guys and hold them for military police questioning as soon as you got back from that mission and those orders were confidential only you knew about them no one could prove anything about you either of course the engagement happened in the dark and friendly fire incidents do happen but still he paused so you resigned your commission revived the law degree youd put on ice and went into the family firm a year ahead of schedule mike resigned his too and came back to mother well to become a pissartist until finally he got out of control i tried to batter his brains out and he had to be put away and you knew about that of course my father set up the trust that looked after him through your firm rather than use his own he did it for the sake of confidentiality but it backfired on him you found out and naturally you didnt forget he tossed the envelope on to a chair all information is useful isnt it candela its my stock in trade i take pieces of information and use them to build models of events scenes crimes my officers down in edinburgh and one in particular has done a bloody good job on you over the last week he worked out that the fire in the academy was a scam and from there it was a short step to tubau gordon once he got in there and he looked at the circumstances of that fire at where and when it was started your name jumped out at him when he was told about the thirtymillionpound loss thats been uncovered since your motive and your guilt became selfevident skinner smiled thats as far as he could go though poor lad thats all the information he had so the model he could build with it only shows how fucking clever youve been giving us the girl might have been risky only it wasnt because of the way you set her up its funny setting up andrea was much the same as you did in the jungle when you used someone elses weapon and left him to take the blame for a moment candela relaxed but only until skinner took another step towards him ah but ive got more knowledge though i can build the model a bit higher looking at the timings involved i know that when you realised that you had lost the biggest and most exciting gamble of your life and that you were about to be exposed arrested disgraced and all that stuff you thought of my poor brother after all these years maybe hed prove useful again so you checked that he was still in oak lodge and you got in touch with him i can almost hear the conversation you know at some point you established that mike still had his skills i knew that myself from something aidan told me and then you invited him to your place in the country once he was here you told him what you wanted him to do skinner sighed i hope he didnt agree just like that id prefer to believe that he didnt so how did you force him i wonder did you really beat him with a hammer was it you who put those marks on his body not some drunken fall or did you torture him by filling him full of drink and then depriving him of it until he did what you wanted and built you a device to trigger the fire in the painting and another one for the computer undetectable because everyone even the experts would think it was part of it he saw candelas eyes narrow very slightly yes that was it wasnt it he nodded know what i think mike did i reckon he made a device that would blow out the fuses of the computer and cause a big power surge that would start a massive electrical fire then he showed you where to install it within the computer and how to set it as a timer the security records show that you went into tubau gordon on thursday evening less than two days before the fire i suppose you did it then it worked too ive seen the reports the heat was so intense that there was nothing identifiable left a nuclear explosion couldnt have done more score one for michael he stared at candela his pretence of amiability was gone so he hissed how did my brother die he had a heart attack said the lawyer simple as that we had dinner here he got drunk as usual and he fell down dead naturally i didnt want him found here so i gave him to the river at the foot of the garden he gave the policeman a look of pure contempt and thats all im telling you you dont have to tell me any more i know everything now and much good may it do you mr skinner you still dont have a case you can take to court theres no forensic evidence michaels dead and you cannot prove nor will you ever that i was responsible for one penny of that loss youre really not much of a fucking lawyer are you said the dcc superintendent rose and inspector steele of my staff are even as i stand here working overtime putting together a report for the crown office tomorrow morning they will present it to the lord advocate in person its touch and go but youre a betting man mr candela knowing how the la feels about bent lawyers would you lay a tenner against him taking you before a jury hed never get a conviction no not one that would stand up at appeal does that matter as soon as they get a warrant for your arrest maggie rose and steven steele will pick you up either here or in edinburgh id like it if they were able to huckle you out of your office actually that would be nice id still be acquitted though youll be ruined too dont you believe it the policeman let out an explosive brutal laugh you dont get it do you candela this is personal whether you killed him or not you took michael away from somewhere he was happy and you forced him back into his past to do your will you used him one last time and then you just threw him away listen im under no illusions my brother was little short of a beast as a young man he was a drunken sadistic thug but somewhere along the line with help from the good brother aidan he found the good within him and he lived a contented if unfulfilled life then you came along and took him away from it and you did worse you treated him like a dog before and after he was dead skinners eyes were chilling as he looked at the lawyer finally fear showed on candelas face suppose you do walk away from your socalled perfect crime youre still going to account for it in public and for the rest of a life which i hope if you have any sense will be very short youre going to be a pariah candela a social outcast if necessary our report to the fiscal will be regrettably leaked to the media you think no one will use it ultimately we might not have enough for a criminal conviction but a civil jury would be pretty certain to find against you should you choose to sue for defamation especially as you couldnt offer any defence since youre guilty as fucking sin he picked up the envelope if you dont believe me ask my daughter like i did shes a bloody sight better lawyer than you ever have been or ever will be but leaking that report would end your own career the man whispered dont be stupid it would never be traced back to me dont you have any idea of what i can do he started for the door think about it candela theres about a twenty per cent chance youre going to prison but theres a one hundred per cent certainty youll be disgraced plus youll have me on your back for the rest of your life he glanced around the distinguished room this place must have a library and gun control or not youve probably got a pearlhandled revolver lying about somewhere ask yourself this said bob skinner as he left whats expected of a real gentleman in your situation sixtyfour he glanced around his drawing room did you ever fancy oak panelling in here he asked certainly not sarah replied much too oldfashioned what brought that on ah nothing said bob youre right that sort of stuff belongs to another era i should think so she turned back to the scotsman and to the front page story will this man candela be convicted theres a chance hes remanded on bail so we have as long as we like within reason to complete a case weve got a search warrant for his place in perthshire and his flat in edinburgh we might just find some supporting evidence even if its only wire that matches the material used on the academy firebomb it could turn a possibility into a probability im still hoping for another outcome though a guilty plea do you mean yeah something like that he pressed the button of the television remote and turned on a question of sport do you know yet when michaels funeral will be she asked ill hear from the undertaker tomorrow but i think itll be next tuesday hell be cremated in gourock brother aidan will take the service thatll suit all his friends through there afterwards his ashes will be interred beside my mother and father in the cemetery in mother well thats good appropriate will you go of course and you if you want thats good too of course ill come she paused speaking of funerals she continued i had a call from babs today the bitch that she is she said that rons mothers arrived in buffalo and that shes planning to hold his service on saturday week once the das office has released his body he looked at her frowned and shook his head dont even think about it he said
