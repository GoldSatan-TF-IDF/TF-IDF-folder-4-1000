stories by english authors england the box tunnel by charles reade the train glided from paddington may in the left compartment of a certain firstclass carriage were four passengers of these two were worth description the lady had a smooth white delicate brow strongly marked eyebrows long lashes eyes that seemed to change colour and a goodsized delicious mouth with teeth as white as milk a man could not see her nose for her eyes and mouth her own sex could and would have told us some nonsense about it she wore an unpretending grayish dress buttoned to the throat with lozengeshaped buttons and a scottish shawl that agreeably evaded colour she was like a duck so tight her plain feathers fitted her and there she sat smooth snug and delicious with a book in her hand and a soupcon of her wrist just visible as she held it her opposite neighbour was what i call a good style of man the more to his credit since he belonged to a corporation that frequently turns out the worst imaginable style of young men he was a cavalry officer aged twentyfive he had a moustache but not a very repulsive one not one of those subnasal pigtails on which soup is suspended like dew on a shrub it was short thick and black as a coal his teeth had not yet been turned by tobacco smoke to the colour of juice his clothes did not stick to nor hang to him he had an engaging smile and what i liked the dog for his vanity which was inordinate was in its proper place his heart not in his face jostling mine and other peoples who have none in a word he was what one oftener hears of than meets a young gentleman he was conversing in an animated whisper with a companion a fellowofficer they were talking about what it is far better not to women our friend clearly did not wish to be overheard for he cast ever and anon a furtive glance at his fair visavis and lowered his voice she seemed completely absorbed in her book and that reassured him at last the two soldiers came down to a whisper the truth must be told the one who got down at slough and was lost to posterity bet ten pounds to three that he who was going down with us to bath and immortality would not kiss either of the ladies opposite upon the road done done now i am sorry a man i have hitherto praised should have lent himself even in a whisper to such a speculation but nobody is wise at all hours not even when the clock is striking five and twenty and you are to consider his profession his good looks and the temptation ten to three after slough the party was reduced to three at twylford one lady dropped her handkerchief captain dolignan fell on it like a lamb two or three words were interchanged on this occasion at reading the marlborough of our tale made one of the safe investments of that day he bought a times and punch the latter full of steelpen thrusts and woodcuts valour and beauty deigned to laugh at some inflamed humbug or other punctured by punch now laughing together thaws our human ice long before swindon it was a talkingmatch at swindon who so devoted as captain dolignan he handed them out he souped them he toughchickened them he brandied and cochinealed one and he brandied and burntsugared the other on their return to the carriage one lady passed into the inner compartment to inspect a certain gentlemans seat on that side of the line reader had it been you or i the beauty would have been the deserter the average one would have stayed with us till all was blue ourselves included not more surely does our slice of bread and butter when it escapes from our hand revolve it ever so often alight face downward on the carpet but this was a bit of a fop adonis dragoon so venus remained in teteatete with him you have seen a dog meet an unknown female of his species how handsome how empresse how expressive he becomes such was dolignan after swindon and to do the dog justice he got handsome and handsomer and you have seen a cat conscious of approaching cream such was miss haythorn she became demurer and demurer presently our captain looked out of the window and laughed this elicited an inquiring look from miss haythorn we are only a mile from the box tunnel do you always laugh a mile from the box tunnel said the lady invariably what for why hem it is a gentlemans joke captain dolignan then recounted to miss haythorn the following a lady and her husband sat together going through the box tunnel there was one gentleman opposite it was pitchdark after the tunnel the lady said george how absurd of you to salute me going through the tunnel i did no such thing you didnt no why because somehow i thought you did here captain dolignan laughed and endeavoured to lead his companion to laugh but it was not to be done the train entered the tunnel miss haythorn ah dolignan what is the matter miss haythorn i am frightened dolignan moving to her side pray do not be alarmed i am near you miss haythorn you are near me very near me indeed captain dolignan dolignan you know my name miss haythorn i heard you mention it i wish we were out of this dark place dolignan i could be content to spend hours here reassuring you my dear lady miss haythorn nonsense dolignan pweep grave reader do not put our lips to the next pretty creature you meet or will understand what this means miss haythorn ee ee friend what is the matter miss haythorn open the door open the door there was a sound of hurried whispers the door was shut and the blind pulled down with hostile sharpness if any critic falls on me for putting inarticulate sounds in a dialogue as above i answer with all the insolence i can command at present hit boys as big as yourself bigger perhaps such as sophocles euripides and aristophanes they began it and i learned it of them sore against my will miss haythorns scream lost most of its effect because the engine whistled forty thousand murders at the same moment and fictitious grief makes itself heard when real cannot between the tunnel and bath our young friend had time to ask himself whether his conduct had been marked by that delicate reserve which is supposed to distinguish the perfect gentleman with a long face real or feigned he held open the door his late friends attempted to escape on the other side impossible they must pass him she whom he had insulted latin for kissed deposited somewhere at his feet a look of gentle blushing reproach the other whom he had not insulted darted redhot daggers at him from her eyes and so they parted it was perhaps fortunate for dolignan that he had the grace to be a friend to major hoskyns of his regiment a veteran laughed at by the youngsters for the major was too apt to look coldly upon billiardballs and cigars he had seen cannonballs and linstocks he had also to tell the truth swallowed a good bit of the messroom poker which made it as impossible for major hoskyns to descend to an ungentlemanlike word or action as to brush his own trousers below the knee captain dolignan told this gentleman his story in gleeful accents but major hoskyns heard him coldly and as coldly answered that he had known a man to lose his life for the same thing that is nothing continued the major but unfortunately he deserved to lose it at this blood mounted to the younger mans temples and his senior added i mean to say he was thirtyfive you i presume are twentyone twentyfive that is much the same thing will you be advised by me if you will advise me speak to no one of this and send white the three pounds that he may think you have lost the bet that is hard when i won it do it for all that sir let the disbelievers in human perfectibility know that this dragoon capable of a blush did this virtuous action albeit with violent reluctance and this was his first damper a week after these events he was at a ball he was in that state of factitious discontent which belongs to us amiable english he was looking in vain for a lady equal in personal attraction to the idea he had formed of george dolignan as a man when suddenly there glided past him a most delightful vision a lady whose beauty and symmetry took him by the eyes another look it cant be yes it is miss haythorn not that he knew her name but what an apotheosis the duck had become a peahen radiant dazzling she looked twice as beautiful and almost twice as large as before he lost sight of her he found her again she was so lovely she made him ill and he alone must not dance with her speak to her if he had been content to begin her acquaintance the usual way it might have ended in kissing it must end in nothing as she danced sparks of beauty fell from her on all around but him she did not see him it was clear she never would see him one gentleman was particularly assiduous she smiled on his assiduity he was ugly but she smiled on him dolignan was surprised at his success his ill taste his ugliness his impertinence dolignan at last found himself injured who was this man and what right had he to go on so he never kissed her i suppose said dolle dolignan could not prove it but he felt that somehow the rights of property were invaded he went home and dreamed of miss haythorn and hated all the ugly successful he spent a fortnight trying to find out who his beauty was he never could encounter her again at last he heard of her in this way a lawyers clerk paid him a little visit and commenced a little action against him in the name of miss haythorn for insulting her in a railwaytrain the young gentleman was shocked endeavoured to soften the lawyers clerk that machine did not thoroughly comprehend the meaning of the term the ladys name however was at last revealed by this untoward incident from her name to her address was but a short step and the same day our crestfallen hero lay in wait at her door and many a succeeding day without effect but one fine afternoon she issued forth quite naturally as if she did it every day and walked briskly on the parade dolignan did the same met and passed her many times on the parade and searched for pity in her eyes but found neither look nor recognition nor any other sentiment for all this she walked and walked till all the other promenaders were tired and gone then her culprit summoned resolution and taking off his hat with a voice for the first time tremulous besought permission to address her she stopped blushed and neither acknowledged nor disowned his acquaintance he blushed stammered out how ashamed he was how he deserved to be punished how he was punished how little she knew how unhappy he was and concluded by begging her not to let all the world know the disgrace of a man who was already mortified enough by the loss of her acquaintance she asked an explanation he told her of the action that had been commenced in her name she gently shrugged her shoulders and said how stupid they are emboldened by this he begged to know whether or not a life of distant unpretending devotion would after a lapse of years erase the memory of his madness his crime she did not know she must now bid him adieu as she had some preparations to make for a ball in the crescent where everybody was to be they parted and dolignan determined to be at the ball where everybody was to be he was there and after some time he obtained an introduction to miss haythorn and he danced with her her manner was gracious with the wonderful tact of her sex she seemed to have commenced the acquaintance that evening that night for the first time dolignan was in love i will spare the reader all a lovers arts by which he succeeded in dining where she dined in dancing where she danced in overtaking her by accident when she rode his devotion followed her to church where the dragoon was rewarded by learning there is a world where they neither polk nor smoke the two capital abominations of this one he made an acquaintance with her uncle who liked him and he saw at last with joy that her eye loved to dwell upon him when she thought he did not observe her it was three months after the box tunnel that captain dolignan called one day upon captain haythorn rn whom he had met twice in his life and slightly propitiated by violently listening to a cuttingout expedition he called and in the usual way asked permission to pay his addresses to his daughter the worthy captain straightway began doing quarterdeck when suddenly he was summoned from the apartment by a mysterious message on his return he announced with a total change of voice that it was all right and his visitor might run alongside as soon as he chose my reader has divined the truth this nautical commander terrible to the foe was in complete and happy subjugation to his daughter our heroine as he was taking leave dolignan saw his divinity glide into the drawingroom he followed her observed a sweet consciousness deepen into confusion she tried to laugh and cried instead and then she smiled again when he kissed her hand at the door it was george and marian instead of captain this and miss the other a reasonable time after this for my tale is merciful and skips formalities and torturing delays these two were very happy they were once more upon the railroad going to enjoy their honeymoon all by themselves marian dolignan was dressed just as before ducklike and delicious all bright except her clothes but george sat beside her this time instead of opposite and she drank him in gently from her long eyelashes marian said george married people should tell each other all will you ever forgive me if i own to you no yes yes well then you remember the box tunnel this was the first allusion he had ventured to it i am ashamed to say i had three pounds to ten pounds with white i would kiss one of you two ladies and george pathetic externally chuckled within i know that george i overheard you was the demure reply oh you overheard me impossible and did you not hear me whisper to my companion i made a bet with her you made a bet how singular what was it only a pair of gloves george yes i know but what about it that if you did you should be my husband dearest oh but stay then you could not have been so very angry with me love why dearest then you brought that action against me mrs dolignan looked down i was afraid you were forgetting me george you will never forgive me sweet angel why here is the box tunnel now reader fie no no such thing you cant expect to be indulged in this way every time we come to a dark place besides it is not the thing consider two sensible married people no such phenomenon i assure you took place no scream in hopeless rivalry of the engine this time minions of the moon by f w robinson our story is of the time when george iii was king and our scene of action lies only at an old farmhouse six miles or so from finchley a quaint ramshackle commodious oldfashioned thatched farmhouse that we see only in pictures now and which has long since been improved off the face of the earth it was a farm estate that was flourishing bravely in those dear disreputable days when the people paid fivepence a pound for bread and only dared curse protection in their hearts when few throve and many starved and younger sons of gentry without interest at court or parliament either cut the country which served them so badly or took to business on the kings highway and served the country badly in return the maythorpe farm belonged to the pemberthys and had descended from father to son from days lying too far back to reckon up just now and a rare exclusive conservative badtempered longheaded race the pemberthys had always borne the reputation of being feathering their own nests well and dying in them fat and prosperous there were a good many pemberthys scattered about the home and midland counties but it was generally understood in the family that the head of the clan as it were lived at maythorpe farm near finchley and here the pemberthys would forgather on any great occasion such as a marriage a funeral or a christening the funeral taking precedence for numbers there had been a grand funeral at maythorpe farm only a few days before our story opens for reuben pemberthy had been consigned to his fathers at the early age of fortynine reuben pemberthy had left one son behind him also named reuben a stalwart heavybrowed goodlooking young fellow who at two and twenty was quite as well able to manage the farm and everybody on it as his father had been before him he had got rid of all his relatives save two six days after his fathers funeral and those two were stopping by general consent because it was signed sealed and delivered by those whom it most concerned that the younger woman his cousin pretty sophie tarne was to be married before the year was out to the present reuben pemberthy who had wooed her and won her consent when he went down to her mothers house at kings norton for a few days trip last summer being a steady handsome fellow who made love in downright earnest he impressed sophies eighteen years and was somewhat timidly but graciously accepted as an affianced suitor it was thought at kings norton that mrs tarne had done a better stroke of business in the first year of her widowhood than her late husband had done always an unlucky wretch timothy in the whole course of his life and now sophie tarne and her mother were staying for a few days longer at maythorpe farm after the funeral mrs tarne having been a real pemberthy before her unfortunate marriage with the improvident draper of kings norton was quite one of the family and seemed more at home at finchley than was the new widow mrs pemberthy a poor unlucky lady a victim to a chronic state of twittering and jingling and twitching but one who despite her shivers had made the late reuben a good wife and was a fair housekeeper even now although superintending housekeeping in jumps like a palsystricken kangaroo so sophie and her bustling mother were of material assistance to mrs pemberthy and the presence of sophie in that house of mourning where the mourning had been speedily got over and business had begun again with commendable celerity was a considerable source of comfort to young reuben when he had leisure after business hours which was not always the case to resume those tender relations which had borne to him last autumn such happy fruit of promise though there was not much work to do at the farm in the wintertime when the nights were long and the days short yet reuben pemberthy was generally busy in one way or another and on the particular day on which our story opens reuben was away at high barnet it had been a dull dark day followed by a dull dark night the farm servants had gone to their homes save the few that were attached to the premises such as scullerymaids and dairymaids and mrs pemberthy mrs tarne and her daughter sophie were waiting early supper for reuben and wondering what kept him so long from his home and his sweetheart mrs tarne accustomed mayhap to the roar and bustle of kings norton found the farm at finchley a trifle dull and lonely not that in a few days after a funeral she could expect any excessive display of life or frivolity and oppressed a bit that evening was a trifle nervous as to the whereabouts of her future soninlaw who had faithfully promised to be home a clear hour and a half before the present time and whose word might be always taken to be as good as his bond mrs tarne was the most restless of the three women good mrs pemberthy though physically shaken was not likely to be nervous concerning her son and indeed was at any time only fidgety over her own special complaints a remarkable trait of character deserving of passing comment here sophie was not of a nervous temperament indeed for her eighteen years was apparently a little too cool and methodical and she was not flurried that evening over the delay in the arrival home of reuben pemberthy she was not imaginative like her mother and did not associate delay with the dangers of a dark night though the nights were full of danger in the good old times of the third george she went to the door to look out after her mother had tripped there for the seventh or eighth time not for appearances sake for she was above that but to keep her mother company and to suggest that these frequent excursions to the front door would end in a bad cold i cant help fearing that something has happened to reu said the mother he is always so true to time there are so many things to keep a man late mother not to keep reuben if he said what hour hed be back he s like his father my poor brother hed do it to the minute even if there werent any reason for his hurry which there is said sophie archly which there is sophie and why you are so quiet over this i dont know i am sure when poor mr tarne was out late and he was often very very late and the lord knows where hed been either i couldnt keep a limb of me still till he came home again i was as bad as your aunt indoors there till i was sure he was safe and sound but he always came home safe and sound mother nearly always i mind the time once though bless us and save us what a gust she cried as the wind came swooping down the hill at them swirling past them into the dark passage and puffing the lights out in the big pantry beyond where the maids began to scream i hope he hasnt been blown off his horse not very likely that said sophie and reuben the best horseman in the county but come in out of the gale mother the sleet cuts like a knife too and he will not come home any the sooner for your letting the wind into the house and why here he comes after all hark there was a rattling of horses hoofs on the frostbound road it was a long way in the distance but it was the unmistakable signal of a wellmounted traveller approaching of more than one wellmounted traveller it became quickly apparent the clattering was so loud and incessant and manifold soldiers said sophie what can bring them this way its the farmers coming the same way as reuben for protections sake these winter nights child protection havent you heard of the highwaymen about and how a single traveller is never safe in these parts or a double one either or perhaps these are highwaymen oh good gracious let us get indoors and bar up cried mrs tarne wholly forgetful of reuben pemberthys safety after this suggestion yes its as likely to be highwaymen as soldiers it was more likely it was pretty conclusive that the odds were in favour of highwaymen when five minutes afterward eight mounted men rode up to the maythorpe farmhouse dismounted with considerable noise and bustle and commenced at the stout oaken door with the buttends of their ridingwhips hammering away incessantly and shouting out much strong language in their vehemence this being fortunately bawled forth all at once was incomprehensible to the dwellers within doors now all scared together and no longer cool and selfpossessed robbers said mrs tarne weve never been molested before at least not for twenty years or more said mrs pemberthy and then i mind is it likely to be any of reubens friends asked sophie timidly oh no reuben has no bellowing crowd like that for friends ask who is there somebody but nobody would go to the door save sophie tarne herself the maids were huddled in a heap together in a corner of the dairy and refused to budge an inch and mrs tarne was shaking more than mrs pemberthy sophie with the colour gone from her face went boldly back to the door where the hammering on the panels continued and would have split anything of a less tough fibre than the english oak of which they were constructed who is there what do you want she gave out in a shrill falsetto but no one heard her till the questions were repeated about an octave and a half higher hold hard stango theres a woman calling to us stop your row will you a sudden cessation of the battering ensued and some one was heard going rapidly backward over cobblestones amid the laughter of the rest who had dismounted and were standing outside in the cold with their hands upon their horses bridles who is there asked sophie tarne again travellers in need of assistance and who began a polite and even musical voice which was interrupted by a hoarse voice open in the kings name will you open in the fiends name wont you called out a third and hoarser voice or well fire through the windows and burn the place down what do you want silence shouted the first one again let me explain you dogs before you bark again there was a pause and the polite gentleman began again in his mellifluous voice we are travellers belated we require corn for our horses food for ourselves there is no occasion for alarm my friends are noisy but harmless i assure you and the favour of admittance and entertainment here will be duly appreciated to refuse your hospitality the hospitality of a pemberthy is only to expose yourselves to considerable inconvenience i fear spoken like a book captain and as we intend to come in at all risks added a deeper voice it will be better for you not to try and keep us out d ye hear d ye captain if you shake me by the collar again ill put a bullet through you i silence let the worthy folks inside consider the position for five minutes not a minute longer if they dont want the place burned about their ears mind you cried a voice that had not spoken yet who are you asked sophie still inclined to parley travellers i have told you thieves cutthroats and murderers eight of us knights of the road gentlemen of the highway and not to be trifled with when half starved and hard driven cried the hoarse man there will that satisfy you wench will you let us in or not its easy enough for us to smash in the windows and get in that way isnt it yes it was very easy wait five minutes please said sophie she went back to the parlour and to the two shivering women and the crowd of maids who had crept from the dairy to the farm parlour having greater faith in numbers now they had better come in aunt especially as we are quite helpless to keep them out i could fire that gun sophie said pointing to an unwieldy old blunderbuss slung by straps to the ceiling and i know its loaded but im afraid it wouldnt be of much use it might make them angry said mrs pemberthy it would only kill one at the best remarked mrs tarne with a heavy sigh and the rest of the men would kill us the brutes said mrs pemberthy yes theyd better come in lord have mercy upon us said mrs tarne theres no help for it said mrs pemberthy even reuben would not have dared to keep them out i mind now their coming like this twenty years agone it was i will see to them said sophie who had become in her young brave strength quite the mistress of the ceremonies leave the rest to me and if you can persuade them to go away began mrs tarne but her daughter had already disappeared and was parleying through the keyhole with the strangers without such hospitality as we can offer gentlemen shall be at your service providing always that you treat us with the respect due to gentlewomen and your hosts trust to that was the reply i will answer for myself and my companions mistress pemberthy you give me your word of honour my word of honour he repeated our words of honour and speaking for all my good friends present is it not so men ay ay that s right chorused the good friends and then sophie tarne not without an extra plunging of the heart beneath her white crossover unlocked the stout oaken door and let in her unwelcome visitors seven out of the eight seemed to tumble in all at once pushing against one another in their eagerness to enter laughing shouting and stamping with the heels of their jackboots on the bright red pantiles of the hall the eighth intruder followed a tall thin man palefaced and stern and young with a heavy horsemans cloak falling from his shoulders the front of which was gathered up across his arms a handsome and yet worn face the face of one who had seen better days and known brighter times a picturesque kind of vagabond take him in the candlelight he raised his hat and bowed low to sophie tarne not offering to shake hands as the rest of them had done who where crowding around her then he seemed to stand suddenly between them and their salutations and to brush them unceremoniously aside you see to those horses stango and grapp he said singling out the most obtrusive and the most blackmuzzled of his gang mistress pemberthy will perhaps kindly trust us for a while with the keys of the stables and cornbins they are here said sophie detaching them from a bunch of keys which in true housewifely fashion hung from her girdle the farm servants are away in the village or they should help you sir we are in the habit of helping ourselvesvery much said one of the highwaymen drily pray dont apologise on that score mistress two of the men departed five of them stalked into the farm parlour flourishing their big hats and executing clumsy scrapings with their feet while bowing in mock fashion to the two nervous widows who sat in one corner regarding them askance the leader of these lawless ones dropped his cloak from his shoulders left it trailing on the pantile floor and made a rapid signal with his hand to sophie to pause an instant before she entered the room treat them with fair words and not too much strong waters he said quickly we have a long ride before us he said it like a warning and sophie nodded as though she took his advice and was not ungrateful for it then they both went into the parlour and joined the company and the maidservant becoming used to the position or making the best of it began to bustle about and wait upon their visitors who had already drawn up their seats to the suppertable which had been spread with good things two hours ago anticipative of the return reuben pemberthy to maythorpe it was an odd supperparty at which sophie tarne presided the highwaymen insisting with much clamour and some emphatic oaths that they would have no old women like mrs tarne and mrs pemberthy at the head of the table sophie was a pretty wench and so must do the honours of the feast the young girls health gentlemen with three times three and may her husband be a match for her in good looks cried one admiring knight of the road and then the toast was drunk the ale flowed freely and there was much laughter and loud jesting the man whom they called guy and captain sat by sophies side he ate very little and kept a watchful eye upon his men after stango and his companion had come in from the stable and completed the number he exchanged at first but few words with sophie though he surveyed her with a grave attention that brought the colour to her cheeks he was a man upon guard presently he said you bear your position well you are not alarmed at these wild fellows no not now i dont think they would hurt me besides besides what he asked as she paused i have your word for them yes he answered but it is only a highwaymans word i can trust it these men can be demons when they like mistress pemberthy sophie did not think it worth while to inform the gentleman that her name was not pemberthy it could not possibly matter to him and there was a difficulty in explaining the relationship she bore to the family why are you with such men as these she asked wonderingly where should i be where can i be else he asked lightly now but it was with a forced lightness of demeanour or sophie tarne was very much deceived helping your king not warring against him and his laws said sophie very quickly i owe no allegiance to king george i have always been a neerdowell despised and scouted by a hard father and a villainous brother or two and life with these good fellows here is after all to my mind theres independence in it and i prefer to be independent and danger and i like danger a wronged man wrongs others in his turn mistress and it is my turn now two wrongs cannot make a right oh i do not attempt the impossible mistress pemberthy what will be the end of this to you the gallows if i cannot get my pistol out in time he laughed lightly and naturally enough as sophie shrank in terror from him one could see he was a desperate man enough despite his better manners probably as great an outcast as the rest of them and as little to be trusted that is a dreadful end to look forward to she said i dont look forward what is the use when that is the prospect your father your brothers would be glad that the end came soon he concluded they are waiting for it patiently they have prophesied it for the last five years they know then oh yes i have taken care that they should know he answered laughing defiantly again and your mother does she know he paused and looked at her very hard god forbid she is she is in heaven where nothing is known of what goes on upon earth how can you tell that there would be no peace in heaven otherwise mistress pemberthy only great grief intense shame misery despair madness at the true knowledge of us all he said passionately on earth we men are hypocrites and liars devils and slaves not all men said sophie thinking of reu pemberthy i have met none other perhaps i have sought none other all my own fault they will tell you where my father is where he added bitterly they are worse than i am and yet oh so respectable you turned highwayman to to to spite them say it is very near the truth it will be a poor excuse to the mother when you see her again eh but sophie had no time to continue so abstruse a subject with this misanthropical freebooter she clapped her hand to her side and gave a little squeak of astonishment what is the matter asked captain guy my keys they have taken my keys and sure enough while sophie tarne had been talking to the captain some one had severed the keys from her girdle and made off with them and there was only a cleancut black ribbon dangling at her waist instead that villain stango exclaimed the captain i saw him pass a minute ago he leaned over and whispered to you kits you remember stango said kits with far too innocent an expression to be genuine yes stango you know he did i dare say he did i dont gainsay it captain but i dont know where he has gone but i will know cried the captain striking his hand upon the table and making every glass and plate jump thereon i will have no tricks played here without my consent am i your master or are you all mine and here we regret to say captain guy swore a good deal and became perfectly unheroic and inelegant and unromantic but his oaths had more effect upon his unruly followers than his protests and they sat looking at him in a halfsullen halfshamefaced manner and would have probably succumbed to his influence had not attention been diverted and aroused by the reappearance of stango who staggered in with four or five great black bottles heaped high in his arms a tremendous shout of applause and delight heralded his return to the parlour we have been treated scurvily my men cried stango exceedingly scurvily the best and strongest stuff in the cellar has been kept back from us its excellent ive been tasting it first lest you should all be poisoned and theres more where this come from oceans more of it hurrah for stango the captains voice was heard once more above the uproar but it was only for a minute longer there was a rush of six men toward stango a shouting scrambling fighting for the spirits which he had discovered a crash of one black bottle to the floor with the spirit streaming over the polished boards and the unceremonious tilting over of the upper part of the suppertable in the ruffians wild eagerness for drink to horse to horse men have you forgotten how far we have to go cried the captain but they had forgotten everything and did not heed him they were drinking strong waters and were heedless of the hour and the risks they ran by a protracted stay there in ten minutes from that time saturnalia had set in and pandemonium seemed to have unloosed its choicest specimens they sang they danced they raved they blasphemed they crowed like cocks they fired pistols at the chimney ornaments they chased the maidservants from one room to another they whirled round the room with mrs tarne and mrs pemberthy they would have made a plunge at sophie tarne for partner had not the captain very white and stern now stood close to her side with a pistol at full cock in his right hand i shall shoot the first man down who touches you he said between his set teeth i will get away from them soon for heavens sake for mine do not add to the horror of this night sir implored sophie he paused i beg your pardon he said in a low tone of voice but but i am powerless to help you unless i quell these wolves at once they are going off for more drink what is to be done can you sing mistress pemberthy yes a little at least they say so she said blushing at her own selfencomium sing something to gain time i will slip away while you are singing and get the horses round to the front door do not be afraid gentlemen he cried in a loud voice and bringing the handle of his pistol smartly on the head of the man nearest to him to emphasise his discourse mistress pemberthy will oblige the company with a song order and attention for the lady a song a song exclaimed the highwaymen clapping their hands and stamping their heels upon the floor and then amid the pause which followed sophie tarne began a plaintive little ballad in a sweet tremulous voice which gathered strength as she proceeded it was a strange scene awaiting the return of reuben pemberthy whose tall form stood in the doorway before sophie had finished her sweet simple rendering of an old english ballad reubens round blue eyes were distended with surprise and his mouth generally very set and close like the mouth of a steel purse was on this especial occasion and for a while wide open sophie tarne singing her best to amuse this vile and disorderly crew who sat or stood around the room half drunk and with glasses in their hands pipes in their mouths and the formidable oldfashioned horsepistols in their pockets and who was the handsome man with the long black flowing hair and a pale face standing by sophies side his sophie in a suit of soiled brocade and tarnished lace with a ramilie cocked hat under his arm and a pistol in his hand the leader of these robbers the very man who had stopped him on the kings highway three hours ago and taken every stiver which he had brought away from barnet who had with the help of these other scoundrels getting mad drunk on his brandy taken away his horse and left him bound to a gate by the roadside because he would not be quietly robbed but must make a fuss over it and fight and kick in a most unbecoming fashion and without any regard for the numbers by whom he had been assailed i did not think you could sing like that said the captain quietly and in a low voice when sophie had finished her song and a great shout of approval was echoing throughout the farm and many hundred yards beyond it you have not got the horses ready said sophie becoming aware that he was still at her side you said you promised i could not leave you while you were singing did you know that was my mothers song how should i know that no no but how strange how ah there is your brother at the door i have had the honour of meeting master pemberthy of finchley earlier this evening i think a brave young gentleman you should be proud of him my bro oh it is reu o reu reu where have you been why did you not come before to help us to tell us what to do and sophie tarne ran to him and put her arms round his neck and burst into tears it was not a wise step on sophies part but it was the reaction at the sight of her sweetheart at the glimpse as it were of deliverance there there dont cry sophie keep a stout heart he whispered if these villains have robbed us they will not be triumphant long it will be my turn to crow presently i i dont understand i cant explain now keep a good face ply them with more drink watch me well my friends he said in a loud voice you have stolen a march upon me this time but ive got home you see in time to welcome you to maythorpe and share in your festivity im a pemberthy and not likely to cry over spilled milk more liquor for the gentlemen you wenches and be quick with it captain heres to you and your companions and next time you catch a pemberthy thy treat him more gently in return for a welcome here more liquor girls the gentlemen are thirsty after their long ride reuben drank to the healths of the gentlemen by whom he was surrounded he was very much at home in his own house very cool and undismayed having recovered from his surprise at finding an evening party being celebrated there the highwaymen were too much excited to see anything remarkable in the effusion of reuben pemberthys greeting these were lawless times when farmers and highwaymen were often in accord dealt in one anothers horses and drove various bargains at odd seasons and in odd corners of the marketplaces and reuben pemberthy was not unknown to them though they had treated him with scant respect upon a lonely country road and when they were impressed by the fact that he was riding homeward with welllined pockets after a days huckstering they cheered mr pemberthys sentiments all but the captain who regarded him very critically although bowing very low while his health was drunk my cousin and my future bride gentlemen will sing you another song and i dont mind following suit myself just to show there is no ill feeling between us and our worthy captain he will oblige after me i am sure it may be a good many years before we meet again it may said the captain laconically i i cannot sing any more reuben cried sophie try sophie for all our sakes our homes sake the home they would strip or burn to the ground if they had only the chance why do you wish to keep them here sophie whispered back to him i was released by a troop of soldiers who were coming in this direction he said hurriedly they have gone on toward finchley in search of these robbers but failing to find them they will return here as my guests till morning that was their promise oh sophie could not say more reuben had left her side and was talking and laughing with stango as though he loved him your sweetheart then this cock o the game said the captain to sophie as he approached her once more yes i had need wish you much joy for i see but little toward it as the poet says he remarked bluntly he will not make you a good husband you cannot say that its a hard face that will look into yours mistress and when trouble comes it will not look pleasantly you are going to sing again i am glad you promised to go away long since i did but the host has returned and i distrust him i am waiting now to see the end of it no no i hope not pray go sir is there danger yes i thought so i am fond of danger i have told you it braces me up it why are you so pale you have been kind to me and you have saved me from indignity pray take your men away at once they will not go and i will not desert them for my sake do a song a song no more lovemaking tonight captain a song from the farmers pretty lass cried out the men and then sophie began to sing again this time a lovesong the song of a maiden waiting for her soldier boy to come back from the wars a maiden waiting for him listening for him hearing the tramp of his regiment on the way toward her she looked at captain guy as she sang and with much entreaty in her gaze and he looked back at her from under the cock of his hat which he had pulled over his brows then he wavered and stole out of the room kits was at the door still with his mug of brandy in his hand guy seized him by the ear and took him out with him into the fresh air where the white frost was and where the white moon was shining now the soldiers are after us and know where we are kits pitch that stuff away not if and get the horses ready quick i will be with you in a moment he walked along the garden path in front of the big old farm swung wide the farm gates and propped them open then he went down on all fours and put his ear to the frostbound country road and listened yes he added two miles away and coming on sharp why not let them come what does it matter how soon he strode back however with quick steps five minutes afterward he was at the door of the farm parlour again with his cloak over his shoulder and his ridingwhip in his hand boys the redcoats are upon us he shouted each man to his horse we are betrayed then we wont go and leave all the good things in this house cried stango why its like the bank of england upstairs and i have the keys i stango i shall certainly put a bullet through your head if you attempt to do anything more save to thank our worthy hose for his hospitality and give him up his keys do you hear he thundered forth will you hang us all you fool by your delay the highwaymen were scurrying out of the room now a few in too much haste to thank the givers of the feast the others bowing and shaking hands in mock burlesque of their chief stango had thrown down his keys and run for it sorry we must leave you master pemberthy said the captain but i certainly have the impression that a troop of horse soldiers is coming in this direction pure fancy probably but one cannot risk anything in these hard times your purse sir which i took this afternoon i shall not require it buy mistress sophie a wedding with it goodnight he bowed low but he did not smile till he met sophies frightened looks then he bowed still lower hat in hand and said goodnight with a funny break in his voice and a longing look in his dark eyes that sophie did not readily forget it was all like a dream after the highwaymen had put spurs to their horses and galloped away from maythorpe farm it will be fifteen years come next wintertime since the minions of the moon held high carnival at the farm of reuben pemberthy save that the trees about the homestead are full of rustling green leaves and there is sunshine where the white frost lay the farm looks very much the same the great thatched roof has taken a darker tinge and all the gold in it has turned to gray and the walls are more weatherbeaten than of yore but it is the old farm still standing foursquare with the highroad to finchley winding over the green hill yonder like a great white dusty snake along the road comes a horseman at full speed as though anxious to find a shelter before nightfall for the kings highway in this direction is no safer than it used to be and people talk of abershaw and barrington and a man with sixteen strings to his hat who are busy in this direction but the days are long now and it wants some hours before sundown when the traveller leaps from his horse and stands under the broad eaves of the porch where the creepers are growing luxuriantly and are full of fair white flowers the traveller is a good horseman though he has passed the heyday of his youth it is not for some three minutes afterward that his manservant hot and blown and powdered thick with dust comes up on horseback after him and takes charge of his masters steed the master is a man of forty years or more and looking somewhat older than his years his hair being very gray he stoops a little between the shoulders too when off his guard though he can look straight and stalwart enough when put to it he is very dark a fiercer sun than that which shines on england has burned him a copper colour and he has a moustache that munchausen might have envied he knocks at the door and asks if master reuben pemberthy can be seen at a moments notice the maidservant looks surprised but says my mistress is within sir reuben pemberthys wife that is he mutters pulling thoughtfully at his long moustache ah well perhaps she will see me what name shall i say sir richard isshaw but she will not know the name he stands in the hall looking about him critically his manservant still mounted goes slowly back toward the roadway with his masters horse and his own where he remains in waiting presently sir richard isshaw is shown into the farm parlour very cool and full of shadow with great green plants on the broad recesses of the open window and bees buzzing about them from the outer world a young woman in deep widows weeds rises as he enters and makes him one of those profound courtesies which were considered appropriate for the fair sex to display to those in rank and honour in the good old days when george was king surely a young woman still despite the fifteen years that have passed with a young supple figure and a pleasant unlined face eighteen years and fifteen only make thirtythree and one can scarcely believe in times inroads looking upon sophie pemberthy the man cannot he is surprised and he looks at her through tears in his dark eyes you asked to see mr reuben pemberthy she says sadly you did not know that no i did not know he says a little huskily i am a stranger to these parts i have been long abroad may i inquire the nature of your errand sir richard she asks in a low voice though i am afraid i cannot be of any service as regards any business of the farm how is that he asks steadily keeping gaze upon her the farm passes to mr pemberthys cousin in a few days time indeed then you he pauses halfway for a reply but it is long in coming only the humming of the bees disturbs the silence of the room then you leave here he concludes at last yes it is only the male pemberthys who rule she says your your children my one little boy my dear algy died before his father it was a great disappointment to my husband that he should die we female pemberthys she says with a sudden real bright little smile that settles down into sadness again very quickly do not count for a great deal in the family how long has mr pemberthy been dead six months you are left poor he says very quickly now i i dont think you have a right to ask me such a question sir i have no right he replies these are foreign manners excuse them please dont mind me still he is persistent from son to sons son and the women left anywhere and anyhow that is the pemberthy law i expect i have seen the workings of such a law before not that i ought to complain he adds with a forced laugh a laugh that mrs pemberthy seems suddenly to remember for i have profited thereby indeed says the farmers widow for the want of a better answer at the moment i am a younger son but all my brothers have been away by wars or pestilence and i am sent for in hot haste i who had shaken the dust of england from my feet for fifteen years fifteen years almost dont you recollect the last time i was in this room you in this room sir richard yes try and remember when that was i only come to look at the old place and you just for once before i go away again try and think mistress pemberthy as i used to call you she looks into the red sunburnt face starts blushes and looks away yes i remember you are well captain guy yes that is it richard guy isshaw younger son who went wholly to the bad who turned highwayman whom you saved the only one out of the eight the rest were hanged at tyburn and kennington poor devils and thought i would ride over and thank you and see you once more your husband would have hanged me i dare say but there there peace to his soul amen whispers sophie pemberthy you saved me you set me thinking of my young mother who died when i was a lad and loved me much too well and you taught me there were warm and loving hearts in the world and when i went away from here i went away from the old life i cannot say how that was but shrugging his shoulders so it was it was a call said sophie piously a call to arms for i went to the wars and what is it now that brings me back here to thank you an old timeworn reprobate turned soldier and turned respectable what is that i dont know another call depend upon it a call to maythorpe where i expected to find a fat farmer and his buxom partner and a crowd of laughing boys and girls where i hoped i might be of help to some of them if help were needed and he adds i find only you and you just the same fair bright girl i left behind me long ago oh no it is like a dream it is very remarkable to me yes its another call mistress pemberthy depend upon it and it is not the last call either the estate of richard isshaw lies not so many miles from maythorpe farm that a good long ride cannot overcome the distance between them and the man turned respectable the real baronet is so very much alone and out of place in his big house that he knows not what to do and mistress pemberthy is very much alone too and going out alone into the world almost friendless and with only two hundred pounds and perhaps the secondbest bed who knows as her share of her late loving but rather hard and unsympathetic husbands worldly goods and folks do say finchley way that pretty mistress pemberthy will be lady isshaw before the winter sets in and that it will be exactly fifteen years since these two first set eyes upon each other the fourfifteen express by amelia b edwards the events which i am about to relate took place between nine and ten years ago sebastopol had fallen in the early spring the peace of paris had been concluded since march our commercial relations with the russian empire were but recently renewed and i returning home after my first northward journey since the war was well pleased with the prospect of spending the month of december under the hospitable and thoroughly english roof of my excellent friend jonathan jelf esq of dumbleton manor clayborough east anglia travelling in the interests of the wellknown firm in which it is my lot to be a junior partner i had been called upon to visit not only the capitals of russia and poland but had found it also necessary to pass some weeks among the trading ports of the baltic whence it came that the year was already far spent before i again set foot on english soil and that instead of shooting pheasants with him as i had hoped in october i came to be my friends guest during the more genial christmastide my voyage over and a few days given up to business in liverpool and london i hastened down to clayborough with all the delight of a schoolboy whose holidays are at hand my way lay by the great east anglian line as far as clayborough station where i was to be met by one of the dumbleton carriages and conveyed across the remaining nine miles of country it was a foggy afternoon singularly warm for the th of december and i had arranged to leave london by the express the early darkness of winter had already closed in the lamps were lighted in the carriages a clinging damp dimmed the windows adhered to the doorhandles and pervaded all the atmosphere while the gasjets at the neighbouring bookstand diffused a luminous haze that only served to make the gloom of the terminus more visible having arrived some seven minutes before the starting of the train and by the connivance of the guard taken sole possession of empty compartment i lighted my travellinglamp made myself particularly snug and settled down to the undisturbed enjoyment of a book and a cigar great therefore was my disappointment when at the last moment a gentleman came hurrying along the platform glanced into my carriage opened the locked door with a private key a stepped in it struck me at the first glance that i had seen him before a tall spare man thinlipped lighteyed with an ungraceful stoop in the shoulders and scant gray hair worn somewhat long upon collar he carried a light waterproof coat an umbrella and a large brown japanned deedbox which last he placed under the seat this done he felt carefully in his breastpocket as if to make certain of the safety of his purse or pocketbook laid his umbrella in the netting overhead spread the waterproof across his knees and exchanged his hat for a travellingcap of some scotch material by this time the train was moving out of the station and into the faint gray of the wintry twilight beyond i now recognised my companion i recognised him from the moment when he removed his hat and uncovered the lofty furrowed and somewhat narrow brow beneath i had met him as i distinctly remembered some three years before at the very house for which in all probability he was now bound like myself his name was dwerrihouse he was a lawyer by profession and if i was not greatly mistaken was first cousin to the wife of my host i knew also that he was a man eminently welltodo both as regarded his professional and private means the jelfs entertained him with that sort of observant courtesy which falls to the lot of the rich relation the children made much of him and the old butler albeit somewhat surly to the general treated him with deference i thought observing him by the vague mixture of lamplight and twilight that mrs jelfs cousin looked all the worse for the three years wear and tear which had gone over his head since our last meeting he was very pale and had a restless light in his eye that i did not remember to have observed before the anxious lines too about his mouth were deepened and there was a cavernous hollow look about his cheeks and temples which seemed to speak of sickness or sorrow he had glanced at me as he came in but without any gleam of recognition in his face now he glanced again as i fancied somewhat doubtfully when he did so for the third or fourth time i ventured to address him mr john dwerrihouse i think that is my name he replied i had the pleasure of meeting you at dumbleton about three years ago mr dwerrihouse bowed i thought i knew your face he said but your name i regret to say langford william langford i have known jonathan jelf since we were boys together at merchant taylors and i generally spend a few weeks at dumbleton in the shooting season i suppose we are bound for the same destination not if you are on your way to the manor he replied i am travelling upon business rather troublesome business too while you doubtless have only pleasure in view just so i am in the habit of looking forward to this visit as to the brightest three weeks in all the year it is a pleasant house said mr dwerrihouse the pleasantest i know and jelf is thoroughly hospitable the best and kindest fellow in the world they have invited me to spend christmas week with them pursued mr dwerrihouse after a moments pause and you are coming i cannot tell it must depend on the issue of this business which i have in hand you have heard perhaps that we are about to construct a branch line from blackwater to stockbridge i explained that i had been for some months away from england and had therefore heard nothing of the contemplated improvement mr dwerrihouse smiled complacently it will be an improvement he said a great improvement stockbridge is a flourishing town and needs but a more direct railway communication with the metropolis to become an important centre of commerce this branch was my own idea i brought the project before the board and have myself superintended the execution of it up to the present time you are an east anglian director i presume my interest in the company replied mr dwerringhouse is threefold i am a director i am a considerable shareholder and as head of the firm of dwerrihouse dwerrihouse craik i am the companys principal solicitor loquacious selfimportant full of his pet project and apparently unable to talk on any other subject mr dwerrihouse then went on to tell of the opposition he had encountered and the obstacles he had overcome in the cause of the stockbridge branch i was entertained with a multitude of local details and local grievances the rapacity of one squire the impracticability of another the indignation of the rector whose glebe was threatened the culpable indifference of the stockbridge townspeople who could not be brought to see that their most vital interests hinged upon a junction with the great east anglian line the spite of the local newspaper and the unheardof difficulties attending the common question were each and all laid before me with a circumstantiality that possessed the deepest interest for my excellent fellowtraveller but none whatever for myself from these to my despair he went on to more intricate matters to the approximate expenses of construction per mile to the estimates sent in by different contractors to the probable traffic returns of the new line to the provisional clauses of the new act as enumerated in schedule d of the companys last halfyearly report and so on and on and on till my head ached and my attention flagged and my eyes kept closing in spite of every effort that i made to keep them open at length i was roused by these words seventyfive thousand pounds cash down seventyfive thousand pounds cash down i repeated in the liveliest tone i could assume that is a heavy sum a heavy sum to carry here replied mr dwerrihouse pointing significantly to his breastpocket but a mere fraction of what we shall ultimately have to pay you do not mean to say that you have seventyfive thousand pounds at this moment upon your person i exclaimed my good sir have i not been telling you so for the last halfhour said mr dwerrihouse testily that money has to be paid over at halfpast eight oclock this evening at the office of sir thomass solicitors on completion of the deed of sale but how will you get across by night from blackwater to stockbridge with seventyfive thousand pounds in your pocket to stockbridge echoed the lawyer i find i have made myself very imperfectly understood i thought i had explained how this sum only carries us as far as mallingford the first stage as it were of our journey and how our route from blackwater to mallingford lies entirely through sir thomas liddells property i beg your pardon i stammered i fear my thoughts were wandering so you only go as far as mallingford tonight precisely i shall get a conveyance from the blackwater arms and you oh jelf sends a trap to meet me at clayborbough can i be the bearer of any message from you you may say if you please mr langford that i wished i could have been your companion all the way and that i will come over if possible before christmas nothing more mr dwerrihouse smiled grimly well he said you may tell my cousin that she need not burn the hall down in my honour time and that i shall be obliged if she will order the blueroom chimney to be swept before i arrive that sounds tragic had you a conflagration on the occasion of your last visit to dumbleton something like it there had been no fire lighted in my bedroom since the spring the flue was foul and the rooks had built in it so when i went up to dress for dinner i found the room full of smoke and the chimney on fire are we already at blackwater the train had gradually come to a pause while mr dwerrihouse was speaking and on putting my head out of the window i could see the station some few hundred yards ahead there was another train before us blocking the way and the guard was making use of the delay to collect the blackwater tickets i had scarcely ascertained our position when the ruddyfaced official appeared at our carriage door tickets sir said he i am for clayborough i replied holding out the tiny pink card he took it glanced at it by the light of his little lantern gave it back looked as i fancied somewhat sharply at my fellowtraveller and disappeared he did not ask for yours i said with some surprise they never do replied mr dwerrihouse they all know me and of course i travel free blackwater blackwater cried the porter running along the platform beside us as we glided into the station mr dwerrihouse pulled out his deedbox put his travellingcap in his pocket resumed his hat took down his umbrella and prepared to be gone many thanks mr langford for your society he said with oldfashioned courtesy i wish you a goodevening goodevening i replied putting out my hand but he either did not see it or did not choose to see it and slightly lifting his hat stepped out upon the platform having done this he moved slowly away and mingled with the departing crowd leaning forward to watch him out of sight i trod upon something which proved to be a cigarcase it had fallen no doubt from the pocket of his waterproof coat and was made of dark morocco leather with a silver monogram upon the side i sprang out of the carriage just as the guard came up to lock me in is there one minute to spare i asked eagerly the gentleman who travelled down with me from town has dropped his cigarcase he is not yet out of the station just a minute and a half sir replied the guard you must be quick i dashed along the platform as fast as my feet could carry me it was a large station and mr dwerrihouse had by this time got more than halfway to the farther end i however saw him distinctly moving slowly with the stream then as i drew nearer i saw that he had met some friend that they were talking as they walked that they presently fell back somewhat from the crowd and stood aside in earnest conversation i made straight for the spot where they were waiting there was a vivid gasjet just above their heads and the light fell full upon their faces i saw both distinctly the face of mr dwerrihouse and the face of his companion running breathless eager as i was getting in the way of porters and passengers and fearful every instant lest i should see the train going on without me i yet observed that the newcomer was considerably younger and shorter than the director that he was sandyhaired mustachioed smallfeatured and dressed in a closecut suit of scotch tweed i was now within a few yards of them i ran against a stout gentleman i was nearly knocked down by a luggagetruck i stumbled over a carpetbag i gained the spot just as the drivers whistle warned me to return to my utter stupefaction they were no longer there i had seen them but two seconds before and they were gone i stood still i looked to right and left i saw no sign of them in any direction it was as if the platform had gaped and swallowed them there were two gentlemen standing here a moment ago i said to a porter at my elbow which way can they have gone i saw no gentlemen sir replied the man the whistle shrilled out again the guard far up the platform held up his arm and shouted to me to come on if youre going on by this train sir said the porter you must run for it i did run for it just gained the carriage as the train began to move was shoved in by the guard and left breathless and bewildered with mr dwerrihouses cigarcase still in my hand it was the strangest disappearance in the world it was like a transformation trick in a pantomime they were there one moment palpably there walking with the gaslight full upon their faces and the next moment they were gone there was no door near no window no staircase it was a mere slip of barren platform tapestried with big advertisements could anything be more mysterious it was not worth thinking about and yet for my life i could not help pondering upon it pondering wondering conjecturing turning it over and over in my mind and beating my brains for a solution of the enigma i thought of it all the way from blackwater to clayborough i thought of it all the way from clayborough to dumbleton as i rattled along the smooth highway in a trim dogcart drawn by a splendid black mare and driven by the silentest and dapperest of east anglian grooms we did the nine miles in something less than an hour and pulled up before the lodgegates just as the church clock was striking halfpast seven a couple of minutes more and the warm glow of the lighted hall was flooding out upon the gravel a hearty grasp was on my hand and a clear jovial voice was bidding me welcome to dumbleton and now my dear fellow said my host when the first greeting was over you have no time to spare we dine at eight and there are people coming to meet you so you must just get the dressing business over as quickly as may be by the way you will meet some acquaintances the biddulphs are coming and prendergast prendergast of the skirmishers is staying in the house adieu mrs jelf will be expecting you in the drawingroom i was ushered to my room not the blue room of which mr dwerrihouse had made disagreeable experience but a pretty little bachelors chamber hung with a delicate chintz and made cheerful by a blazing fire i unlocked my portmanteau i tried to be expeditious but the memory of my railway adventure haunted me i could not get free of it i could not shake it off it impeded me worried me it tripped me up it caused me to mislay my studs to mistie my cravat to wrench the buttons off my gloves worst of all it made me so late that the party had all assembled before i reached the drawingroom i had scarcely paid my respects to mrs jelf when dinner was announced and we paired off some eight or ten couples strong into the diningroom i am not going to describe either the guests or the dinner all provincial parties bear the strictest family resemblance and i am not aware that an east anglian banquet offers any exception to the rule there was the usual country baronet and his wife there were the usual country parsons and their wives there was the sempiternal turkey and haunch of venison vanitas vanitatum there is nothing new under the sun i was placed about midway down the table i had taken one rectors wife down to dinner and i had another at my left hand they talked across me and their talk was about babies it was dreadfully dull at length there came a pause the entrees had just been removed and the turkey had come upon the scene the conversation had all along been of the languidest but at this moment it happened to have stagnated altogether jelf was carving the turkey mrs jelf looked as if she was trying to think of something to say everybody else was silent moved by an unlucky impulse i thought i would relate my adventure by the way jelf i began i came down part of the way today with a friend of yours indeed said the master of the feast slicing scientifically into the breast of the turkey with whom pray with one who bade me tell you that he should if possible pay you a visit before christmas i cannot think who that could be said my friend smiling it must be major thorp suggested mrs jelf i shook my head it was not major thorp i replied it was a near relation of your own mrs jelf then i am more puzzled than ever rep my hostess pray tell me who it was it was no less a person than your cousin mr john dwerrihouse jonathan jelf laid down his knife and fork mrs jelf looked at me in a strange startled way and said never a word and he desired me to tell you my dear madam that you need not take the trouble to burn the hall down in his honour this time but only to have the chimney of the blue room swept before his arrival before i had reached the end of my sentence i became aware of something ominous in the faces of the guests i felt i had said something which i had better have left unsaid and that for some unexplained reason my words had evoked a general consternation i sat confounded not daring to utter another syllable and for at least two whole minutes there was dead silence round the table then captain prendergast came to the rescue you have been abroad for some months have you not mr langford he said with the desperation of one who flings himself into the breach i heard you had been to russia surely you have something to tell us of the state and temper of the country after the war i was heartily grateful to the gallant skirmisher for this diversion in my favour i answered him i fear somewhat lamely but he kept the conversation up and presently one or two others joined in and so the difficulty whatever it might have been was bridged over bridged over but not repaired a something an awkwardness a visible constraint remained the guests hitherto had been simply dull but now they were evidently uncomfortable and embarrassed the dessert had scarcely been placed upon the table when the ladies left the room i seized the opportunity to select a vacant chair next captain prendergast in heavens name i whispered what was the matter just now what had i said you mentioned the name of john dwerrihouse what of that i had seen him not two hours before it is a most astounding circumstance that you should have seen him said captain prendergast are you sure it was he as sure as of my own identity we were talking all the way between london and blackwater but why does that surprise you because replied captain prendergast dropping his voice to the lowest whisper because john dwerrihouse absconded three months ago with seventyfive thousand pounds of the companys money and has never been heard of since john dwerrihouse had absconded three months ago and i had seen him only a few hours back john dwerrihouse had embezzled seventyfive thousand pounds of the companys money yet told me that he carried that sum upon his person were ever facts so strangely incongruous so difficult to reconcile how should he have ventured again into the light of day how dared he show himself along the line above all what had he been doing throughout those mysterious three months of disappearance perplexing questions these questions which at once suggested themselves to the minds of all concerned but which admitted of no easy solution i could find no reply to them captain prendergast had not even a suggestion to offer jonathan jelf who seized the first opportunity of drawing me aside and learning all that i had to tell was more amazed and bewildered than either of us he came to my room that night when all the guests were gone and we talked the thing over from every point of view without it must be confessed arriving at any kind of conclusion i do not ask you he said whether you can have mistaken your man that is impossible as impossible as that i should mistake some stranger for yourself it is not a question of looks or voice but of facts that he should have alluded to the fire in the blue room is proof enough of john dwerrihouses identity how did he look older i thought considerably older paler and more anxious he has had enough to make him look anxious anyhow said my friend gloomily be he innocent or guilty i am inclined to believe that he is innocent i replied he showed no embarrassment when i addressed him and no uneasiness when the guard came round his conversation was open to a fault i might almost say that he talked too freely of the business which he had in hand that again is strange for i know no one more reticent on such subjects he actually told you that he had the seventyfive thousand pounds in his pocket he did humph my wife has an idea about it and she may be right what idea well she fancies women are so clever you know at putting themselves inside peoples motives she fancies that he was tempted that he did actually take the money and that he has been concealing himself these three months in some wild part of the country struggling possibly with his conscience all the time and daring neither to abscond with his booty nor to come back and restore it but now that he has come back that is the point she conceives that he has probably thrown himself upon the companys mercy made restitution of the money and being forgiven is permitted to carry the business through as if nothing whatever had happened the last i replied is an impossible case mrs jelf thinks like a generous and delicate minded woman but not in the least like a board of railway directors they would never carry forgiveness so far i fear not and yet it is the only conjecture that bears a semblance of likelihood however we can run over to clayborough tomorrow and see if anything is to be learned by the way prendergast tells me you picked up his cigarcase i did so and here it is jelf took the cigarcase examined it by the light of the lamp and said at once that it was beyond doubt mr dwerrihouses property and that he remembered to have seen him use it here too is his monogram on the side he added a big j transfixing a capital d he used to carry the same on his notepaper it offers at all events a proof that i was not dreaming ay but it is time you were asleep and dreaming now i am ashamed to have kept you up so long goodnight goodnight and remember that i am more than ready to go with you to clayborough or blackwater or london or anywhere if i can be of the least service thanks i know you mean it old friend and it may be that i shall put you to the test once more goodnight so we parted for that night and met again in the breakfastroom at halfpast eight next morning it was a hurried silent uncomfortable meal none of us had slept well and all were thinking of the same subject mrs jelf had evidently been crying jelf was impatient to be off and both captain prendergast and myself felt ourselves to be in the painful position of outsiders who are involuntarily brought into a domestic trouble within twenty minutes after we had left the breakfasttable the dogcart was brought round and my friend and i were on the road to clayborough tell you what it is langford he said as we sped along between the wintry hedges i do not much fancy to bring up dwerrihouses name at clayborough all the officials know that he is my wifes relation and the subject just now is hardly a pleasant one if you dont much mind we will make the to blackwater its an important station and we shall stand a far better chance of picking up information there than at clayborough so we took the which happened to be an express and arriving at blackwater about a quarter before twelve proceeded at once to prosecute our inquiry we began by asking for the stationmaster a big blunt businesslike person who at once averred that he knew mr john dwerrihouse perfectly well and that there was no director on the line whom he had seen and spoken to so frequently he used to be down here two or three times a week about three months ago said he when the new line was first set afoot but since then you know gentlemen he paused significantly jelf flushed scarlet yes yes he said hurriedly we know all about that the point now to be ascertained is whether anything has been seen or heard of him lately not to my knowledge replied the stationmaster he is not known to have been down the line any time yesterday for instance the stationmaster shook his head the east anglian sir said he is about the last place where he would dare to show himself why there isnt a stationmaster there isnt guard there isnt a porter who doesnt know mr dwerrihouse by sight as well as he knows his own face in the lookingglass or who wouldnt telegraph for the police as soon as he had set eyes on him at any point along the line bless you sir theres been a standing order out against him ever since the th of september last and yet pursued my friend a gentleman who travelled down yesterday from london to clayborough by the afternoon express testifies that he saw mr dwerrihouse in the train and that mr dwerrihouse alighted at blackwater station quite impossible sir replied the stationmaster promptly why impossible because there is no station along the line where he is so well known or where he would run so great a risk it would be just running his head into the lions mouth he would have been mad to come nigh blackwater station and if he had come he would have been en arrested before he left the platform can you tell me who took the blackwater tickets of that train i can sir it was the guard benjamin somers and where can i find him you can find him sir by staying here if you please till one oclock he will be coming through with the up express from crampton which stays in blackwater for ten minutes we waited for the up express beguiling the time as best we could by strolling along the blackwater road till we came almost to the outskirts of the town from which the station was distant nearly a couple of miles by one oclock we were back again upon the platform and waiting for the train it came punctually and i at once recognised the ruddyfaced guard who had gone down with my train the evening before the gentlemen want to ask you something about mr dwerrihouse somers said the stationmaster by way of introduction the guard flashed a keen glance from my face to jelfs and back again to mine mr john dwerrihouse the late director said he interrogatively the same replied my friend should you know him if you saw him anywhere sir do you know if he was in the express yesterday afternoon he was not sir how can you answer so positively because i looked into every carriage and saw every face in that train and i could take my oath that mr dwerrihouse was not in it this gentleman was he added turning sharply upon me i dont know that i ever saw him before in my life but i remember his face perfectly you nearly missed taking your seat in time at this station sir and you got out at clayborough quite true guard i replied but do you not remember the face of the gentleman who travelled down in the same carriage with me as far as here it was my impression sir that you travelled down alone said somers with a look of some surprise by no means i had a fellowtraveller as far as blackwater and it was in trying to restore him the cigarcase which he had dropped in the carriage that i so nearly let you go on without me i remember your saying something about a cigarcase certainly replied the guard but you asked for my ticket just before we entered station i did sir then you must have seen him he sat in the corner next the very door to which you came no indeed i saw no one i looked at jelf i began to think the guard was in the exdirectors confidence and paid for his silence if i had seen another traveller i should have asked for his ticket added somers did you see me ask for his ticket sir i observed that you did not ask for it but he explained that by saying i hesitated i feared i might be telling too much and so broke off abruptly the guard and the stationmaster exchanged glances the former looked impatiently at his watch i am obliged to go on in four minutes more sir he said one last question then interposed jelf with a sort of desperation if this gentlemans fellow traveller had been mr john dwerrihouse and he had been sitting in the corner next the door in which you took the tickets could you have failed to see and recognise him no sir it would have been quite impossible and you are certain you did not see him as i said before sir i could take my oath i did not see him and if it wasnt that i dont like to contradict a gentleman i would say i could also take my oath that this gentlemen was quite alone in the carriage the whole way from london to clayborough why sir he added dropping his voice so as to be inaudible to the stationmaster who had been called away to speak to some person close by you expressly asked me to give you a compartment to yourself and i did so i locked you in and you were so good as to give me something for myself yes but mr dwerrihouse had a key of his own i never saw him sir i saw no one in that compartment but yourself beg pardon sir my times up and with this the ruddy guard touched his cap and was gone in another minute the heavy panting of the engine began afresh and the train glided slowly out of the station we looked at each other for some moments in silence i was the first to speak mr benjamin somers knows more than he chooses to tell i said humph do you think so it must be he could not have come to the door without seeing him its impossible there is one thing not impossible my dear fellow what is that that you may have fallen asleep and dreamed the whole thing could i dream of a branch line that i had never heard of could i dream of a hundred and one business details that had no kind of interest for me could i dream of the seventyfive thousand pounds perhaps you might have seen or heard some vague account of the affair while you were abroad it might have made no impression upon you at the time and might have come back to you in your dreams recalled perhaps by the mere names of the stations on the line what about the fire in the chimney of the blue room should i have heard of that during my journey well no i admit there is a difficulty about that point and what about the cigarcase ay by jove there is the cigarcase that is a stubborn fact well its a mysterious affair and it will need a better detective than myself i fancy to clear it up i suppose we may as well go home a week had not gone by when i received a letter from the secretary of the east anglian railway company requesting the favour of my attendance at a special board meeting not then many days distant no reasons were alleged and no apologies offered for this demand upon my time but they had heard it was clear of my inquiries anent the missing director and had a mind to put me through some sort of official examination upon the subject being still a guest at dumbleton hall i had to go up to london for the purpose and jonathan jelf accompanied me i found the direction of the great east anglian line represented by a party of some twelve or fourteen gentlemen seated in solemn conclave round a huge green baize table in a gloomy board room adjoining the london terminus being courteously received by the chairman who at once began by saying that certain statements of mine respecting mr john dwerrihouse had come to the knowledge of the direction and that they in consequence desired to confer with me on those points we were placed at the table and the inquiry proceeded in due form i was first asked if i knew mr john dwerrihouse how long i had been acquainted with him and whether i could identify him at sight i was then asked when i had seen him last to which i replied on the th of this present month december then came the inquiry of where i had seen him on that fourth day of december to which i replied that i met him in a firstclass compartment of the down express that he got in just as the train was leaving the london terminus and that he alighted at blackwater station the chairman then inquired whether i had held any communication with my fellowtraveller whereupon i related as nearly as i could remember it the whole bulk and substance of mr john dwerrihouses diffuse information respecting the new branch line to all this the board listened with profound attention while the chairman presided and the secretary took notes i then produced the cigarcase it was passed from hand to hand and recognised by all there was not a man present who did not remember that plain cigarcase with its silver monogram or to whom it seemed anything less entirely corroborative of my evidence when at length i had told all that i had to tell the chairman whispered something to the secretary the secretary touched a silver handbell and the guard benjamin somers was ushered into the room he was then examined as carefully as myself he declared that he knew mr john dwerrihouse perfectly well that he could not be mistaken in him that he remembered going down with the express on the afternoon in question that he remembered me and that there being one or two empty firstclass compartments on that especial afternoon he had in compliance with my request placed me in a carriage by myself he was positive that i remained alone in that compartment all the way from london to clayborough he was ready to take his oath that dwerrihouse was neither in that carriage with me nor in any compartment of that train he remembered distinctly to have examined my ticket to blackwater was certain that there was no one else at that time in the carriage could not have failed to observe a second person if there had been one had that second person been mr john dwerrihouse should have quietly doublelocked the door of the carriage and have at once given information to the blackwater stationmaster so clear so decisive so ready was somers with this testimony that the board looked fairly puzzled you hear this persons statement mr langford said the chairman it contradicts yours in every particular what have you to say in reply i can only repeat what i said before i am quite as positive of the truth of my own assertions as mr somers can be of the truth of his you say that mr dwerrihouse alighted in blackwater and that he was in possession of a private key are you sure that he had not alighted by means of that key before the guard came round for the tickets i am quite positive that he did not leave the carriage till the train had fairly entered the station and the other blackwater passengers alighted i even saw that he was met there by a friend indeed did you see that person distinctly quite distinctly can you describe his appearance i think so he was short and very slight sandyhaired with a bushy moustache and beard and he wore a closely fitting suit of gray tweed his age i should take to be about thirtyeight or forty did mr dwerrihouse leave the station in this persons company i cannot tell i saw them walking together down the platform and then i saw them standing inside under a gasjet talking earnestly after that i lost sight of them quite suddenly and just then my train went on and i with it the chairman and secretary conferred together in an undertone the directors whispered to one another one or two looked suspiciously at the guard i could see that my evidence remained unshaken and that like myself they suspected some complicity between the guard and the defaulter how far did you conduct that express on the day in question somers asked the chairman all through sir replied the guard from london to crampton how was it that you were not relieved at clayborough i thought there was always a change of guards at clayborough there used to be sir till the new regulations came in force last midsummer since when the guards in charge of express trains go the whole way through the chairman turned to the secretary i think it would be as well he said if we had the daybook to refer to upon this point again the secretary touched the silver handbell and desired the porter in attendance to summon mr raikes from a word or two dropped by another of the directors i gathered that mr raikes was one of the undersecretaries he came a small slight sandyhaired keeneyed man with an eager nervous manner and a forest of light beard and moustache he just showed himself at the door of the board room and being requested to bring a certain daybook from a certain shelf in a certain room bowed and vanished he was there such a moment and the surprise of seeing him was so great and sudden that it was not till the door had closed upon him that i found voice to speak he was no sooner gone however than i sprang to my feet that person i said is the same who met mr dwerrihouse upon the platform at blackwater there was a general movement of surprise the chairman looked grave and somewhat agitated take care mr langford he said take care what you say i am as positive of his identity as of my own do you consider the consequences of your words do you consider that you are bringing a charge of the gravest character against one of the companys servants i am willing to be put upon my oath if necessary the man who came to that door a minute since is the same whom i saw talking with mr dwerrihouse on the blackwater platform were he twenty times the companys servant i could say neither more nor less the chairman turned again to the guard did you see mr raikes in the train or on the platform he asked somers shook his head i am confident mr raikes was not in the train he said and i certainly did not see him on the platform the chairman turned next to the secretary mr raikes is in your office mr hunter he said can you remember if he was absent on the th instant i do not think he was replied the secretary but i am not prepared to speak positively i have been away most afternoons myself lately and mr raikes might easily have absented himself if he had been disposed at this moment the undersecretary returned with the daybook under his arm be pleased to refer mr raikes said the chairman to the entries of the th instant and see what benjamin somerss duties were on that day mr raikes threw open the cumbrous volume and ran a practised eye and finger down some three or four successive columns of entries stopping suddenly at the foot of a page he then read aloud that benjamin somers had on that day conducted the express from london to crampton the chairman leaned forward in his seat looked the undersecretary full in the face and said quite sharply and suddenly where were you mr raikes on the same afternoon i sir you mr raikes where were you on the afternoon and evening of the th of the present month here sir in mr hunters office where else should i be there was a dash of trepidation in the undersecretarys voice as he said this but his look of surprise was natural enough we have some reason for believing mr raikes that you were absent that afternoon without leave was this the case certainly not sir i have not had a days holiday since september mr hunter will bear me out in this mr hunter repeated what he had previously said on the subject but added that the clerks in the adjoining office would be certain to know whereupon the senior clerk a grave middleaged person in green glasses was summoned and interrogated his testimony cleared the undersecretary at once he declared that mr raikes had in no instance to his knowledge been absent during office hours since his return from his annual holiday in september i was confounded the chairman turned to me with a smile in which a shade of covert annoyance was scarcely apparent you hear mr langford he said i hear sir but my conviction remains unshaken i fear mr langford that your convictions are very insufficiently based replied the chairman with a doubtful cough i fear that you dream dreams and mistake them for actual occurrences it is a dangerous habit of mind and might lead to dangerous results mr raikes here would have found himself in an unpleasant position had he not proved so satisfactory an alibi i was about to reply but he gave me no time i think gentlemen he went on to say addressing the board that we should be wasting time to push this inquiry further mr langfords evidence would seem to be of an equal value throughout the testimony of benjamin somers disproves his first statement and the testimony of the last witness disproves his second i think we may conclude that mr langford fell asleep in the train on the occasion of his journey to clayborough and dreamed an unusually vivid and circumstantial dream of which however we have now heard quite enough there are few things more annoying than to find ones positive convictions met with incredulity i could not help feeling impatience at the turn that affairs had taken i was not proof against the civil sarcasm of the chairmans manner most intolerable of all however was the quiet smile lurking about the corners of benjamin somerss mouth and the halftriumphant halfmalicious gleam in the eyes of the undersecretary the man was evidently puzzled and somewhat alarmed his looks seemed furtively to interrogate me who was i what did i want why had i come there to do him an ill turn with his employers what was it to me whether or no he was absent without leave seeing all this and perhaps more irritated by it than the thing deserved i begged leave to detain the attention of the board for a moment longer jelf plucked me impatiently by the sleeve better let the thing drop he whispered the chairmans right enough you dreamed it and the less said now the better i was not to be silenced however in this fashion i had yet something to say and i would say it it was to this effect that dreams were not usually productive of tangible results and that i requested to know in what way the chairman conceived i had evolved from my dream so substantial and wellmade a delusion as the cigarcase which i had had the honour to place before him at the commencement of our interview the cigarcase i admit mr langford the chairman replied is a very strong point in your evidence it is your only strong point however and there is just a possibility that we may all be misled by a mere accidental resemblance will you permit me to see the case again it is unlikely i said as i handed it to him that any other should bear precisely this monogram and yet be in all other particulars exactly similar the chairman examined it for a moment in silence and then passed it to mr hunter mr hunter turned it over and over and shook his head this is no mere resemblance he said it is john dwerrihouses cigarcase to a certainty i remember it perfectly i have seen it a hundred times i believe i may say the same added the chairman yet how account for the way in which mr langford asserts that it came into his possession i can only repeat i replied that i found it on the floor of the carriage after mr dwerrihouse had alighted it was in leaning out to look after him that i trod upon it and it was in running after him for the purpose of restoring it that i saw or believed i saw mr raikes standing aside with him in earnest conversation again i felt jonathan jelf plucking at my sleeve look at raikes he whispered look at raikes i turned to where the undersecretary had been standing a moment before and saw him white as death with lips trembling and livid stealing toward the door to conceive a sudden strange and indefinite suspicion to fling myself in his way to take him by the shoulders as if he were a child and turn his craven face perforce toward the board were with me the work of an instant look at him i exclaimed look at his face i ask no better witness to the truth of my words the chairmans brow darkened mr raikes he said sternly if you know anything you had better speak vainly trying to wrench himself from my grasp the undersecretary stammered out an incoherent denial let me go he said i know nothing you have no right to detain me let me go did you or did you not meet mr john dwerrihouse at blackwater station the charge brought against you is either true or false if true you will do well to throw yourself upon the mercy of the board and make full confession of all that you know the undersecretary wrung his hands in an agony of helpless terror i was away he cried i was two hundred miles away at the time i know nothing about it i have nothing to confess i am innocent i call god to witness i am innocent two hundred miles away echoed the chairman what do you mean i was in devonshire i had three weeks leave of absence i appeal to mr hunter mr hunter knows i had three weeks leave of absence i was in devonshire all the time i can prove i was in devonshire seeing him so abject so incoherent so wild with apprehension the directors began to whisper gravely among themselves while one got quietly up and called the porter to guard the door what has your being in devonshire to do with the matter said the chairman when were you in devonshire mr raikes took his leave in september said the secretary about the time when mr dwerrihouse disappeared i never even heard that he had disappeared till i came back that must remain to be proved said the chairman i shall at once put this matter in the hands of the police in the meanwhile mr raikes being myself a magistrate and used to deal with these cases i advise you to offer no resistance but to confess while confession may yet do you service as for your accomplice the frightened wretch fell upon his knees i had no accomplice he cried only have mercy upon me only spare my life and i will confess all i didnt mean to harm him i didnt mean to hurt a hair of his head only have mercy upon me and let me go the chairman rose in his place pale and agitated good heavens he exclaimed what horrible mystery is this what does it mean as sure as there is a god in heaven said jonathan jelf it means that murder has been done no no no shrieked raikes still upon his knees and cowering like a beaten hound not murder no jury that ever sat could bring it in murder i thought i had only stunned him i never meant to do more than stun him manslaughtermanslaughter not murder overcome by the horror of this unexpected revelation the chairman covered his face with his hand and for a moment or two remained silent miserable man he said at length you have betrayed yourself you bade me confess you urged me to throw myself upon the mercy of the board you have confessed to a crime which no one suspected you of having committed replied the chairman and which this board has no power either to punish or forgive all that i can do for you it to advise you to submit to the law to plead guilty and to conceal nothing when did you do this deed the guilty man rose to his feet and leaned heavily against the table his answer came reluctantly like the speech of one dreaming on the d of september on the d of september i looked in jonathan jelfs face and he in mine i felt my own smiling with a strange sense of wonder and dread i saw his blanch suddenly even to the lips merciful heaven he whispered what was it then that you saw in the train what was it that i saw in the train that question remains unanswered to this day i have never been able to reply to it i only know that it bore the living likeness of the murdered man whose body had then been lying some ten weeks under a rough pile of branches and brambles and rotting leaves at the bottom of a deserted chalkpit about halfway between blackwater and mallingford i know that it spoke and moved and looked as that man spoke and moved and looked in life that i heard or seemed to hear things revealed which i could never otherwise have learned that i was guided as it were by that vision on the platform to the identification of the murderer and that a passive instrument myself i was destined by means of these mysterious teachings to bring about the ends of justice for these things i have never been able to account as for that matter of the cigarcase it proved on inquiry that the carriage in which i travelled down that afternoon to clayborough had not been in use for several weeks and was in point of fact the same in which poor john dwerrihouse had performed his last journey the case had doubtless been dropped by him and had lain unnoticed till i found it upon the details of the murder i have no need to dwell those who desire more ample particulars may find them and the written confession of augustus raikes in the files of the times for enough that the undersecretary knowing the history of the new line and following the negotiation step by step through all its stages determined to waylay mr dwerrihouse rob him of the seventyfive thousand pounds and escape to america with his booty in order to effect these ends he obtained leave of absence a few days before the time appointed for the payment of the money secured his passage across the atlantic in a steamer advertised to start on the d provided himself with a heavily loaded lifepreserver and went down to blackwater to await the arrival of his victim how he met him on the platform with a pretended message from the board how he offered to conduct him by a short cut across the fields to mallingford how having brought him to a lonely place he struck him down with the lifepreserver and so killed him and how finding what he had done he dragged the body to the verge of an outoftheway chalkpit and there flung it in and piled it over with branches and brambles are facts still fresh in the memories of those who like the connoisseurs in de quinceys famous essay regard murder as a fine art strangely enough the murderer having done his work was afraid to leave the country he declared that he had not intended to take the directors life but only to stun and rob him and that finding the blow had killed he dared not fly for fear of drawing down suspicion upon his own head as a mere robber he would have been safe in the states but as a murderer he would inevitably have been pursued and given up to justice so he forfeited his passage returned to the office as usual at the end of his leave and locked up his illgotten thousands till a more convenient opportunity in the meanwhile he had the satisfaction of finding that mr dwerrihouse was universally believed to have absconded with the money no one knew how or whither whether he meant murder or not however mr augustus raikes paid the full penalty of his crime and was hanged at the old bailey in the second week in january those who desire to make his further acquaintance may see him any day admirably done in wax in the chamber of horrors at madame tussauds exhibition in baker street he is there to be found in the midst of a select society of ladies and gentlemen of atrocious memory dressed in the closecut tweed suit which he wore on the evening of the murder and holding in his hand the identical lifepreserve with which he committed it the wrong black bag by angelo lewis it was the eve of good friday within the modest parlour of no primrose terrace a little man wearing a gray felt hat and a red necktie stood admiring himself in the lookingglass over the mantelpiece such a state of things anywhere else would have had no significance whatever but circumstances proverbially alter cases at primrose terrace it approached the dimensions of a portent not to keep the reader in suspense the little man was benjamin quelch clerk in the office of messrs cobble clink coal merchants and he was about to carry out a desperate resolution most men have some secret ambition benjamins was twofold for years he had yearned to wear a soft felt hat and to make a trip to paris and for years fate in the person of mrs quelch had stood in the way and prevented the indulgence of his longing quelch being as we have hinted exceptionally small of stature had in accordance with mysterious law of opposites selected the largest lady of his acquaintance as the partner of his joys he himself was of a meek and retiring disposition mrs quelch on the other hand was a woman of stern and decided temperament with strong views upon most subjects she administered benjamins finances regulated his diet and prescribed for him when his health was out order though fond of him in her own way she ruled him with a rod of iron and on three points she was inflexible to make up for his insignificance of stature she insisted on his wearing the tallest hat that money could procure to the exclusion of all other headgear secondly on the ground that it looked more professional she would allow him none but black silk neckties and lastly she would not let him smoke she had further an intense repugnance to all things foreign holding as an article of faith that no good thing whether in art cookery or morals was to be found on other than english soil when benjamin once in a rash moment suggested a trip to boulogne by way of summer holiday the suggestion was received in a manner that took away his appetite for a week afterward the prohibition of smoking quelch did not much mind for having in his salad days made trial of a cheap cigar the result somehow satisfies him that tobacco was not in his line and he ceased to yearn for it accordingly but the tall hat and the black necktie were constant sources of irritation he had an idea based on his having once won a drawing prize at school that nature had intended him for an artist and he secretly lamented the untoward fate which had thrown him away upon coals now the few artists benjamin had chanced to meet affected a soft and slouchy style of headgear and a considerable amount of freedom generally with a touch of colour in the region of the neck such therefore in the fitness of things should have been the hat and such the neckgear of benjamin quelch and the veto of his wife only made him yearn for them the more intensely in later years he had been seized with a longing to see paris it chanced that a clerk in the same office one peter flipp had made one of a personally conducted party on a visit to the gay city the cost of the trip had been but five guineas but never surely were five guineas so magnificently invested there was a good deal of romance about flipp and it may be that his accounts were not entirely trustworthy but they so fired the imagination of our friend benjamin that he had at once begun to hoard up surreptitious sixpences with the hope that some day he too might by some unforeseen combination of circumstances be enabled to visit the enchanted city and at last that day had come mrs quelch her three children and her one domestic had gone to lowestoft for an easter outing benjamin and a deaf charwoman mrs widger being left in charge of the family belongings benjamins easter holidays were limited to good friday and easter monday and as it seemed hardly worth while that he should travel so far as lowestoft for such short periods mrs quelch had thoughtfully arranged that he should spend the former day at the british museum and the latter at the zoological gardens two days after her departure however mr cobble called quelch into his private office and told him that if he liked he might for once take holiday from the friday to the tuesday inclusive and join his wife at the seaside quelch accepted the boon with an honest intention of employing it as suggested indeed he had even begun a letter to his wife announcing the pleasing intelligence and had got as far as my dear penelope when a wild and wicked thought struck him why should he not spend his unexpected holiday in paris laying down his pen he opened his desk and counted his secret hoard it amounted to five pounds seventeen twelve shillings more than flipps outlay there was no difficulty in that direction and nobody would be any the wiser his wife would imagine that he was in london while his employers would believe him to be at lowestoft there was a brief struggle in his mind but the tempter prevailed and with a courage worthy of a better cause he determined to risk it and go and thus it came to pass that on the evening of our story benjamin quelch having completed his packing which merely comprised what he was accustomed to call his night things neatly bestowed in a small black handbag belonging to mrs quelch stood before the lookingglass and contemplated his guilty splendour the red necktie and the soft gray felt hat purchased out of surplus funds he had expended a couple of guineas in a secondclass return ticket and another two pounds in coupons entitling him to bed breakfast and dinner for five days at certain specified hotels in paris this outlay with half a crown for a pair of gloves and a bribe of five shillings to secure the silence of mrs widger left him with little more than a pound in hand but this small surplus would no doubt amply suffice for his modest needs his only regret as he gazed at himself in the glass was that he had not had time to grow a moustache the one thing needed to complete his artistic appearance but time was fleeting and he dared not linger over the enticing picture he stole along the passage and softly opened the street door as he did so a sudden panic came over him and he felt half inclined to abandon his rash design but as he wavered he caught sight of the detested tall hat hanging up in the passage and he hesitated no longer he passed out and closing the door behind him started at a brisk pace for victoria station his plans had been laid with much ingenuity though at a terrible sacrifice of his usual straightforwardness he had written a couple of letters to mrs quelch to be posted by mrs widger on appropriate days giving imaginary accounts of his visits to the british museum and zoological gardens with pointed allusions to the behavior of the elephant and other circumstantial particulars to insure the posting of these in proper order he had marked the dates in pencil on the envelopes in the corner usually occupied by the postagestamp so that when the latter was affixed the figures would be concealed he explained the arrangement to mrs widger who promised that his instructions should be faithfully carried out after a sharp walk he reached the railwaystation and in due course found himself steaming across the channel to dieppe the passage was not especially rough but to poor quelch unaccustomed as he was to the sea it seemed as if the boat must go to the bottom every moment to the bodily pains of seasickness were added the mental pains of remorse and between the two he reached dieppe more dead than alive indeed he would almost have welcomed death as a release from his sufferings even when the boat had arrived at the pier he still remained in the berth he had occupied all night and would probably have continued to lie there had not the steward lifted him by main force to his feet he seized his black bag with a groan and staggered on deck here he felt a little better but new terrors seized him at the sight of the goldlaced officials and bluebloused porters who lined each side of the gangway all talking at the top of their voices and in tones which seemed to his unaccustomed ear to convey a thirst for british blood no sooner had he landed than he was accosted by a ferociouslooking personage in truth a harmless customhouse officer who asked him in french whether he had anything to declare and made a movement to take his bag in order to mark it as passed quelch jumped to the conclusion that the stranger was a brigand bent on depriving him of his property and he held on to the bag with such tenacity that the douanier naturally inferred there was something specially contraband about it he proceeded to open it and produced among sundry other feminine belongings a ladys frilled and furbelowed nightdress from which as he unrolled it fell a couple of bundles of cigars benjamins look of astonishment as he saw these unexpected articles produced from his handbag was interpreted by the officials as a look of guilt as a matter of fact half stupefied by the agonies of the night he had forgotten the precise spot where he had left his own bag and had picked up in its stead one belonging to the wife of a sporting gentleman on his way to some races at longchamps desiring to smuggle a few weeds and deeming that the presence of such articles would be less likely to be suspected among a ladys belongings the sporting gentleman had committed them to his companions keeping handbags as a rule are passed unopened and such would probably have been the case in the present instance had not quelchs look of panic excited suspicion the real owners of the bag had picked up quelchs which it precisely resembled and were close behind him on the gangway the lady uttered an exclamation of dismay as she saw the contents of her bag spread abroad by the customs officer but was promptly silenced by her husband keep your blessed tongue quiet he whispered if a bloomin idiot chooses to sneak our bag and then to give himself away to the first man that looks at him he must stand the racket whereupon the sporting gentleman and lady first taking a quiet peep into benjamins bag to make sure that it contained nothing compromising passed the examiner with a smile of conscious innocence and after an interval for refreshment at the buffet took their seats in the train for paris meanwhile poor quelch was taken before a pompous individual with an extra large moustache and a double allowance of gold lace on his cap and charged not only with defrauding the revenue but with forcibly resisting an officer in the execution of his duty the accusation being in french quelch did not understand a word of it and in his ignorance took it for granted that he was accused of stealing the strange bag and its contents visions of imprisonment penal servitude nay even capital punishment floated before his bewildered brain finally the official with the large moustache made a speech to him in french setting forth that for his dishonest attempt to smuggle he must pay a fine of a hundred francs with regard to the assault on the official as said official was not much hurt he graciously agreed to throw that in and make no charge for it when he had fully explained matters to his own satisfaction he waited to receive the answer of the prisoner but none was forthcoming for the best of reasons it finally dawned on the official that quelch might not understand french and he therefore proceeded to address him in what he considered to be his native tongue you smoggle smoggle seegar zen it must zat you pay amende hundred francs you me understand hundred francs pay pay pay at each repetition of the last word he brought down a dirty fist into the palm of the opposite hand immediately under quelchs nose hundred francs engleesh money four pound quelch caught the last words and was relieved to find that it was merely a money payment that was demanded of him but he was little better off for having but a few shillings in his pocket to pay four pounds was as much out of his power as if it had been four hundred he determined to appeal to the mercy of his captors not got he said apologetically with a vague idea that by speaking very elementary english he came somehow nearer to french that all he continued producing his little store and holding it out beseechingly to the official pas assez not enouf growled the latter quelch tried again in all his pockets but only succeeded in finding another threepenny piece the officer shook his head and after a brief discussion with his fellows said commentvous appelezvous monsieur how do you call yourself with a vague idea of keeping his disgrace from his friends quelch rashly determined to give a false name if he had had a few minutes to think it over he would have invented one for the occasion but his imagination was not accustomed to such sudden calls and on the question being repeated he desperately gave the name of his nextdoor neighbour mr henry fladgate henri flodgett repeated the officer as he wrote it down et vous demeurez you live where and quelch proceeded to give the address of mr fladgate primrose terrace tres bien i send telegrramme au violon and poor benjamin was ignominiously marched to the local police station meanwhile quelchs arrangements at home were scarcely working as he had intended the estimable mrs widger partly by reason of her deafness and partly of native stupidity had only half understood his instructions about the letters she knew she was to stamp them and she knew she was to post them but the dates in the corners might have been runic inscriptions for any idea they conveyed to her obfuscated intellect accordingly the first time she visited her usual house of call which was early on the morning of good friday she proceeded in her own language to get the dratted things off her mind by dropping them both into the nearest pillarbox on the following day therefore mrs quelch at lawestoft was surprised to find on the breakfasttable two letters in her benjamins handwriting her surprise was still greater when on opening them she found one to be a graphic account of a visit to the zoological gardens on the following monday the conclusion was obvious either benjamin had turned prophet and had somehow got ahead of the almanac or he was carrying on in some very underhand manner mrs quelch decided for the latter alternative and determined to get to the bottom of the matter at once she cut a sandwich put on her bonnet and grasping her umbrella in a manner which boded no good to any one who stayed her progress started by the next train for liverpool street on reaching home she extracted from the weeping widger who had just been spending the last of benjamins five shillings and was far gone in depression and gin and water that her good gentleman had not been home since thursday night this was bad enough but there was still more conclusive evidence that he was up to no good in the shape of his tall hat which hung silent accuser on the last peg in the passage having pumped mrs widger till there was no more save tears to be pumped out of her mrs quelch still firmly grasping her umbrella proceeded next door on the chance that her neighbour mrs fladgate might be able to give her some information she found mrs fladgate weeping in the parlour with an open telegram before her being a woman who did not stand upon ceremony she read the telegram which was dated from dieppe and ran as follows monsieur fladgate here detained for to have smuggle cigars fine to pay one hundred franc send money and he will be release oh the men the men ejaculated mrs quelch as she dropped into an armchair theyre all alike first benjamin and now fladgate i shouldnt wonder if they had gone off together you dont mean to say mr quelch has gone too sobbed mrs fladgate he has taken a shameful advantage of my absence he has not been home since thursday evening and his hat is hanging up in the hall you dont think he has been mmmurdered im not afraid of that replied mrs quelch it wouldnt be worth anybodys while but what has he got on his head thats what i want to know of course if hes with mr fladgate in some foreign den of iniquity that accounts for it dont foreigners wear hats inquired mrs fladgate innocently not the respectable english sort ill bet bound replied mrs quelch some outlandish rubbish i dare say but i thought mr fladgate on his scotch journey mr fladgate it should be stated was a traveller in the oil and colour line so he is i mean so he ought to be in fact i expected him home today but now hes in ppprison and i may never see him any mmomore and mrs fladgate wept afresh stuff and nonsense retorted mrs quelch youve only to send the money they ask for and theyll be glad enough to get rid of him but i wouldnt hurry id let him wait a bit youll see him soon enough never fear the prophecy was fulfilled sooner than the prophet expected scarcely were the words out of her mouth when a cab was heard to draw up at the door and a moment later fladgate himself a big jovial man wearing a white hat very much on one side entered the room and threw a bundle of rugs on the sofa home again old girl and glad of it mornin mrs quelch said the newcomer mrs fladgate gazed at him doubtfully for a moment and then flung her arms round his neck ejaculating saved saved martha said mrs quelch reprovingly have you no selfrespect is this the way you deal to so shameful a deception then turning the supposed offender so mr fladgate you have escaped from your foreign prison foreign how much have you both gone dotty ladies ive just escaped from a thirdclass carriage on the london and northwestern the space is limited but i never heard it called a foreign prison it is useless to endeavour to deceive us said mrs quelch sternly look at that telegram mr fladgate and deny it if you can you have been gadding about in some vile foreign place with my misguided husband oh quelch is in it too is he then it must be a bad case but lets see what we have been up to for pon my word im quite in the dark at present he held out his hand for the telegram and read it carefully somebodys been having a lark with you old lady he said to his wife you know well enough where ive been my regular northern journey and nowhere else i dont believe a word of it said mrs quelch you men are all alike deceivers every one of you much obliged for your good opinion mrs quelch i had no idea quelch was such a bad lot but so far as i am concerned the things easily tested here is the bill for my bed last night at carlisle now if i was in carlisle and larking about at dieppe at the same time perhaps youll kindly explain how i managed it mrs quelch was staggered but not convinced but if if you were at carlisle where is benjamin and what does this telegram mean not being a wizard i really cant say but concerning quelch we shall find him never fear when did he disappear mrs quelch told her story not forgetting the mysterious letter i think i see daylight said fladgate the party who has got into that mess is quelch and being frightened out of his wits he has given my name instead of his own thats about the size of it but benjamin doesnt smoke and how should he come to be at dieppe went for a holiday i suppose as for smoking i shouldnt have thought he was up to it but with that satupon sort of man begging your pardon mrs quelch you never know where he may break out worms will turn you know and sometimes they take a wrong turning but benjamin would never dare thats just it he darent do anything when youve got your eye on him when you havent perhaps he may and perhaps he maynt the fact is you hold up his head too tight and if he jibs now and then you cant wonder at it you have a very coarse way of putting things mr fladgate mr quelch is not a horse that i am aware of we wont quarrel about the animal my dear madam but you may depend upon it my solutions right a hardened villain like myself say would never have got into such a scrape but quelch dont know enough of the world to keep himself out of mischief theyve got him in quod thats clear and the best thing you can do is to send the coin and get him out again send money to those swindling frenchmen never if benjamin is in prison i will fetch him out myself you would never risk that dreadful sea passage exclaimed mrs fladgate and how will you manage the language you dont understand french oh i shall do very well said the heroic woman they wont talk french to me that same night a female passenger crossed by the boat from newhaven to dieppe the passage was rough and the passenger was very seasick but she still sat grimly upright never for one moment relaxing her grasp on the handle of her silk umbrella what she went through on landing how she finally obtained her husbands release and what explanations passed between the reunited pair must be left to the readers imagination for mrs quelch never told the story twentyfour hours later a fourwheeled cab drew up at the quelchs door and from it descended first a stately female and then a woebegone little man in a soft felt hat and a red necktie both sorely crushed and soiled with a black bag in his hand is there a fire in the kitchen asked mrs quelch the moment she set foot in the house being assured that there was she proceeded down the kitchen stairs quelch meekly following her now she said pointing to the black bag those things benjamin opened the bag and tremblingly took out the frilled nightdress and the cigars his wife pointed to the fire and he meekly laid them on it now that necktie the necktie followed the cigars and that thing and the hat crowned the funeral pile the smell was peculiar and to the ordinary nose disagreeable but to mrs quelch it was as the odour of burnt incense she watched the heap as it smouldered away and finally dispersed the embers by a vigorous application of the poker now benjamin she said to her trembling spouse i forgive you but if ever again the warning was left unspoken but it was not needed benjamins one experience has more than satisfied his yearning for soft raiment and foreign travel and his hats are taller than ever the three strangers by thomas hardy among the few features of agricultural england which retain an appearance but little modified by the lapse of centuries may be reckoned the high grassy and furzy downs coombs or eweleases as they are indifferently called that fill a large area of certain counties in the south and southwest if any mark of human occupation is met with hereon it usually takes the form of the solitary cottage of some shepherd fifty years ago such a lonely cottage stood on such a down and may possibly be standing there now in spite of its loneliness however the spot by actual measurement was not more than five miles from a county town yet what of that five miles of irregular upland during the long inimical seasons with their sleets snows rains and mists afford withdrawing space enough to isolate a timon or a nebuchadnezzar much less in fair weather to please that less repellent tribe the poets philosophers artists and others who conceive and meditate of pleasant things some old earthen camp or barrow some clump of trees at least some starved fragment of ancient hedge is usually taken advantage of in the execution of these forlorn dwellings but in the present case such a kind of shelter had been disregarded higher crowstairs as the house was called stood quite detached and undefended the only reason for its precise situation seemed to be the crossing of two footpaths at right angles hard by which may have crossed there and thus for a good five hundred years the house was thus exposed to the elements on all sides but though the wind up here blew unmistakably when it did blow and the rain hit hard whenever it fell the various weathers of the winter season were not quite so formidable on the coomb as they were imagined to be by dwellers on low ground the raw rimes were not so pernicious as in the hollows and the frosts were scarcely so severe when the shepherd and his family who tenanted the house were pitied for their sufferings from the exposure they said that upon the whole they were less inconvenienced by wuzzes and flames hoarses and phlegms than when they had lived by the stream of a snug neighbouring valley the night of march was precisely one of the nights that were wont to call forth these expressions of commiseration the level rainstorm smote walls slopes and hedges like the clothyard shafts of senlac and crecy such sheep and outdoor animals as had no shelter stood with their buttocks to the wind while the tails of little birds trying to roost on some scraggy thorn were blown inside out like umbrellas the gable end of the cottage was stained with wet and the eavesdroppings flapped against the wall yet never was commiseration for the shepherd more misplaced for that cheerful rustic was entertaining a large party in glorification of the christening of his second girl the guests had arrived before the rain began to fall and they were all now assembled in the chief or living room of the dwelling a glance into the apartment at eight oclock on this eventful evening would have resulted in the opinion that it was as cosey and comfortable a nook as could be wished for in boisterous weather the calling of its inhabitant was proclaimed by a number of highly polished sheepcrooks without stems that were hung ornamentally over the fireplace the curl of each shining crook varying from the antiquated type engraved in the patriarchal pictures of old family bibles to the most approved fashion of the last local sheep fair the room was lighted by half a dozen candles having wicks only a trifle smaller than the grease which enveloped them in sticks that were never used but at highdays holy days and family feasts the lights were scattered about the room two of them standing on the chimneypiece this position of candles was in itself significant candles on the chimneypiece always meant a party on the hearth in front of a back brand to give substance blazed a fire of thorns that crackled like the laughter of the fool nineteen persons were gathered here of these five women wearing gowns of various bright hues sat in chairs along the wall girls shy and not shy filled the windowbench four men including charley jake the hedgecarpenter elijah new the parish clerk and john pitcher a neighbouring dairyman the shepherds fatherinlaw lolled in the settle a young man and maid who were blushing over tentative pourparlers on a lifecompanionship sat beneath the corner cupboard and an elderly engaged man of fifty or upward moved restlessly about from spots where his betrothed was not to the spot where she was enjoyment was pretty general and so much the more prevailed in being unhampered by conventional restrictions absolute confidence in one anothers good opinion begat perfect ease while the finishing stroke of manner amounting to a truly princely serenity was lent to the majority by the absence of any expression or trait denoting that they wished to get on in the world enlarge their minds or do any eclipsing thing whatever which nowadays so generally nips the bloom and bonhomie of all except the two extremes of the social scale shepherd fennel had married well his wife being a dairymans daughter from the valley below who brought fifty guineas in her pocket and kept them there till they should be required for ministering to the needs of a coming family this frugal woman had been somewhat exercised as to the character that should be given to the gathering a sitstill party had its advantages but an undisturbed position of ease in chairs and settles was apt to lead on the men to such an unconscionable deal of toping that they would sometimes fairly drink the house dry a dancingparty was the alternative but this while avoiding the foregoing objection on the score of good drink had a counterbalancing disadvantage in the matter of good victuals the ravenous appetites engendered by the exercise causing immense havoc in the buttery shepherdess fennel fell back upon the intermediate plan of mingling short dances with short periods of talk and singing so as to hinder any ungovernable rage in either but this scheme was entirely confined to her own gentle mind the shepherd himself was in the mood to exhibit the most reckless phases of hospitality the fiddler was a boy of those parts about twelve years of age who had a wonderful dexterity in jigs and reels though his fingers were so small and short as to necessitate a constant shifting for the high notes from which he scrambled back to the first position with sounds not of unmixed purity of tone at seven the shrill tweedledee of this youngster had begun accompanied by a booming ground bass from elijah new the parish clerk who had thoughtfully brought with him his favourite musical instrument the serpent dancing was instantaneous mrs fennel privately enjoining the players on no account to let the dance exceed the length of a quarter of an hour but elijah and the boy in the excitement of their position quite forgot the injunction moreover oliver giles a man of seventeen one of the dancers who was enamoured of his partner a fair girl of thirtythree rolling years had recklessly handed a new crownpiece to the musicians as a bribe to keep going as long as they had muscle and wind mrs fennel seeing the steam begin to generate on the countenances of her guests crossed over and touched the fiddlers elbow and put her hand on the serpents mouth but they took no notice and fearing she might lose her character of genial hostess if she were to interfere too markedly she retired and sat down helpless and so the dance whizzed on with cumulative fury the performers moving in their planetlike courses direct and retrograde from apogee to perigee till the hand of the wellkicked clock at the bottom of the room had travelled over the circumference of an hour while these cheerful events were in course of enactment within fennels pastoral dwelling an incident having considerable bearing on the party had occurred in the gloomy night without mrs fennels concern about the growing fierceness of the dance corresponded in point of time with the ascent of a human figure to the solitary hill of higher crowstairs from the direction of the distant town this personage strode on through the rain without a pause following the little worn path which farther on in its course skirted the shepherds cottage it was nearly the time of full moon and on this account though the sky was lined with a uniform sheet of dripping cloud ordinary objects out of doors were readily visible the sad wan light revealed the lonely pedestrian to be a man of supple frame his gait suggested that he had somewhat passed the period of perfect and instinctive agility though not so far as to be otherwise than rapid of motion when occasion required in point of fact he might have been about forty years of age he appeared tall but a recruiting sergeant or other person accustomed to the judging of mens heights by the eye would have discerned that this was chiefly owing to his gauntness and that he was not more than five feet eight or nine notwithstanding the regularity of his tread there was caution in it as in that of one who mentally feels his way and despite the fact that it was not a black coat nor a dark garment of any sort that he wore there was something about him which suggested that he naturally belonged to the blackcoated tribes of men his clothes were of fustian and his boots hobnailed yet in his progress he showed not the mudaccustomed bearing of hobnailed and fustianed peasantry by the time that he had arrived abreast of the shepherds premises the rain came down or rather came along with yet more determined violence the outskirts of the little homestead partially broke the force of wind and rain and this induced him to stand still the most salient of the shepherds domestic erections was an empty sty at the forward corner of his hedgeless garden for in these latitudes the principle of masking the homelier features of your establishment by a conventional frontage was unknown the travellers eye was attracted to this small building by the pallid shine of the wet slates that covered it he turned aside and finding it empty stood under the pentroof for shelter while he stood the boom of the serpent within and the lesser strains of the fiddler reached the spot as an accompaniment to the surging hiss of the flying rain on the sod its louder beating on the cabbageleaves of the garden on the eight or ten beehives just discernible by the path and its dripping from the eaves into a row of buckets and pans that had been placed under the walls of the cottage for at higher crowstairs as at all such elevated domiciles the grand difficulty of housekeeping was an insufficiency of water and a casual rainfall was utilised by turning out as catchers every utensil that the house contained some queer stories might be told of the contrivances for economy in suds and dishwaters that are absolutely necessitated in upland habitations during the droughts of summer but at this season there were no such exigencies a mere acceptance of what the skies bestowed was sufficient for an abundant store at last the notes of the serpent ceased and the house was silent this cessation of activity aroused the solitary pedestrian from the reverie into which he had lapsed and emerging from the shed with an apparently new intention he walked up the path to the house door arrived here his first act was to kneel down on a large stone beside the row of vessels and to drink a copious draught from one of them having quenched his thirst he rose and lifted his hand to knock but paused with his eye upon the panel since the dark surface of the wood revealed absolutely nothing it was evident that he must be mentally looking through the door as if he wished to measure thereby all the possibilities that a house of this sort might include and how they might bear upon the question of his entry in his indecision he turned and surveyed the scene around not a soul was anywhere visible the garden path stretched downward from his feet gleaming like the track of a snail the roof of the little well mostly dry the wellcover the top rail of the garden gate were varnished with the same dull liquid glaze while far away in the vale a faint whiteness of more than usual extent showed that the rivers were high in the meads beyond all this winked a few bleared lamplights through the beating drops lights that denoted the situation of the county town from which he had appeared to come the absence of all notes of life in that direction seemed to clinch his intentions and he knocked at the door within a desultory chat had taken the place of movement and musical sound the hedgecarpenter was suggesting a song to the company which nobody just then was inclined to undertake so that the knock afforded a not unwelcome diversion walk in said the shepherd promptly the latch clicked upward and out of the night our pedestrian appeared upon the doormat the shepherd arose snuffed two of the nearest candies and turned to look at him their light disclosed that the stranger was dark in complexion and not unprepossessing as to feature his hat which for a moment he did not remove hung low over his eyes without concealing that they were large open and determined moving with a flash rather than a glance round the room he seemed pleased with the survey and baring his shaggy head said in a rich deep voice the rain is so heavy friends that i ask leave to come in and rest awhile to be sure stranger said the shepherd and faith youve been lucky in choosing your time for we are having a bit of a fling for a glad cause though to be sure a man could hardly wish that glad cause to happen more than once a year nor less spoke up a woman for tis best to get your family over and done with as soon as you can so as to be all the earlier out of the fag ot and what may be this glad cause asked the stranger a birth and christening said the shepherd the stranger hoped his host might not be made unhappy either by too many or too few of such episodes and being invited by a gesture to a pull at the mug he readily acquiesced his manner which before entering had been so dubious was now altogether that of a careless and candid man late to be traipsing athwart this coomb hey said the engaged man of fifty late it is master as you say ill take a seat in the chimneycorner if you have nothing to urge against it maam for i am a little moist on the side that was next the rain mrs shepherd fennel assented and made room for the selfinvited comer who having got completely inside the chimneycorner stretched out his legs and his arms with the expansiveness of a person quite at home yes i am rather thin in the vamp he said freely seeing that the eyes of the shepherds wife fell upon his boots and i am not well fitted either i have had some rough times lately and have been forced to pick up what i can get in the way of wearing but i must find a suit better fit for workingdays when i reach home one of hereabouts she inquired not quite that farther up the country i thought so and so am i and by your tongue you come from my neighbourhood but you would hardly have heard of me he said quickly my time would be long before yours maam you see this testimony to the youthfulness of his hostess had the effect of stopping her crossexamination there is only one thing more wanted to make me happy continued the newcomer and that is a little baccy which i am sorry to say i am out of ill fill your pipe said the shepherd i must ask you to lend me a pipe likewise a smoker and no pipe about ye i have dropped it somewhere on the road the shepherd filled and handed him a new clay pipe saying as he did so hand me your baccybox ill fill that too now i am about it the man went through the movement of searching his pockets lost that too said his entertainer with some surprise i am afraid so said the man with some confusion give it to me in a screw of paper lighting his pipe at the candle with a suction that drew the whole flame into the bowl he resettled himself in the corner and bent his looks upon the faint steam from his damp legs as if he wished say no more meanwhile the general body of guests had been taking little notice of this visitor by reason of an absorbing discussion in which they were engaged with the band about a tune for the next dance the matter being settled they were about to stand up when an interruption came in the shape of another knock at the door at sound of the same the man in the chimneycorner took up the poker and began stirring the fire as if doing it thoroughly were the one aim of his existence and a second time the shepherd said walk in in a moment another man stood upon the strawwoven doormat he too was a stranger this individual was one of a type radically different from the first there was more of the commonplace in his manner and a certain jovial cosmopolitanism sat upon his features he was several years older than the first arrival his hair being slightly frosted his eyebrows bristly and his whiskers cut back from his cheeks his face was rather full and flabby and yet it was not altogether a face without power a few grogblossoms marked the neighbourhood of his nose he flung back his long drab greatcoat revealing that beneath it he wore a suit of cindergray shade throughout large heavy seals of some metal or other that would take a polish dangling from his fob as his only personal ornament shaking the waterdrops from his lowcrowned glazed hat he said i must ask for a few minutes shelter comrades or i shall be wetted to my skin before i get to casterbridge make yerself at home master said the shepherd perhaps a trifle less heartily than on the first occasion not that fennel had the least tinge of niggardliness in his composition but the room was far from large spare chairs were not numerous and damp companions were not altogether comfortable at close quarters for the women and girls in their brightcoloured gowns however the second comer after taking off his greatcoat and hanging his hat on a nail in one of the ceiling beams as if he had been specially invited to put it there advanced and sat down at the table this had been pushed so closely into the chimneycorner to give all available room to the dancers that its inner edge grazed the elbow of the man who had ensconced himself by the fire and thus the two strangers were brought into close companionship they nodded to each other way of breaking the ice of unacquaintance and the first stranger handed his neighbour the large mug a huge vessel of brown ware having its upper edge worn away like a threshold by the rub of whole genealogies of thirsty lips that had gone the way of all flesh and bearing the following inscription burned upon its rotund side in yellow letters there is no fun untill i cum the other man nothing loath raised the mug to his lips and drank on and on and on till a curious blueness overspread the countenance of the shepherds wife who had regarded with no little surprise the first strangers free offer to the second of what did not belong to him to dispense i knew it said the toper to the shepherd with much satisfaction when i walked up your garden afore coming in and saw the hives all of a row i said to myself where theres bees theres honey and where theres honey theres mead but mead of such a truly comfortable sort as this i really didnt expect to meet in my older days he took yet another pull at the mug till it assumed an ominous horizontality glad you enjoy it said the shepherd warmly it is goodish mead assented mrs fennel with an absence of enthusiasm which seemed to say that it was possible to buy praise for ones cellar at too heavy a price it is trouble enough to make and really i hardly think we shall make any more for honey sells well and we can make shift with a drop o small mead and metheglin for common use from the comb washings oh but youll never have the heart reproachfully cried the stranger in cinder gray after taking up the mug a third time and setting it down empty i love mead when t is old like this as i love to go to church o sundays or to relieve the needy any day of the week ha ha ha said the man in the chimneycorner who in spite of the taciturnity induced by the pipe of tobacco could not or would not refrain from this slight testimony to his comrades humour now the old mead of those days brewed of the purest firstyear or maiden honey four pounds to gallon with its due complement of whites of eggs cinnamon ginger cloves mace rosemary yeast and processes of working bottling and cellaring tasted remarkably strong but it did not taste so strong as it actually was hence presently the stranger in cinder gray at the table moved by its creeping influence unbuttoned his waistcoat threw himself back in his chair spread his legs and made his presence felt in various ways well well as i say he resumed i am going to casterbridge and to casterbridge i must go i should have been almost there by this time but the rain drove me in to ye and im not sorry for it you dont live in casterbridge said the shepherd not as yet though i shortly mean to move there going to set up in trade perhaps no no said the shepherds wife it is easy to see that the gentleman is rich and dont want to work at anything the cindergray stranger paused as if to consider whether he would accept that definition of himself he presently rejected it by answering rich is not quite the word for me dame i do work and i must work and even if i only get to casterbridge by midnight i must begin work there at eight tomorrow morning yes hot or wet blow or snow famine or sword my days work tomorrow must be done poor man then in spite o seeming you be worse off than we replied the shepherds wife tis the nature of my trade men and maidens tis the nature of my trade more than my poverty but really and truly i must up and off or i shant get a lodging in the town however the speaker did not move and directly added theres time for one more draught of friendship before i go and id perform it at once if the mug were not dry heres a mug o small said mrs fennel small we call it though to be sure tis only the first wash o the combs no said the stranger disdainfully i wont spoil your first kindness by partaking o your second certainly not broke in fennel we dont increase and multiply every day and ill fill the mug again he went away to the dark place under the stairs where the barrel stood the shepherdess followed him why should you do this she said reproachfully as soon as they were alone hes emptied it once though it held enough for ten people and now hes not contented wi the small but must needs call for more o the strong and a stranger unbeknown to any of us for my part i dont like the look o the man at all but hes in the house my honey and tis a wet night and a christening daze it whats a cup of mead more or less therell be plenty more next beeburning very well this time then she answered looking wistfully at the barrel but what is the mans calling and where is he one of that he should come in and join us like this i dont know ill ask him again the catastrophe of having the mug drained dry at one pull by the stranger in cinder gray was effectually guarded against this time by mrs fennel she poured out his allowance in a small cup keeping the large one at a discreet distance from him when he had tossed off his portion the shepherd renewed his inquiry about the strangers occupation the latter did not immediately reply and the man in the chimneycorner with sudden demonstrativeness said anybody may know my trade im a wheelwright a very good trade for these parts said the shepherd and anybody may know mineif theyve the sense to find it out said the stranger in cinder gray you may generally tell what a man is by his claws observed the hedgecarpenter looking at his hands my fingers be as full of thorns as an old pincushion is of pins the hands of the man in the chimneycorner instinctively sought the shade and he gazed into the fire as he resumed his pipe the man at the table took up the hedgecarpenters remark and added smartly true but the oddity of my trade is that instead of setting a mark upon me it sets a mark upon my customers no observation being offered by anybody in elucidation of this enigma the shepherds wife once more called for a song the same obstacles presented themselves as at the former time one had no voice another had forgotten the first verse the stranger at the table whose soul had now risen to a good working temperature relieved the difficulty by exclaiming that to start the company he would sing himself thrusting one thumb into the armhole of his waistcoat he waved the other hand in the air and with an extemporising gaze at the shining sheepcrooks above the mantelpiece began oh my trade it is the rarest one simple shepherds all my trade is a sight to see for my customers i tie and take them up on high and waft em to a far countree the room was silent when he had finished the verse with one exception that of the man in the chimneycorner who at the singers word chorus joined him in a deep bass voice of musical relish and waft em to a far countree oliver giles john pitcher the dairyman the parish clerk the engaged man of fifty the row of young women against the wall seemed lost in thought not of the gayest kind the shepherd looked meditatively on the ground the shepherdess gazed keenly at the singer and with some suspicion she was doubting whether this stranger was merely singing an old song from recollection or composing one there and then for the occasion all were as perplexed at the obscure revelation as the guests at belshazzars feast except the man in the chimneycorner who quietly said second verse stranger and smoked on the singer thoroughly moistened himself from his lips inward and went on with the next stanza as requested my tools are but common ones simple shepherds all my tools are no sight to see a little hempen string and a post whereon to swing are implements enough for me shepherd fennel glanced round there was no longer any doubt that the stranger was answering his question rhythmically the guests one and all started back with suppressed exclamations the young woman engaged to the man of fifty fainted halfway and would have proceeded but finding him wanting in alacrity for catching her she sat down trembling oh hes the whispered the people in the background mentioning the name of an ominous public officer hes come to do it t is to be at casterbridge gaol tomorrow the man for sheepstealing the poor clockmaker we heard of who used to live away at anglebury and had no work to do timothy sommers whose family were astarving and so he went out of anglebury by the highroad and took a sheep in open daylight defying the farmer and the farmers wife and the farmers man and every man jack among em he and they nodded toward the stranger of the terrible trade is come from up the country to do it because theres not enough to do in his own county town and hes got the place here now our own county mans dead hes going to live in the same cottage under the prison wall the stranger in cinder gray took no notice of this whispered string of observations but again wetted his lips seeing that his friend in the chimneycorner was the only one who reciprocated his joviality in any way he held out his cup toward that appreciative comrade who also held out his own they clinked together the eyes of the rest of the room hanging upon the singers actions he parted his lips for the third verse but at that moment another knock was audible upon the door this time the knock was faint and hesitating the company seemed scared the shepherd looked with consternation toward the entrance and it was with some effort that he resisted his alarmed wifes deprecatory glance and uttered for the third time the welcoming words walk in the door was gently opened and another man stood upon the mat he like those who had preceded him was a stranger this time it was a short small personage of fair complexion and dressed in a decent suit of dark clothes can you tell me the way to he began when gazing round the room to observe the nature of the company among whom he had fallen his eyes lighted on the stranger in cinder gray it was just at the instant when the latter who had thrown his mind into his song with such a will that he scarcely heeded the interruption silenced all whispers and inquiries by bursting into his third verse tomorrow is my workingday simple shepherds all tomorrow is a workingday for me for the farmers sheep is slain and the lad who did it taen and on his soul may god ha mercy the stranger in the chimneycorner waving cup with the singer so heartily that his mead splashed over on the hearth repeated in his bass voice as before and on his soul may god ha mercy all this time the third stranger had been standing in the doorway finding now that he did not come forward or go on speaking the guests particularly regarded him they noticed to their surprise that he stood before them the picture of abject terrorhis knees trembling his hand shaking so violently that the doorlatch by which he supported himself rattled audibly his white lips were parted and his eyes fixed on the merry officer of justice in the middle of the room a moment more and he had turned closed the door and fled what a man can it be said the shepherd the rest between the awfulness of their late discovery and the odd conduct of this third visitor looked as if they knew not what to think and said nothing instinctively they withdrew farther and farther from the grim gentleman in their midst whom some of them seemed to take for the prince of darkness himself till they formed a remote circle an empty space of floor being left between them and him circulus cujus centrum diabolus the room was so silent though there were more than twenty people in it that nothing could be heard but the patter of the rain against the windowshutters accompanied by the occasional hiss of a stray drop that fell down the chimney into the fire and the steady puffing of the man in the corner who had now resumed his pipe of long clay the stillness was unexpectedly broken the distant sound of a gun reverberated through the air apparently from the direction of the county town be jiggered cried the stranger who had sung the song jumping up what does that mean asked several a prisoner escaped from the gaol that s what it means all listened the sound was repeated and none of them spoke but the man in the chimneycorner who said quietly ive often been told that in this county they fire a gun at such times but i never heard it till now i wonder if it is my man murmured personage in cinder gray surely it is said the shepherd involuntarily and surely weve seen him that little man who looked in at the door by now and quivered like a leaf when he seed ye and heard your song his teeth chattered and the breath went out of his body said the dairyman and his heart seemed to sink within him like a stone said oliver giles and he bolted as if hed been shot at said the hedgecarpenter true his teeth chattered and his heart seemed to sink and he bolted as if hed been shot at slowly summed up the man in the chimneycorner i didnt notice it remarked the grim songster we were all awondering what made him run off in such a fright faltered one of the women against the wall and nowt is explained the firing of the alarmgun went on at intervals low and sullenly and their suspicions became a certainty the sinister gentleman in cinder gray roused himself is there a constable here he asked in thick tones if so let him step forward the engaged man of fifty stepped quavering out of the corner his betrothed beginning to sob on the back of the chair you are a sworn constable i be sir then pursue the criminal at once with assistance and bring him back here he cant have gone far i will sir i will when ive got my staff ill home and get it and come sharp here and start in a body staff never mind your staff the manll be gone but i cant do nothing without my staff can i william and john and charles jake no for theres the kings royal crown apainted on en in yaller and gold and the lion and the unicorn so as when i raise en up and hit my prisonert is made a lawful blow thereby i wouldnt tempt to take up a man without my staff no not i if i hadnt the law to gie me courage why instead o my taking him up he might take up me now im a kings man myself and can give you authority enough for this said the formidable person in cinder gray now then all of ye be ready have ye any lanterns yes have ye any lanterns i demand it said the constable and the rest of you ablebodied ablebodied men yes the rest of ye said the constable have you some good stout staves and pitchforks staves and pitchforks in the name o the law and take em in yer hands and go in quest and do as we in authority tell ye thus aroused the men prepared to give chase the evidence was indeed though circumstantial so convincing that but little argument was needed to show the shepherds guests that after what they had seen it would look very much like connivance if they did not instantly pursue the unhappy third stranger who could not as yet have gone more than a few hundred yards over such uneven country a shepherd is always well provided with lanterns and lighting these hastily and with hurdlestaves in their hands they poured out of the door taking a direction along the crest of the hill away from the town the rain having fortunately a little abated disturbed by the noise or possibly by unpleasant dreams of her baptism the child who had been christened began to cry heartbrokenly in the room overhead these notes of grief came down through the chinks of the floor to the ears of the women below who jumped up one by one and seemed glad of the excuse to ascend and comfort the baby for the incidents of the last halfhour greatly oppressed them thus in the space of two or three minutes the room on the ground floor was deserted quite but it was not for long hardly had the sound of footsteps died away when a man returned round the corner of the house from the direction the pursuers had taken peeping in at the door and seeing nobody there he entered leisurely it was the stranger of the chimneycorner who had gone out with the rest the motive of his return was shown by his helping himself to a cut piece of skimmercake that lay on a ledge beside where he had sat and which he had apparently forgotten to take with him he also poured out half a cup more mead from the quantity that remained ravenously eating and drinking these as he stood he had not finished when another figure came in just as quietly the stranger in cinder gray oh you here said the latter smiling i thought you had gone to help in the capture and this speaker also revealed the object of his return by looking solicitously round for the fascinating mug of old mead and i thought you had gone said the other continuing his skimmercake with some effort well on second thoughts i felt there were enough without me said the first confidentially and such a night as it is too besides t is the business o the government to take care of its criminals not mine true so it is and i felt as you did that were enough without me i dont want to break my limbs running over the humps and hollows of this wild country nor i either between you and me these shepherd people are used to it simpleminded souls you know stirred up to anything a moment theyll have him ready for me before the morning and no trouble to me at all theyll have him and we shall have saved ourselves all labour in the matter true true well my way is to casterbridge andt is as much as my legs will do to take me that far going the same way no i am sorry to say i have to get home over there he nodded indefinitely to the right and i feel as you do that it is quite enough for my legs to do before bedtime the other had by this time finished the mead in the mug after which shaking hands at the door and wishing each other well they went their several ways in the meantime the company of pursuers had reached the end of the hogsback elevation which dominated this part of the coomb they had decided on no particular plan of action and finding that the man of the baleful trade was no longer in their company they seemed quite unable to form any such plan now they descended in all directions down the hill and straightway several of the parties fell into the snare set by nature for all misguided midnight ramblers over the lower cretaceous formation the lynchets or flint slopes which belted the escarpment at intervals of a dozen yards took the less cautious ones unawares and losing their footing on the rubbly steep they slid sharply downward the lanterns rolling from their hands to the bottom and there lying on their sides till the horn was scorched through when they had again gathered themselves together the shepherd as the man who knew the country best took the lead and guided them round these treacherous inclines the lanterns which seemed rather to dazzle their eyes and warn the fugitive than to assist them in the exploration were extinguished due silence was observed and in this more rational order they plunged into the vale it was a grassy briery moist channel affording some shelter to any person who had sought it but the party perambulated it in vain and ascended on the other side here they wandered apart and after an interval closed together again to report progress at the second time of closing in they found themselves near a lonely oak the single tree on this part of the upland probably sown there by a passing bird some hundred years before and here standing a little to one side of the trunk as motionless as the trunk itself appeared the man they were in quest of his outline being well defined against the sky beyond the band noiselessly drew up and faced him your money or your life said the constable sternly to the still figure no no whispered john pitcher tisnt our side ought to say that thats the doctrine of vagabonds like him and we be on the side of the law well well replied the constable impatiently i must say something mustnt i and if you had all the weight o this undertaking upon your mind perhaps youd say the wrong thing too prisoner at the bar surrender in the name of the fath the crown i mane the man under the tree seemed now to notice them for the first time and giving them no opportunity whatever for exhibiting their courage he strolled slowly toward them he was indeed the little man the third stranger but his trepidation had in a great measure gone well travellers he said did i hear ye speak to me you did youve got to come and be our prisoner at once said the constable we arrest ye on the charge of not biding in casterbridge gaol in a decent proper manner to be hung tomorrow morning neighbours do your duty and seize the culpet on hearing the charge the man seemed enlightened and saying not another word resigned himself with preternatural civility to the searchparty who with their staves in their hands surrounded him on all sides and marched him back toward the shepherds cottage it was eleven oclock by the time they arrived the light shining from the open door a sound of mens voices within proclaimed to them as they approached the house that some new events had arisen in their absence on entering they discovered the shepherds livingroom to be invaded by officers from casterbridge gaol and a wellknown magistrate who lived at the nearest countryseat intelligence of the escape having become generally circulated gentlemen said the constable i have brought back your man not without risk and danger but every one must do his duty he is inside this circle of ablebodied persons who have lent me useful aid considering their ignorance of crown work men bring forward your prisoner and the third stranger was led to the light who is this said one of the officials the man said the constable certainly not said the other turnkey and the first corroborated his statement but how can it be otherwise asked the constable or why was he so terrified at sight o the singing instrument of the law here he related the strange behaviour of the third stranger on entering the house cant understand it said the officer coolly all i know is that it is not the condemned man hes quite a different character from this one a gauntish fellow with dark hair and eyes rather goodlooking and with a musical bass voice that if you heard it once youd never mistake as long as you lived why souls t was the man in the chimneycorner hey what said the magistrate coming forward after inquiring particulars from the shepherd in the background havent you got the man after all well sir said the constable hes the man we were in search of thats true and yet hes not the man we were in search of for the man we were in search of was not the man we wanted sir if you understand my everyday way for t was the man in the chimneycorner a pretty kettle of fish altogether said the magistrate you had better start for the other man at once the prisoner now spoke for the first time the mention of the man in the chimneycorner seemed to have moved him as nothing else could do sir he said stepping forward to the magistrate take no more trouble about me the time is come when i may as well speak i have done nothing my crime is that the condemned man is my brother early this afternoon i left home at anglebury to tramp it all the way to casterbridge gaol to bid him farewell i was benighted and called here to rest and ask the way when i opened the door i saw before me the very man my brother that i thought to see in the condemned cell at casterbridge he was in this chimneycorner and jammed close to him so that he could not have got out if he had tried was the executioner whod come to take his life singing a song about it and not knowing that it was his victim who was close by joining in to save appearances my brother looked a glance of agony at me and i knew he meant dont reveal what you see my life depends on it i was so terrorstruck that i could hardly stand and not knowing what i did i turned and hurried away the narrators manner and tone had the stamp of truth and his story made a great impression on around and do you know where your brother is at the present time asked the magistrate i do not i have never seen him since i closed this door i can testify to that for weve been between ye ever since said the constable where does he think to fly to what is his occupation hes a watch and clockmaker sir a said a was a wheelwright a wicked rogue said the constable the wheels o clocks and watches he meant no doubt said shepherd fennel i thought his hands were palish fors trade well it appears to me that nothing can be gained by retaining this poor man in custody the magistrate your business lies with the other unquestionably and so the little man was released offhand but he looked nothing the less sad on that account it being beyond the power of magistrate or constable to rase out the written troubles in his brain for they concerned another whom he regarded with more solicitude than himself when this was done and the man had gone his way the night was found to be so far advanced that it was deemed useless to renew the search before the next morning next day accordingly the quest for the clever sheepstealer became general and keen to all appearance at least but the intended punishment was cruelly disproportioned to the transgression and the sympathy of a great many country folk in that district was strongly on the side of the fugitive moreover his marvellous coolness and daring under the unprecedented circumstances of the shepherds party won their admiration so that it may be questioned if all those who ostensibly made themselves so busy in exploring woods and fields and lanes were quite so thorough when it came to the private examination of their own lofts and outhouses stories were afloat of a mysterious figure being occasionally seen in some old overgrown trackway or other remote from turnpike roads but when a search was instituted in any of these suspected quarters nobody was found thus the days and weeks passed without tidings in brief the bassvoiced man of the chimneycorner was never recaptured some said that he went across the sea others that he did not but buried himself in the depths of a populous city at any rate the gentleman in cinder gray never did his mornings work at casterbridge nor met anywhere at all for business purposes the comrade with whom he had passed an hour of relaxation in the lonely house on the coomb the grass has long been green on the graves of shepherd fennel and his frugal wife the guests who made up the christeningparty have mainly followed their entertainers to the tomb the baby in whose honour they all had met is a matron in the sear and yellow leaf but the arrival of the three strangers at the shepherds that night and the details connected therewith is a story as well known as ever in the country about higher crowstairs mr lismore and the widow by wilkie collins late in the autumn not many years since a public meeting was held at the mansion house london under the direction of the lord mayor the list of gentlemen invited to address the audience had been chosen with two objects in view speakers of celebrity who would rouse public enthusiasm were supported by speakers connected with commerce who would be practically useful in explaining the purpose for which the meeting was convened money wisely spent in advertising had produced the customary result every seat was occupied before the proceedings began among the late arrivals who had no choice but to stand or to leave the hall were two ladies one of them at once decided on leaving the hall i shall go back to the carriage she said and wait for you at the door her friend answered i shant keep you long he is advertised to support the second resolution i want to see him and that is all an elderly gentleman seated at the end of a bench rose and offered his place to the lady who remained she hesitated to take advantage of his kindness until he reminded her that he had heard what she said to her friend before the third resolution was proposed his seat would be at his own disposal again she thanked him and without further ceremony took his place he was provided with an operaglass which he more than once offered to her when famous orators appeared on the platform she made no use of it until a speaker known in the city as a shipowner stepped forward to support the second resolution his name announced in the advertisements was ernest lismore the moment he rose the lady asked for the operaglass she kept it to her eyes for such a length of time and with such evident interest in mr lismore that the curiosity of her neighbours was aroused had he anything to say in which a lady evidently a stranger to him was personally interested there was nothing in the address that he delivered which appealed to the enthusiasm of women he was undoubtedly a handsome man whose appearance proclaimed him to be in the prime of life midway perhaps between thirty and forty years of age but why a lady should persist in keeping an operaglass fixed on him all through his speech was a question which found the general ingenuity at a loss for a reply having returned the glass with an apology the lady ventured on putting a question next did it strike you sir that mr lismore seemed to be out of spirits she asked i cant say it did maam perhaps you noticed that he left the platform the moment he had done this betrayal of interest in the speaker did not escape the notice of a lady seated on the bench in front before the old gentleman could answer she volunteered an explanation i am afraid mr lismore is troubled by anxieties connected with his business she said my husband heard it reported in the city yesterday that he was seriously embarrassed by the failure a loud burst of applause made the end of the sentence inaudible a famous member of parliament had risen to propose the third resolution the polite old man took his seat and the lady left the hall to join her friend well mrs callender has mr lismore disappointed you far from it but i have heard a report about him which has alarmed me he is said to be seriously troubled about money matters how can i find out his address in the city we can stop at the first stationers shop we pass and ask to look at the directory are you going to pay mr lismore a visit i am going to think about it the next day a clerk entered mr lismores private room at the office and presented a visitingcard mrs callender had reflected and had arrived at a decision underneath her name she had written these explanatory words an important business does she look as if she wanted money mr lismore inquired oh dear no she comes in her carriage is she young or old old sir to mr lismore conscious of the disastrous influence occasionally exercised over busy men by youth and beauty this was a recommendation in itself he said show her in observing the lady as she approached him with the momentary curiosity of a stranger he noticed that she still preserved the remains of beauty she had also escaped the misfortune common to persons at her time of life of becoming too fat even to a mans eye her dressmaker appeared to have made the most of that favourable circumstance her figure had its defects concealed and its remaining merits set off to advantage at the same time she evidently held herself above the common deceptions by which some women seek to conceal their age she wore her own gray hair and her complexion bore the test of daylight on entering the room she made her apologies with some embarrassment being the embarrassment of a stranger and not of a youthful stranger it failed to impress mr lismore favourably i am afraid i have chosen an inconvenient time for my visit she began i am at your service he answered a little stiffly especially if you will be so kind as to mention your business with me in few words she was a woman of some spirit and that reply roused her i will mention it in one word she said smartly my business is gratitude he was completely at a loss to understand what she meant and he said so plainly instead of explaining herself she put a question do you remember the night of the th of march between five and six years since he considered for a moment no he said i dont remember it excuse me mrs callender i have affairs of my own to attend to which cause me some anxiety let me assist your memory mr lismore and i will leave you to your affairs on the date that i have referred to you were on your way to the railwaystation at bexmore to catch the night express from the north to london as a hint that his time was valuable the shipowner had hitherto remained standing he now took his customary seat and began to listen with some interest mrs callender had produced her effect on him already it was absolutely necessary she proceeded that you should be on board your ship in the london docks at nine oclock the next morning if you had lost the express the vessel would have sailed without you the expression of his face began to change to surprise who told you that he asked you shall hear directly on your way into the town your carriage was stopped by an obstruction on the highroad the people of bexmore were looking at a house on fire he started to his feet good heavens are you the lady she held up her hand in satirical protest gently sir you suspected me just now of wasting your valuable time dont rashly conclude that i am the lady until you find that i am acquainted with the circumstances is there no excuse for my failing to recognise you mr lismore asked we were on the dark side of the burning house you were fainting and i and you she interposed after saving me at the risk of your own life turned a deaf ear to my poor husbands entreaties when he asked you to wait till i had recovered my senses your poor husband surely mrs callender he received no serious injury from the fire the firemen rescued him under circumstances of peril she answered and at his great age he sank under the shock i have lost the kindest and best of men do you remember how you parted from him burned and bruised in saving me he liked to talk of it in his last illness at least he said to you tell me the name of the man who preserved my wife from a dreadful death you threw your card to him out of the carriage window and away you went at a gallop to catch your train in all the years that have passed i have kept that card and have vainly inquired for my brave seacaptain yesterday i saw your name on the list of speakers at the mansion house need i say that i attended the meeting need i tell you now why i come here and interrupt you in business hours she held out her hand mr lismore took it in silence and pressed it warmly you have not done with me yet she resumed with a smile do you remember what i said of my errand when i first came in you said it was an errand of gratitude something more than the gratitude which only says thank you she added before i explain myself however i want to know what you have been doing and how it was that my inquiries failed to trace you after that terrible night the appearance of depression which mrs callender had noticed at the public meeting showed itself again in mr lismores face he sighed as he answered her my story has one merit he said it is soon told i cannot wonder that you failed to discover me in the first place i was not captain of my ship at that time i was only mate in the second place i inherited some money and ceased to lead a sailors life in less than a year from the night of the fire you will now understand what obstacles were in the way of your tracing me with my little capital i started successfully in business as a shipowner at the time i naturally congratulated myself on my own good fortune we little know mrs callender what the future has in store for us he stopped his handsome features hardened as if he were suffering and concealing pain before it was possible to speak to him there was a knock at the door another visitor without an appointment had called the clerk appeared again with a card and a message the gentleman begs you will see him sir he has something to tell you which is too important to be delayed hearing the message mrs callender rose immediately it is enough for today that we understand each other she said have you any engagement tomorrow after the hours of business none she pointed to her card on the writingtable will you come to me tomorrow evening at that address i am like the gentleman who has just called i too have my reason for wishing to see you he gladly accepted the invitation mrs callender stopped him as he opened the door for her shall i offend you she said if i ask a strange question before i go i have a better motive mind than mere curiosity are you married no forgive me again she resumed at my age you cannot possibly misunderstand me and yet she hesitated mr lismore tried to give her confidence pray dont stand on ceremony mrs callender nothing that you can ask me need be prefaced by an apology thus encouraged she ventured to proceed you may be engaged to be married she suggested or you may be in love he found it impossible to conceal his surprise but he answered without hesitation there is no such bright prospect in my life he said i am not even in love she left him with a little sigh it sounded like a sigh of relief ernest lismore was thoroughly puzzled what could be the old ladys object in ascertaining that he was still free from a matrimonial engagement if the idea had occurred to him in time he might have alluded to her domestic life and might have asked if she had children with a little tact he might have discovered more than this she had described her feeling toward him as passing the ordinary limits of gratitude and she was evidently rich enough to be above the imputation of a mercenary motive did she propose to brighten those dreary prospects to which he had alluded in speaking of his own life when he presented himself at her house the next evening would she introduce him to a charming daughter he smiled as the idea occurred to him an appropriate time to be thinking of my chances of marriage he said to himself in another month i may be a ruined man the gentleman who had so urgently requested an interview was a devoted friend who had obtained a means of helping ernest at a serious crisis in his affairs it had been truly reported that he was in a position of pecuniary embarrassment owing to the failure of a mercantile house with which he had been intimately connected whispers affecting his own solvency had followed on the bankruptcy of the firm he had already endeavoured to obtain advances of money on the usual conditions and had been met by excuses for delay his friend had now arrived with a letter of introduction to a capitalist well known in commercial circles for his daring speculations and for his great wealth looking at the letter ernest observed that the envelope was sealed in spite of that ominous innovation on established usage in cases of personal introduction he presented the letter on this occasion he was not put off with excuses the capitalist flatly declined to discount mr lismores bills unless they were backed by responsible names ernest made a last effort he applied for help to two mercantile men whom he had assisted in their difficulties and whose names would have satisfied the moneylender they were most sincerely sorry but they too refused the one security that he could offer was open it must be owned to serious objections on the score of risk he wanted an advance of twenty thousand pounds secured on a homewardbound ship and cargo but the vessel was not insured and at that stormy season she was already more than a month overdue could grateful colleagues be blamed if they forgot their obligations when they were asked to offer pecuniary help to a merchant in this situation ernest returned to his office without money and without credit a man threatened by ruin is in no state of mind to keep an engagement at a ladys teatable ernest sent a letter of apology to mrs callender alleging extreme pressure of business as the excuse for breaking his engagement am i to wait for an answer sir the messenger asked no you are merely to leave the letter in an hours time to ernests astonishment the messenger returned with a reply the lady was just going out sir when i rang at the door he explained and she took the letter from me herself she didnt appear to know your handwriting and she asked me who i came from when i mentioned your name i was ordered to wait ernest opened the letter dear mr lismore one of us must speak out and your letter of apology forces me to be that one if you are really so proud and so distrustful as you seem to be i shall offend you if not i shall prove myself to be your friend your excuse is pressure of business the truth as i have good reason to believe is want of money i heard a stranger at that public meeting say that you were seriously embarrassed by some failure in the city let me tell you what my own pecuniary position is in two words i am the childless widow of a rich man ernest paused his anticipated discovery of mrs callenders charming daughter was in his mind for the moment that little romance must return to the world of dreams he thought and went on with the letter after what i owe to you i dont regard it as repaying an obligation i consider myself as merely performing a duty when i offer to assist you by a loan of money wait a little before you throw my letter into the wastepaper basket circumstances which it is impossible for me to mention before we meet put it out of my power to help you unless i attach to my most sincere offer of service a very unusual and very embarrassing condition if you are on the brink of ruin that misfortune will plead my excuse and your excuse too if you accept the loan on my terms in any case i rely on the sympathy and forbearance of the man to whom i owe my life after what i have now written there is only one thing to add i beg to decline accepting your excuses and i shall expect to see you tomorrow evening as we arranged i am an obstinate old woman but i am also your faithful friend and servant mary callender ernest looked up from the letter what can this possibly mean he wondered but he was too sensible a man to be content with wondering he decided on keeping his engagement what dr johnson called the insolence of wealth appears far more frequently in the houses of the rich than in the manners of the rich the reason is plain enough personal ostentation is in the very nature of it ridiculous but the ostentation which exhibits magnificent pictures priceless china and splendid furniture can purchase good taste to guide it and can assert itself without affording the smallest opening for a word of depreciation or a look of contempt if i am worth a million of money and if i am dying to show it i dont ask you to look at me i ask you to look at my house keeping his engagement with mrs callender ernest discovered that riches might be lavishly and yet modestly used in crossing the hall and ascending the stairs look where he might his notice was insensibly won by proofs of the taste which is not to be purchased and the wealth which uses but never exhibits its purse conducted by a manservant to the landing on the first floor he found a maid at the door of the boudoir waiting to announce him mrs callender advanced to welcome her guest in a simple evening dress perfectly suited to her age all that had looked worn and faded in her fine face by daylight was now softly obscured by shaded lamps objects of beauty surrounded her which glowed with subdued radiance from their background of sober colour the influence of appearances is the strongest of all outward influences while it lasts for the moment the scene produced its impression on ernest in spite of the terrible anxieties which consumed him mrs callender in his office was a woman who had stepped out of her appropriate sphere mrs callender in her own house was a woman who had risen to a new place in his estimation i am afraid you dont thank me for forcing you to keep your engagement she said with her friendly tones and her pleasant smile indeed i do thank you he replied your beautiful house and your gracious welcome have persuaded me into forgetting my troubles for a while the smile passed away from her face then it is true she said gravely only too true she led him to a seat beside her and waited to speak again until her maid had brought in the tea have you read my letter in the same friendly spirit in which i wrote it she asked when they were alone again i have read your letter gratefully but but you dont know yet what i have to say let us understand each other before we make any objections on either side will you tell me what your present position is at its worst i can and will speak plainly when my turn comes if you will honour me with your confidence not if it distresses you she added observing him attentively he was ashamed of his hesitation and he made amends for it do you thoroughly understand me he asked when the whole truth had been laid before her without reserve she summed up the result in her own words if your overdue ship returns safely within a month from this time you can borrow the money you want without difficulty if the ship is lost you have no alternative when the end of the month comes but to accept a loan from me or to suspend payment is that the hard truth it is and the sum you require is twenty thousand pounds yes i have twenty times as much money as that mr lismore at my sole disposal on one condition the condition alluded to in your letter yes does the fulfilment of the condition depend in some way on any decision of mine it depends entirely on you that answer closed his lips with a composed manner and a steady hand she poured herself out a cup of tea i conceal it from you she said but i want confidence here she pointed to the cup is the friend of women rich or poor when they are in trouble what i have now to say obliges me to speak in praise of myself i dont like it let me get it over as soon as i can my husband was very fond of me he had the most absolute confidence in my discretion and in my sense of duty to him and to myself his last words before he died were words that thanked me for making the happiness of his life as soon as i had in some degree recovered after the affliction that had fallen on me his lawyer and executor produced a copy of his will and said there were two clauses in it which my husband had expressed a wish that i should read it is needless to say that i obeyed she still controlled her agitation but she was now unable to conceal it ernest made an attempt to spare her am i concerned in this he asked yes before i tell you why i want to know what you would do in a certain case which i am unwilling even to suppose i have heard of men unable to pay the demands made on them who began business again and succeeded and in course of time paid their creditors and you want to know if there is any likelihood of my following their example he said have you also heard of men who have made that second effort who have failed again and who have doubled the debts they owed to their brethren in business who trusted them i knew one of those men myself he committed suicide she laid her hand for a moment on his i understand you she said if ruin comes if ruin comes he interposed a man without money and without credit can make but one last atonement dont speak of it now she looked at him with horror i didnt mean that she said shall we go back to what you read in the will he suggested yes if you will give me a minute to compose myself in less than the minute she had asked for mrs callender was calm enough to go on i now possess what is called a lifeinterest in my husbands fortune she said the money is to be divided at my death among charitable institutions excepting a certain event which is provided for in the will ernest added helping her to go on yes i am to be absolute mistress of the whole of the four hundred thousand pounds her voice dropped and her eyes looked away from him as she spoke the next words on this one condition that i marry again he looked at her in amazement surely i have mistaken you he said you mean on this one condition that you do not marry again no mr lismore i mean exactly what i have said you now know that the recovery of your credit and your peace of mind rests entirely with yourself after a moment of reflection he took her hand and raised it respectfully to his lips you are a noble woman he said she made no reply with drooping head and downcast eyes she waited for his decision he accepted his responsibility i must not and dare not think of the hardship of my own position he said i owe it to you to speak without reference to the future that may be in store for me no man can be worthy of the sacrifice which your generous forgetfulness of yourself is willing to make i respect you i admire you i thank you with my whole heart leave me to my fate mrs callender and let me go he rose she stopped him by a gesture a young woman she answered would shrink from saying what i as an old woman mean to say now i refuse to leave you to your fate i ask you to prove that you respect me admire me and thank me with your whole heart take one day to think and let me hear the result you promise me this he promised now go she said next morning ernest received a letter from mrs callender she wrote to him as follows there are some considerations which i ought to have mentioned yesterday evening before you left my house i ought to have reminded you if you consent to reconsider your decision that the circumstances do not require you to pledge yourself to me absolutely at my age i can with perfect propriety assure you that i regard our marriage simply and solely as a formality which we must fulfill if i am to carry out my intention of standing between you and ruin therefore if the missing ship appears in time the only reason for the marriage is at an end we shall be as good friends as ever without the encumbrance of a formal tie to bind us in the other event i should ask you to submit to certain restrictions which remembering my position you will understand and excuse we are to live together it is unnecessary to say as mother and son the marriage ceremony is to be strictly private and you are so to arrange our affairs that immediately afterward we leave england for any foreign place which you prefer some of my friends and perhaps some of your friends will certainly misinterpret our motives if we stay in our own country in a manner which would be unendurable to a woman like me as to our future lives i have the most perfect confidence in you and i should leave you in the same position of independence which you occupy now when you wish for my company you will always be welcome at other times you are your own master i live on my side of the house and you live on yours and i am to be allowed my hours of solitude every day in the pursuit of musical occupations which have been happily associated with all my past life and which i trust confidently to your indulgence a last word to remind you of what you may be too kind to think of yourself at my age you cannot in the course of nature be troubled by the society of a grateful old woman for many years you are young enough to look forward to another marriage which shall be something more than a mere form even if you meet with the happy woman in my lifetime honestly tell me of it and i promise to tell her that she has only to wait in the meantime dont think because i write composedly that i write heartlessly you pleased and interested me when i first saw you at the public meeting i dont think i could have proposed what you call this sacrifice of myself to a man who had personally repelled me though i have felt my debt of gratitude as sincerely as ever whether your ship is safe or whether your ship is lost old mary callender likes you and owns it without false shame let me have your answer this evening either personally or by letter whichever you like best mrs callender received a written answer long before the evening it said much in few words a man impenetrable to kindness might be able to resist your letter i am not that man your great heart has conquered me the few formalities which precede marriage by special license were observed by ernest while the destiny of their future lives was still in suspense an unacknowledged feeling of embarrassment on either side kept ernest and mrs callender apart every day brought the lady her report of the state of affairs in the city written always in the same words no news of the ship on the day before the shipowners liabilities became due the terms of the report from the city remained unchanged and the special license was put to its contemplated use mrs callenders lawyer and mrs callenders maid were the only persons trusted with the secret leaving the chief clerk in charge of the business with every pecuniary demand on his employer satisfied in full the strangely married pair quitted england they arranged to wait for a few days in paris to receive any letters of importance which might have been addressed to ernest in the interval on the evening of their arrival a telegram from london was waiting at their hotel it announced that the missing ship had passed up channel undiscovered in a fog until she reached the downs on the day before ernests liabilities fell due do you regret it mrs lismore said to her husband not for a moment he answered they decided on pursuing their journey as far as munich mrs lismores taste for music was matched by ernests taste for painting in his leisure hours he cultivated the art and delighted in it the picturegalleries of munich were almost the only galleries in europe which he had not seen true to the engagements to which she had pledged herself his wife was willing to go wherever it might please him to take her the one suggestion she made was that they should hire furnished apartments if they lived at a hotel friends of the husband or the wife visitors like themselves to the famous city might see their names in the book or might meet them at the door they were soon established in a house large enough to provide them with every accommodation which they required ernests days were passed in the galleries mrs lismore remaining at home devoted to her music until it was time to go out with her husband for a drive living together in perfect amity and concord they were nevertheless not living happily without any visible reason for the change mrs lismores spirits were depressed on the one occasion when ernest noticed it she made an effort to be cheerful which it distressed him to see he allowed her to think that she had relieved him of any further anxiety whatever doubts he might feel were doubts delicately concealed from that time forth but when two people are living together in a state of artificial tranquillity it seems to be a law of nature that the element of disturbance gathers unseen and that the outburst comes inevitably with the lapse of time in ten days from the date of their arrival at munich the crisis came ernest returned later than usual from the picturegallery and for the first time in his wifes experience shut himself up in his own room he appeared at the dinner hour with a futile excuse mrs lismore waited until the servant had withdrawn now ernest she said its time to tell me the truth her manner when she said those few words took him by surprise she was unquestionably confused and instead of looking at him she trifled with the fruit on her plate embarrassed on his side he could only answer i have nothing to tell were there many visitors at the gallery she asked about the same as usual any that you particularly noticed she went on i mean among the ladies he laughed uneasily you forget how interested i am in the pictures he said there was a pause she looked up at him and suddenly looked away again but he saw it plainly there were tears in her eyes do you mind turning down the gas she said my eyes have been weak all day he complied with her request the more readily having his own reasons for being glad to escape the glaring scrutiny of the light i think i will rest a little on the sofa she resumed in the position which he occupied his back would have been now turned on her she stopped him when he tried to move his chair i would rather not look at you ernest she said when you have lost confidence in me not the words but the tone touched all that was generous and noble in his nature he left his place and knelt beside her and opened to her his whole heart am i not unworthy of you he asked when it was over she pressed his hand in silence i should be the most ungrateful wretch living he said if i did not think of you and you only now that my confession is made we will leave munich tomorrow and if resolution can help me i will only remember the sweetest woman my eyes ever looked on as the creature of a dream she hid her face on his breast and reminded him of that letter of her writing which had decided the course of their lives when i thought you might meet the happy woman in my lifetime i said to you tell me of it and i promise to tell her that she has only to wait time must pass ernest before it can be needful to perform my promise but you might let me see her if you find her in the gallery tomorrow you might bring her here mrs lismores request met with no refusal ernest was only at a loss to know how to grant it you tell me she is a copyist of pictures his wife reminded him she will be interested in hearing of the portfolio of drawings by the great french artists which i bought for you in paris ask her to come and see them and to tell you if she can make some copies and say if you like that i shall be glad to become acquainted with her he felt her breath beating fast on his bosom in the fear that she might lose all control over herself he tried to relieve her by speaking lightly what an invention yours is he said if my wife ever tries to deceive me i shall be a mere child in her hands she rose abruptly from the sofa kissed him on the forehead and said wildly i shall be better in bed before he could move or speak she had left him the next morning he knocked at the door of his wifes room and asked how she had passed the night i have slept badly she answered and i must beg you to excuse my absence at breakfasttime she called him back as he was about to withdraw remember she said when you return from the gallery today i expect that you will not return alone three hours later he was at home again the young ladys services as a copyist were at his disposal she had returned with him to look at the drawings the sittingroom was empty when they entered it he rang for his wifes maid and was informed that mrs lismore had gone out refusing to believe the woman he went to his wifes apartments she was not to be found when he returned to the sittingroom the young lady was not unnaturally offended he could make allowances for her being a little out of temper at the slight that had been put on her but he was inexpressibly disconcerted by the manner almost the coarse manner in which she expressed herself i have been talking to your wifes maid while you have been away she said i find you have married an old lady for her money she is jealous of me of course let me beg you to alter your opinion he answered you are wronging my wife she is incapable of any such feeling as you attribute to her the young lady laughed at any rate you are a good husband she said satirically suppose you own the truth wouldnt you like her better if she was young and pretty like me he was not merely surprised he was disgusted her beauty had so completely fascinated him when he first saw her that the idea of associating any want of refinement and good breeding with such a charming creature never entered his mind the disenchantment to him was already so complete that he was even disagreeably affected by the tone of her voice it was almost as repellent to him as this exhibition of unrestrained bad temper which she seemed perfectly careless to conceal i confess you surprise me he said coldly the reply produced no effect on her on the contrary she became more insolent than ever i have a fertile fancy she went on and your absurd way of taking a joke only encourages me suppose you could transform this sour old wife of yours who has insulted me into the sweetest young creature that ever lived by only holding up your finger wouldnt you do it this passed the limits of his endurance i have no wish he said to forget the consideration which is due to a woman you leave me but one alternative he rose to go out of the room she ran to the door as he spoke and placed herself in the way of his going out he signed to her to let him pass she suddenly threw her arms round his neck kissed him passionately and whispered with her lips at his ear o ernest forgive me could i have asked you to marry me for my money if i had not taken refuge in a disguise when he had sufficiently recovered to think he put her back from him is there an end of the deception now he asked sternly am i to trust you in your new character you are not to be harder on me than i deserve she answered gently did you ever hear of an actress named miss max he began to understand her forgive me if i spoke harshly he said you have put me to a severe trial she burst into tears love she murmured is my only excuse from that moment she had won her pardon he took her hand and made her sit by him yes he said i have heard of miss max and of her wonderful powers of personation and i have always regretted not having seen her while she was on the stage did you hear anything more of her ernest yes i heard that she was a pattern of modesty and good conduct and that she gave up her profession at the height of her success to marry an old man will you come with me to my room she asked i have something there which i wish to show you it was the copy of her husbands will read the lines ernest which begin at the top of the page let my dead husband speak for me the lines ran thus my motive in marrying miss max must be stated in this place in justice to her and i will venture to add in justice to myself i felt the sincerest sympathy for her position she was without father mother or friends one of the poor forsaken children whom the mercy of the foundling hospital provides with a home her after life on the stage was the life of a virtuous woman persecuted by profligates insulted by some of the baser creatures associated with her to whom she was an object of envy i offered her a home and the protection of a father on the only terms which the world would recognise as worthy of us my experience of her since our marriage has been the experience of unvarying goodness sweetness and sound sense she has behaved so nobly in a trying position that i wish her even in this life to have her reward i entreat her to make a second choice in marriage which shall not be a mere form i firmly believe that she will choose well and wisely that she will make the happiness of a man who is worthy of her and that as wife and mother she will set an example of inestimable value in the social sphere that she occupies in proof of the heartfelt sincerity with which i pay my tribute to her virtues i add to this my will the clause that follows with the clause that followed ernest was already acquainted will you now believe that i never loved till i saw your face for the first time said his wife i had no experience to place me on my guard against the fascination the madness some people might call it which possesses a woman when all her heart is given to a man dont despise me my dear remember that i had to save you from disgrace and ruin besides my old stage remembrances tempted me i had acted in a play in which the heroine did what i have done it didnt end with me as it did with her in the story she was represented as rejoicing in the success of her disguise i have known some miserable hours of doubt and shame since our marriage when i went to meet you in my own person at the picturegallery oh what relief what joy i felt when i saw how you admired me it was not because i could no longer carry on the disguise i was able to get hours of rest from the effort not only at night but in the daytime when i was shut up in my retirement in the musicroom and when my maid kept watch against discovery no my love i hurried on the disclosure because i could no longer endure the hateful triumph of my own deception ah look at that witness against me i cant bear even to see it she abruptly left him the drawer that she had opened to take out the copy of the will also contained the false gray hair which she had discarded it had only that moment attracted her notice she snatched it up and turned to the fireplace ernest took it from her before she could destroy it give it to me he said why he drew her gently to his bosom and answered i must not forget my old wife the philosopher in the apple orchard by anthony hope it was a charmingly mild and balmy day the sun shone beyond the orchard and the shade was cool inside a light breeze stirred the boughs of the old appletree under which the philosopher sat none of these things did the philosopher notice unless it might be when the wind blew about the leaves of the large volume on his knees and he had to find his place again then he would exclaim against the wind shuffle the leaves till he got the right page and settle to his reading the book was a treatise on ontology it was written by another philosopher a friend of this philosophers it bristled with fallacies and this philosopher was discovering them all and noting them on the flyleaf at the end he was not going to review the book as some might have thought from his behaviour or even to answer it in a work of his own it was just that he found a pleasure in stripping any poor fallacy naked and crucifying it presently a girl in a white frock came into the orchard she picked up an apple bit it and found it ripe holding it in her hand she walked up to where the philosopher sat and looked at him he did not stir she took a bite out of the apple munched it and swallowed it the philosopher crucified a fallacy on the flyleaf the girl flung the apple away mr jerningham said she are you very busy the philosopher pencil in hand looked up no miss may said he not very because i want your opinion in one moment said the philosopher apologetically he turned back to the flyleaf and began to nail the last fallacy a little tighter to the cross the girl regarded him first with amused impatience then with a vexed frown finally with a wistful regret he was so very old for his age she thought he could not be much beyond thirty his hair was thick and full of waves his eyes bright and clear his complexion not yet divested of all youths relics now miss may im at your service said the philosopher with a lingering look at his impaled fallacy and he closed the book keeping it however on his knee the girl sat down just opposite to him its a very important thing i want to ask you she began tugging at a tuft of grass and its very difficult and you mustnt tell any one i asked you at least id rather you didnt i shall not speak of it indeed i shall probably not remember it said the philosopher and you mustnt look at me please while im asking you i dont think i was looking at you but if i was i beg your pardon said the philosopher apologetically she pulled the tuft of grass right out of the ground and flung it from her with all her force suppose a man she began no thats not right you can take any hypothesis you please observed the philosopher but you must verify it afterward of course oh do let me go on suppose a girl mr jerningham i wish you wouldnt nod it was only to show that i followed you oh of course you follow me as you call it suppose a girl had two lovers youre nodding again or i ought to say suppose there were two men who might be in love with a girl only two asked the philosopher you see any number of men might be in love with oh we can leave the rest out said miss may with a sudden dimple they dont matter very well said the philosopher if they are irrelevant we will put them aside suppose then that one of these men was oh awfully in love with the girl and and proposed you know a moment said the philosopher opening a notebook let me take down his proposition what was it why proposed to her asked her to marry him said the girl with a stare dear me how stupid of me i forgot that special use of the word yes the girl likes him pretty well and her people approve of him and all that you know that simplifies the problem said the philosopher nodding again but shes not in in love with him you know she doesnt really care for him much do you understand perfectly it is a most natural state of mind well then suppose that theres another man what are you writing i only put down b like that pleaded the philosopher meekly exhibiting his notebook she looked at him in a sort of helpless exasperation with just a smile somewhere in the background of it oh you really are she exclaimed but let me go on the other man is a friend of the girls hes very clever oh fearfully clever and hes rather handsome you neednt put that down it is certainly not very material admitted the philosopher and he crossed out handsome clever he left and the girl is most awfully she admires him tremendously she thinks him just the greatest man that ever lived you know and she she the girl paused im following said the philosopher with pencil poised shed think it better than the whole world if if she could be anything to him you know you mean become his wife well of course i do at least i suppose i do you spoke rather vaguely you know the girl cast one glance at the philosopher as she replied well yes i did mean become his wife yes well but continued the girl starting on another tuft of grass he doesnt think much about those things he likes her i think he likes her well doesnt dislike her suggested the philosopher shall we call him indifferent i dont know yes rather indifferent i dont think he thinks about it you know but she shes pretty you neednt put that down i was not about to do so observed the philosopher she thinks life with him would be just heaven and and she thinks she would make him awfully happy she would would be so proud of him you see i see yes and i dont know how to put it quite she thinks that if he ever thought about it at all he might care for her because he doesnt care for anybody else and shes pretty you said that before oh dear i dare say i did and most men care for somebody dont they some girl i mean most men no doubt conceded the philosopher well then what ought she to do its not a real thing you know mr jerningham its in in a novel i was reading she said this hastily and blushed as she spoke dear me and its quite an interesting case yes i see the question is will she act most wisely in accepting the offer of the man who loves her exceedingly but for whom she entertains only a moderate affection yes just a liking hes just a friend exactly or in marrying the other whom she loves ex thats not it how can she marry him he hasnt he hasnt asked her you see true i forgot let us assume though for the moment that he has asked her she would then have to consider which marriage would probably be productive of the greater sum total of oh but you neednt consider that but it seems the best logical order we can afterward make allowance for the element of uncertainty caused by oh no i dont want it like that i know perfectly well which shed do if he the other man you know asked her you apprehend that never mind what i apprehend take it as i told you very good a has asked her hand b has not yes may i take it that but for the disturbing influence of b a would be a satisfactory er candidate ye es i think so she therefore enjoys a certainty of considerable happiness if she marries a ye es not perfect because of b you know quite so quite so but still a fair amount of happiness is it not so i dont well perhaps on the other hand if b did ask her we are to postulate a higher degree of happiness for her yes please mr jerningham much higher for both of them for her never mind him very well that again simplifies the problem but his asking her is a contingency only yes thats all the philosopher spread out his hands my dear young lady he said it becomes a question of degree how probable or improbable is it i dont know not very probable unless well unless he did happen to notice you know ah yes we supposed that if he thought of it he would probably take the desired step at least that he might be led to do so could she not er indicate her preference she might try no she couldnt do much you see he he doesnt think about such things i understand precisely and it seems to me miss may that in that very fact we find our solution do we she asked i think so he has evidently no natural inclination toward her perhaps not toward marriage at all any feeling aroused in him would be necessarily shallow and in a measure artificial and in all likelihood purely temporary moreover if she took steps to arouse his attention one of two things would be likely to happen are you following me yes mr jerningham either he would be repelled by her overtures which you must admit is not improbable and then the position would be unpleasant and even degrading for her or on the other hand he might through a misplaced feeling of gallantry through what through a mistaken idea of politeness or a mistaken view of what was kind allow himself to be drawn into a connection for which he had no genuine liking you agree with me that one or other of these things would be likely yes i suppose they would unless he did come to care for her ah you return to that hypothesis i think its an extremely fanciful one no she need not marry a but she must let b alone the philosopher closed his book took off his glasses wiped them replaced them and leaned back against the trunk of the appletree the girl picked a dandelion in pieces after a long pause she asked you think bs feelings wouldnt be at all likely to to change that depends on the sort of man he is but if he is an able man with intellectual interests which engross him a man who has chosen his path in life a man to whom womens society is not a necessity hes just like that said the girl and she bit the head off a daisy then said the philosopher i see not the least reason for supposing that his feelings will change and would you advise her to marry the other a well on the whole i should a is a good fellow i think we made a a good fellow he is a suitable match his love for her is true and genuine its tremendous yes and er extreme she likes him there is every reason to hope that her liking will develop into a sufficiently deep and stable affection she will get rid of her folly about b and make a a good wife yes miss may if i were the author of your novel i should make her marry a and i should call that a happy ending a silence followed it was broken by the philosopher is that all you wanted my opinion about miss may he asked with his finger between the leaves of the treatise on ontology yes i think so i hope i havent bored you ive enjoyed the discussion extremely i had no idea that novels raised points of such psychological interest i must find time to read one the girl had shifted her position till instead of her full face her profile was turned toward him looking away toward the paddock that lay brilliant in sunshine on the skirts of the apple orchard she asked in low slow tones twisting her hands in her lap dont you think that perhaps if b found out afterward when she had married a you know that she had cared for him so very very much he might be a little sorry if he were a gentleman he would regret it deeply i mean sorry on his own account that that he had thrown away all that you know the philosopher looked meditative i think he pronounced that it is very possible he would i can well imagine it he might never find anybody to love him like that again she said gazing on the gleaming paddock he probably would not agreed the philosopher and and most people like being loved dont they to crave for love is an almost universal instinct miss may yes almost she said with a dreary little smile you see hell get old and and have no one to look after him he will and no home well in a sense none corrected the philosopher smiling but really youll frighten me im a bachelor myself you know miss may yes she whispered just audibly and all your terrors are before me well unless oh we neednt have that unless laughed the philosopher cheerfully theres no unless about it miss may the girl jumped to her feet for an instant she looked at the philosopher she opened her lips as if to speak and at the thought of what lay at her tongues tip her face grew red but the philosopher was gazing past her and his eyes rested in calm contemplation on the gleaming paddock a beautiful thing sunshine to be sure said he her blush faded away into paleness her lips closed without speaking she turned and walked slowly away her head drooping the philosopher heard the rustle of her skirt in the long grass of the orchard he watched her for a few moments a pretty graceful creature said he with a smile then he opened his book took his pencil in his hand and slipped in a careful forefinger to mark the flyleaf the sun had passed midheaven and began to decline westward before he finished the book then he stretched himself and looked at his watch good gracious two oclock i shall be late for lunch and he hurried to his feet he was very late for lunch everythings cold wailed his hostess where have you been mr jerningham only in the orchardreading and youve missed may missed miss may how do you mean i had a long talk with her this morning a most interesting talk but you werent here to say goodby now you dont mean to say that you forgot that she was leaving by the twooclock train what a man you are dear me to think of my forgetting it said the philosopher shamefacedly she told me to say goodbye to you for her shes very kind i cant forgive myself his hostess looked at him for a moment then she sighed and smiled and sighed again have you everything you want she asked everything thank you said he sitting down opposite the cheese and propping his book he thought he would just run through the last chapter again against the loaf everything in the world that i want thanks his hostess did not tell him that the girl had come in from the apple orchard and run hastily upstairs lest her friend should see what her friend did see in her eyes so that he had no suspicion at all that he had received an offer of marriage and refused it and he did not refer to anything of that sort when he paused once in his reading and exclaimed im really sorry i missed miss may that was an interesting case of hers but i gave the right answer the girl ought to marry a and so the girl did
