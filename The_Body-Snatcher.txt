the bodysnatcher every night in the year four of us sat in the small parlour of the george at debenham the undertaker and the landlord and fettes and myself sometimes there would be more but blow high blow low come rain or snow or frost we four would be each planted in his own particular armchair fettes was an old drunken scotsman a man of education obviously and a man of some property since he lived in idleness he had come to debenham years ago while still young and by a mere continuance of living had grown to be an adopted townsman his blue camlet cloak was a local antiquity like the churchspire his place in the parlour at the george his absence from church his old crapulous disreputable vices were all things of course in debenham he had some vague radical opinions and some fleeting infidelities which he would now and again set forth and emphasize with tottering slaps upon the table he drank rum five glasses regularly every evening and for the greater portion of his nightly visit to the george sat with his glass in his right hand in a state of melancholy alcoholic saturation we called him the doctor for he was supposed to have some special knowledge of medicine and had been known upon a pinch to set a fracture or reduce a dislocation but beyond these slight particulars we had no knowledge of his character and antecedents one dark winter night it had struck nine some time before the landlord joined us there was a sick man in the george a great neighbouring proprietor suddenly struck down with apoplexy on his way to parliament and the great mans still greater london doctor had been telegraphed to his bedside it was the first time that such a thing had happened in debenham for the railway was but newly open and we were all proportionately moved by the occurrence hes come said the landlord after he had filled and lighted his pipe he said i who not the doctor himself replied our host what is his name dr macfarlane said the landlord fettes was far through his third tumbler stupidly fuddled now nodding over now staring mazily around him but at the last word he seemed to awaken and repeated the name macfarlane twice quietly enough the first time but with sudden emotion at the second yes said the landlord thats his name doctor wolfe macfarlane fettes became instantly sober his eyes awoke his voice became clear loud and steady his language forcible and earnest we were all startled by the transformation as if a man had risen from the dead i beg your pardon he said i am afraid i have not been paying much attention to your talk who is this wolfe macfarlane and then when he had heard the landlord out it cannot be it cannot be he added and yet i would like well to see him face to face do you know him doctor asked the undertaker with a gasp god forbid was the reply and yet the name is a strange one it were too much to fancy two tell me landlord is he old well said the host hes not a young man to be sure and his hair is white but he looks younger than you he is older though years older but with a slap upon the table its the rum you see in my face rum and sin this man perhaps may have an easy conscience and a good digestion conscience hear me speak you would think i was some good old decent christian would you not but no not i i never canted voltaire might have canted if hed stood in my shoes but the brains with a rattling fillip on his bald head the brains were clear and active and i saw and made no deductions if you know this doctor i ventured to remark after a somewhat awful pause i should gather that you do not share the landlords good opinion fettes paid no regard to me yes he said with sudden decision i must see him face to face there was another pause and then a door was closed rather sharply on the first floor and a step was heard upon the stair thats the doctor cried the landlord look sharp and you can catch him it was but two steps from the small parlour to the door of the old george inn the wide oak staircase landed almost in the street there was room for a turkey rug and nothing more between the threshold and the last round of the descent but this little space was every evening brilliantly lit up not only by the light upon the stair and the great signallamp below the sign but by the warm radiance of the barroom window the george thus brightly advertised itself to passersby in the cold street fettes walked steadily to the spot and we who were hanging behind beheld the two men meet as one of them had phrased it face to face dr macfarlane was alert and vigorous his white hair set off his pale and placid although energetic countenance he was richly dressed in the finest of broadcloth and the whitest of linen with a great gold watchchain and studs and spectacles of the same precious material he wore a broadfolded tie white and speckled with lilac and he carried on his arm a comfortable drivingcoat of fur there was no doubt but he became his years breathing as he did of wealth and consideration and it was a surprising contrast to see our parlour sot bald dirty pimpled and robed in his old camlet cloak confront him at the bottom of the stairs macfarlane he said somewhat loudly more like a herald than a friend the great doctor pulled up short on the fourth step as though the familiarity of the address surprised and somewhat shocked his dignity toddy macfarlane repeated fettes the london man almost staggered he stared for the swiftest of seconds at the man before him glanced behind him with a sort of scare and then in a startled whisper fettes he said you ay said the other me did you think i was dead too we are not so easy shut of our acquaintance hush hush exclaimed the doctor hush hush this meeting is so unexpected i can see you are unmanned i hardly knew you i confess at first but i am overjoyed overjoyed to have this opportunity for the present it must be howdyedo and goodbye in one for my fly is waiting and i must not fail the train but you shall let me see yes you shall give me your address and you can count on early news of me we must do something for you fettes i fear you are out at elbows but we must see to that for auld lang syne as once we sang at suppers money cried fettes money from you the money that i had from you is lying where i cast it in the rain dr macfarlane had talked himself into some measure of superiority and confidence but the uncommon energy of this refusal cast him back into his first confusion a horrible ugly look came and went across his almost venerable countenance my dear fellow he said be it as you please my last thought is to offend you i would intrude on none i will leave you my address however i do not wish it i do not wish to know the roof that shelters you interrupted the other i heard your name i feared it might be you i wished to know if after all there were a god i know now that there is none begone he still stood in the middle of the rug between the stair and the doorway and the great london physician in order to escape would be forced to step to one side it was plain that he hesitated before the thought of this humiliation white as he was there was a dangerous glitter in his spectacles but while he still paused uncertain he became aware that the driver of his fly was peering in from the street at this unusual scene and caught a glimpse at the same time of our little body from the parlour huddled by the corner of the bar the presence of so many witnesses decided him at once to flee he crouched together brushing on the wainscot and made a dart like a serpent striking for the door but his tribulation was not yet entirely at an end for even as he was passing fettes clutched him by the arm and these words came in a whisper and yet painfully distinct have you seen it again the great rich london doctor cried out aloud with a sharp throttling cry he dashed his questioner across the open space and with his hands over his head fled out of the door like a detected thief before it had occurred to one of us to make a movement the fly was already rattling toward the station the scene was over like a dream but the dream had left proofs and traces of its passage next day the servant found the find gold spectacles broken on the threshold and that very night we were all standing breathless by the barroom window and fettes at our side sober pale and resolute in look god protect us mr fettes said the landlord coming first into possession of his customary senses what in the universe is all this these are strange things you have been saying fettes turned toward us he looked us each in succession in the face see if you can hold your tongues said he that man macfarlane is not safe to cross those that have done so already have repented it too late and then without so much as finishing his third glass far less waiting for the other two he bade us goodbye and went forth under the lamp of the hotel into the black night we three turned to our places in the parlour with the big red fire and four clear candles and as we recapitulated what had passed the first chill of our surprise soon changed into a glow of curiosity we sat late it was the latest session i have known in the old george each man before we parted had his theory that he was bound to prove and none of us had any nearer business in this world than to track out the past of our condemned companion and surprise the secret that he shared with the great london doctor it is no great boast but i believe i was a better hand at worming out a story than either of my fellows at the george and perhaps there is now no other man alive who could narrate to you the following foul and unnatural events in his young days fettes studied medicine in the schools of edinburgh he had talent of a kind the talent that picks up swiftly what it hears and readily retails it for its own he worked little at home but he was civil attentive and intelligent in the presence of his masters they soon picked him out as a lad who listened closely and remembered well nay strange as it seemed to me when i first heard it he was in those days well favoured and pleased by his exterior there was at that period a certain extramural teacher of anatomy whom i shall here designate by the letter k his name was subsequently too well known the man who bore it skulked through the streets of edinburgh in disguise while the mob that applauded at the execution of burke called loudly for the blood of his employer but mr k was then at the top of his vogue he enjoyed a popularity due partly to his own talent and address partly to the incapacity of his rival the university professor the students at least swore by his name and fettes believed himself and was believed by others to have laid the foundations of success when he had acquired the favour of this meteorically famous man mr k was a bon vivant as well as an accomplished teacher he liked a sly allusion no less than a careful preparation in both capacities fettes enjoyed and deserved his notice and by the second year of his attendance he held the halfregular position of second demonstrator or subassistant in his class in this capacity the charge of the theatre and lectureroom devolved in particular upon his shoulders he had to answer for the cleanliness of the premises and the conduct of the other students and it was a part of his duty to supply receive and divide the various subjects it was with a view to this last at that time very delicate affair that he was lodged by mr k in the same wynd and at last in the same building with the dissectingrooms here after a night of turbulent pleasures his hand still tottering his sight still misty and confused he would be called out of bed in the black hours before the winter dawn by the unclean and desperate interlopers who supplied the table he would open the door to these men since infamous throughout the land he would help them with their tragic burthen pay them their sordid price and remain alone when they were gone with the unfriendly relics of humanity from such a scene he would return to snatch another hour or two of slumber to repair the abuses of the night and refresh himself for the labours of the day few lads could have been more insensible to the impressions of a life thus passed among the ensigns of mortality his mind was closed against all general considerations he was incapable of interest in the fate and fortunes of another the slave of his own desires and low ambitions cold light and selfish in the last resort he had that modicum of prudence miscalled morality which keeps a man from inconvenient drunkenness or punishable theft he coveted besides a measure of consideration from his masters and his fellowpupils and he had no desire to fail conspicuously in the external parts of life thus he made it his pleasure to gain some distinction in his studies and day after day rendered unimpeachable eyeservice to his employer mr k for his day of work he indemnified himself by nights of roaring blackguardly enjoyment and when that balance had been struck the organ that he called his conscience declared itself content the supply of subjects was a continual trouble to him as well as to his master in that large and busy class the raw material of the anatomists kept perpetually running out and the business thus rendered necessary was not only unpleasant in itself but threatened dangerous consequences to all who were concerned it was the policy of mr k to ask no questions in his dealings with the trade they bring the boy and we pay the price he used to say dwelling on the alliteration quid pro quo and again and somewhat profanely ask no questions he would tell his assistants for conscience sake there was no understanding that the subjects were provided by the crime of murder had that idea been broached to him in words he would have recoiled in horror but the lightness of his speech upon so grave a matter was in itself an offence against good manners and a temptation to the men with whom he dealt fettes for instance had often remarked to himself upon the singular freshness of the bodies he had been struck again and again by the hangdog abominable looks of the ruffians who came to him before the dawn and putting things together clearly in his private thoughts he perhaps attributed a meaning too immoral and too categorical to the unguarded counsels of his master he understood his duty in short to have three branches to take what was brought to pay the price and to avert the eye from any evidence of crime one november morning this policy of silence was put sharply to the test he had been awake all night with a racking toothache pacing his room like a caged beast or throwing himself in fury on his bed and had fallen at last into that profound uneasy slumber that so often follows on a night of pain when he was awakened by the third or fourth angry repetition of the concerted signal there was a thin bright moonshine it was bitter cold windy and frosty the town had not yet awakened but an indefinable stir already preluded the noise and business of the day the ghouls had come later than usual and they seemed more than usually eager to be gone fettes sick with sleep lighted them upstairs he heard their grumbling irish voices through a dream and as they stripped the sack from their sad merchandise he leaned dozing with his shoulder propped against the wall he had to shake himself to find the men their money as he did so his eyes lighted on the dead face he started he took two steps nearer with the candle raised god almighty he cried that is jane galbraith the men answered nothing but they shuffled nearer the door i know her i tell you he continued she was alive and hearty yesterday its impossible she can be dead its impossible you should have got this body fairly sure sir youre mistaken entirely said one of the men but the other looked fettes darkly in the eyes and demanded the money on the spot it was impossible to misconceive the threat or to exaggerate the danger the lads heart failed him he stammered some excuses counted out the sum and saw his hateful visitors depart no sooner were they gone than he hastened to confirm his doubts by a dozen unquestionable marks he identified the girl he had jested with the day before he saw with horror marks upon her body that might well betoken violence a panic seized him and he took refuge in his room there he reflected at length over the discovery that he had made considered soberly the bearing of mr ks instructions and the danger to himself of interference in so serious a business and at last in sore perplexity determined to wait for the advice of his immediate superior the class assistant this was a young doctor wolfe macfarlane a high favourite among all the reckless students clever dissipated and unscrupulous to the last degree he had travelled and studied abroad his manners were agreeable and a little forward he was an authority on the stage skilful on the ice or the links with skate or golfclub he dressed with nice audacity and to put the finishing touch upon his glory he kept a gig and a strong trottinghorse with fettes he was on terms of intimacy indeed their relative positions called for some community of life and when subjects were scarce the pair would drive far into the country in macfarlanes gig visit and desecrate some lonely graveyard and return before dawn with their booty to the door of the dissectingroom on that particular morning macfarlane arrived somewhat earlier than his wont fettes heard him and met him on the stairs told him his story and showed him the cause of his alarm macfarlane examined the marks on her body yes he said with a nod it looks fishy well what should i do asked fettes do repeated the other do you want to do anything least said soonest mended i should say someone else might recognize her objected fettes she was as well known as the castle rock well hope not said macfarlane and if anybody does well you didnt dont you see and theres an end the fact is this has been going on too long stir up the mud and youll get k into the most unholy trouble youll be in a shocking box yourself so will i if you come to that i should like to know how any one of us would look or what the devil we should have to say for ourselves in any christian witnessbox for me you know theres one thing certain that practically speaking all our subjects have been murdered macfarlane cried fettes come now sneered the other as if you hadnt suspected it yourself suspecting is one thing and proof another yes i know and im as sorry as you are this should have come here tapping the body with his cane the next best thing for me is not to recognize it and he added coolly i dont you may if you please i dont dictate but i think a man of the world would do as i do and i may add i fancy that is what k would look for at our hands the question is why did he choose us two for his assistants and i answer because he didnt want old wives this was the tone of all others to affect the mind of a lad like fettes he agreed to imitate macfarlane the body of the unfortunate girl was duly dissected and no one remarked or appeared to recognize her one afternoon when his days work was over fettes dropped into a popular tavern and found macfarlane sitting with a stranger this was a small man very pale and dark with coalblack eyes the cut of his features gave a promise of intellect and refinement which was but feebly realized in his manners for he proved upon a nearer acquaintance coarse vulgar and stupid he exercised however a very remarkable control over macfarlane issued orders like the great bashaw became inflamed at the least discussion or delay and commented rudely on the servility with which he was obeyed this most offensive person took a fancy to fettes on the spot plied him with drinks and honoured him with unusual confidences on his past career if a tenth part of what he confessed were true he was a very loathsome rogue and the lads vanity was tickled by the attention of so experienced a man im a pretty bad fellow myself the stranger remarked but macfarlane is the boy toddy macfarlane i call him toddy order your friend another glass or it might be toddy you jump up and shut the door toddy hates me he said again oh yes toddy you do dont you call me that confounded name growled macfarlane hear him did you ever see the lads play knife he would like to do that all over my body remarked the stranger we medicals have a better way than that said fettes when we dislike a dead friend of ours we dissect him macfarlane looked up sharply as though this jest was scarcely to his mind the afternoon passed gray for that was the strangers name invited fettes to join them at dinner ordered a feast so sumptuous that the tavern was thrown in commotion and when all was done commanded macfarlane to settle the bill it was late before they separated the man gray was incapably drunk macfarlane sobered by his fury chewed the cud of the money he had been forced to squander and the slights he had been obliged to swallow fettes with various liquors singing in his head returned home with devious footsteps and a mind entirely in abeyance next day macfarlane was absent from the class and fettes smiled to himself as he imagined him still squiring the intolerable gray from tavern to tavern as soon as the hour of liberty had struck he posted from place to place in quest of his last nights companions he could find them however nowhere so returned early to his rooms went early to bed and slept the sleep of the just at four in the morning he was awakened by the wellknown signal descending to the door he was filled with astonishment to find macfarlane with his gig and in the gig one of those long and ghastly packages with which he was so well acquainted what he cried have you been out alone how did you manage but macfarlane silenced him roughly bidding him turn to business when they had got the body upstairs and laid it on the table macfarlane made at first as if he were going away then he paused and seemed to hesitate and then you had better look at the face said he in tones of some constraint you had better he repeated as fettes only stared at him in wonder but where and how and when did you come by it cried the other look at the face was the only answer fettes was staggered strange doubts assailed him he looked from the young doctor to the body and then back again at last with a start he did as he was bidden he had almost expected the sight that met his eyes and yet the shock was cruel to see fixed in the rigidity of death and naked on that coarse layer of sackcloth the man whom he had left wellclad and full of meat and sin upon the threshold of a tavern awoke even in the thoughtless fettes some of the terrors of the conscience it was a cras tibi which reechoed in his soul that two whom he had known should have come to lie upon these icy tables yet these were only secondary thoughts his first concern regarded wolfe unprepared for a challenge so momentous he knew not how to look his comrade in the face he durst not meet his eye and he had neither words nor voice at his command it was macfarlane himself who made the first advance he came up quietly behind and laid his hand gently but firmly on the others shoulder richardson said he may have the head now richardson was a student who had long been anxious for that portion of the human subject to dissect there was no answer and the murderer resumed talking of business you must pay me your accounts you see must tally fettes found a voice the ghost of his own pay you he cried pay you for that why yes of course you must by all means and on every possible account you must returned the other i dare not give it for nothing you dare not take it for nothing it would compromise us both this is another case like jane galbraiths the more things are wrong the more we must act as if all were right where does old k keep his money there answered fettes hoarsely pointing to a cupboard in the corner give me the key then said the other calmly holding out his hand there was an instants hesitation and the die was cast macfarlane could not suppress a nervous twitch the infinitesimal mark of an immense relief as he felt the key between his fingers he opened the cupboard brought out pen and ink and a paperbook that stood in one compartment and separated from the funds in a drawer a sum suitable to the occasion now look here he said there is the payment made first proof of your good faith first step to your security you have now to clinch it by a second enter the payment in your book and then you for your part may defy the devil the next few seconds were for fettes an agony of thought but in balancing his terrors it was the most immediate that triumphed any future difficulty seemed almost welcome if he could avoid a present quarrel with macfarlane he set down the candle which he had been carrying all the time and with a steady hand entered the date the nature and the amount of the transaction and now said macfarlane its only fair that you should pocket the lucre ive had my share already bytheby when a man of the world falls into a bit of luck has a few shillings extra in his pocket im ashamed to speak of it but theres a rule of conduct in the case no treating no purchase of expensive classbooks no squaring of old debts borrow dont lend macfarlane began fettes still somewhat hoarsely i have put my neck in a halter to oblige you to oblige me cried wolfe oh come you did as near as i can see the matter what you downright had to do in selfdefence suppose i got into trouble where would you be this second little matter flows clearly from the first mr gray is the continuation of miss galbraith you cant begin and then stop if you begin you must keep on beginning thats the truth no rest for the wicked a horrible sense of blackness and the treachery of fate seized hold upon the soul of the unhappy student my god he cried but what have i done and when did i begin to be made a class assistant in the name of reason wheres the harm in that service wanted the position service might have got it would he have been where i am now my dear fellow said macfarlane what a boy you are what harm has come to you what harm can come to you if you hold your tongue why man do you know what this life is there are two squads of us the lions and the lambs if youre a lamb youll come to lie upon these tables like gray or jane galbraith if youre a lion youll live and drive a horse like me like k like all the world with any wit or courage youre staggered at the first but look at k my dear fellow youre clever you have pluck i like you and k likes you you were born to lead the hunt and i tell you on my honour and my experience of life three days from now youll laugh at all these scarecrows like a highschool boy at a farce and with that macfarlane took his departure and drove off up the wynd in his gig to get under cover before daylight fettes was thus left alone with his regrets he saw the miserable peril in which he stood involved he saw with inexpressible dismay that there was no limit to his weakness and that from concession to concession he had fallen from the arbiter of macfarlanes destiny to his paid and helpless accomplice he would have given the world to have been a little braver at the time but it did not occur to him that he might still be brave the secret of jane galbraith and the cursed entry in the daybook closed his mouth hours passed the class began to arrive the members of the unhappy gray were dealt out to one and to another and received without remark richardson was made happy with the head and before the hour of freedom rang fettes trembled with exultation to perceive how far they had already gone toward safety for two days he continued to watch with increasing joy the dreadful process of disguise on the third day macfarlane made his appearance he had been ill he said but he made up for lost time by the energy with which he directed the students to richardson in particular he extended the most valuable assistance and advice and that student encouraged by the praise of the demonstrator burned high with ambitious hopes and saw the medal already in his grasp before the week was out macfarlanes prophecy had been fulfilled fettes had outlived his terrors and had forgotten his baseness he began to plume himself upon his courage and had so arranged the story in his mind that he could look back on these events with an unhealthy pride of his accomplice he saw but little they met of course in the business of the class they received their orders together from mr k at times they had a word or two in private and macfarlane was from first to last particularly kind and jovial but it was plain that he avoided any reference to their common secret and even when fettes whispered to him that he had cast in his lot with the lions and forsworn the lambs he only signed to him smilingly to hold his peace at length an occasion arose which threw the pair once more into a closer union mr k was again short of subjects pupils were eager and it was a part of this teachers pretensions to be always well supplied at the same time there came the news of a burial in the rustic graveyard of glencorse time has little changed the place in question it stood then as now upon a crossroad out of call of human habitations and buried fathom deep in the foliage of six cedar trees the cries of the sheep upon the neighbouring hills the streamlets upon either hand one loudly singing among pebbles the other dripping furtively from pond to pond the stir of the wind in mountainous old flowering chestnuts and once in seven days the voice of the bell and the old tunes of the precentor were the only sounds that disturbed the silence around the rural church the resurrection man to use a byname of the period was not to be deterred by any of the sanctities of customary piety it was part of his trade to despise and desecrate the scrolls and trumpets of old tombs the paths worn by the feet of worshippers and mourners and the offerings and the inscriptions of bereaved affection to rustic neighbourhoods where love is more than commonly tenacious and where some bonds of blood or fellowship unite the entire society of a parish the bodysnatcher far from being repelled by natural respect was attracted by the ease and safety of the task to bodies that had been laid in earth in joyful expectation of a far different awakening there came that hasty lamplit terrorhaunted resurrection of the spade and mattock the coffin was forced the cerements torn and the melancholy relics clad in sackcloth after being rattled for hours on moonless byways were at length exposed to uttermost indignities before a class of gaping boys somewhat as two vultures may swoop upon a dying lamb fettes and macfarlane were to be let loose upon a grave in that green and quiet restingplace the wife of a farmer a woman who had lived for sixty years and been known for nothing but good butter and a godly conversation was to be rooted from her grave at midnight and carried dead and naked to that faraway city that she had always honoured with her sunday best the place beside her family was to be empty till the crack of doom her innocent and almost venerable members to be exposed to that last curiosity of the anatomist late one afternoon the pair set forth well wrapped in cloaks and furnished with a formidable bottle it rained without remission a cold dense lashing rain now and again there blew a puff of wind but these sheets of falling water kept it down bottle and all it was a sad and silent drive as far as penicuik where they were to spend the evening they stopped once to hide their implements in a thick bush not far from the churchyard and once again at the fishers tryst to have a toast before the kitchen fire and vary their nips of whisky with a glass of ale when they reached their journeys end the gig was housed the horse was fed and comforted and the two young doctors in a private room sat down to the best dinner and the best wine the house afforded the lights the fire the beating rain upon the window the cold incongruous work that lay before them added zest to their enjoyment of the meal with every glass their cordiality increased soon macfarlane handed a little pile of gold to his companion a compliment he said between friends these little dd accommodations ought to fly like pipelights fettes pocketed the money and applauded the sentiment to the echo you are a philosopher he cried i was an ass till i knew you you and k between you by the lord harry but youll make a man of me of course we shall applauded macfarlane a man i tell you it required a man to back me up the other morning there are some big brawling fortyyearold cowards who would have turned sick at the look of the dd thing but not you you kept your head i watched you well and why not fettes thus vaunted himself it was no affair of mine there was nothing to gain on the one side but disturbance and on the other i could count on your gratitude dont you see and he slapped his pocket till the gold pieces rang macfarlane somehow felt a certain touch of alarm at these unpleasant words he may have regretted that he had taught his young companion so successfully but he had no time to interfere for the other noisily continued in this boastful strain the great thing is not to be afraid now between you and me i dont want to hang thats practical but for all cant macfarlane i was born with a contempt hell god devil right wrong sin crime and all the old gallery of curiosities they may frighten boys but men of the world like you and me despise them heres to the memory of gray it was by this time growing somewhat late the gig according to order was brought round to the door with both lamps brightly shining and the young men had to pay their bill and take the road they announced that they were bound for peebles and drove in that direction till they were clear of the last houses of the town then extinguishing the lamps returned upon their course and followed a byroad toward glencorse there was no sound but that of their own passage and the incessant strident pouring of the rain it was pitch dark here and there a white gate or a white stone in the wall guided them for a short space across the night but for the most part it was at a foot pace and almost groping that they picked their way through that resonant blackness to their solemn and isolated destination in the sunken woods that traverse the neighbourhood of the buryingground the last glimmer failed them and it became necessary to kindle a match and reillumine one of the lanterns of the gig thus under the dripping trees and environed by huge and moving shadows they reached the scene of their unhallowed labours they were both experienced in such affairs and powerful with the spade and they had scarce been twenty minutes at their task before they were rewarded by a dull rattle on the coffin lid at the same moment macfarlane having hurt his hand upon a stone flung it carelessly above his head the grave in which they now stood almost to the shoulders was close to the edge of the plateau of the graveyard and the gig lamp had been propped the better to illuminate their labours against a tree and on the immediate verge of the steep bank descending to the stream chance had taken a sure aim with the stone then came a clang of broken glass night fell upon them sounds alternately dull and ringing announced the bounding of the lantern down the bank and its occasional collision with the trees a stone or two which it had dislodged in its descent rattled behind it into the profundities of the glen and then silence like night resumed its sway and they might bend their hearing to its utmost pitch but naught was to be heard except the rain now marching to the wind now steadily falling over miles of open country they were so nearly at an end of their abhorred task that they judged it wisest to complete it in the dark the coffin was exhumed and broken open the body inserted in the dripping sack and carried between them to the gig one mounted to keep it in its place and the other taking the horse by the mouth groped along by wall and bush until they reached the wider road by the fishers tryst here was a faint diffused radiancy which they hailed like daylight by that they pushed the horse to a good pace and began to rattle along merrily in the direction of the town they had both been wetted to the skin during their operations and now as the gig jumped among the deep ruts the thing that stood propped between them fell now upon one and now upon the other at every repetition of the horrid contact each instinctively repelled it with greater haste and the process natural although it was began to tell upon the nerves of the companions macfarlane made some illfavoured jest about the farmers wife but it came hollowly from his lips and was allowed to drop in silence still their unnatural burthen bumped from side to side and now the head would be laid as if in confidence upon their shoulders and now the drenching sackcloth would flap icily about their faces a creeping chill began to possess the soul of fettes he peered at the bundle and it seemed somehow larger than at first all over the countryside and from every degree of distance the farm dogs accompanied their passage with tragic ululations and it grew and grew upon his mind that some unnatural miracle had been accomplished that some nameless change had befallen the dead body and that it was in fear of their unholy burden that the dogs were howling for gods sake said he making a great effort to arrive at speech for gods sake lets have a light seemingly macfarlane was affected in the same direction for though he made no reply he stopped the horse passed the reins to his companion got down and proceeded to kindle the remaining lamp they had by that time got no further than the crossroad down to auchendinny the rain still poured as though the deluge were returning and it was no easy matter to make a light in such a world of wet and darkness when at last the flickering blue flame had been transferred to the wick and began to expand and clarify and shed a wide circle of misty brightness round the gig it became possible for the two young men to see each other and the thing they had along with them the rain had moulded the rough sacking to the outlines of the body underneath the head was distinct from the trunk the shoulders plainly modelled something at once spectral and human riveted their eyes upon the ghastly comrade of their drive for some time macfarlane stood motionless holding up the lamp a nameless dread was swathed like a wet sheet about the body and tightened the white skin upon the face of fettes a fear that was meaningless a horror of what could not be kept mounting to his brain another beat of the watch and he had spoken but his
