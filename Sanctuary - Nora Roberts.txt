the house stood as it had for more than a century a grand tribute to mans vanity and brilliance near the dark shadows of the forest of live oaks where the river flowed in murky silence within the shelter of trees fireflies blinked gold and night creatures stirred braced to hunt or be hunted wild things bred there in shadows in secret there were no lights to brighten the tall narrow windows of sanctuary no lights to spread welcome over its graceful porches its grand doors night was deep and the breath of it moist from the sea the only sound to disturb it was of wind rustling through the leaves of the great oaks and the dry clickinglike bony fingersof the palm fronds the white columns stood like soldiers guarding the wide veranda but no one opened the enormous front door to greet her as she walked closer she could hear the crunch of sand and shells on the road under her feet wind chimes tinkled little notes of song the porch swing creaked on its chain but no one lazed upon it to enjoy the moon and the night the smell of jasmine and musk roses played on the air underscored by the salty scent of the sea she began to hear that too the low and steady thunder of water spilling over sand and sucking back into its own heart the beat of it that steady and patient pulse reminded all who inhabited the island of lost desire that the sea could reclaim the land and all on it at its whim still her mood lifted at the sound of it the music of home and childhood once she had run as free and wild through that forest as a deer had scouted its marshes raced along its sandy beaches with the careless privilege of youth now no longer a child she was home again she walked quickly hurrying up the steps across the veranda closing her hand over the big brass handle that glinted like a lost treasure the door was locked she twisted it right then left shoved against the thick mahogany panel let me in she thought as her heart began to thud in her chest ive come home ive come back but the door remained shut and locked when she pressed her face against the glass of the tall windows flanking it she could see nothing but darkness within and was afraid she ran now around the side of the house over the terrace where flowers streamed out of pots and lilies danced in chorus lines of bright color the music of the wind chimes became harsh and discordant the fluttering of fronds was a hiss of warning she struggled with the next door weeping as she beat her fists against it please please dont shut me out i want to come home she sobbed as she stumbled down the garden path she would go to the back in through the screened porch it was never lockedmama said a kitchen should always be open to company but she couldnt find it the trees sprang up thick and close the branches and draping moss barred her way she was lost tripping over roots in her confusion fighting to see through the dark as the canopy of trees closed out the moon the wind rose up and howled and slapped at her in flathanded punishing blows spears of saw palms struck out like swords she turned but where the path had been was now the river cutting her off from sanctuary the high grass along its slippery banks waved madly it was then she saw herself standing alone and weeping on the other bank it was then she knew she was dead jo fought her way out of the dream all but felt the sharp edges of it scraping her skin as she dragged herself to the surface of the tunnel of sleep her lungs burned and her face was wet with sweat and tears with a trembling hand she fumbled for the bedside lamp knocking both a book and an overfilled ashtray to the floor in her hurry to break out of the dark when the light shot on she drew her knees up close to her chest wrapped her arms around them and rocked herself calm it was just a dream she told herself just a bad dream she was home in her own bed in her apartment and miles from the island where sanctuary stood a grown woman of twentyseven had no business being spooked by a silly dream but she was still shaking when she reached for a cigarette it took her three tries to manage to light a match threefifteen she noted by the clock on the nightstand that was becoming typical there was nothing worse than the three am jitters she swung her legs over the side of the bed and bent down to pick up the overturned ashtray she told herself shed clean up the mess in the morning she sat there her oversized tshirt bunched over her thighs and ordered herself to get a grip she didnt know why her dreams were taking her back to the island of lost desire and the home shed escaped from at eighteen but jo figured any firstyear psych student could translate the rest of the symbolism the house was locked because she doubted anyone would welcome her if she did return home just lately shed given some thought to it but had wondered if shed lost the way back and she was nearing the age her mother had been when she had left the island disappeared abandoning her husband and three children without a second glance had annabelle ever dreamed of coming home jo wondered and dreamed the door was locked to her she didnt want to think about that didnt want to remember the woman who had broken her heart twenty years before jo reminded herself that she should be long over such things by now shed lived without her mother and without sanctuary and her family she had thrivedat least professionally tapping her cigarette absently jo glanced around the bedroom she kept it simple practical though shed traveled widely there were few mementos except the photographs shed matted and framed the blackandwhite prints choosing the ones among her work that she found the most restful to decorate the walls of the room where she slept there an empty park bench the black wrought iron all fluid curves and there a single willow its lacy leaves dipping low over a small glassy pool a moonlit garden was a study in shadow and texture and contrasting shapes the lonely beach with the sun just breaking the horizon tempted the viewer to step inside the photo and feel the sand rough underfoot shed hung that seascape only the week before after returning from an assignment on the outer banks of north carolina perhaps that was one reason shed begun to think about home jo decided shed been very close she could have traveled a bit south down to georgia and ferried from the mainland to the island there were no roads to desire no bridges spanning its sound but she hadnt gone south shed completed her assignment and come back to charlotte to bury herself in her work and her nightmares she crushed out the cigarette and stood there would be no more sleep she knew so she pulled on a pair of sweatpants she would do some darkroom work take her mind off things it was probably the book deal that was making her nervous she decided as she padded out of the bedroom it was a huge step in her career though she knew her work was good the offer from a major publishing house to create an art book from a collection of her photographs had been unexpected and thrilling natural studies by jo ellen hathaway she thought as she turned into the small galley kitchen to make coffee no that sounded like a science project glimpses of life pompous she smiled a little pushing back her smoky red hair and yawning she should just take the pictures and leave the title selection to the experts she knew when to step back and when to take a stand after all shed been doing one or the other most of her life maybe she would send a copy of the book home what would her family think of it would it end up gracing one of the coffee tables where an overnight guest could page through it and wonder if jo ellen hathaway was related to the hathaways who ran the inn at sanctuary would her father even open it at all and see what she had learned to do or would he simply shrug leave it untouched and go out to walk his island annabelles island it was doubtful he would take an interest in his oldest daughter now and it was foolish for that daughter to care jo shrugged the thought away took a plain blue mug from a hook while she waited for the coffee to brew she leaned on the counter and looked out her tiny window there were some advantages to being up and awake at three in the morning she decided the phone wouldnt ring no one would call or fax or expect anything of her for a few hours she didnt have to be anyone or do anything if her stomach was jittery and her head ached no one knew the weakness but herself below her kitchen window the streets were dark and empty slicked by latewinter rain a streetlamp spread a small pool of lightlonely fight jo thought there was no one to bask in it aloneness had such mystery she mused such endless possibilities it pulled at her as such scenes often did and she found herself leaving the scent of coffee grabbing her nikon and rushing out barefoot into the chilly night to photograph the deserted street it soothed her as nothing could with a camera in her hand and an image in her mind she could forget everything else her long feet splashed through chilly puddles as she experimented with angles with absent annoyance she flicked at her hair it wouldnt be falling in her face if shed had it trimmed but shed had no time so it swung heavily forward in a tousled wave and made her wish for an elastic band she took nearly a dozen shots before she was satisfied when she turned her gaze was drawn upward shed left the lights on she mused she hadnt even been aware shed turned on so many on the trip from bedroom to kitchen lips pursed she crossed the street and focused her camera again calculating she crouched shot at an upward angle and captured those lighted windows in the dark building den of the insomniac she felt dead then with a half laugh that echoed eerily enough to make her shudder she lowered the camera again god maybe she was losing her mind would a sane woman be out at three in the morning half dressed and shivering while she took pictures of her own windows she pressed her fingers against her eyes and wished more than anything else for the single thing that had always seemed to elude her normality you needed sleep to be normal she thought she hadnt had a full nights sleep in more than a month you needed regular meals shed lost ten pounds in the last few weeks and had watched her long rangy frame go bony you needed peace of mind she couldnt remember if she had ever laid claim to that friends certainly she had friends but no one close enough to call in the middle of the night to console her family well she had family of sorts a brother and sister whose lives no longer marched with hers a father who was almost a stranger a mother she hadnt seen or heard from in twenty years not my fault jo reminded herself as she started back across the street it was annabelles fault everything had changed when annabelle had run from sanctuary and left her baffled family crushed and heartbroken the trouble as jo saw it was that the rest of them hadnt gotten over it she had she hadnt stayed on the island guarding every grain of sand like her father did she hadnt dedicated her life to running and caring for sanctuary like her brother brian and she hadnt escaped into foolish fantasies or the next thrill the way her sister lexy had instead she had studied and she had worked and she had made a life for herself if she was a little shaky just now it was only because shed overextended was letting the pressure get to her she was a little rundown that was all shed just add some vitamins to her regiment and get back in shape of her pocket it had been three yearsno foursince she had last taken a trip without a specific assignment maybe mexico the west in dies someplace where the pace was slow and the sun hot slowing down and clearing her mind that was the way to get past this little blip in her life manila envelope that lay on the floor for a moment she simply stood one hand on the door the other holding her camera and stared at it had it been there when she left why was it there in the first place the first one had come a month before had been waiting in her stack of mail with only her name carefully printed across it her hands began to shake again as she ordered herself to close the door to lock it her breath hitched but she leaned over picked it up carefully she set the camera aside then unscaled the flap she tapped out the contents the sound she made was a long low moan the photograph was very professionally done perfectly cropped just as the other three had been a womans eyes heavylidded almondshaped with thick lashes and delicately arched brows jo knew their color would be blue deep blue because the eyes were her own in them was stark terror when was it taken how and why she pressed a hand to her mouth staring down at the photo knowing her eyes mirrored the shot perfectly terror swept through her had her rushing through the apartment into the small second bedroom shed converted to a darkroom frantically she yanked open a drawer pawed through the contents and found the envelopes shed buried there in each was another blackandwhite photo cropped to two by six inches her heartbeat was thundering in her ears as she lined them up in the first the eyes were closed as if shed been photographed while sleeping the others followed the waking process lashes barely lifted showing only a hint of iris in the third the eyes were open but unfocused and clouded with confusion they had disturbed her yes unsettled her certainly when she found them tucked in her mall but they hadnt frightened her now the last shot centered on her eyes frilly awake and bright with fear stepping back shivering jo struggled to be calm why only the eyes she asked herself how had someone gotten close enough to take these pictures without her being aware of it now whoever it was had been as close as the other side of her front door propelled by fresh panic she ran into the living room frantically checked the locks her heart was battering against her ribs when she fell back against the door then the anger kicked in bastard she thought he wanted her to be terrorized he wanted her to hide inside those rooms jumping at shadows afraid to step outside for fear hed be there watching she who had always been fearless was playing right into his hands she had wandered alone through foreign cities walked mean streets and empty ones shed climbed mountains and hacked through jungles with the camera as her shield shed never given a thought to fear and now because of a handful of photos her legs were jellied with it the fear had been building she admitted now growing and spiking over the weeks level by level it made her feel helpless so exposed so brutally alone jo pushed herself away from the door she couldnt and wouldnt live this way she would ignore it put it aside bury it deep god knew she was an expert at burying traumas small and large this was just one more she was going to drink her coerce and go to work by eight she had come till circlesliding through fatigue arcing through nervous energy creative calm then back to fatigue she couldnt work mechanically not even on the most basic aspect of darkroom chores she insisted on giving every step her full attention to do so shed had to calm down ditch both the anger and the fear over her first cup of coffee shed convinced herself she had figured out the reasoning behind the photos shed been receiving someone admired her work and was trying to get her attention engage her influence for their own that made sense occasionally she lectured or gave workshops in addition shed had three major shows in the last three years it wasnt that difficult or that extraordinary for someone to have taken her pictureseveral pictures for that matter that was certainly reasonable whoever it was had gotten creative that was all theyd enlarged the area cropped it and were sending the photos to her in a kind of series though the photos appeared to have been printed recently there was no telling when or where theyd been taken the negatives might be a year old or two or five they had certainly gotten her attention but shed overreacted taken it too personally over the last couple of years she had received samples of work from admirers of hers usually there was a letter attached praising her own photographs before the sender went into a pitch about wanting her advice or her help or in a few cases suggesting that they collaborate on a project the success she was enjoying professionally was still relatively new she wasnt yet used to the pressures that went along with commercial success or the expectations which could become burdensome and jo admitted as she ignored her unsteady stomach and sipped coffee that had gone stone cold she wasnt handling that success as well as she might she would handle it better she thought rolling her aching head on her aching shoulders if everyone would just leave her alone to do what she did best completed prints hung drying on the wet side of her darkroom her last batch of negatives had been developed and sitting on a stool at her work counter she slid a contact sheet onto her light board then studied it frame by frame through her loupe for a moment she felt a flash of panic and despair every print she looked at was out of focus blurry goddamn it goddamn it how could that be was it the whole roll she shifted blinked and watched the magnified image of rising dunes and oat grass pop clear with a sound somewhere between a grunt and a laugh she sat back rolled her tensed shoulders its not the prints that are blurry and out of focus you idiot she muttered aloud its you she set the loupe aside and closed her eyes to rest them she lacked the energy to get up and make more coffee she knew she should go eat get something solid into her system and she knew she should sleep stretch out on the bed close everything off and crash but she was afraid to in sleep she would lose this shaky control she was beginning to think she should see a doctor get something for her nerves before they frayed beyond repair but that idea made her think of psychiatrists undoubtedly they would want to poke and pry inside her brain and dig up matters she was determined to forget she would handle it she was good at handling herself or as brian had always said she was good at elbowing everyone out of her way so she could handle everything herself what choice had she hadhad any of them had when theyd been left alone to flounder on that damned spit of land miles from nowhere the rage that erupted inside her jolted her it was so sudden so powerful she trembled with it clenched her fists in her lap and had to bite back the hot words she wanted to spit out at the brother who wasnt even there tired she told herself she was just tired that was all she needed to put work aside take one of those overthecounter sleeping aids shed bought and had yet to try turn off the phone and get some sleep she would be steadier then stronger when a hand fell on her shoulder she ripped off a scream and sent her coffee mug flying jesus jesus jo bobby banes scrambled back scattering the mail he carried on the floor what are you doing what the hell are you doing she bolted off the stool and sent it crashing as he gaped at her i you said you wanted to get started at eight im only a few minutes late jo fought for breath gripped the edge of her worktable to keep herself upright eight her student assistant nodded cautiously he swallowed hard and kept his distance to his eye she still looked wild and ready to attack it was his second semester working with her and he thought hed learned how to anticipate her orders gauge her moods and avoid her temper but he didnt have a clue how to handle that hot fear in her eyes why the hell didnt you knock she snapped at him i did when you didnt answer i figured you must be in here so i used the key you gave me when you went on the last assignment give it back now sure okay jo keeping his eyes on hers he dug into the front pocket of his fashionably faded jeans i didnt mean to spook you jo bit down on control and took the key he held out there was as much embarrassment now she realized as fear to give herself a moment she bent down and righted her stool sorry bobby you did spook me i didnt hear you knock its okay want me to get you another cup of coffee she shook her head and gave in to her knocking knees as she slid onto the stool she worked up a smile for him he was a good student she thoughta little pompous about his work yet but he was only twentyone she thought he was going for the artistascollegestudent look with his dark blond hair in a shoulderlength ponytail the single gold hoop earring accenting his long narrow face his teeth were perfect his parents had believed in braces she thought running her tongue over her own slight overbite he had a good eye she mused and a great deal of potential that was why he was here after all jo was always willing to pay back what had been given to her because his big brown eyes were still watching her warily she put more effort into the smile i had a rough night you look like it he tried a smile of his own when she lifted a brow the art is in seeing whats really there right and you look whipped couldnt sleep huh vain was one thing jo wasnt she shrugged her shoulders and rubbed her tired eyes not much you ought to try that melatonin my mother swears by it he crouched to pick up the broken shards of the mug and maybe you could cut back on the coffee he glanced up but saw she wasnt listening shed gone on a side trip again bobby thought a new habit of hers hed just about given up on getting his mentor into a healthier lifestyle but he decided to give it one more shot youve been living on coffee and cigarettes again yeah she was drifting half asleep where she sat that stuffll kill you and you need an exercise program youve dropped about ten pounds in the last few weeks with your height you need to carry more weight and youve got small bonesyoure courting osteoporosis gotta build up those bones and muscles uhhuh you ought to see a doctor you ask me youre anemic you got no color and you could pack half your equipment in the bags under your eyes so nice of you to notice he scooped up the biggest shards dumped them in her waste can of course hed noticed she had a face that drew attention it didnt matter that she seemed to work overtime to fade into the background hed never seen her wear makeup and she kept her hair pulled back but anyone with an eye could see it should be framing that oval face with its delicate bones and exotic eyes and sexy mouth bobby caught himself felt heat rise to his cheeks she would laugh at him if she knew hed had a little crush on her when she first took him on that he figured had been as much professional admiration as physical attraction and hed gotten over the attraction part mostly but there was no doubt that if she would do the minimum to enhance that magnolia skin dab some color on that topheavy mouth and smudge up those longlidded eyes shed be a knockout i could fix you breakfast he began if youve got something besides candy bars and moldy bread taking a long breath jo tuned in no thats okay maybe well stop somewhere and grab something im already running behind she slid off the stool and crouched to pick up the mail you know it wouldnt hurt you to take a few days off focus on yourself my mom goes to this spa down in eami his words were only a buzzing in her ear now she picked up the manila envelope with her name printed neatly on it in block letters she had to wipe a film of sweat from her brow in the pit of her stomach was a sick ball that went beyond dread into fear the envelope was thicker than the others had been weightier throw it away her mind screamed out dont open it dont look inside but her fingers were already scraping along the flap low whimpering sounds escaped her as she tore at the little metal clasp this time an avalanche of photos spilled out onto the floor she snatched one up it was a wellproduced fivebyseven blackandwhite not just her eyes this time but all of her she recognized the backgrounda park near her building where she often walked another was of her in downtown charlotte standing on a curb with her camera bag over her shoulder hey thats a pretty good shot of you as bobby leaned down to select one of the prints she slapped at his hand and snarled at him keep away keep back dont touch me jo i stay the hell away from me panting she dropped on all fours to paw frantically through the prints there was picture after picture of her doing ordinary everyday things coming out of the market with a bag of groceries getting in or out of her car hes everywhere hes watching me wherever i go whatever i do hes hunting me she thought as her teeth began to chatter hes hunting me and theres nothing i can do nothing until then everything inside her clicked off the photograph in her hand shook as if a brisk breeze had kicked up inside the room she couldnt scream there seemed to be no air inside her she simply couldnt feel her body any longer the photograph was brilliantly produced the lighting and use of shadows and textures masterful she was naked her skin glowing eerily her body was arranged in a restful pose the fragile chin dipped down the head gently angled one arm draped across her midriff the other was flung up over her head in a position of dreaming sleep but the eyes were open and staring a dolls eyes dead eyes for a moment she was thrown helplessly back into her nightmare staring at herself and unable to fight her way out of the dark but even through terror she could see the differences the woman in the photo had a waving mass of hair that fanned out from her face and the face was softer the body riper than her own mama she whispered and gripped the picture with both hands mama what is it jo shaken bobby listened to his own voice hitch and dip as he stared into jos glazed eyes what the hell is it where are her clothes jo tilted her head began to rock herself her head was full of sounds rushing thundering sounds where is she take it easy bobby took a step forward started to reach down to take the photo from her her head snapped up stay away the color flashed back into her cheeks riding high something not quite sane danced in her eyes dont touch me dont touch her frightened baffled he straightened again held both hands palms out okay okay jo i dont want you to touch her she was cold so cold she looked down at the photo again it was annabelle young eerily beautiful and cold as death she shouldnt have left us she shouldnt have gone away why did she go maybe she had to bobby said quietly no she belonged with us we needed her but she didnt want us shes so pretty tears rolled down jos cheeks and the picture trembled in her hand shes so beautiful like a fairy princess i used to think she was a princess she left us she left us and went away now shes dead her vision wavered her skin went hot pressing the photo against her breasts jo curled into a ball and wept come on jo gently bobby reached down come on with me now well get some help im so tired she murmured letting him pick her up as if she were a child i want to go home okay just close your eyes now the photo fluttered silently to the floor facedown atop all the other faces she saw writing on the back large bold letters death of an angel her last thought as the dark closed in was sanctuary at first light the air was misty like a dream just about to vanish beams of light stabbed through the canopy of live oaks and glittered on the dew the warblers and buntings that nested in the sprays of moss were waking chirping out a morning song a cock cardinal a red bullet of color shot through the trees without a sound it was his favorite time of day at dawn when the demands on his time and energy were still to come he could be alone he could think his thoughts or simply be brian hathaway had never lived anywhere but desire hed never wanted to hed seen the mainland and visited big cities hed even taken an impulsive vacation to mexico once so it could be said hed visited a foreign land but desire with all its virtues and flaws was his hed been born there on a galetossed night in september thirty years before born in the big oak tester bed he now slept in delivered by his own father and an old black woman who had smoked a corncob pipe and whose parents had been house slaves owned by his ancestors the old womans name was miss ellie and when he was very young she often told him the story of his birth how the wind had howled and the seas had tossed and inside the great house in that grand bed his mother had borne down like a warrior and shot him out of her womb and into his fathers waiting arms with a scream it was a good story brian had once been able to imagine his mother laughing and his father waiting wanting to catch him now his mother was long gone and old miss ellie long dead it had been a long long time since his father had wanted to catch him brian walked through the thinning mists through huge trees with lichen vivid in pinks and red on their trunks through the cool shady light that fostered the ferns and shrubby palmettos he was a tall lanky man very much his fathers son in build his hair was dark and shaggy his skin tawny and his eyes cool blue he had a long face that women found melancholy and appealing his mouth was firm and tended to brood more than smile that was something else women found appealingthe challenge of making those lips curve the slight change of light signaled him that it was time to start back to sanctuary he had to prepare the morning meal for the guests brian was as contented in the kitchen as he was in the forest that was something else his father found odd about him and brian knew with some amusementthat sam hathaway wondered if his son might be gay after all if a man liked to cook for a living there must be some thing wrong with him if theyd been the type to discuss such matters openly brian would have told him that he could enjoy creating a perfect meringue and still prefer women for sex he simply wasnt inclined toward intimacy and wasnt that tendency toward distance from others a hathaway family trait brian moved through the forest as quietly as the deer that walked there suiting himself he took the long way around detouring by half moon creek where the mists were rising up from the water like white smoke and a trio of does sipped contentedly in the shimmering and utter silence there was time yet brian thought there was always time on desire he indulged himself by taking a seat on a fallen log to watch the morning bloom the island was only two miles across at its widest less than thirteen from point to point brian knew every inch of it the sunbleached sand of the beaches the cool shady marshes with their ancient and patient alligators he loved the dune swales the wonderful wet undulating grassy meadows banked by young pines and majestic live oaks but most of all he loved the forest with its dark pockets and its mysteries he knew the history of his home that once cotton and indigo had been grown there worked by slaves fortunes had been reaped by his ancestors the rich had come to play in this isolated little paradise hunting the deer and the feral hogs gathering shells fishing both river and surf theyd held lively dances in the ballroom under the candle glow of crystal chandeliers gambled carelessly at cards in the game room while drinking good southern bourbon and smoking fat cuban cigars they had lazed on the veranda on hot summer afternoons while slaves brought them cold glasses of lemonade sanctuary had been an enclave for privilege and a testament to a way of life that was doomed to failure more firtuncs still had gone in and out of the hands of the steel and shipping magnate who had turned sanctuary into his private retreat though the money wasnt what it had been sanctuary still stood and the island was still in the hands of the descendants of those cotton kings and emperors of steel the cottages that were scattered over it rising up behind the dunes tucked into the shade of the trees facing the wide swath of pelican sound passed from generation to generation ensuring that only a handful of families could claim desire as home so it would remain his father fought developers and environmentalists with equal fervor there would be no resorts on desire and no wellrecalling government would convince sam hathaway to make his island a national preserve it was brian thought his fathers monument to a faithless wife his blessing and his curse visitors came now despite the solitude or perhaps because of it to keep the house the island the trust the hathaways had turned part of their home into an inn brian knew sam detested it resented every footfall on the island from an outsider it was the only thing he could remember his parents arguing over annabelle had wanted to open the island to more tourists to draw people to it to establish the kind of social whirl her ancestors had once enjoyed sam had insisted on keeping it unchanged untouched monitoring the number of visitors and overnight guests like a miser doling out pennies it was in the end what brian believed had driven his mother awaythat need for people for faces for voices but however much his father tried he couldnt hold off change any more than the island could hold back the sea adjustments brian thought as the deer turned as a unit and bounded into the concealing trees he didnt care for adjustments himself but in the case of the inn they had been necessary and the fact was he enjoyed the running of it the planning the implementing the routine he liked the visitors the voices of strangers observing their varying habits and expectations listening to the occasional stories of their worlds he didnt mind people in his lifeas long as they didnt intend to stay in any case he didnt believe people stayed in the long run annabelle hadnt brian rose vaguely irritated that a twentyyearold scar had unexpectedly throbbed ignoring it he turned away and took the winding upward path toward sanctuary when he came out of the trees the light was dazzling it struck the spray of a fountain and turned each individual drop into a rainbow he looked at the back end of the garden the tulips were rioting dependably the sea pinks looked a little shaggy and the what the hell was that purple thing anyway he asked himself he was a mediocre gardener at best struggling constantly to keep up the grounds paying guests expected tended gardens as much as they expected gleaming antiques and fine meals sanctuary had to be kept in tiptop shape to lure them and that meant endless hours of work without paying guests there would be no means for upkeep on sanctuary at all so brian thought scowling down at the flowers it was an endless cycle a snake swallowing its own tail a trap without a key ageratum brians head came up he had to squint against the sunlight to bring the woman into focus but he recognized the voice it irritated him that shed been able to walk up behind him that way then again he always viewed dr kirby fitzsimmons as a minor irritation ageratum she repeated and smiled she knew she annoyed him and considered it progress it had taken nearly a year before shed been able to get even that much of a reaction from him the flower youre glaring at your gardens need some work brian ill get to it he said and fell back on his best weapon silence he never felt completely easy around y yirby it wasnt just her looks though she was attractive enough if you went for the delicate blond type brian figured it was her manner which was the direct opposite of delicate she was efficient competent and seemed to know a little about every damn thing her voice carried what he thought of as highsociety new england or he was feeling less charitable damn yankee she had those yankee cheekbones too they set off seagreen eyes and a slightly turnedup nose her mouth was fullnot too wide not too small it was just one more irritatingly perfect thing about her he kept expecting to hear that shed gong back to the mainland closed up the little cottage shed inherited from her granny and given up on the notion of running a clinic on the island but month after month she stayed slowly weaving herself into the fabric of the place and getting under his skin she kept smiling at him with that mocking look in her eyes as she pushed back a soft wave of the wheatcolored hair that fell smoothly to her shoulders beautiful morning its early he stuck his hands in his pockets he never knew quite what to do with them around her not too early for you she angled her head lord he was tin to look at shed been hoping to do more than look for months but brian hathaway was one of the natives of this little spit of land that she was having trouble winning over i guess breakfast isnt ready yet i suppose i can wait whats the special this morning havent decided since there was no shaking her off he re stretched linking her fingers as she lifted her arms overhead he did his best not to notice the way her cotton shirt strained over small firm breasts not noticing kirby fitzsimmons had become a full time job he wound around the side of the house through the spring blooms that lined the path of crushed shells you can wait in the guest parlor or the dining room id rather sit in the kitchen i like watching you cook before he could think of a way around it shed stepped up into the rear screened porch and through the kitchen door as usual it was neat as a pin kirby appreciated tidiness in a man the same way she appreciated good muscle tone and a wellexercised brain brian had all three qualities which was why she was interested in what kind of lover hed make she figured she would find out eventually yirby always worked her way toward a goal all she had to do was keep chipping away at that armor of his it wasnt disinterest shed seen the way he watched her on the rare occasions when his guard was down it was sheer stubbornness she appreciated that as well and the contrasts of him were such fran she knew as she settled on a stool at the breakfast bar that he would have little to say unless she prodded that was the distance he kept between himself and others and she knew he would pour her a cup of his really remarkable coffee and remember that she drank it light that was his innate hospitality yirby let him have his quiet for a moment as she sipped the coffee from the steaming mug hed set before her she hadnt been teasing when shed said she liked to watch him cook a kitchen might have been a traditionally female domain but this kitchen was all male just like its overseer kirby thought with his big hands shaggy hair and tough face she knewbecause there was little that one person on the island didnt know about the othersthat brian had had the kitchen redone about eight years before and hed created the design chosen the colors and materials had made it a working mans room with long granitecolored counters and glittering stainless steel there were three wide windows framed only by curved and carved wood trim a banquette in smoky gray was tucked under them for family meals though as far as she knew the hathaways rarely ate as a family the floor was creamy white tile the walls white and unadorned no fancy work for brian yet there were homey touches in the gleam of copper pots that hung from hooks the hanks of dried peppers and garlic the shelf holding antique kitchen tools she imagined he thought of them as practical rather than homey but they warmed the room hed left the old brick hearth alone and it brought back reminders of a time when the kitchen had been the core of this house a place for gathering for lingering she liked it in the winter when he lighted a fire there and the scent of wood burning mixed pleasurably with that of spicy stews or soups bubbling to her the huge commercial range looked like something that required an engineering degree to operate then again her idea of cooking was taking a package from the freezer and nuking it in the microwave i love this room she said he was whipping something in a large blue bowl and only grunted taking that as a response kirby slid off the stool to help herself to a second cup of coffee she leaned in just brushing his arm and grinned at the batter in the bowl waffles he shifted slightly her scent was in his way that was what you wanted wasnt it yeah lifting her cup she smiled at him over the rim its nice to get what you want dont you think she had the damnedest eyes he thought hed believed in mermaids as a child all of them had had eyes like yirbys its easy enough to get it if all you want is waffles he stepped back around her and took a waffle iron out of a lower cabinet after hed plugged it in he turned and bumped into her automatically he lifted a hand to her arm to steady her and left it there youre underfoot she eased forward just a little pleased by the quick flutter in her stomach i thought i could help with what she smiled let her gaze wander down to his mouth then back with whatever what the hell she thought and laid her free hand on his chest need anything his blood began to pump faster his fingers tightened on her arm before he could prevent it he thought about it oh he thought about it what would it be like to push her back against the counter and take what she kept insisting on patting under his nose that would wipe the smirk off her face youre in my way yirby he had yet to let her go that she thought was definite progress beneath her hand his heartbeat was accelerated ive been in your way the best part of a year brian when are you going to do something about it she saw his eyes flicker before they narrowed her breathing took on an anticipatory hitch finally she thought and leaned toward him he dropped her arm and stepped back the move so unexpected and abrupt that this time she did nearly stumble drink your coffee he said ive got work to do here he had the satisfaction of seeing that hed pushed one of her buttons for a change the smirk was gone all right her delicate brows were knit and under them her eyes had gone dark and hot damn it brian whats the problem delly he ladled batter onto the heated waffle iron i dont have a problem he slanted a look at her as he closed the lid her color was up and her mouth was thinned spitting mad he thought good what do i have to do she slammed her coffee cup down sloshing the hot liquid onto his spotless counter do i have to stroll in here naked his lips twitched well now thats a thought isnt it i could raise the rates around here after that he cocked his head that is if you look good naked i look great naked and ive given you numerous opportunities to find that out for yourself i guess i like to make my own opportunities he opened the refrigerator you want eggs with those waffles yirby clenched her fists reminded herself that shed taken a vow to heal not harm then spun on her heel oh stuff your waffles she muttered and stalked out the back door brian waited until he heard the door slam before he grinned he figured he had come out on top of that little tussle of wills and decided to treat himself to her waffles he was just flipping them onto a plate when the door swung open lexy posed for a moment which both she and brian knew was out of habit rather than an attempt to impress her brother her hair was a tousled mass of spiraling curls that flowed over her shoulders in her current favorite shade renaissance red she liked the titian influence and considered it an improvement over the bombshell blonde shed worn the last few years that was shed discovered a bitch to maintain the color was only a few shades lighter and brighter than what god had given her and it suited her skin tones which were milky with a hint of rose beneath shed inherited her fathers changeable hazel eyes this morning they were heavy the color of cloudy seas and already carefully accented with mascara and liner waffles she said her voice was a feline purr shed practiced religiously and made her own yum unimpressed brian cut the first bite as he stood and shoveled it into his mouth mine lexy tossed back her gypsy mane of hair strolled over to the breakfast bar and pouted prettily she fluttered her lashes and smiled when brian set the plate in front of her thanks sweetie she laid a hand on his cheek and kissed the other lexy had the very unhathaway like habit of touching kissing hugging brian remembered that after their mother had left lexy had been like a puppy always leaping into someones arms looking for a snuggle hell he thought shed only been four he gave her hair a tug and handed her the syrup anyone else up mmm the couple in the blue room are stirring cousin kate was in the shower i thought you were handling the breakfast shift this morning i am she told him with her mouth frill he lifted a brow skimmed his gaze over her short thin wildly patterned robe is that your new waitress uniform she crossed long legs and slipped another bite of waffle between her lips like it youll be able to retire on the tips yeah she gave a half laugh and pushed at the waffles on her plate thats been my lifelong dreamserving food to strangers and clearing away their dirty plates saving the pocket change they give me so i can retire in splendor we all have our little fantasies brian said lightly and set a cup of coffee loaded with cream and sugar beside her he understood her bitterness and disappointment even if he didnt agree with it because he loved her he cocked his head and said want to hear mine probably has something to do with winning the betty crocker recipe contest hey it could happen i was going to be somebody bri you are somebody alexs hathaway island princess she rolled her eyes before she picked up her coffee i didnt last a year in new york not a damn year who wants to the very idea gave him the creeps crowded streets crowded smells crowded air its a little tough to be an actress on desire honey you ask me youre doing a hell of a job of it and if youre going to sulk take the waffles up to your room youre spoiling my mood its easy for you she shoved the waffles away brian nabbed the plate before it slid off the counter youve got what you want living in nowhere day after day year after year doing the same thing over and over again daddys practically given the house over to you so he can tromp around the island all day to make sure nobody moves so much as one grain of his precious sand she pushed herself up from the stool flung out her arms and jos got what she wants bigfuckingdeal photographer traveling all over the world to snap her pictures but what do i have just what do i have a pathetic rdsumd with a couple of commercials a handful of walkons and a icad in a threeact play that closed in pittsburgh on opening night now im stuck here again waiting tables changing other peoples sheets and i hate it he waited a moment then applauded hell of a speech lex and you know just what words to punch you might want to work on the staging though the gestures lean toward grandiose her lips trembled then firmed damn you bri she jerked her chin up before stalking out brian picked up her fork looked like he was two for two that morning he thought and decided to finish off her breakfast as well i within an hour lexy was all smiles and southern sugared charm she was a skilled waitresswhich had saved her from total poverty during her stint in new yorkand served her tables with every appearance of pleasure and unhurried grace she wore a trim skirt just short enough to irritate brian which had been her intention and a capsleeved sweater that she thought showed off her figure to best advantage she had a good one and worked hard to keep it that way it was a tool of the trade whether waitressing or acting as was her quick sunny smile why dont i warm that coffee up for you mr benson hows your omelette brians an absolute wonder in the kitchen isnt he since mr benson seemed so appreciative of her breasts she leaned over a bit further to give him frill bang for his buck before moving to the next table youre leaving us today arent you she beamed at the newlyweds cuddling at a corner table i hope yall come back and see us again she sailed through the room gauging when a customer wanted to chat when another wanted to be left alone as usual on a weekday morning business was light and she had plenty of opportunity to play the room what she wanted to play was packed houses those grand theaters of new york instead she thought keeping that summersun smile firmly in place she was cast in the role of waitress in a house that never changed on an island that never changed it had all been the same for hundreds of years she thought lexy wasnt a woman who appreciated history as far as she was concerned the past was boring and as tediously carved in stone as desire and its scattering of families pendletons married fitzsimmonses or brodies or verdons the islands main four occasionally one of the sons or daughters took a detour and married a mainlander some even moved away but almost invariably they remained living in the same cottages generation after generation sprinkling a few more names among the permanent residents it was all so predictable she thought as she flipped her order pad brightly and beamed down at her next table her mother had married a mainlander and now the hathaways reigned over sanctuary it was the hathaways who had lived there worked there sweated time and blood over the keeping of the house and the protection of the island for more than thirty years now but sanctuary still was and always would be the pendleton house high on the hill and there seemed to be no escaping from it she stuffed tips into her pocket and carried dirty plates away the minute she stepped into the kitchen her eyes went frigid she shed her charm like a snake sheds its skin it only infuriated her more that brian was impervious to the cold shoulder she jammed in his face she dumped the dishes snagged the fresh pot of coffee then swung back into the dining room for two hours she served and cleared and replaced setupsand dreamed of where she wanted to be broadway shed been so sure she could make it everyone had told her she had a natural talent of course that was before she went to new york and found herself up against hundreds of other young women whod been told the same thing she wanted to be a serious actress not some airheaded bimbo who posed for lingerie ads and billed herself as an actressmodel shed fully expected to start at the top after all she had brains and looks and talent her first sight of manhattan had filled her with a sense of purpose and energy it was as if it had been waiting for her she thought as she calculated the tab for table six all those people and that noise and vitality and oh the stores with those gorgeous clothes the sophisticated restaurants and the overwhelming sense that everyone had something to do somewhere to go in a hurry she had something to do and somewhere to go too of course shed rented an apartment that had cost far too much but she hadnt been willing to settle for some cramped little room she treated herself to new clothes at bendels and a full day at elizabeth arden that ate a large chunk out of her budget but she considered it an investment she wanted to look her best when she answered casting calls her first month was one rude awakening after another shed never expected so much competition or such desperation on the faces of those who lined up with her to audition for part after part and she did get a few offersbut most of them involved her aditioning on her back she had too much pride and too much selfconfidence for that now that pride and selfconfidence and she was forced to admit her own nafvetd had brought her full circle but it was only temporary lexy reminded herself in a little less than a year she would turn twentyfive and then shed come into her inheritance what there was of it she was going to take it back to new york and this time shed be smarter more cautious and more clever she wasnt beaten she decided she was taking a sabbatical one day she would stand on stage and feel all that love and admiration from the audience roll over her then she would be someone someone other than annabelles younger daughter she carried the last of the plates into the kitchen brian was already putting the place back into shape no dirty pots and pans cluttered his sink no spills and smears spoiled his counter knowing it was nasty lexy turned her wrist so that the cup stacked on top of the plates tipped spilling the dregs of coffee before it shattered on the tile oops she said and grinned wickedly when brian turned his head you must enjoy being a fool lex he said coolly youre so good at it really before she could stop herself she let the rest of the dishes drop they hit and crashed scattering food and fragments of stoneware all over hows that goddamn it what are you trying to prove that youre as destructive as ever that somebody will always come behind you to clean up your mess he stomped to a closet pulled out a broom do it yourself he shoved the broom at her i wont though she already regretted the impulsive act she shoved the broom back at him the colorful fiestaware was like a ruined carnival at their feet theyre your precious dishes you clean them up youre going to clean it up or i swear ill use this broom on your backside just try it bri she went toe to toe with him knowing shed been wrong was only a catalyst for standing her ground just try it and ill scratch your damn eyes out im sick to death of you telling me what to do this is my house as much as it is yours well i see nothings changed around here their faces still dark with temper both brian and lexy turned and stared jo stood at the back door her two suitcases at her feet and exhaustion in her eyes i knew i was home when i heard the crash followed by the happy voices in an abrupt and deliberate shift of mood lexy slid her arm through brians uniting them look here brian another prodigals returned i hope we have some of that fatted calf left ill settle for coffee jo said and closed the door behind her jo stood at the window in the bedroom of her childhood the view was the same pretty gardens patiently waiting to be weeded and fed mounds of alyssum were already golden and bluebells were waving violas were sunning their sassy little faces guarded by the tall spears of purple iris and cheerful yellow tulips impatiens and dianthus bloomed reliably there were the palms cabbage and saw and beyond them the shady oaks where lacy ferns and indifferent wildflowers thrived the light was so lovely gilded and pearly as the clouds drifted casting soft shadows the image was one of peace solitude and storybook perfection if shed had the energy shed have gone out now captured it on film and made it her own ought to realize only now that shed missed the view from the window of the room where shed spent nearly every night of the first eighteen years of her life shed whiled away many hours gardening with her mother learning the names of the flowers their needs and habits enjoying the feel of soil under her fingers and the sun on her back birds and butterflies the tinkle of wind chimes the drift of puffy clouds overhead in a soft blue sky were treasured memories from her early childhood apparently shed forgotten to hold on to them jo decided as she turned wearily from the window any pictures shed taken of the scene with her mind or with her camera had been tucked away for a very long time her room had changed little as well the family wing in sanctuany still glowed with annabelles style and taste for her older daughter shed chosen a gleaming brass halftester bed with a lacy canopy and a complex and fluid design of cornices and knobs the spread was antique irish lace a pendleton heirloom that jo had always loved because of its pattern and texture and because it seemed so sturdy and ageless on the wallpaper bluebells bloomed in cheerful riot over the ivory background and the trim was honeytoned and warm annabelle had selected the antiquesthe globe lamps and maple tables the dainty chairs and vases that had always held fresh flowers shed wanted her children to learn early to live with the precious and care for it on the mantel over the little marble fireplace were cadlcs and seashells on the shelves on the opposite wall were books rather than dolls even as a child jo had had little use for dolls annabelle was dead no matter how much of her stubbornly remained in this room in this house on this island she was dead sometime in the last twenty years she had died made her desertion complete and irrevocable dear god why had someone immortalized that death on film jo wondered as she buried her face in her hands and why had they sent that immortalization to annabelles daughter death of an angel those words had been printed on the back of the photograph jo remembered them vividly now she rubbed the heel of her hand hard between her breasts to try to calm her heart what kind of sickness was that she asked herself what kind of threat and how much of it was aimed at herself it had been there it had been real it didnt matter that when she got out of the hospital and returned to her apartment the print was gone she couldnt let it matter if she admitted shed imagined it that shed been hallucinating she would have to admit that shed lost her mind how could she face that but the print hadnt been there when she returned all the others were all those everyday images of herself still scattered on the darkroom floor where shed dropped them in shock and panic but though she searched spent hours going over every inch of the apartment she didnt find the print that had broken her if it had never been there closing her eyes she rested her forehead on the window glass if shed fabricated it if shed somehow wanted that terrible image to be fact for her mother to be exposed that way and deadwhat did that make her which could she accept her own mental instability or her mothers death dont think about it now she pressed a hand to her mouth as her breath began to catch in her throat put it away just like you put the photographs away lock it up until youre stronger dont break down again jo ellen she ordered herself youll end up back in the hospital with doctors poking into both body and mind handle it she drew a deep steadying breath handle it until you can ask whatever questions have to be asked find whatever answers there are to be found she would do something practical she decided something ordinary attempt the pretense at least of a normal visit home shed already lowered the front of the slanttop desk and set one of her cameras on it but as she stared at it she realized that was as much unpacking as she could handle jo looked at the suitcases lying on the lovely bedspread the thought of opening them of taking clothes out and hanging them in the armoire folding them into drawers was simply overwhelming instead she sat down in a chair and closed her eyes what she needed to do was think and plan she worked best with a list of goals and tasks recorded in the order that would be the most practical and efficient coming home had been the only solution so it was practical and efficient it was she promised herself the first step she just had to clear her mind somehowclear it and latch on to the next step but she drifted nearly dreaming it seemed like only seconds had passed when someone knocked but jo found herself jerked awake and disoriented she sprang to her feet feeling ridiculously embarrassed to have nearly been caught napping in the middle of the day before she could reach the door it opened and cousin kate poked her head in well there you are goodness jo you look like three days of death sit down and drink this tea and tell me whats going on with you it was so kate jo thought that frank nononsense bossy attitude she found herself smiling as she watched kate march in with the tea tray you look wonderful i take care of myself kate set the tray on the low table in the sitting area and waved one hand at a chair which from the looks of you you havent been doing youre too thin too pale and your hairs a disaster of major proportions but well fix that briskly she poured tea from a porcelain teapot decked with sprigs of ivy into two matching cups now then she sat back sipped then angled her head im taking some time off jo told her shed driven down from charlotte for the express purpose of giving herself time to rehearse her reasons and excuses for coming home a few weeks jo ellen you cant snow me theyd never been able to jo thought not any of them not from the moment kate had set foot in sanctuary shed come days after annabelles desertion to spend a week and was still there twenty years later theyd needed her god knew jo thought as she tried to calculate just how little she could get away with telling katherine pedleton she sipped her tea stalling icate was annabelles cousin and the family resemblance was marked in the eyes the coloring the physical build but where annabelle in jos memory had always seemed soft and innately feminine kate was sharpangled and precise yes kate did take care of herself jo agreed she wore her hair boyishly short a russet cap that suited her foxatalert face and practical style her wardrobe leaned toward the casual but never the sloppy jeans were always pressed cotton shirts crisp her nails were neat and short and never without three coats of clear polish though she was fifty she kept herself trim and from the back could have been mistaken for a teenage boy she had come into their lives at their lowest ebb and had never faltered had simply been there managing details pushing each of them to do whatever needed to be done next and in her nononsense way bullying and loving them into at least an illusion of normality ive missed you kate jo murmured i really have kate stared at her a moment and something flickered over her face you wont soften me up jo ellen youre in trouble and you can choose to tell me or you can make me pry it out of you either way ill have it i needed some time off that kate mused was undoubtedly true she could tell just from the looks of the girl knowing jo she doubted very much if it was a man whod put that wounded look in her eyes so that left work work that took jo to strange and faraway places kate thought often dangerous places of war and disaster work that she knew her young cousin had deliberately put ahead of a life and a family little girl kate thought my poor sweet little girl what have you done to yourself kate tightened her fingers on the handle of her cup to keep them from trembling were you hurt no no jo repeated and set her tea down to press her fingers to her aching eyes just overwork stress i guess i overextended myself in the last couple of months the pressure thats all the photographs mama kate drew her brows together the line that formed between them was known not so affectionately as the pendleton fault line what kind of pressure eats the weight off of you jo ellen and makes your hands shake defensively jo clasped those unsteady hands together in her lap i guess you could say i havent been taking care of myself jo smiled a little im going to do better tapping her fingers on the arm of the chair kate studied jos face the trouble there went too deep to be only professional concerns have you been sick no the lie slid off her tongue nearly as smoothly as planned very deliberately she blocked out the thought of a hospital room almost certain that kate would be able to see it in her mind just a little rundown i havent been sleeping well lately edgy under kates steady gaze jo rose to dig cigarettes out of the pocket of the jacket shed tossed over a chair ive got that book deali wrote you about it i guess its got me stressed out she flicked on her lighter its new territory for me you should be proud of yourself not making yourself sick over it youre right absolutely jo blew out smoke and fought back the image of annabelle the photographs im taking some time off it wasnt all kate calculated but it was enough for now its good youve come home a couple of weeks of brians cooking will put some fat on you again and god knows we could use some help around here most of the rooms and the cottages are booked straight through the summer so business is good jo asked without much interest people need to get away from their own routings and pick up someone elses most that come here are looking for quiet and solitude or theyd be in hilton head or on jekyll still they want clean linen and fresh towels kate tapped her fingers thinking briefly of the work stretched out before her that afternoon lexys been lending a hand she continued but shes no more dependable than she ever was just as likely to run off for the day as to do what chores need doing shes dealing with some disappointments herself and some growingup pains lex is twentyfour kate she should be grown up by now some take longer than others its not a fault its a fact kate rose always ready to defend one of her chicks even if it was against the pecks of another and some never learn to face reality jo put in and spend their lives blaming everyone else for their failures and disappointments alexs is not a failure you were never patient enough with her any more than she was with you thats a fact as well i never asked her to be patient with me old resentments surfaced like hot grease on tainted water i never asked her or any of them for anything no you never asked jo kate said evenly you might have to give something back if you ask you might have to admit you need them if you let them need you well its time you all faced up to a few things its been two years since the three of you have been in this house together i know how long its been jo said bitterly and i didnt get any more of a welcome from brian and lexy than id expected maybe youd have gotten more if youd expected more kate set her jaw you havent even asked about your father annoyed jo stabbed out her cigarette what would you like me to ask dont take that snippy tone with me young lady if youre going to be under this roof youll show some respect for those who provide it and youll do your part while youre here your brothers had too much of the running of this place on his shoulders these last few years its time the family pitched in its time you were a family im not an innkeeper kate and i cant imagine that brian wants me poking my fingers into his business you dont have to be an innkeeper to do laundry or polish furniture or sweep the sand off the veranda at the ice in her long jo responded in defense and defiance i didnt say i wouldnt do my part i just meant i know exactly what you meant and im telling you young lady im sick to death of that kind of attitude every one of you children would rather sink over your heads in the marsh than ask one of your siblings for a helping hand and youd strangle on your tongue before you asked your daddy i dont know whether youre competing or just being ornery but i want you to put it aside while youre here this is home by god its time it felt like one kate jo began as kate headed for the door no im too mad to talk to you now i only meant when the door shut smartly jo let the air out of her lungs on a long sigh her head was achy her stomach knotted and guilt was smothering her like a soaked blanket kate was wrong she decided it felt exactly like home from the fringes of the marsh sam hathaway watched a hawk soar over its hunting ground sam had hiked over to the landward side of the island that morning leaving the house just before dawn he knew brian had gone out at nearly the same hour but they hadnt spoken each had his own way and his own route sometimes sam took a jeep but more often he walked some days he would head to the dunes and watch the sun rise over the water turning it bloody red then golden then blue when the beach was all space and light and brilliance he might walk for miles his eyes keenly lldgfo ing erosion looking r any fresh buildup of sand he left shells where the water had tossed them he rarely ventured onto the meadows they were fragile and every footfall caused damage and change sam fought bitterly against change there were days he preferred to wander to the edge of the forest behind the dunes where the lakes and sloughs were full of life and music there were mornings he needed the stillness and dim light there rather than the thunder of waves and the rising sun he could like the patient heron waiting for a careless fish stand motionless as minutes ticked by there were times among the ponds and stands of willow and thick film of duckweed that he could forget that any world existed beyond this his own here the alligator hidden in the reeds while it digested its last meal and the turtle sunning on the log likely to become gator bait iself were more real to him than people but it was a rare rare thing for sam to go beyond the ponds and into the shadows of the forest annabelle had loved the forest best other days he was drawn here to the marsh and its mysteries here was a cycle he could understandgrowth and decay life and death this was nature and could be accepted no man caused this oras long as sam was in controlwould interfere with it at the edges he could watch the fiddler crabs scurrying so busy in the mud that they made quiet popping sounds like soapsuds sam knew that when he left raccoons and other predators would creep along the mud scrape out those busy crabs and feast that was all part of the cycle now as spring came brilliantly into its own the waving cordgrass was turning from tawny gold to green and the turf was beginning to bloom with the colors of sea lavender and oxeye he had seen more than thirty springs come to desire and he never tired of it the land had been his wifes passed through her family from generation to generation but it had become his the moment hed set foot on it just as annabelle had become his the moment hed set eyes on her he hadnt kept the woman but through her desertion he had kept the land sam was a fatalistor had become one there was no avoiding destiny the land had come to him from annabelle and he tended it carefully protected it fiercely and left it never though it had been years since hed turned in the night reaching out for the ghost of his wife he could find her anywhere and every where he looked on desire it was both his pain and his comfort sam could see the exposed roots of trees where the river was eating away at the fringe of the marsh some said it was best to take steps to protect those fringes but sam believed that nature found its way if man whether with good intent or ill set his own hand to changing that rivers course what repercussions would it have in other areas no he would leave it be and let the land and the sea the wind and the rain fight it out from a few feet away kate studied him he was a tall wiry man with skin tanned and ruddy and dark hair silvering his firm mouth was slow to smile and slower yet were those changeable hazel eyes lines fanned out from those eyes deeply scored and in that oddity of masculinity only enhancing his face he had large hands and feet both of which hed passed on to his son yet kate knew sam could move with an uncanny and soundless grace that no city dweller could ever master in twenty years he had never welcomed her nor expected her to leave she had simply come and stayed and fulfilled a purpose in weak moments kate allowed herself to wonder what he would think or do or say if she simply packed up and left but she didnt leave doubted she ever would shed been in love with sam hathaway nearly every moment of those twenty years late squared her shoulders set her chin though she suspected he already knew she was there she knew he wouldnt speak to her unless she spoke first jo ellen canic in on the morning ferry sam continued to watch the hawk circle yes hed known kate was there just as hed known she had some reason she thought important that would have brought her to the marsh kate wasnt one for mud and gators why was all he said and extracted an impatient sigh from late its her home isnt it his voice was slow as if the words were formed reluctantly dont figure she thinks of it that way hasnt for a long time vaiatever she thinks it is her home youre her father and youll want to welcome her back he got a picture of his older daughter in his mind and saw his wife with a clarity that brought both despair and outrage but only disinterest showed in his voice ill be up to the house later on its been nearly two years since shes been home sam for lords sake go see your daughter he shifted annoyed and uncomfortable kate had a way of drawing out those reactions in him theres time unless shes planning on taking the ferry back to the mainland this afternoon never could stay in one place for long as i recall and she couldnt wait to get shed of desire going off to college and making a career and a life for herself isnt desertion though he didnt move or make a sound kate knew the shaft had hit home and was sorry shed felt it necessary to hurl it shes back now sam i dont think shes up to going anywhere for a while and thats not the point kate marched up took a firm hold on his arm and turned him to face her there were times you had to shove an obvious point in sams face to make him see it she thought and that was just what she intended to do now shes hurting she doesnt look well sam shes lost weight and shes pale as a sheet she says she hasnt been ill but shes lying she looks like you could knock her down with a hard thought for the first time a shadow of worry moved into his eyes did she get hurt on her job there finally kate thought but was careful not to show the satisfaction its not that kind of hurt she said more gently its an inside hurt i cant put my finger on it but its there she needs her home her family she needs her father if jos got a problem shell deal with it she always has you mean shes always had to kate tossed back she wanted to shake him until shed loosened the lock he had snapped on his heart damn it sam be there for her he looked beyond kate to the marshes shes past the point where she needs me to bandage up her bumps and scratches no shes not kate dropped her hand from his arm shes still your daughter she always will be belle wasnt the only one who went away sam she watched his face close in as she said it and shook her head fiercely brian and jo and lexy lost her too but they shouldnt have had to lose you his chest had tightened and he turned away to stare out over the marsh knowing that the pressure inside him would ease again if he was left alone i said id be up to the house later on jo ellen has something to say to me she can say it then one of these days youre going to realize youve got something to say to her to all of them she left him alone hoping he would realize it soon brian stood in the doorway of the west terrace and studied his sister she looked frail he noted skittish lost somehow he thought amid the sunlight and flowers she still wore the baggy trousers and oversized lightweight sweater that shed arrived in and had added a pair of round wireframed sunglasses brian imagined that jo wore just such a uniform when she hunted her photographs but at the moment it served only to add to the overall impression of an invalid yet shed always been the tough one he remembered even as a child shed insisted on doing everyffung herself on finding the answers solving the puzzles fighting the fights shed been fearless climbing higher in any tree swimming farther beyond the waves running faster through the forest just to prove she could brian mused it seemed to him jo ellen had always had something to prove and after their mother had gone jo had seemed hellbent on proving she needed no one and nothing but herself well brian decided she needed something now he stepped out saying nothing as she turned her head and looked at him from behind the tinted lenses then he sat down on the glider beside her and put the plate hed brought out in her lap eat was all he said jo looked down at the fried chicken the fresh slaw the golden hiscult is this the lunch special most of the guests went for the box lunch today too nice to eat inside cousin kate said youve been busy busy enough out of habit he pushed off with his foot and set the glider in motion what are you doing here jo seemed like the thing to do at the time she lifted a drumstick bit in her stomach did a quick pitch and roll as if debating whether to accept food jo persisted and swallowed ill do my share and i wont get in your way brian listened to the squeak of the glider for a moment thought about oiling the hinges i havent said you were in my way as i recollect he said mildly in lexys way then jo took another bite of chicken scowled at the softpink ivy geraniums spilling over the edges of a concrete jardiniere carved with chubby cherubs you can tell her im not here to cramp her style tell her yourself brian opened the thermos hed brought along and poured freshly squeezed lemonade into the lid im not stepping between the two of you so i can get my ass kicked from both sides bri stay out of it then her head was beginning to ache but she took the cup and sipped i dont know why the hell she resents me so much cant imagine brian drawled it before he lifted the thermos and drank straight from the lip youre successful famous financially independent a rising star in your field all the things she wants for herself he picked up the biscuit and broke it in half handing a portion to jo as the steam burst out i cant think why thatd put her nose out of joint i did it by myself for myself i didnt work my butt off to get to this point to show her up without thinking she stuffed a bite of biscuit in her mouth its not my fault shes got some childish fantasy about seeing her name in lights and having people throw roses at her feet your seeing it as childish doesnt make the desire any less real for her he held up a hand before jo could speak and im not getting in the middle the two of you are welcome to rip the hide off each other in your own good time but id say right now she could take you without breaking a sweat i dont want to fight with her jo said wearily she could smell the wisteria that rioted over the nearby arched iron trellisanother vivid memory of childhood i didnt come here to fight with anyone thatll be a change that lured a ghost of a smile to her lips maybe ive mellowed miracles happen eat your slaw i dont remember you being so bossy ive cut back on mellow with what passed as a chuckle jo picked up her fork and poked at the slaw tell me whats new around here bri and whats the same bring me home she thought but couldnt say it bring me back lets see gaff verdon built on another room to the verdon cottage stop the presses then jos brow furrowed young giff the scrawny kid with the cowlick the one who was always mooning over lex thats the one filled out some gaff has and hes right handy with a hammer and saw does all our repair work now still moons over lexy but id say he knows what he wants to do about it now jo snorted and without thinking shoveled in more slaw shell eat him alive brian shrugged maybe but i think shell find him tougher to chew up than she might expect the sanders girl rachel she got herself engaged to some college boy in atlanta going to move there come september rachel sanders jo tried to conjure up a mental image was she the one with the lisp or the one with the giggle the gigglesharp enough to make the ears bleed satisfied that jo was eating brian stretched an arm over the back of the glider and relaxed old mrs fitzsimmons passed on more than a year back old mrs fitzsimmons jo murmured she used to shuck oysters on her porch with that lazy hound of hers sleeping at her feet beside the rocker the hound passed too right after guess he didnt see much point in living without her she let me take pictures of her jo remembered when i was a kid just learning i still have them a couple werent bad mr david helped me develop them i must have been such a pest but she just sat there in her rocker and let me practice on her sitting back jo fell into the rhythm of the glider as slow and monotionous as the rhythm of the island i hope it was quick and painless she died in her sleep at the ripe old age of ninetysix cant do much better than that no jo closed her eyes the food forgotten what was wrong with her cottage passed down the pendletons bought most of the fitzslmmons land back in but she owned her house and the little spit of land it sits on went to her granddaughter brian lifted the thermos again drank deeply this time a doctor shes set up a practice here on the island we have a doctor on desire jo opened her eyes lifted her brows well well how civilized are people actually going to her seems they are little by little anyway shes dug her toes in she must be the first new permanent resident here in what ten years thereabouts i cant imagine why jo trailed off as it struck her its not kirby is it kirby fitzsimmons she spent summers here a couple of years running when we were kids i guess she liked it well enough to come back ill be damned yirby fitzsimmons and a doctor of all things pleasure bloomed a surprising sensation she nearly didnt recognize we used to pal around together some i remember the summer mr david came to take photographs of the island and brought his family it cheered her to think of it the young friend with the quick northern voice the adventures theyd shared or imagined together you would run off with his boys and wouldnt give me the time of day jo continued when i wasnt pestering mr david to let me take pictures with his camera id go off with yirby and look for trouble christ that was twenty years ago if it was a day it was the summer that brian nodded then finished the thought the summer that mama left its all out of focus jo murmured and the pleasure died out of her voice hot sun long days steamy nights so full of sound all the faces she slipped her fingers under her glasses to rub at her eyes getting up at sunrise so i could follow mr david around bolting down cold ham sandwiches and cooling off in the river mama dug out that old camera for methat ancient box brownieand i would run over to the fitzsimmons cottage and take pictures until mrs fitzsimmons told yirby and me to scoot there were hours and hours so many hours until the sun went down and mama called us home for supper she closed her eyes tight so much so many images yet i cant bring any one of them really clear then she was gone one morning i woke up ready to do all the things a long summer day called for and she was just gone and there was nothing to do at all summer was over brian said quietly for all of us yeah her hands had gone trembly again jo reached in her pockets for cigarettes do you ever think about her why would i dont you ever wonder where she went what she did jo took a jerky drag in her mind she saw longlidded eyes empty of life or why it doesnt have anything to do with me brian rose took the plate or you or any of us anymore its twenty years past that summer jo ellen and a little late to worry about it now she opened her mouth then shut it again when brian turned and walked back into the house but she was worried about it she thought and she was terrified lexy was still steaming as she climbed over the dunes toward the beach jo had come back she was sure to flaunt her success and her snazzy life and the fact that shed arrived at sanctuary hard on the heels of lexys own failure didnt strike lexy as coincidence jo would flap her wings and crow in triumph while lexy would have to settle for eating crow the thought of it made her blood boil as she raced along the trampeddown sand through the dunes sending sand flying from her sandals not this time she promised herself this time she would hold her head up refuse to be cast as inferior in the face of jos latest triumph latest trip latest wonder she wasnt going to play the hotshots baby sister any longer shed outgrown that role lexy assured herself and it was high time everyone realized it there was a scattering of people on the wide crescent of beach they had staked their claims with their blankets and colorful umbrellas slic noted several with the brightly striped box lunches from sanctuary the scents of sea and lotions and fried chicken assaulted her nostrils a toddler shoveled sand into a red bucket while his mother read a paperback novel in the shade of a portable awning a man was slowly turning into a lobster under the merciless sun two couples she had served that morning were sharing a picnic and laughing together over the clever voice of annie lennox on their portable stereo she didnt want themany of themto be there on her beach in her personal crisis to dismiss them she turned and walked away from the temporary development down the curve of beach she saw the figure out in the water the gleam of tanned wet shoulders the glint of sunbleached hair gaff was a reliable creature of habit she thought and he was just exactly what the doctor called for he invariably took a quick swim during his afternoon break and lexy knew he had his eye on her he hadnt made a secret of it she mused and she wasnt one to resent the attentions of an attractive man particularly when she needed her ego soothed she thought a little flirtation and the possibility of mindless sex might put the day back on track people said her mother had been a flirt lexy hadnt been old enough to remember anything more than vague images and soft scents when it came to annabelle but she believed shed come by her skill at flirtation naturally her mother had enjoyed looking her best smiling at men and if the theory of a secret lover was fact annabelle had more than smile at at least one man in any case thats what the police had concluded after months of investigation lexy thought she was good at sex she had been told so often enough to consider it a fine personal skill as far as she was concerned there was little else that compared to it for shouldering away tension and being the focus of someones complete attention and she liked it all the hot slick sensations that went with it it hardly mattered that most men didnt have a clue whether a woman was thinking about them or the latest hollywood pretty boy while it was going on as long as she performed well and remembered the right lings lexy considered herself born to perform and she decided it was time to open that velvet curtain for giffverdon she dropped the towel shed brought with her onto the packed sand she didnt have a doubt that he was watching her men did as if on stage lexy put her heart into the performance standing near the edge of the water she slipped off her sunglasses let them fall lifelessly onto the towel slowly she stepped out of her sandals then taking the hem of the shortskirted sundress she wore she lifted it making the movements a lazy striptease the bikini underneath covered little more than a strippers gstring and pasties would have dropping the thin cotton she shook her head skimmed her hair back with both hands then walked with a sirens swagger of hips into the sea gaff let the next wave roll over him he knew that every movement every gesture lexy made was deliberate it didnt seem to make any difference he couldnt take his eyes off her couldnt prevent his body from going tight and hard and needy as she stood there all iuscious curves and pale gold skin with her hair spiraling down like sunkissed flames as she walked into the water and it moved up her body he imagined what it would be like to rock himself inside her to the rhythm of the waves she was watching him too he noted her eyes picking up the green of the sea and laughing she dipped down rose up again with her hair shiny and wet water sliding off her skin and she laughed out loud waters cold today she called out and a little rough you dont usually come in till june maybe i wanted it cold today she let the wave carry her closer and rough itll be colder and rougher tomorrow he told her rains coming mmm she floated on her back a moment studying the pale blue sky maybe ill come back letting her feet sink she began to tread water as she watched him shed grown accustomed to his dark brown eyes watching her like a puppy when they were teenagers they were the same age had grown up all but shoulder to shoulder but she noticed there had been a few changes in him during her year in new york his face had fined down and his mouth seemed firmer and more confident the long lashes that had caused the boys to tease him mercilessly in his youth no longer seemed feminine his light brown hair el was needlestraight and streaked from the sun when he smiled at her dimplesanother curse of his youthdented his cheeks see something interesting he asked her i might his voice matched his face she decided all grownup and male the flutter in her stomach was satisfying and unexpectedly strong i just might i figure you had a reason for swimming out here mostly naked not that i didnt enjoy the view but you want to tell me what it is or do you want me to guess she laughed kicking against the current to keep a teasing distance between them maybe i just wanted to cool off i imagine so he smiled back satisfied that he understood her better than she could ever imagine i heard jo came in on the morning ferry the smile slid away from her face and left her eyes cold so what so you want to blow off some steam want to use me to do it when she hissed at him and started to kick out to swim back to shore he merely nipped her by the waist ill oblige you he said as she tried to wiggle free ive been wanting to anyway get your hands the end of her demand was lost in a surprised grunt against his mouth shed never expected reliable gaff verdon to move so quickly or so decisively she hadnt realized his hands were so big or so hard or that his mouth would be so sexy as it crushed down on hers with the cool tang of the sea clinging to it for forms sake she shoved against him but ruined it with a throaty little moan as her lips parted and invited more she tasted exactly as hed imaginedhot and ready the sex kitten mouth slippery and wet he fantasies hed woven for over ten years simply fell apart and reformed in fresh wild colors threaded with helpless love and desperate need when she wrapped her legs around his waist rocked her body against his he was lost i want you he tore his mouth from hers to race it along her throat while the waves tossed them about and into a tangle of limbs damn you lex you know ive always wanted you water flowed over her head filled it with roaring the sea sucked her down made her giddy then she was in the dazzling sunlight again with his mouth fused to hers now then right now she panted it out amazed at how real the need was that tight hot little ball of it right here hed wanted her like this as long as he could remember ready and willing and eager his body pulsed toward pain with the need to be in her and of her and he knew if he let that need rule he would take her and lose her in one flash instead he slid his hands down from her waist to cup and knead her bottom used his thumbs to torment her until her eyes went dark and blind ive waited lex and let her go so can you she struggled to stay above the waves sputtered out water as she gaped at him what the hell are you talking about im not interested in scratching your itch and then watching you walk off purring he lifted a hand to push back his dripping hair when youre ready for more than that you know where to find me you son of a bitch you go work off your mad honey well talk when youve had time to think it through calm his hand shot out grabbed her arm when i make love with you thats going to be it for both of us youll want to think about that too she shoved his hand away dont you touch me again gaff verdon im going to do more than touch you he told her as she dove under to swim toward shore im going to marry you he said only loud enough for his own ears he let out a long breath as he watched her stride out of the water unless i kill myself first to case the throbbing in his system he sank under the water but as the taste of her continued to cling to his mouth he decided he was either the smartest man on desire or the stupidest jo had just drummed up the energy to take a walk and had reached the edges of the garden when lexy stormed up the path she hadnt bothered to towel off so the little sundress was plastered against her like skin jo straightened her shoulders lifted an eyebrow well hows the water go to hell breath heaving humiliation still stinging lexy planted her feet just go straight to hell im beginning to think ive already arrived and so far my welcomes been pretty much as expected why should you expect anything this place means nothing to you ancd neither do we how do you know what means anything to me lexy t dont see you changing sheets clearing tables whens the last time you scrubbed a toilet or mopped a damn floor is that what youve been doing this afternoon jo skimmed her gaze up lexys damp and sandy legs to her dripping hair must have been some toilet i dont have to explain myself to you same goes lex when jo started to move past lexy grabbed her arm and jerked why did you come back here weariness swamped her suddenly made her want to weep i dont know but it wasnt to hurt you it wasnt to hurt anybody and im too tired to fight with you now baffled lexy stared at her the sister she knew would have waded in with words scraped flesh with sarcasm shed never known jo to tremble and back off what happened to you ill let you know when i figure it out jo shook off the hand blocking her leave me alone and ill do the same for you she walked quickly down the path took its curve toward the sea she barely glanced at the dune swale with its glistening grasses never looked up to follow the flight of the gull that called stridently she needed to think she told herself just an hour or two of quiet thought she would figure out what to do how to tell them if she should tell them at all could she tell them about her breakdown could she tell anyone that shed spent two weeks in the hospital because her nerves had snapped and something in her mind had tilted would they be sympathetic ambivalent or hostile and what did it matter how could she tell them about the photograph no matter how often she was at swords point with them they were her family how could she put them through that dredging up the pain and the past and if any of them demanded to see it she would have to tell them it was gong just like annabelle or it had never existed they would think her mad poor jo ellen mad as a hatter could she tell them shed spent days trembling inside her apartment doors locked after shed left the hospital that she would catch herself searching mindlessly frantically for the print that would prove she wasnt really ill and that she had come home because shed finally had to accept that she was ill that if she had stayed locked in that apartment alone for another day she would never have found the courage to leave it again still the print was so clear in her mind the texture the tones the composition her mother had been young in the photograph and wasnt that the way jo remembered heryoung the long waving hair the smooth skin if she was going to hallucinate about her mother wouldnt she have snapped to just that age nearly the same age she herself was now jo thought that was probably another reason for all the dreams the fears the nerves had annabelle been as restless and as edgy as her daughter was had there been a lover after all there had been whispers of that even a child had been able to hear them thered been no hint of one no suspicion of infidelity before the desertion but afterward the rumors had been rife and tongues had clucked and wagged but then annabelle would have been discreet and clever she had given no hint of her plans to leave yet she had left wouldnt daddy have known jo wondered surely a man knew if his wife was restless and dissatisfied and unhappy she knew they had argued over the island had that been enough to do it to make annabelle so unhappy that she would turn her back on her home her husband her children hadnt he seen it or had he even then been oblivious to the feelings of the people around him it was so hard to remember if it had ever been different but surely there had once been laughter in that house echoes of it still lingered in her mind quick snapshots of her parents embracing in the kitchen of her mother laughing of walking on the beach with her fathers hand holding hers they were dim pictures faded with time as if improperly fixed but they were there and they were real if she had managed to block so many memories of her mother out of her mind then she could also bring them back and maybe she would begin to understand then she would decide what to do the crunch of a footstep made her look up quickly the sun wasbehind him casting him in shadow a cap shielded his eyes his stride was loose and leggy another longforgotten picture snapped into her mind she saw herself as a little girl with flyaway hair racing down the path giggling calling then leaping high and his arms had reached out to catch her to toss her high then hug her close jo blinked the picture away and the tears that wanted to come with it he didnt smile and she knew that no matter how she worked to negate it he saw annabelle in her she lifted her chin and met his eyes hello daddy jo ellen he stopped a foot away and took her measure he saw that kate had been right the girl looked ill pale and strained because he didnt know how to touch her didnt believe she would welcome the touch in any case he dipped his hands into his pockets kate told me you were here i came in on the morning ferry she said knowing the information was unnecessary for a difficult moment they stood there more awkward than strangers sam shifted his feet you in trouble im just taking some time off you look peaked ive been working too hard frowning he looked deliberately at the camera hanging from a strap around her neck doesnt look like youre taking time off to me in an absent gesture she cupped a hand under the camera old habits are hard to break they are that he huffed out a breath theres a pretty light on the water today and the waves are up guess itd make a nice picture ill check it out thanks take a hat next time youll likely burn yes youre right ill remember he could think of nothing else so he nodded and started up the path moving past her mind the sun i will she turned away quickly walking blindly now because she had smelled the island on him the rich dark scent of it and it broke her heart miles away in the hot red glow of the darkroom light he slipped paper emulsion side up into a tray of developing fluid it pleased him to recreate the moment from so many years before to watch it form on the paper shadow by shadow and line by line he was nearly done with this phase and wanted to linger to draw out all the pleasure before he moved on he had driven her back to sanctuary the idea made him chuckle and preen nothing could have been more perfect it was there that he wanted her otherwise he would have taken her before half a dozen times before but it had to be perfect he knew the beauty of perfection and the ki fu iy toward creating it satisfaction of wor ng care i not annabelle but annabelles daughter a perfect circle closing she would be his triumph his masterpiece claiming her taking her killing her and every stage of it would be captured on film oh how jo would appreciate that he could barely wait to explain it all to her the one person he was certain would understand his ambition and his art her work drew him and his understanding of it made him feel intimate with her already and they would become more intimate yet smiling he shifted the print from the developing tray to the stop bath swishing it through before lifting it into the fixer carefully he checked the temperature of the wash waiting patiently until the timer rang and he could switch on the white light and examine the print beautiful just beautiful lovely composition dramatic lighting such a perfect halo over the hair such lovely shadows to outline the body and highlight skin tones and the subject he thought perfection when the print was fully fixed he lifted it out of the tray and into the running water of the wash now he could allow himself to dream of what was to come he was closer to her than ever linked to her through the photographs that reflected each of their lives he could barely wait to send her the next but he knew he must choose the time with great care on the worktable beside him a battered journal lay open its precisely written words faded from time the decisive moment is the ultimate goal in my work capturing that short passing event where all the elements all the dynamics of a subject reach a peak at more decisive moment can there be than death and how much more control can the photographer have over thes moment over the capturing of it on film than to plan and stage and cause that deatb yhat single actorns subject and artist makes him part of the art and the image created since i will kill only one woman manipulate only one deetsive moment i have chosen her with great care her name is annabelle with a quiet sigh he hung the print to dry and turned on the white light to better study it annabelle he murmured so beautiful and your daughter is the image of you he left annabelle there staring staring and went out to complete his plans for his stay on desire the ferry steamed across pelican sound heading east to lost desire nathan delaney stood at the starboard rail as he had done before as a tenyearold boy it wasnt the same ferry and he was no longer a boy but he wanted to recreate the moment as closely as possible it was cool with the breeze off the water and the scent of it was raw and mysterious it had been warmer before but then it had been late may rather than midapril close enough he thought remembering how he and his parents and his young brother had all crowded together at the starboard rail of another ferry eager for their first glimpse of desire and the start of their island summer he could see little difference spearing up from the land were the majestic live oaks with their lacy moss cabbage palms and glossyleaved magnolias not yet in bloom had they been blooming then a young boy eager for adventure paid little attention to flowers he lifted the binoculars that hung around his neck his father had helped him aim and focus on that longago morning so that he could catch the quick dart of a woodpecker the expected tussle had followed because kyle had demanded the binoculars and nathan hadnt wanted to give them up he remembered his mother laughing at them and his father bending down to tickle kyle to distract him in his mind nathan could see the picture they had made the pretty woman with her hair blowing her dark eyes sparkling with amusement and excitement the two young boys sturdy and scrubbed squabbling and the man tall and dark long of leg and rangy of build now nathan thought he was the only one left somehow he had grown up into his fathers body had gone from sturdy boy to a man with long legs and narrow hips he could look in a mirror and see reflections of his fathers face in the hollow cheeks and dark gray eyes but he had his mothers mouth firmly ridged and her deep brown hair with hints of gold and red his father had said it was like aged mahogany nathan wondered if children were really just montages of their parents and he shuddered without the binoculars he watched the island take shape he could see the wash of color from wildflowerspinks and violets from lupine and wood sorrel a scatter of houses was visible a few straight or winding roads the flash of a creek that disappeared into the trees mystery was added by the dark shadows of the forest where feral pigs and horses had once lived the gleam of the marshes and the blades of waving grasses gold and green in the streaming morning sunlight it was all hazed with distance like a dream then he saw the gleam of white on a rise the quick wink that was sun shooting off glass sanctuary he thought and kept it in his sights until the ferry turned toward the dock and the house was lost from view nathan turned from the rail and walked back to his jeep when he was settled inside with only the hum of the ferrys engines for company he wondered if he was crazy coming back here exploring the past in some ways repeating it hed left new york packed everything that mattered into the jeep it was surprisingly little then again hed never had a deepseated need for things that had made his life simpler through the divorce two years before maureen had been the collector and it saved them both a great deal of time and temper when he offered to let her strip the west side apartment christ knew shed taken him up on it and had left him with little more than his own clothes and a mattress that chapter of his life was over and for nearly two years now hed devoted himself to his work designing buildings was as much a passion as a career for him and with new york as no more than a home base he had traveled studying sites working wherever he could set up his drawing board and computer hed given himself the gift of time to study other buildings explore the art of them from the great cathedrals in italy and france to the streamlined desert homes in the american southwest hed been free his work the only demand on his time and on his heart then he had lost his parents suddenly irrevocably and had lost himself he wondered why he felt he could find the pieces on desire but he was committed to staying at least six months nathan took it as a good sign that hed been able to book the same cottage his famly had lived in during that summer he knew he would listen for the echo of their voices and would hear them with a mans ear he would see their ghosts with a mans eyes and he would return to sanctuary with a mans purpose would they remember him the children of annabelle he would soon find out he decided when the ferry bumped up to the dock he waited his turn watching as the blocks were removed from the tires of the pickup ahead of him a family of five he noted and from the gear he could see that they would be camping at the facility the island provided nathan shook his head wondering why anyone would choose to sleep in a tent on the ground and consider it a vacation the light dimmed as clouds rolled over the sun frowning he noted that they were coming in fast flying in from the east rain could come quickly to barrier islands he knew he remembered it falling in torrents for three endless days when hed been there before by day two he and kyle had been at each others throats like young wolves it made him smile now and wonder how in gods name his mother had tolerated it he drove slowly off the ferry then up the bumpy pitted road leading away from the dock with his windows open he could hear the cheerfully blaring rock and roll screaming out of the trucks radio camper family he thought was already having a great time impending rain or not he was determined to follow their example and enjoy the morning he would have to face sanctuary of course but he would approach it as an architect he remembered that its heart was a glorious example of the colonial stylewide verandas stately columns tall narrow windows even as a child hed been interested enough to note some of the details gargoyle rainspouts he recalled that personalized rather than detracted from the grand style hed scared the piss out of kyle by telling him they came alive at night and prowled there was a turret with a widows walk circling it balconies jutting out with ornate railings of stone or iron the chimneys were softhued stones mined from the mainland the house itself fashioned of local cypress and oak there was a smokehouse that had still been in use and slave quarters that had been falling to rain where he and brian and kyle had found a rattler curled in a dark corner there were deer in the forest and alligators in the marshes whispers of pirates and ghosts filled the air it was a fine place for young boys and grand adventures and for dark and dangerous secrets he passed the western marshlands with their busy mud and thin islands of trees the wind had picked up sending the cordgrass rippling along the edge two egrets were on patrol their long legs like stilts in the shallow water then the forest took over lush and exotic nathan slowed letting the truck ahead of him rattle out of sight here was stillness and those dark secrets his heart began to pound uncomfortably and his hands tightened on the wheel this was something hed come to face to dissect and eventually to understand the shadows were thick and the moss dripped from the trees like webs of monstrous spiders to test himself he turned off the engine he could hear nothing but his own heartbeat and the voice of the wind ghosts he thought he would have to look for them there and when he found them what then would he leave them where they drifted night after night or would they continue to haunt him muttering to him in his sleep would he see his mothers face or annabelles and which one would cry out the loudest he let out a long breath caught himself reaching for the cigarettes hed given up over a year before annoyed he turned the ignition key but got only a straining rumble in return he pumped the gas tried it again with the same results well shit he muttered thats perfect sitting back he tapped his fingers restlessly on the wheel the thing to do of course was to get out and look under the hood he knew what he would seean engine wires and tubes and belts nathan figured he knew as much about engines and wires and tubes as he did about brain surgery and being broken down on a deserted road was exactly what he deserved for letting himself be talked into buying a friends secondhand jeep resigned he climbed out and popped the hood yep he thought just as hed suspected an enging he leaned in poked at it and felt the first fat drop of rain hit his back now its even more perfect he shoved his hands in the front pockets of his jeans and scowled continued to scowl while the rain pattered on his head he should have known something was up when his friend had cheerfully tossed in a box of tools along with the jeep nathan considered hauling them out and beating on the engine with a wrench it was unlikely to work but it would at least be satisfying he stepped back then froze as the ghost stepped out of the forest shadows and watched him annabelle the name swam through his mind and his gut clenched in defense she stood in the rain still as a doe her smoky red hair damp and tangled those big blue eyes quiet and sad his knees threatened to give way and he braced a hand on the fender then she moved pushed back her wet hair and started toward him he saw then that it was no ghost but a woman it was not annabelle but he was sure it was annabelles daughter he let out the breath hed been holding until his heart settled again car trouble jo tried to keep her voice light the way he was staring at her made her wish shed stayed in the trees and let him fend for himself i take it youre not standing here in the rain taking in the sights no it pleased him that his voice was normal if there was all edge to it the situation was cause enough to explain it it wont start well thats a problem he looked vaguely familiar she thought a good face strong and bony and male interesting eyes as well she mused pure gray and very direct if she were inclined to portrait photography hed have been a fine subject did you find the trouble her voice was honey over cream gorgeously southern it helped him relax i found the engine he said and smiled just where i suspected it would be uhhuh and now im deciding how long i should look at it and pretend i know what im looking at before i get back in out of the rain you dont know how to fix your car she asked with such obvious surprise that he bristled no i dont i also own shoes and dont have a clue how to tan leather he started to yank down the hood but she raised a hand to hold it open ill take a look what are you a mechanic no but i know the basics elbowing him aside she checked the battery connections first these look all right but youre going to want to keep an eye on them for corrosion if youre spending any time on desire six months or so he leaned in with her what am i keeping my eye on these moisture can play hell with engines around here youre crowding me sorry he shifted his position obviously she didnt remember him and he decided to pretend he didnt remember her you live on the island not anymore to keep from bumping it on the jeep jo moved the camera slung around her neck to her back nate stared at it felt the low jolt it was a highend nikon compact quieter and more rugged than other designs it was often a professionals choice his father had had one he had one himself been out taking pictures in the rain wasnt raining when i left she said absently your fan belts going to need replacing before long but thats not your problem now she straightened and though the skies had opened wide seemed oblivious to the downpour get in and try it so i can hear what she sounds like youre the boss her lips twitched as he turned and climbed back into the jeep no doubt his male ego was dented she decided she cocked her head as the engine groaned lips pursed she leaned back under the hood again she called out to him muttering to herself carburetor what carburetor she repeated and opened the little metal door with her thumb turn her over again this time the engine roared to life with a satisfied nod she shut the hood and walked around to the drivers side window its sticking closed thats all youre going to want to have it looked at from the sound of it you need a tuneup anyway whens the last time you had it in i just bought it a couple of weeks ago from a former friend ah always a mistake well it should get you where youre going now when she started to step back he reached through the window for her hand it was narrow he noted long both elegant and competent listen let me give you a lift its pouring and its the least i can do its not necessary i can i could break down again he shot her a smile charming easy persuasive wholl fix my carburetor it was foolish to refuse she knew more foolish to feel trapped just because he had her hand she shrugged all right then she gave her hand a little tug was relieved when he immediately released it she jogged around the jeep and climbed dripping into the passenger seat well the interiors in good shape my former friend knows me too well nathan turned on the wipers and looked at jo where to up this road then bear right at the first fork sanctuary isnt farbut then nothing is on desire thats handy im heading to sanctuary myself oh the air in the cab was thick and heavy the driving rain seemed to cut them off from everything misting out the trees muffling all the sound reason enough to be uncomfortable she told herself but she was sufficiently annoyed with her reaction to angle her head and meet his eyes directly are you staying at the big house no just picking up keys for the cottage im renting for six months you said it relieved her when he began to drive turned those intense gray eyes away from her face and focused on the road thats a long vacation i brought work with me i wanted a change of scene for a while desires a long way from home she said then smiled a little when he glanced at her anyone from georgia can spot a yankee even if you keep your mouth shut you move differently she pushed her wet hair back if shed walked jo thought shed have been spared making conversation but talk was better than the heavy raindrenched silence youve got little desire cottage by the river how do you know oh everybody knows everything around here but my family rents the cottages runs them and the inn the restaurant as it happens i was assigned little desire stocked the linens and so forth just yesterday for the yankee whos coming to stay for six months so youre my mechanic landlord and housekeeper im a lucky man who exactly do i call if my sink backs up you open the closet and take out the plunger if you need instructions for use ill write them down for you heres the fork nathan bore right and climbed lets try that again if i wanted to grill a couple of steaks chill a bottle of wine and invite you to dinner who would i call jo turned her head and gave him a cool look youd have better luck with my sister her name is alexa does she fix carburetors with a half laugh jo shook her head no but shes very decorative and enjoys invitations from men and you dont lets just say im more selective than lexy ouch whistling nathan rubbed a hand over his heart direct hit just saving us both some time theres sanctuary she murmured he watched it appear through the curtain of rain swim out of the thin mists that curled at its base it was old and grand as elegant as a southern belle dressed for company definitely feminine nate thought with those fluid lines all in virginal white tall windows were softened by arched trim and pretty ironwork adorned balconies where flowers bloomed out of clay pots of soft red her gardens glowed the blooms heavyheaded with rain like bowing fairies at her feet stunning nathan said half to himself the more recent additions blend perfectly with the on ginal structure accent rather than modernize its a masterful harmony of styles classically southern without being typical it couldnt be more perfect if the island had been designed for it rather than it being designed for the island nathan stopped at the end of the drive before he noticed that jo was staring at him for the first time there was curiosity in her eyes im an architect he explained buildings like this grab me right by the throat well then youll probably want a tour of the inside id love one and id owe you at least one steak dinner for that youll want my cousin kate to show you around shes a pendleton jo added as she opened her door sanctuary came down through the pendletons she knows it best come inside you can dry off some and pick up the keys she hurried up the steps paused on the veranda to shake her head and scatter rain from her hair she waited until he stepped up beside her jesus look at this door reverently nathan ran his fingertips over the rich carved wood odd that hed forgotten it he thought but then he had usually raced in through the screened porch and through the kitchen honduran mahogany jo told him imported in the early eighteenhundreds long before anyone worried about depicting the rain forests but it is beautiful she turned the heavy brass handle and stepped with him into sanctuary the floors are heart of pine she began and blocked out a una bidden image of her mother patiently pastewaxing them as are the main stairs and the banister is oak carved and constructed here on desire when it was a plantation dealing mostly in sea island cotton the chandelier is more recent an addition purchased in france by the wife of stewart pendleton the shipping tycoon who rebuilt the main house and added the wings a great deal of the furniture was lost during the war between the states but stewart and his wife traveled extensively and selected antiques that suited them and sanctuary he had a good eye nathan commented scanning the wide highceilinged foyer with its fluid sweep of glossy stairs its glittering fountain of crystal light and a deep pocket jo put in telling herself to be patient she stood where she was and let him wander the walls were a soft pale yellow that would give the illusion of cool during those viciously hot summer afternoons they were trimmed in dark wood that added richness with carved moldings framing the high plaster ceiling the furnishings here were heavy and large in scale as befitted a grand entrance way a pair of george armchairs with shellshaped backs flanked a hexagonal credence table that held a towering brass urn filled with sweetly scented lilies and wild grasses though he didnt collect antiques himselfor anything else for that matterhe was a man who studied all aspects of buildings including what went inside them he recognized the flemish cabinetonstand in carved oak the giltwood pier mirror over a marquetry candle stand the delicacy of queen antic and the flash of louis xiv and he found the mix of periods and styles inspired incredible his hands tucked in his back pockets he turned back to jo hell of a place to live id say in more ways than one her voice was dry and just a little bitter it had him lifting a brow in question but she added nothing more we do registration in the front parlor she turned down the hallway stepped into the first room on the right someone had started a fire she observed probably in anticipation of the yankee and to keep the guests at the inn cheerful on a rainy day if they wandered through she went to the huge old chippendale writing desk and opened the top side drawer flipped through the paperwork for the rental cottages upstairs in the family wing was an office with a workaday file cabinet and a computer kate was still struggling to learn about but guests were never subjected to such drearily ordinary details little desire cottage jo announced sliding the contract free she noted it had already been stamped to indicate receipt of the deposit and signed by both kate and one nathan delaney jo laid the paperwork aside and opened another drawer to take out the keys jingling from a metal clip that held the cottage name this one is for both the front and the rear doors and the smaller one is for the storage room under the cottage i wouldnt store anything important in there if i were you flooding is a hazard that near the river ill remember that i took care of setting up the telephone yesterday all calls will be billed directly to the cottage and added to your bill monthly she opened another drawer and took out a slim folder youll find the usual information and answers in this packet the ferry schedule tide information how to rent fishing or boating scar if you want it theres a pamphlet that describes the islandhistory flora and fauna why are you staring at me like that she demanded youve got gorgeous eyes its hard not to look at them she shoved the folder into his hands youd be better off looking at whats in here all right nathan opened it began to page through are you always this jittery or do i bring that out in you im not jittery im impatient not all of us are on vacation do you have any questionsthat pertain to the cottage or the island ill let you know directions to your cottage are in the folder if youd just initial the contract here to confirm receipt of the keys and information you can be on your way he smiled again intrigued at how rapidly her southern hospitality was thinning i wouldnt want to wear out my welcome he said taking the pen she offered him since i intend to come back breakfast lunch and dinner are served in the inns dining room the service hours are also listed in your folder box lunches are available for picnics the more she talked the more he enjoyed hearing her voice she smelled of rain and nothing else and lookedwhen you looked into those lovely blue eyesas sad as a bird with a broken wing do you like picnics he asked her she let out a long sigh snatched the pen back from him and scrawled her initials under his youre wasting your time flirting with me mr delaney im just not interested any sensible woman knows that a statement like that only presents a challenge he bent down to read her initials jeh jo ellen hathaway she told him in hopes of hurrying him along its been a pleasure being rescued by you jo ellen he offered a hand amused when she hesitated before clasping it with hers try zeke fitzsimmons about that tuneup hell get the jeep running smoothly for you enjoy your stay on desire its already started on a higher note than id expected then your expectations must have been very low she slid her hand free and led the way back to the front door the rains let up she commented as she opened the door to moist air and mist you shouldnt have any trouble finding the cottage no he remembered the way perfectly im sure i wont ill see you again jo ellen will have to he thought for a number of reasons she inclined her head shut the door quietly and left him standing on the veranda wondering what to do next on his third day on desire nathan woke in a panic his heart was booming his breath short and strangled his skin iced covered with sweat he shot up in bed with fists clenched his eyes searching the murky shadows of the room weak sunlight filtered through the slats of the blinds and built a cage on the thin gray carpet his mind stayed blank for an agonizing moment trapped behind the images that crowded it moonlit trees fingers of fog a womans naked body her fanning dark hair wide glassy eyes ghosts he told himself as he rubbed his face hard with his hands hed expected them and they hadnt disappointed him they clung to desire like the moss clung to the live oaks he swung out of bed and deliberatelylike a child daring sidewalk crackswalked through the sun bars in the narrow bathroom he stepped into the white tub yanked the cheerfully striped curtain closed and ran the shower hot he washed the sweat away imagined the panic as a dark red haze that circled and slid down the drain the room was thick with steam when he dried off but his mind was clear again he dressed in a tattered shortsleeved sweatshirt and ancient gym shorts then with his face unshaven and his hair dripping headed into the kitchen to heat water for instant coffee he looked around scowled again at the carafe and drip cone the owners had provided even if he could have figured out the proper measuring formula he hadnt thought to bring coffee filters at that moment he would have paid a thousand dollars for a coffeemaker he set the kettle on the front burner of a stove that was older than he was then walked over to the living room section of the large multipurpose room to flip on the early news the reception was miserable and the pickings slim no coffeemaker no payperview nathan mused as he tuned in the sunrise news on one of the available channels he remembered how he and kyle had whined over the lack of televised entertainment how are we supposed to watch the six million dollar man on this stupid thing its agyp youre not here to keep your noses glued to the yv screen aw mom it seemed to him the color scheme was different now he lad a vague recollection of soft pastels on the wide deep chairs and straightbacked sofa now they were covered in bold geometric prints deep greens and blues sunny yellows the fan that dropped from the center pitch of the ceiling had squeaked he knew because hed been compelled to tug on the cord that it ran now with only a quiet hiss of blades but it was the same long yellowpine dining table separating the roomsthe table he and his family had gathered around to eat to play board games to put together eyecrossingly complex jigsaw puzzles during that summer the same table he and kvle had been assigned to clear after dinner the table where his father had lingered some mornings over coffee he remembered when their father had shown him and kyle how to punch holes in the lid of ajar and catch lightning bugs the evening had been warm and soft the hunt and chase giddy nathan remembered watching the ar hed put beside his bed wink and glow wink and glow lulling him to sleep but in the morning all the lightning bugs in his jar had been dead smothered as the book atop the lid had plugged all the holes he still couldnt remember putting it there that battered copy of jobnny tremaing the dark corpses in the bottom of the jar had left him feeling sick and guilty hed snuck out of the house and dumped them in the river he chased no more lightning bugs that summer irritated at the memory nathan turned away from the tv went back to the stove to pour the steaming water over a spoonful of coffee he carried the mug out onto the screened porch to look at the river memories were bound to surface now that he was here he reminded himself that was why hed come to remember that summer step by step day by day and to figure out what to do about the hathaways he sipped coffee winced a little at its false and bitter taste hed discovered that a great deal of life was false and bitter so he drank again jo ellen hathaway he remembered her as a skinny sharpelbowed girl with a sloppy ponytail and a lightning temper he hadnt had much use for girls at ten so hed paid her little attention shed simply been one of brians little sisters still was nathan thought and she was still skinny apparently her temper was still in place as well the streaming ponytail was gone the shorter choppy cut suited her personality if not her face he decided the carelessness of it the nod to fashion the color of it was like the pelt of a wild deer he wondered why she looked so pale and tired she didnt seem the type to pine away over a shattered affair or relationship but something was hurting her eyes were full of sorrow and secrets and that was the problem nathan thought with a half laugh he had a weakness for sadeyed women better to resist it he told himself wondering what was going on behind those big sad bluebell eyes was bound to interfere with his purpose what he needed was time and objectivity before he took the next step he sipped more coffee told himself hed get dressed shortly and walk to sanctuary for a decent cup and some breakfast it was time to go back to observe and to plan time to stir more ghosts but for now he just wanted to stand here look through the thin mesh of screen feel the damp air watch the sun slowly burn away the pearly mists that clung to the ground and skimmed like fairy wings over the river he could hear the ocean if he listened for it a low constant rumble off to the east closer he could identify the chirp of birds the monotionous drumming of a woodpecker hunting insects somewhere in the shadows of the forest dew glistened like shards of glass on the leaves of cabbage palms and palmettos and there was no wind to stir them and make them rattle whoever chose this spot for the cottage chose well he thought it sang of solitude offered view and privacy the structure itself was simple and functional a weathered cedar box on stilts with a generous screened porch on the west end a narrow open deck on the east inde the main room had a pitched ceiling to add space and an open si i feel on each end were two bedrooms and a bath he and icyle had each had a room in one half as the elder lie laid claim to the larger room the double bed made him feel very grownup and superior he made a sign for the door please knock before entering he liked to stay up late reading his books thinking his thoughts listening to the murmur of his parents voices or the drone of the tv he liked to hear them laugh at something they were watching his mothers quick chuckle his fathers deep belly laugh hed heard those sounds often throughout his childhood it grieved him that he would never hear them again a movement caught his eye nathan turned his head and where hed expected a deer he saw a man slipping along the river bank like the mist he was tall and lanky his hair dark as soot because his throat had gone dry nathan forced himself to lift his mug and drink again he continued to watch as the man walked closer as the strengthening sun slanted over his face not sam hathaway nathan realized as the beginnings of a smile tugged at his lips brian twenty years had made them both men brian glanced up squinted focused on the figure behind the screen hed forgotten the cottage was occupied now and made a note to himself to remember to take his walks on the opposite side of the river now he supposed he would have to make some attempt at conversation he lifted a hand morning didnt mean to disturb you you didnt i was just drinking bad coffee and watching the river the yankee brian remembered a sixmonth rental he could all but hear kate telling him to be polite to be sociable its a nice spot brian stuck his hands in his pockets annoyed that hed inadvertently sabotaged his own solitude you settling in all right yeah im settled nathan hesitated then took the next step are you still hunting the ghost stallion brian blinked cocked his head the ghost stallion was a legend that stretched back to the days when wild horses had roamed the island it was said that the greatest of these a huge black stallion of unparalleled speed ran the woods whoever caught him leaped onto his back and rode would have all his wishes granted throughout childhood it had been brians deepest ambition to be the one to catch and ride the ghost stallion i keep an eye out for him brian murmured and stepped closer do i know you we camped out one night across the river in a patched pup tent we had a rope halter a couple of flashlights and a bag of fritos once we thought we heard hooves pounding and a high wild whinny nathan smiled maybe we did brians eyes widened and the shadows in them cleared away nate nate delaney son of a bitch the screen door squeaked in welcome when nathan pushed it open come on up bri ill fix you a cup of lousy coffee grinning brian climbed up the stairs you should have let me know you were coming that you were here brian shot out a hand gripped nathans my cousin kate handles the cottages jesus nate you look like a derelict with a rueful smile nathan rubbed a hand over the stubble on his chin im on vacation well aint this a kick in the ass nate delaney brian shook his head what the hell have you been doing all these years hows kyle your parents the smile faltered ill tell you about it pieces of it nathan thought let me make that lousy coffee first hell no come on up to the house ill fix you a decent cup some breakfast all right let me get some pants and shoes on i cant believe youre our yankee brian commented as nathan started inside goddamn this takes me back nathan turned back briefly yeah me too a short time later nathan was sitting at the kitchen counter of sanctuary breathing in the heavenly scents of coffee brewing and bacon frying he watched brian deftly chopping mushrooms and peppers for an omelette looks like you know what youre doing didnt you read your pamphlet my kitchen has a fivestar rating brian slid a mug of coffee under nathans nose drink then grovel nathan sipped closed his eyes in grateful pleasure ive been drinking sand for the last two days and that may be influencing me but id say this is the best cup of coffee ever brewed in the civilized world damn right it is why havent you come up before this ive been getting my bearings being lazy getting acquainted with ghosts nathan thought now that ive sampled this ill be a regular brian tossed his chopped vegetables into a skillet to sauteed then began grating cheese wait till you get a load of my omelette so what are you independently wealthy that you can take six months off to sit on the beach i brought work with me im an architect as long as i have my computer and my drawing board i can work anywhere an architect whisking eggs brian leaned against the counter you any good id put my buildings against your coffee any day well then chuckling brian turned back to the stove with the ease of experience he poured the egg mixture set bacon to drain checked the biscuits he had browning in the oven so whats kyle up to he ever get rich and famous like he wanted it was a stab hard and fast in the center of the heart nathan put the mug down and waited for his hands and voice to steady he was working on it hes dead brian he died a couple of months ago jesus nathan shocked brian swung around jesus im sorry he was in europe hed been more or less living there the last couple of years he was on a yacht some party kyle liked to party nathan murmured rubbing his temple they were tooling around the med the verdict was he must have had too much to drink and fallen overboard maybe he hit his head but he was gone thats rough im sorry brian turned back to his skillet losing family takes a chunk out of you yeah it does nathan drew a deep breath braced himself it happened just a few weeks after my parents were killed train wreck in south america dad was on assignment and ever since kyle and i hit college age mom traveled with him she used to say it made them feel like newlyweds all the time christ nate i dont know what to say nothing nathan lifted his shoulders you get through i figure mom would have been lost without dad and i dont know how either one of them would have handled losing kyle youve got to figure everything happens for a reason and you get through sometimes the reason stinks brian said quietly a whole hell of a lot of the time the reason stinks doesnt change anything its good to be back here its good to see you we had some fine times that summer some of the best of my life nathan worked up a smile are you going to give me that omelette or are you going to make me beg for it the food on a plate genuflecting afterward is encouraged nathan picked up a fork and dug in so fill me in on the last two decades of the adventures of brian hathaway not much of an adventure running the inn takes a lot of time we get guests yearround now seems the more crowded and busy life in the outside world gets the more people want to get the hell away from it for weekends anyhow and when they do we house them feed them entertain them it sounds like a twentyfour seven proposition would be on the outside life still moves slower around here wife kids nope you i had a wife nathan said dryly we gave each other up no kids you know your sister checked me in jo ellen did she brian brought the pot over to top off nathans cup she just got here herself about a week ago lex is here too were one big happy family as brian turned away nathan lifted his eyebrows at the tone your dad you couldnt dynamite him off desire he doesnt even go over to the mainland for supplies anymore youll see him wandering around he glanced over as lexy swung through the door weve got a couple of early birds panting for coffee she began then spotting nathan she paused automatically she flipped back her hair angled her head and aimed a flirtatious smile well kitchen company she strolled closer to pose against the counter and give him a whiff of the eternity shed rubbed on her throat from a magazine sample that morning you must be special if brians let you into his domain nathans hormones did the quick instinctive dance that made him want to laugh at both of them a gorgeous piece of fluff was his first impression but he revised it when he took a good look into her eyes they were sharp and very selfaware he took pity on an old friend nathan told her really she liked the roughedged look of him and pleased herself by basking in the easy male approval on his face well then brian introduce me to your old friend i didnt know you had any nathan delaney brian said shortly going over to fetch the second pot of freshly brewed coffee my kid sister lexy nathan lexy offered a hand shed manicured in flame red brian still sees me in pigtails big brothers privilege it surprised nathan to find the sirens hand firm and capable actually i remember you in pigtails myself do you mildly disappointed that he hadnt lingered over her hand lexy folded her elbows on the bar and leaned toward him i cant believe ive forgotten you i make it a policy to remember all the attractive men whove come into my life however briefly you were barely out of diapers brian put in his voice dripping sarcasm and hadnt polished your femmefatale routine yet cheese and mushroom omelettes are the breakfast special he told her ignoring the vicious look she shot in his direction she caught herself before she snarled made her lips curve up thanks sugar she purred it as she took the coffeepot he thrust at her then she fluttered her lashes at nathan dont be a stranger we get so few interesting men on desire because it seemed foolish to resist the treat and she seemed so obviously to expect it nathan watched her sashay out then turned back to brian with a slow grin thats some baby sister youve got there bri she needs a good walloping coming on to strange men that way it was a nice side dish with my omelette but nathan held up a hand as brians eyes went hot dont worry about me pal that kind of heartthrob means major headaches ive got enough problems you can bet your ass ill look but i dont plan to touch none of my business brian muttered shes bound and determined not just to look for trouble but to find it women who look like that usually slide their way out of it too he swiveled when the door opened again this time it was jo who walked through it and women who look like that nathan thought dont slide out of trouble they punch their way out he wondered why he preferred that kind of woman and that kind of method jo stopped when she saw him her brows drew together before she deliberately smoothed her forehead you look right at home mr delaney feeling that way miss hathaway well thats pretty formal brian commented as he reached for a clean mug for a guy who pushed her into the river then got a bloody lip for his trouble when he tried to fish her out again i didnt push her in nathan smiled slowly as he watched jos brows knit again she slipped but she did bloody my lip and call me a yankee pig bastard as i recall the memory circled around her mind nearly skipped away then popped clear hot summer afternoon the shock of cool water head going under and coming up swinging youre mr davids boy the warmth spread in her stomach and up to her heart for a moment her eyes reflected it and made his pulse trip which one nathan the older of course she skimmed her hair back not with the studied seductiveness of her sister but with absentminded impatience and you did push me i never fell in the river unless i wanted to or was helped along you slipped nathan corrected then i helped you along she laughed a quick rich chuckle then took the mug brian offered i suppose i can let bygones be since i gave you a fat lipand your father gave me the world nathans head began to throb fast and vicious my father i dogged him like a shadow pestered him mercilessly about how he took pictures why he took the ones he did how the camera worked he was so patient with me i must have been driving him crazy interrupting his work that way but he never shooed me away he taught me so much not just the basics but how to look and how to see i suppose i owe him for every photograph ive ever taken the breakfast hed just eaten churned greasily in his stomach youre a professional photographer jos a bigdeal photographer lexy said with a bite in her voice as she came back in the globetrotting j e hathaway snapping her pictures of other peoples lives as she goes two omelettes brian two sides of hash browns one bacon one sausage rooms having breakfast miss world traveler youve got beds to strip exit stage left jo murmured when lexy strode out again yes she said turning back to nathan thanks in large part to david delaney im a photographer if it hadnt been for mr david i might be as frustrated and pissed off at the world as lexy how is your father hes dead nathan said shortly and pushed himself up from the stool ive got to get back thanks for breakfast brian he went out fast letting the screen door slam behind him dead brian accident brian told her about three months ago both his parents and he lost his brother about a month later oh god jo ran a hand over her face i put my foot in that ill be back in a minute she set the mug down and raced out the door to chase nathan down nathan nathan wait a minute she caught him on the shell path that wound through the garden toward the trees im sorry she put a hand on his arm to stop him im so sorry i went on that way he pulled himself in fought to think clearly over the pounding in his temples its all right im still a little raw there if id known she broke off shrugged her shoulders helplessly shed likely have put her foot in it anyway she decided shed always been socially clumsy you didnt nathan clamped down on his own nerves and gave the hand still on his arm a light squeeze she looked so distressed he thought and shed done nothing more than accidentally scrape an open wound dont worry about it i wish id managed to keep in touch with him her voice went mistful now i wish id made more of an effort so i could have thanked him for everything he did for me dont he bit the word off swung around to her with his eyes fierce and cold thanking someone for where your life ended up is the same as blaming them for it were all responsible for ourselves uneasy she backed off a step true enough but some people influence what roads we take funny then that were both back here isnt it he stared beyond her to sanctuary where the windows glinted in the sun why are you back here jo its my home he looked back at her pale cheeks bruised eyes and thats where you come when you feel beat up and lost and unhappy she folded her arms across her chest as if chilled she usually the observer didnt care to be observed quite so clearsightedly its just where you go it seems we decided to come here at almost the same time fate i wonderor luck he smiled a little because he was going to go with the latter coincidence she preferred it why are you back here damned if i know he exhaled between his teeth then looked at her again he wanted to soothe that sorrow and worry from her eyes hear that laugh again he was suddenly very certain it would ease his soul as much as hers but since i am why dont you walk me back to the cottage you know the way itd be a nicer walk with company with you i told you im not interested im telling you i am his smile deepened as he reached up to tuck a stray lock of hair behind her ear itll be fun seeing who nudges who to the other side men didnt flirt with her ever or not that she had ever noticed the fact that he was doing just that and she noticed only irritated her the inherent pendleton fault line dug between her brows ive got work to do right bed stripping in see you around jo ellen because he turned away first she had the opportunity to watch him walk into the trees deliberately she shook her hair so that it fell over her ears again then she rolled her shoulders as if shrugging off an unwelcome touch but she was forced to admit she was already more interested than she wanted to be atnan took a camera with him he felt compelled to retrace some of his fathers footsteps on desireor perhaps to eradicate them he chose the heavy old mediumrange pentax one of his fathers favorites and surely be thought one that david delancy had brought to the island with him that summer he would have brought the bulky hasselblad view camera as well and the clever nikon along with a collection of lenses and filters and a mountain of film nathan had brought them all and they were neatly stored as his father had taught him back at the cottage but when his father hiked out to hunt a shot he would most usually take the pentax nathan chose the beach with its foaming waves and diamond sand he slipped on dark glasses against the fierce brilliance of the sun and climbed onto the marked path between the shifting dunes with their garden of sea oats and tangle of railroad vines the wind kicked in from the sea and sent his har flying he stood at the crest of the path listening to the beat of the water the smug squeal of gulls that wheeled and dipped above it shells the tide had left behind were scattered like pretty toys along the sand tiny dunes whisked up by the wind were already forming behind them the busy sanderlings were rushing back and forth in the spume like businessmen hustling to the next meeting and there just behind the first roll of water a trio of pelicans flew in military formation climbing and wheeling as a unit one would abruptly drop a dizzying headfirst dive into the sea and the others would follow a trio of splashes then they were up again breakfast in their beaks with the ease of experience nathan lifted his camera widened the aperture increased the shutter speed to catch the motion then homed in on the pelicans following following as they skimmed the wave crests rose into their climb and capturing them on the next bombing dive he lowered the camera smiled a little over the years hed gone long stretches of time without indulging in his hobby he planned to make up for it now spending at least an hour a day reacquainting himself with the pleasure and improving his eye he couldnt have asked for a more perfect beginning the beach was inhabited only by birds and shells his footprints were the only ones to mar the sand that was a miracle in itself he thought where else could a man be so entirely alone borrow for a while this kind of beauty along with peace and solitude he needed those things now miracles beauty peace cupping a hand over the camera nathan walked down the incline to the soft moist sand of the beach he crouched now and then to examine a shell to trace the shape of a starfish with a fingertip but he left them where he found them collecting them only on film the air and the exercise helped settle the nerves that had jangled before hed left sanctuary she was a photographer nathan thought as he studied a pretty weathersilvered cottage peeking out from behind the dunes had his father known that the little girl hed played mentor to one summer had gone on to follow in his footsteps would he have cared been proud amused he could remember when his father had first shown him the workings of a camera the big hands had covered his small ones gently patiently guiding the smell of aftershave on his fathers cheeks a sharp tang brut yes brut mom had liked that best his fathers cheek had been smoothly shaven pressed against his his dark hair would have been neatly combed smooth bumps of waves back from the forehead his clear gray eyes soft and serious always respect your equipment nate you may want to make a living from the camera one day travel the world on it and see everything there is to see learn how to look and youll see more than anyone else or youll be something else do something else an to just use it to take moments away with you vacations family theyll be your moments so theyll be important respect your equipment learn to use it right and youll never lose those moments how many did we lose anyway nathan wondered aloud and how many do we have tucked away that wed be better off losing excuse me nathan jerked when the voice cut through the memory when a hand touched his arm what he took a quickstep in retreat half expecting one of his own ghosts but he saw a pretty delicately built blonde staring up at him through ambertinted lenses sorry i startled you she tilted her head and her eyes stayed focused unblinking on his face are you all right yeah nathan dragged a hand through his hair ignored the uncomfortably loose sensation in his knees less easily ignored was the acute embarrassment as the woman continued to study him as if he were some alien smear on a microscope slide i didnt know anyone else was around just finishing up my morning run she told him and he noted for the first time that she wore a sweatdampened gray tshirt over snug red bike shorts thats my cottage you were staring at or through oh nathan ordered himself to focus on it again the silvered cedar shakes the sloping brown roof with its jut of open deck for sunning youve got a hell of a view the sunrises are the best yolre sure youre all right she asked again im sorry to poke but when i see a guy standing alone on the beach looking as if hed just been slapped with a twobyfour and talking to himself ive got to wonder its my job she added beach police he said dryly no she smiled held out a friendly hand doctor doctor fitzsimmons kirby i run a clinic out of the cottage nathan delaney medically sound didnt an old woman used to live there a tiny woman with white hair up in a bun my grandmother did you know her youre not a native no no i remember or have this impression of her i spent a summer here as a kid memories keep popping out at me you just walked into one oh the eyes behind the amber lenses lost their clinical shrewdness and warmed that explains it i know just what you mean i spent several summers here growing up and memories wing up at me all the time thats why i decided to relocate here when granny died i always loved it here absently she grabbed her toe bending her leg back heel to butt to stretch out youd be the yankee whos taken little desire cottage for half a year word travels doesnt it just especially when it doesnt have far to go we dont get many single men renting for six months a number of the ladies are intrigued kirby repeated the process on the other leg you know i think i might remember you wasnt it you and your brother who palled around with brian hathaway i remember granny saying how those delaney boys and young brian stuck together like a dirt clod good memory you were here that summer yes it was my first summer on desire i suppose thats whyremember it best have you seen brian yet she asked casually he just fixed me breakfast magic in an egg it was kirbys turn to look past the cottage beyond it i heard jos back im going to try to get up to the house after the clinic closes today she glanced at her watch and since it opens in twenty minutes id better go get cleaned up it was nice seeing you again nathan nice seeing you doc he added as she began to jog toward the dunes with a laugh she turned backward general practice she called out everything from birth to earth come in for what ails you ill keep it in mind he smiled and watched her ponytail swing sassily as she ran through the valley between the dunes nineteen minutes later kirby put on a white lab coat over her levis she considered the coat a kind of costume designed to reassure the reluctant patient that she was indeed a doctor that and the stethoscope tucked in its pocket gave the islanders the visual nudge many of them needed to let granny fitzsimmonss little girl poke into their orifices she stepped into her office formerly her grandmothers well stocked pantry off the kitchen yirby had left one wall of shelves intact to hold books and papers and the clever little combo fax and copy machine that kept her linked with the mainland shed removed the other shelves since she had no plans to follow her grandmothers example and put by everything from stewed tomatoes to watermelon pickles shed muscled the small lovingly polished cherry wood desk into the room herself it had traveled with her from connecticut one of the few pieces shed brought south it was outfitted with a leatherframed blotter and appointment book that had been a parting gift from her baffled parents her father had grown up on desire and considered himself fortunate to have escaped she knew both of her parents had been thrilled when shed decided to follow in her fathers footsteps and go into medicine and they had assumed she would continue to follow into his cardiac surgery specially into his thriving practice and right along to the platinumedged lifestyle both of them so enjoyed instead shed chosen family practice her grandmothers weatherbeaten cottage and the simplicity of island life she couldnt have been happier tidily arranged with the appointment book that bore her initials in gold leaf were a snazzy phone system with intercomin the unlikely event that she should ever need an assistantand a lucite container of wellsharpened ticonderoga pencils iyirby had spent her first few weeks of practice doing little more than sharpening pencils and wearing them down again by doodling on the blotter but shed stuck and gradually shed begun to use those pencils to note down appointments a baby with the croup an old woman with arthritis a child spiking a fever with roseola it had been the very young or the very old whod trusted her first then others had come to have their stitches sewn the aches tended their stomachs soothed now she was doc yirby and the clinic was holding its own kirby scanned her appointment book an annual gyn a followup on a nasty sinus infection the matthews boy had another earache and the simmons baby was due in for his next immunizations well her waiting room wasnt going to be crowded but at least shed keep busy through the morning and who knew she thought with a chuckle there could be a couple of emergencies to liven up the day since ginny pendleton was her gyn at ten oclock yirby calculated she had at least another ten minutes ginny was invariably late for everything pulling the necessary chart she stepped back into the kitchen poured the last of the coffee from the pot shed made early that morning and took it with her to the examining room the room where shed once dreamed away summer nights was now crisp and clean she had posters of wildflowers on the white walls rather than the pictures of nervous systems and ear canals that some doctors decorated with iyirby thought they made patients jumpy after sliding the chart into the holder inside the door she took out one of the backless cotton gownsshe thought paper gowns humiliatingand laid it out on the foot of the examining table she hummed along with the quiet mozart sonata from the stereo shed switched on even those who eschewed classical would invariably relax to it shed found shed arranged everything shed need for the basic yearly exam and had finished off her coffee when she heard the little chime that meant the door at the clinic entrance had opened sorry sorry ginny came in on the run as yirby stepped into the living room that served as the waiting area the phone rang just as i was leaving she was in her middle twenties and kirby was continually telling her that her fondness for the sun was going to haunt her in another ten years her hair was whiteblond shoulderlength frizzed mercilessly and crying out for a root job ginny came from a family of fishermen and though she could pilot a boat like a grinning pirate clean a fish like a surgeon and shuck oysters with dizzying speed and precision she preferred working at the heron campground helping the novice pitch a tent assigning sites keeping the books for her doctors appointment shed spruced herself up with one of her favored western shirts in wildplum purple with white fringe yirby wondered with idle curiosity how many internal organs were gasping for oxygen beneath the girdletight jeans im always late ginny sent her a sunny baffled smile that made yirby laugh and everyone knows it go ahead in and pee in the bottle first you know the routine then go into the exam room take everything off put the gown on opening to the front just give a holler when youre ready okay it was lexy on the stairs she called out as she scurried down the hall in her cowboy boots and shut the door shes feeling restless usually is kirby replied ginny continued chatting as she left the bathroom and turned into the exam room anyway lexys going to come down to the campground tonight about nine oclock there was a thud as the first boot hit the floor number twelve is free its one of my favorites we thought wed build us a nice fire knock off a couple of sixpacks wanna come i appreciate the offer there was another thud ill think about it if i decide to come by ill bring another sixpack i wanted her to ask jo but you know how hurry lex gets hope she will though ginnys voice was breathless leading kirby to imagine she was peeling herself out of the jeans you seen her yet jo no im going to try to catch her sometime today do them good to sit down and he one on together dont know why lexys so pissed off at jo seems to be pissed off at everybody though she went on about gaff too if i had a man who looked like giff eyeing me up one side and down the other the way he does her i wouldnt be pissed off at anything and im not saying that because were cousins fact is if we werent bloodrelated id jump his bones in a new york minute all set in here id give odds gaff will wear her down kirby commented taking out the chart as she came in hes got a stubborn streak as wide as hers lets check your weight any problems ginny nope been feeling fine ginny stepped on the scale and firmly shut her eyes dont tell me what it is chuckling yirby tapped the weight up the line one thirty one thirtyfive whoops she thought one fortytwo have you been exercising regularly ginny eyes still tightly shut ginny shifted from side to side sort of aerobics twenty minutes three times a week and cut back on the candy bars because she was female as well as a doctor yirby obligingly zeroed out the scale before ginny opened her eyes hop up on the table well check your blood pressure i keep meaning to watch that jane fonda tape what do you think about lipo y yirby snugged on the bp cuff i think you should take a brisk walk on the beach a few times a week and imagine carrot sticks are hershey bars for a while youll lose that extra five pounds without the hoover routine bps good when was your last period two weeks ago it was almost a week late though scared the shit out of me youre using your diaphragm right ginny folded her arms over her middle tapped her fingers well most of the time its not always convenient you know neither is pregnancy i always make the guy condomize no exceptions theres a couple of really cute ones camped at number six right now sighing kirby snapped on her gloves casual sex equals dangerous complications yeah but its so damn much fun ginny smiled up at the dreamy monet poster kirby had tacked to the ceiling and i always fall in love with them a little sooner or later im going to come across the big one the right one meantime i might as well sample the field minefield yirby muttered youre selling yourself short i dont know trying to imagine herself walking through those misty flowers in the poster ginny tapped her manyringed fingers on her midriff havent you ever seen a guy and just wanted him so bad everything inside you curled up and shivered yirby thought of brian caught herself before she sighed again yeah i just love when that happens dont you i mean its so primal right i suppose but primal and inconvenience aside i want you using that diaphragm ginny rolled her eyes yes doctor oh hey speaking of men and sex lexy says she got a load of the yankee and he is prime beef i got a load of him myself yirby replied was she right hes very attractive gendy yirby lifted one of ginnys arms over her head and began the breast exam turns out hes an old friend of brisspent a summer here with his parents his father was that photographer who did the picture book on the sea islands way back my mothers still got a copy the photographer of course id forgotten that he took pictures of granny he made a print and matted it sent it to her after he left i still have it in my bedroom magot the book out this morning when i told her its really nice ginny added as yirby helped her sit up theres one of annabelle hathaway and jo gardening at sanctuary ma remembered he took the pictures the summer annabelle ran off so i said maybe she ran off with the photographer but ma said he and his wife and kids were still on the island after she left it was twenty years ago youd think people would forget and leave it alone the pendletons are desire ginny pointed out annabelle was a pendleton and nobody ever forgets anything on the island she was really beautiful she added scooting off the table i dont remember her very well but seeing the picture brought it back some jo would look like that if she put some effort into it i imagine jo prefers to look like jo youre healthy ginny go ahead and get dressed ill meet you outside when youre done thanks oh and kirby try to make it by the campground well make it a real girls night out number twelve well see i at four kirby closed the clinic her only emergency walkin had been a nasty case of sunburn on a vacationer whod fallen asleep on the beach shed spent fifteen minutes after her last patient sprucing up her makeup brushing her hair dabbing on fresh perfume she told herself it was for her own personal pleasure but as she was heading over to sanctuary she knew that was a lie she was hoping she looked fresh enough smelled good enough to make brian hathaway suffer she took the beach door yirby loved that quick shocking thrill of seeing the ocean so near her own home she watched a family of four playing in the shallows and caught the high music of the childrens laughter over the hum of the sea she slipped on her sunglasses and trotted down the steps the narrow boardwalk shed had gaff build led her around the house away from the dunes rising out of the sand was a stand of cypress bent and crippled by the wind that even now blew sand around her ankles bushes of bayberry and beach elder grew in the through she added her own tracks to those that crisscrossed the sand she circled the edges of the dune swale islander enough to know and respect its fragility in moments she had left the hot brilliance of sand and sea for the cool dim cave of the forest she walked quickly not hurrying but simply with her mind set on her destination she was used to the rustles and clicis of the woods the shifts of sound and light so she was baffled when she found herself stopping straining her ears and hearing her own heart beating fast and high in her throat slowly she turned in a circle searching the shadows shed heard something she thought felt something she could feel it now that crawling sensation of being watched hello she hated herself for trembling at the empty echo of her own voice is someone there the rattle of fronds the rustle that could be deer or rabbit and the heavy silence of thickly shaded air idiot she told herself of course there was no one there and if there were what would it matter she turned back continued down the wellknown path and ordered herself to walk at a reasonable pace sweat snaked cold down the center of her back and her breath began to hitch she clamped down on the rising fear and swung around again certain she would catch a flash of movement behind her there was nothing but twining branches and dripping moss damn it she thought and rubbed a hand over her speeding heart someone was there crouched behind a tree snugged into a shadow watching her just kids she assured herself just a couple of sneaky kids playing tricks she walked backward her eyes darting side to side she heard it again just a faint stealthy sound she tried to call out again make some pithy comment on rude children but the terror that had leaped into her throat snapped it closed moving on instinct she turned and increased her pace when the sound came closer she abandoned all pride and broke into a run and the one who watched her snickered helplessly into his hands then blew a kiss at her retreating back her breath heaving yirby pounded through the trees sneakers slapping the path in a wild tattoo she gulped in a sob as she saw the light change brighten then flash as she burst out of the trees she looked back over her shoulder prepared to see some monster leaping out behind her and screamed when she ran into a solid wall of chest and arms banded tight around her whats wrong what happened brian nearly picked her up in his arms but she clamped hers around him and burrowed are you hurt let me see no no im not hurt a minute i need a minute okay all right he gentled his hold and stroked her hair hed been yanking at weeds on the outer edge of the garden when hed heard the sounds of her panicked race through the forest hed just taken the first steps forward to investigate when she shot out of the trees and dead into him now her heart was thudding against his and his own was nearly matching its rhythm shed scared the life out of himthat wildanimal look in her eyes when she jerked her head around as if expecting to be attacked from behind i got spooked she managed and clung like a burr it was just kids im sure it was just kids it felt like i was being stalked hunted it was just kids it spooked me its all right now catch your breath she was so small he thought delicate back tiny waist silky hair hardly aware of it he gathered her closer it was odd that she should fit against him so well and at the same time seem fragile enough for him to pick up and tuck safely in his pocket christ she smelled good he lowered his cheek to the top of her head for a moment indulged in the scent and texture of her hair as he slowly stroked the tension out of her neck i dont know why i panicked that way i never panic and because the sensation was subsiding she became gradually aware that he was holding her very close that his hands were moving over her very smoothly his lips were in her hair very softly her slowing heart rate kicked up again but this time it had nothing to do with panic brian she murmured it ran her hands up his back as she lifted her head youre all right now youre okay and before he knew what he was doing his mouth was on hers it was like a fist in the gut a breathstealing blow that sent his brain reeling and buckled his knees then her lips were parting under his so warm and smooth with sexy little purrs slipping between them and into his mouth he went deeper nipping her tongue then soothing it while his hands slid down over snug denim to mold her bottom and angle heat against heat she stopped thinking the instant his mouth took over hers the novelty of that experience was a separate giddy thrill always shed been able to separate her intellect to somehow step outside herself in a way to direct and control the event but now she was swirled into it lapped by sensation after sensation his mouth was hot and hungry his body hard his hands big and demanding for the first time in her life she truly felt delicate as though she could be snapped in two at his whim for reasons she couldnt understand the sensation was unbearably arousing murmuring his name against his busy mouth she hooked her hands over the back of his shoulders her head tipped back limply for the first time with a man she teetered oil the brink of absolute and unquestioning surrender it was the change the sudden pliancy the helpless little moan that ed him back hed dragged her up to her toes his fingers were digging into her flesh and the single image that had lodged in his mind was that of taking her on the ground in his mothers garden for christs sake in the daylight in the shadow of his own home disgusted with both of them brian jerked her out to arms length thats what you wanted wasnt it he said furiously you went to a lot of trouble to prove im as weak as the next guy colors were still swimming in her head what she blinked to clear her vision what the damselindistress routine worked score one for your side she came back to earth with a thud his eyes were as hard and hot as his mouth had been but with passion of a different sort when his words and the meaning behind them registered her own widened with shocked indignation do you honestly belleve i staged this made a fool of myself just so youd kiss me you arrogant conceited selfimportant son of a bitch insulted to the core she shoved him away i dont have routines and im not now nor will i ever be a damsel of any sort and furthermore kissing you is not a major goal in my life she pushed her tousled hair back squared her shoulders i came here to see jo not you you just happened to be in the way i suppose thats why you jumped into my arms and wrapped yourself around me like a snake she drew a breath determined to cloak herself in calm and dignity the problem here brian is that you wanted to kiss me and you enjoyed it now you have to blame me accuse me of perpetrating some ridiculous female ruse because you want to kiss me again you want to get your hands on me the way you just had them on me and for some reason that really ticks you off but thats your problem i came here to see jo shes not here brian said between his teeth shes out with her cameras somewhere well then you just give her a message for me heron campground nine oclock site twelve girls night out think you can remember that or do you want to write it down ill tell her anything else no not a thing she turned then hesitated pride or no she simply couldnt face going back into the trees alone just yet she shifted directions and headed down the shell path it would more than double the distance home she thought but a good sweaty walk would help her work off her temper brian frowned at her back then into the woods he had a sudden and certain feeling that none of what had just happened had been a pretense and that he decided made him not only a fool but a nasty one hold on kirby ill give you a ride back no thanks damn it i said hold on he caught up with her took her arm and was stunned by the ripe fury on her face when she whirled around ill let you know when i want you to touch me brian and ill let you know when i want anything from you in the meantime she jerked free ill take care of myself im sorry he cursed himself even as he said it he hadnt meant to and the raisedeyebrow wideeyed look she sent him made him wish hed sawed off his tongue first i beg your pardon did you say something too late to back out he thought and swallowed the bitter pill i said im sorry i was out of line let me drive you home she inclined her head regally he thought and her smile was smug thank you id appreciate it you were supposed to bring a sixpack not fancy wine big shot already disposed to complain lexy loaded her sleeping bag and gear into jos land rover i like wing jo kept her voice mild and her sentences short i dont know why you want to spend the night dishing in the woods anyway lexy scowled at jos tidily rolled and topgrade sleeping bag always the best for jo ellen she thought sourly then shoved her two sixpacks of coors into the cargo area no piano bar no room service no fawning maitre d jo thought of the nights shed spent in a tent in secondrate motels shivering in the cab of her fourwheeler anything to get the shot she muscled in the bag of groceries shed begged off of brian shoved her hair back ill survive somehow i set this up you know i set it up because i wanted to get the hell away from here for one night i wanted to relax with friends my friends jo slammed the rear door clenched her teeth as the sound echoed like a gunshot it would be easier to walk away she thought just turn around and go back into the house and leave lexy to find her own way to the campground damned if she was going to take the easy way ginnys my friend too and i havent seen kirby in years leaving it at that she circled around to the drivers side climbed behind the wheel and waited the pleasant anticipation shed felt when brian had relayed kirbys invitation had disappeared leaving a churning pit in her stomach but she was determined to follow through not to be chased away by her sisters bitchiness she was bound to have a miserable time now but by god she was going and so she thought when her sister slammed in beside her was lexy seat belt jo ordered and lexy let out an exasperated huff of breath as she strapped in listen why dont we just get drunk and pretend we can tolerate each other for one night an actress of your astonishing range shouldnt have any trouble with that lexy cocked her head aimed a brilliant smile fuck you sister dear there you go jo started the engine reaching for a cigarette out of habit the minute it turned over would you not smoke in the car jo punched in the lighter my car she headed north her tires singing musically on the shell road the air rushing in the windows was a beautiful balm she used it to soothe her raw nerves and made no complaint when lexy turned the stereo up full blast loud music meant no conversation and no conversation meant no arguments at least for the drive to camp she drove fast the memory of every curve in the road coming back to her that too soothed so little had changed dark still fell quickly here and the night brought the sounds of wind and sea that made the island seem a huge place to her a world where the tides ruled dependably she remembered driving fast along this road with the wind rushing through her hair and the radio screaming lexy had been beside her then too the spring before jo had left the island a soft fragrant spring she would have been eighteen then she remembered and lexy just fifteen theyd been giggling and thered been the best part of a quart of ernest and julio between them to help the mood along cousin kate had been visiting her sister in atlanta so thered been no one to wonder where two teenage girls had gone off to there had been freedom and foolishness and a connection jo thought that theyd lost somewhere along the way the island remained as it was always but those two young girls were gone hows giff jo heard herself ask how should i know jo shrugged even all those years back gaff had had his eye on lexy and even all those years back lexy had known it jo simply wondered if that had stayed constant i havent seen him since ive been back i heard he was doing carpentry and whatnot hes a jerk i dont pay any attention to what hes doing lexy scowled out the window as she remembered the way hed kissed her brainless im not interested in island boys i like men she turned back shot a challenging look men with style and money know any quite a few actually lexy hooked an arm out the window easing into a pose of casual sophistication new yorks bursting with them i like a man who knows his way around our yankee for example jo felt her spine stiffen deliberately relaxed it our yankee nathan delaney he has the look of a man who knows his way around women id say hes exactly my type rich why do you think hes rich he can afford a sixmonth vacation an architect with his own company has to have financial substance hes traveled men whove traveled know how to show a woman interesting pieces of the world hes divorced divorced men appreciate an amiable woman done your research havent you lex sure she stretched luxuriously yes indeedy id say nathan delaney is just my type he should keep me from being bored brainless for the next little while until you can get back to new york jo put in shift hunting grounds exactly interesting jos headlights splashed the discreet sign for heron campground she cut her speed and took the turn off shell road into a land of sloughs and marsh grass i always figured you thought more of yourself than that you have no idea what i think about anything including myself apparently not they fell into a humming silence disturbed only by the shrill peeping of frogs at a sharp cracking sound jo shuddered involuntarily it was the unmistakable sound of a gator crunching a turtle between its jaws she thought she understood exactly what that turtle felt in those last seconds of life the sensation of being helplessly trapped by something large and feral and hungry because her fingers trembled she gripped the wheel tighter she hadnt been consumed she reminded herself shed escaped shed bought some time she was still in control but the anxiety attack was pinching away at her with insistent little fingers she made herself breathe in breathe out slow normal god just be normal she turned the radio off she passed the little checkin booth empty now as the sun had set and concentrated on winding her way through the chain of small lakes lights flickered here and there from campfires ghost music floated out of radios then vanished where the hillocks of grass parted she could see the delicate white glow of lily pads in the moonlight she would walk back she told herself take pictures focus on the silence and the emptiness on being alone on being safe theres kirbys car too much roaring in the ears jo thought and forced out another breath what the snazzy little convertible there thats yirbys just park behind it right jo maneuvered the land rover into position and found when she cut the engine that the air was full of sound the humming and peeping and rustling of the little world hidden behind the dunes and beyond the edge of the forest it was ripe with scent as well water and fish and damp vegetation she climbed out of the car relieved to step into so much life jo ellen kirby dashed out of the dark and grabbed join a hard hug quick spontaneous embraces always caught jo off guard before she could steady herself kirby was pulling back her hands still firm on jos arms her smile huge and delighted im so glad you came im so glad to see you oh we have a million years to catch up on hey lexy lets get your gear and pop a couple of tops she brought mine lexy said pulling open the cargo door great well pop some corks too then weve got a mountain of junk food to go with it well be sick as dogs by midnight chattering all the way yirby dragged jo to the back of the land rover good thing im a doctor whats this she dived into the grocery bag patd you got p atd i nagged brian jo managed to say good thinking yirby hefted the food bag then hooked lexys sixpack ive got these ginnys getting the fire going need a hand with the rest we can get it jo shouldered her camera bag tucked her bedroll under one arm and clinked the bottles of wine together im sorry about your grandmother yirby thanks she lived a long life exactly as she wanted to we should all be that smart here lexy i can get that bag kirby beamed at both of them deciding shed just about cut the edge off the tension that had been snarling in the air when theyd arrived christ im starving i missed dinner lexy slammed the rear door shut lets go then i want a beer shit my flashlights in my back pocket kirby turned angled a hip can you get it she asked jo with a little shifting and some flexible use of fingers jo pried it out and managed to switch it on they headed down the narrow path single file site twelve was already set up and organized a cheerful fire burning bright in a circle of raked sand ginny had her coleman lantern on low and an ice chest filled she sat on it eating from a bag of chips and drinking a beer there she is ginny lifted the beer can in toast hey jo ellen hathaway welcome home jo dumped her bedroll and grinned for the first time she felt home and felt welcome thanks a doctor jo sat crosslegged by the campfire sipping chardonnay from a plastic glass one bottle was already nose down in the sand i cant imagine it when we were kids you always talked about being an archaeologist or something a female indiana jones exploring the world i decided to explore anatomy instead comfortably drunk yirby spread more of brians excellent duck phtd on a ritz cracker and i like it we all know about your work jo but is there someone special in your life yirby asked trying to steer the conversation in jos direction no you ive been working on your brother but he isnt cooperating brian jo choked on her wine sucked in air brian she repeated hes single attractive intelligent kirby licked her thumb he makes great p td why not brian i dont know hes jo gestured widely brian he pretends to ignore her lexy sat up and reached for the phtd herself but he doesnt he doesnt kirby looked over ees narrowed how do you know an actor has to observe people their role playing lexy waved a hand airily you make him nervous which irritates him which means you irritate him because he notices you really though her head was spinning ijrby finished off her wing and poured another glass has he said anything about me does he wait she held up a hand and rolled her eyes this is so high school forget i asked the less brian says about anything the more its on his mind lexy told her he hardly ever mentions your name really yirby said again and began to perk up is that so well well maybe ill give him another chance after all she blinked as a light flashed in her eyes whats that for she demanded as jo lowered her camera you looked so damn smug shift over closer to lex ginny let me get the three of you here she goes lexy muttered but she flipped her hair back and posed nevertheless it was rare for her to take portraits even candid ones jo indulged herself letting them mug or preen for the camera framing them in adjusting the angle letting the burst of light from her strobe flash illuminate them they were beautiful she realized each in her own unique fashion ginny with her bottleblonde frizz and wideopen smile lexy so selfaware and sulky kirby carelessly confident and classy they were hers jo thought each one of them for different reasons was part of her shed forgotten that for too long her vision blurred before she knew her eyes had flooded with tears ive missed you all ive missed you so much she set the camde has iy then rose from her crouch ive got to pee ill go with her yirby murmured as jo rushed out of the clearing she snagged a flashlight and hurried after jo hey she had to double her pace to catch up grab jos arm are you going to tell me whats wrong my bladders full as a doctor you should recognize the symptom when jo started to turn kirby simply tightened her grip honey im asking as your friend and as a doctor granny would have said you look peaked i can tell from this brief session that youre rundown and stressed out wont you tell me whats wrong i dont know jo pressed a hand to her eyes because they wanted to fill up again i cant talk about it i just need some space okay trust always had to be gained by degrees yirby thought will you come and see me let me give you a physical i dont know maybe ill think about it jo steadied herself and managed a smile there is one thing i can tell you what stillve got to pee well why didnt you say so chuckling yirby aimed the light on the path you go running out of camp without a light you could end up gator bait cautious kirby scanned the thick vegetation fringing the near pond i think i could walk this island blind it stays with you i missed it more than i realized yirby but i still feel like a stranger here its a shaky line to walk you havent been home two weeks give yourself that time you said you need im trying me first jo said and ducked into the little outhouse yirby started to laugh then found herself shuddering the minute jo closed the door she felt completely alone completely exposed the sounds of the slough seemed to rush toward her over her rusfles and calls and plops clouds drifted slyly over the moon and had her gripping her flashlight in both hands ridiculous she told herself it was just a leftover reaction to her experience in the woods that afternoon she was hardly along there were campsites pocketed all through the area she could even see the flicker of lights from lanterns and fires and jo was only a single wooden door away there was nothing to be frightened of she reminded herself there was nothing and no one on the island that meant her any harm and she nearly whimpered with relief when jo stepped out again youre up jo told her still buttoning her jeans take the flash i nearly fell in its black as death in there and nearly as atmospheric we could have walked over to the main toilets i wouldnt have needed them by the time i got there good point wait for me okay jo hummed assent and leaned back against the door then almost immediately straightened when she heard footsteps padding softly to her right she tensed told herself that the reaction was a byproduct of city living and watched a light bob closer hello there the male voice was low and pleasant she ordered herself to relax hello well be out of your way in a minute no problem i was just taking a little moonlight walk before i turned in im over at site ten he took a few steps closer but stayed in the shadows beautiful night beautiful spot i never expected to see a beautiful woman you never know what youll see on the island jo squinted as the light from his lantern reflected into her eyes thats part of its charm it certainly is and im enjoying every bit of it an adventure in every step dont you think the anticipation of whats to come im a fan of anticipation no she realized his voice wasnt pleasant it was like syruptoo sweet too thick and it carried that exaggerated drawl that yankees insuitingly believed mimicked the south then im sure you wont be disappointed in what desire has to offer from where im standing the offerings are perfect if shed had the flashlight she would have abandoned manners and shined it in his face it was the voice coming out of the dark she told herself that made it seem so eerie and dangerous when the door creaked beside her she turned quickly and reached for kirbys hand before yirby had stepped all the way out weve got company jo said annoyed that her voice was too high and too bright this is a popular spot tonight number ten was just passing through but when she looked back raising kirbys hand that held the flash there was no one there with a panicked sound in her throat jo grabbed the flashlight and waved it frantically over the dark grass and trees he was here there was someone here i didnt imagine it i didnt all right gently yirby laid a hand on jos shoulder concerned by the trembling its all right who was he i dont know he was just there he talked to me didnt you hear no i didnt hear anything he was almost whispering thats why he didnt want you to hear him but he was there her fingers gripped kirbys like a vise the panic beating like bat wings in her stomach t swear he was right over there i believe you honey why wouldnt i because hes gone and she trailed off rocked herself for a moment to regain her balance i dont know christ im a mess it was dark he startled me i couldnt see his face she blew out a breath dragged her hair back with both hands he creeped me out i guess its no big deal i got spooked in the woods today walking to sanctuary ran like a rabbit jo let out a little laugh scrubbed her clammy palms dry on the thighs of her cans really jumped gibbering into brians arms made him feel big and male enough to kiss me though so it wasnt a complete loss jo sniffled grateful that she could feel her legs solidly under her again so how was it terrific i believe ill definitely give him another chance she gave jos hand a squeeze okay now yeah sorry no problem spooky place her grin flashed lets sneak back and scare the hell out of lex and ginny as they started off hands linked he watched them from the shadows he smiled to himself enjoing the music of quiet female voices yi drifting away it was best he realized that she had come with the other one he might have felt compelled to move to the next stage if jo ellen had wandered so neatly into him alone and he wasnt ready not nearly ready to move from anticipation to reality there was still so much to prepare so much to enjoy but oh how he wanted her to taste that sexy topheavy mouth to spread those long thighs to close his hands around that pretty white throat he closed his eyes and let the image of it roll through his brain the frozen image of annabelle so still and so perfect shifted into hot life and became his became jo a portion of the journal he carried with him played through his head murderfascinates us all some would deny it but they are liars man is helplessly drawn to the death of his own mortality animals kill to surviveforfood for territory for sex nature kills without emotion but man also kills for pleasure it has always been so we alone among the animals know that the taking of a life is the essence of control and power soon she experience the perfection of that and capture it my own immortality he shuddered in pleasure anticipation he mused as he turned on his light again to guide his way yes he was a huge fan of anticipation he cheerful whistling woke nathan as he drifted n that netherworld just under frill consciousness he dreamed of a bird chirping happily on the near branch of the maple tree outside his window there had been one in his youth a mocking bird that sang its morning song every day for a full summer greeting him so reliably that he had named it bud hazy hot days filled with the important business of bike riding and ball playing and popslcle licking the insistent wakeup call caused nathan to greet every morning with a grin and a quick salute to bud hed been devastated when bud deserted him in late august but nathans mother said that bud had probably gone off early for his winter vacation nathan rolled over and thought how odd it was that bud should know how to whistle ring of fire in the half dream the bird hopped onto the windowsill a cartoon bird now a disney character with sleek black feathers and johnny cashs weathered beentheredonethat face when the bird began executing some sharp choreography that included high kicks and fancy spins nathan jerked himself awake he stared at the window half expecting to see a richly animated cartoon extravaganza jesus he ran his hands over his face no more canned chili at midnight delaney he rolled over facedown on the pillow then he realized that while the bird wasnt there the whistling was grunting he crawled out of bed and stepped into the cutoffs hed stepped out of the night before brain bleary he blinked at the clock winced then stumbled out of the room to find out who the hell was so cheerful at sixfifteen he followed the whistlingit was san antonio rose nowout the screened porch down the steps a shiny red pickup was parked behind his jeep in the short drive its owner was under the house standing on a stepladder and doing something to the ductwork while whistling his heart out the ropy muscles rippling outside and under the thin blue tshirt had nathan readjusting his thoughts of quick murder maybe he could take whistling boy he considered they looked to be close to the same height he couldnt see the face but the gimme cap the snug jeans and scruffy work boots said youth to nathan hed think about killing him after coffee he decided what the hell are you doing whistling boy turned his head shot a quick cheerful grin from under the bill of his cap morning you got some leaks here gotta get it up and running right before ac weather hits youre airconditioning repair hell im everything repair he stepped off the ladder swiping a hand clean on the seat of his jeans before holding it out to nathan im giff verdon i fix anything nathan studied the friendly brown eyes the crooked incisor dimples the shaggy mess of sunstreaked hair spilling out of the cap and gave up you fix coffee decent coffee you got the makings i can fix it they got some sort of cone thing with a nathan illustrated vaguely with his hands pot drip coffee thats the best you look like you could use some mr delaney nathan ill give you a hundred dollars for a real pot of coffee giff gave a chuckling laugh slapped nathan smartly on the back you need it that bad its free lets go fix you up you always start work at dawn nathan asked as he shuffled up the steps behind giff get an early start you enjoy more of the day he headed directly to the stove filled the kettle at the sink got any filters no well well juryrig her then gaff tore off some paper towels folded them cleverly and slipped them into the plastic cone youre an architect right yeah nathan ran his tongue over his teeth thought fleetingly about brushing them after coffee worlds could be conquered oceans could be crossed women could be seduced after coffee life would be worth living again after coffee i used to think id be one to think youd be one what nathan prompted as giff dug into the cabinet over the stove for coffee a architect i could always see these places in my head houses mostly windows rooflines shades of brick and siding right down to the fancy work giff scooped coffee out of the can and into the cone w th the careless precision of habit i cou i even walk myself inside go through the layout sometimes id shift things around that stairway doesnt belong over there its better over here i know what you mean well i could never afford the schooling or the time to go off and study so i build instead in anticipation nate got out two mugs youre a builder well now i dont know if id say that nothing that fancy really i do addons fix things up he patted the tool belt cocked with gunslinger swagger on his hip swing a hammer always something needs to be done around here so i keep busy maybe one of these days ill take one of the houses in my head and build it from the ground up nathan leaned back against the counter and tried not to drool as giff poured boiling water into the cone have you done any work at sanctuary sure this and that i worked on the crew that remodeled the kitchen for brian over there miz pendletons got in her mind to add on a little bathhouse a solarium like something where she can put a jacuzzi tub and maybe an exercise room people look for that kind of thing now when theyre on vacation im putting together a design for her the south side nathan said to himself the light would be right and it could be worked right into the gardens yep just what i was figuring gaffs smile widened i guess im on the right track there if you thought the same id like to see your drawings for it yeah surprise and pleasure zipped through him great ill bring them by sometime when i got them a little more complete better payment than a hundred bucks for the coffee drip takes time he added noting the way nathan was eyeing the slowly filling pot the best things do when nathan was in the shower sipping his second cup while hot water pounded the back of his neck he had to agree that gaff was right some things were worth the wait his mind was clear again his system all but singing with caffeine by the time he was dressed and had downed cup number three he was rimed for the hike to sanctuary p and set for an enormous breakfast both the pickup and giff were gone when nathan walked down the steps again off to fix up something else nathan decided he knew giff had been amused when hed asked him to write down the instructions for brewing drip coffee step by step but nathan dealt better with a clear outline he caught himself whistling i walk the ling back to johnny cash he thought with a shake of his head and he didnt even like country music when he stepped into the forest dim and green he deliberately slowed his steps and followed the gentle bend of the river under the arching sway of limbs and moss because it always struck him as entering a church he stopped whistling a flutter of color caught his eye and he stopped to watch a sunny yellow butterfly flit along the path to the left the lances of palmettos tangled vines and twisted trunks formed a wall that reached up and up giving him glimpses of scarlet from the flowering vine snatches of vivid blue sky through the forks of branches though it was a detour he kept to the river path a bit longer knowing that the water would widen and lead him deeper into the cool stillness then he saw her crouched beside a fallen log her baggy jacket was pushed up past her elbows her hair was pulled back into a stubby tail she had one knee on the damp ground the other foot planted for balance he couldnt have said why he found that so attractive why he found her so interesting but he stayed where he was and remained silent watching jo set up her shot he thought he knew what she was after the play of light on the water the shadows of trees on the dark surface the faint breath of mist just fading a small intimate miracle and the way the river curved just beyond nathan thought the way it disappeared around that bend where the grass was high and wet and the trees thick made one wonder what could be seen if you only walked on when he saw the doe step out to the left he stepped forward quietly and crouched behind her she jolted when he laid a hand on her shoulder so he squeezed ssh to the left he murmured near her ear ten oclock though her heart had icaped and pounded jo shifted the camera when she focused on the doe she took a steadying breath and waited she caught the doe head lifted scenting the air then again her shutter clicked as the deer scanned the river and looked across directly at the two humans crouched and still her artns began to ache as seconds passed into minutes but she didnt move unwilling to risk losing a shot the reward came when the doe picked her way gracefullly through the grass and the yearling slipped out of the trees and joined her at the verge to drink light slanted down in dreamy white shafts that slid like liquid through the faint swimming mist and the deers tongues sent ripples spreading soft and slow over the dark water she would underexpose just a bit she thought to accent that otherworldly aura rather than go for the crisp clarity of reality the prints should look enchanted with the faintest of fairytale blurs she didnt lower her camera until shed run out of film and even then she remained silent watching while the deer meandered downriver and around the bend thanks i might have missed them no i dont think so she turned her head had to will herself not to jerk back she hadnt realized he was quite that close or that his hand still made warm connection with her shoulder you move quietly nathan i never heard you you were pretty absorbed did you get the shot you were working on before the deer well see ive been taking some shots myself old hobby natural that it would be itd be in your blood he didnt care for the sound of that and shook his head no i dont have a passion for it just an amateurs interest and a lot of equipment she never knew whether it was easier to speak of such losses or say nothing so she said nothing in any case he continued ive got all the professional equipment now and a very minor skill he smiled at her not like yours how do you know i have any skill when you havent seen my work excellent question i could say the opinion comes from watching you work just now you have the patience the silent grace the stillness stillness is an attractive quality maybe but ive been still long enough she started to rise but he shifted his hand from her shoulder to her elbow and drew her up with him i dont want to keep you from your walk jo ellen you keep brushing me off im going to get a complex she looked more rested he thought there was a little color in her cheeksbut that could have been brought on by annoyance he sanded and lifted the singlelens reflex camera that hung around her neck ive got this model do you remembering his upbringing she stopped herself from tugging the camera away from him as i said it would be hard for you not to have some interest in photography was your father disappointed that you didnt follow in his fsteps no nathan continued to study the nikon remembering his father patiently instructing him on aperture field of vision my parents never wanted me to be anything but what i wanted to be anyway kyle made his living with a camera oh i didnt realize kyle was dead too she remembered abruptly and without thinking touched a hand to nathans look if its a tender spot theres no need to poke at it you cant ignore it either nathan shrugged his shoulders kyle based himself in europemilan paris london he did a lot of fashion photography its an art of its own sure and you take pictures of rivers among other things id like to see why weve just established that its an interest of mine he released her camera im going to spend more time on it while im here and id like to see your work like you said its connected to my father it was the right tack to take he could almost see her mind change from automatic refusal to agreement i brought some with me you could take a look sometime i suppose good how about now i was heading over to sanctuary anynvay all right but i dont have a lot of time im still on housekeeping duty she started to bend to pick up her camera bag but he beat her to it ive got it jo walked with him dug her cigarettes out of her jacket pocket this isnt another comeon is it it would be if id thought of it ive still got that steak waiting its going to get freezer burn she exhaled studied him through narrowed eyes why did your wife leave you what makes you think she left me okaywhy did you leave her we left each other he brushed some lowhanging moss out of their way marriage canceled through lack of interest are you trying to gauge what kind of husband i was before you let me grill you a piece of meat no but the annoyance in his tone made her lips twitch but i would have if id thought of it why dont we leave that topic and ill ask you how youve enjoyed your first week on desire he stopped turned looked at her isnt this just about where you fell into the water that summer she lifted a brow no actually it was quite a bit farther downriver that you pushed me into the water and if youve got a notion to repeat yourself id think again you know one of the reasons im here is to revisit some of those days and nights he took a step forward she took a step back are you sure it wasnt here that you went in yes im sure he backed her up another step she slapped a hand on his chest but found herself maneuvered nearer the bank just im sure im not going in again dont be too sure as her feet skidded on the wet grass he hauled her back and against him oops and grinning locked his arms comfortably around her waist not much to you is there she gripped his arms firmly just in case theres enough i guess ill have to take your word for that and anticipate finding out for myself anticipations half the fun what she felt her blood drain down to the soles of her feet im a fan of anticipation what did you say that id take your word for it hey he shifted his weight pulled her closer as she struggled against him watch out or were both going to be taking a morning dip he managed to pull her back from the edge her face had gone sheetwhite and tremors jerked from her so that her skin seemed to bump against his palms steady he murmured and gathered her against him i didnt mean to scare you no the fear had come and gone rapidly and left her feeling like a fool because her heart was still thumping she let herself be heldwondered how long it had been since anyone had put arms around her and let her rest there no it was nothing stupid there was a guy at the campground a couple of nights ago he said something similar he scared me im sorry she let out a long sigh not your fault really my nerves are a little close to the surface these days he didnt hurt you no no tie never touched me it was just creepy she left her head against his shoulder started to close her eyes it would have been so easy to stay there being held being safe but easy wasnt always the right way or the smart way im not going to sleep with you nathan he waited a moment letting himself enjoy the feel of her snug against him the texture of her hair against his cheek well then i may as well drown myself in the river right now youve just shattered my lifelong dream he made her want to laugh and she squelched down the bubble in her throat im trying to be up front with you why dont you lie to me for a while instead soothe my ego he gave her ponytail a little tug and she lifted her head in fact why dont we start with something simple and work our way up to complications she watched his gaze dip down to her mouth linger then slide slowly back up to her eyes she could almost taste the kiss feel the hum of it on her lips it would be simple to close her eyes and let his mouth close over hers it would be easy to lean forward and meet him halfivay instead she lifted a hand pressed her fingers to his mouth dont he sighed took her wrist and skimmed his lips over her knuckles jo you sure know how to make a man work for his pleasures im not going to be one of your pleasures you already are he kept her hand in his and turned to walk to sanctuary dont ask me why since he didnt seem to expect her to comment on that or to make small talk jo walked in silence she was going to have to think about this situation she decided she wasnt foolish enough to deny that shed had a reaction to him that physical gutlevel click any woman recognized as basic lust it was normal enough to be almost soothing she might be losing her mind but her body was still functioning on all the elemental circuits she hadnt felt the click often enough in her life to take it for granted and when it was so obviously echoed in the man who caused it that was something to think about for now at least this was something she could control something she could understand analyze and list clear choices about but she suspected that the trouble with clicks was that they caused itches and the trouble with itches was that they nagged until she just gave the hell up and scratched well have to make this quick she told nathan and headed toward the side door i know youre on bedmaking detail i wont keep you long im planning on sniffing around brian until he feeds me if youre not busy you might talk him into getting out afterward going to the beach doing some fishing he spends too much time here he loves it here i know she turned into a long hallway where a mural of forest and river flowed over the wall that doesnt mean he has to serve sanctuary every hour of every day she pressed a hinge and a section of the mural opened thats an odd way to put it nathan commented following her through the opening and up the stairs into what had once been the servants quarters and was now the private entrance to the family wing serving sanctuary its what he does i suppose its what all of us do when were here she turned left at the top of the stairs as she passed the first open door she glanced into lexys room the huge old canopy bed was empty unmade naturally clothes were scattered everywhereon the aubusson carpet the polished floor the dainty queen antic chairs the scents of lotions and perfumes and powders hung on the air in female celebration well maybe not all of us jo muttered and kept walking taking a key out of her pocket she unlocked a narrow door nathans brows lifted in surprise when he walked in it was a fully equipped and ruthlessly organized darkroom an ancient and threadbare rug protected the randomwidthpine floor thick shades were drawn down and snugly fastened to stay that way over twin windows shelves of practical gray metal were lined with bottles of chemicals plastic tubs on others were boxes of thick black cardboard which he assumed held her paper contact sheets and prints there was a long wooden worktable a high stool i didnt realize you had a darkroom here it used to be a bath and dressing room jo hit the white light then moved around the prints shed developed the night before that were still hanging on the drying ie i hounded cousin icate until she let me take out the wall and the fixtures and turn it into my darkroom id been saving for three years so i could buy the equipment she ran a hand over the enlarger remembering how carefully shed priced them counted her pennies kate bought this for me for my sixteenth birthday brian gave me the shelves and the workbench lex got me paper and developing fluid they surprised me with them before i could spend my savings it was the best birthday ive ever had family comes through nathan said and noted she hadnt mentioned her father yes sometimes they do she inclined her head at his unspoken question he gave me the room after all it wasnt easy for my father to give up a wall she turned away to reach up for a box above her matting machine im compiling prints for a book im contracted for these are probably the best of the lot though i still have some culling to do youre doing a book thats great that remains to be seen right now its just something to be worried about she stepped back as he walked up to the box then tucked her thumbs in her back pockets it took only the first print for him to see that she was well beyond competent his father had been competent nathan mused at times inspired but if she considered herself david delaneys pupil she had far outreached her mentor the blackandwhite print shimmered with drama the lines so clean so crisp they might have been carved with a scalpel it was a study of a bridge soaring over churning waterthe white bridge empty the dark water restless and the sun just breaking the far horizon another showed a single tree branches wide and spreading and empty of leaves over a deserted freshly plowed field he could have counted the furrows he went through them slowly saying nothing struck time after time at what she could see and freeze and take away with her he came to a night shot a brick building windows dark but for the top three which glowed startlingly bright he could see the dampness on the brick the faint mist swirling above black puddles and could all but feel the chilly moist air on his skin theyre wonderful you know that youd have to be ridiculously neurotic and humble not to know how much talent you have i wouldnt say im humble she smiled a little neurotic probably art demands neuroses i wouldnt say neurotic curious he lowered the last print so that he could study her face but lonely why are you so lonely i dont know what youre talking about my work is brilliant he interrupted and heartbreaking in every one of these its as if someones just walked away and theres no one there but you uneasy she took the print from him put it back in the box im not terribly interested in portrait photography its not what i dojo he touched his fingertips to her cheek saw by the flicker in her eye that the simple gesture had startled her you close people out it makes your work visually stunning and emotional but what does it do to the rest of your life my work is the rest of my life with a sharp slap she set the box back on the shelf now as i said ive got afiall morning i wont take up much more of it but he turned idly and began to examine the prints on the drying line when he laughed jo hunched her shoulders and prepared to snarl for someone who claims to have no interest in portrait photography you sure hit it dead on scowling she walked over and saw that hed homed in on one of the shots shed taken at the campground thats hardly work its terrific he finished fun even intimate thats the doc with her arm slung around your sister whos the woman with the acre of smile ginny pendicton jo muttered trying not to be amused ginnys smile was just that an acre wide fertile and full of promise shes a fried theyre all friends it showsthe affection and that female connection and it shows that the photographers connected not in the picture maybe but of it jo shifted uncomfortably we were drunk or getting there good for you this is undoubtedly wrong for the theme of the book youre doing now but you ought to keep it in mind if you do another never hurts to mix a little fun in with your angst you just like looking at attractive halfplowed females why not he tipped a hand under her chin lifting it higher when she would have jerked away id love to see what you do with a selfportrait the next time youre feeling that loose his eyes were warm and friendly so damned attractive in the way they looked direct and deep into hers she felt that little click again sharper this time go away nathan okay before either of them could think about it he dipped his head and touched his lips lightly to hers then touched them there again a little longer a little more firmly warmer than hed expected he thought and more arousing as shed kept her eyes open and unblinking on his throughout you shivered he said quietly no i didnt he skimmed his thumb over her jawline before he dropped his hands well one of us did and she was mortally afraid she would do so again youre not going away i guess notat least not the way you mean he pressed his lips to her forehead this time she didnt shiver but her heart lurched no definitely not the way you mean when he left her she turned to the window hurriedly unfastening the shade to throw it up and the window behind it she wanted air air to cool her blood and clear her mind even as she gulped it in she saw the figure standing near the edge of the dune swale with the wind breezing through his hair fluttering his shirt alone as her father was always alone with every person who would reach out closed off behind that thin invisible wall of his own making with a vicious pull she slammed the window shut again shot the shade down damn it she wasnt her father she wasnt her mother she was herself and maybe that was why there were times when she felt as if she was no one at all iffwas whistling again nathan tried to identify the tune as he tackled his french toast at the breakfast counter but this one eluded him he could only assume gaff had wandered too deep into countrywestern territory for nathans limited education to follow the man was certainly a cheerful worker nathan mused and apparently he could fix anything nathan was certain it had taken absolute faith for brian to ask gaff to take apart the restaurants dishwasher in the middle of the breakfast shift now brian was frying and grilling and stirring giff was whistling and tinkering with dishwasher guts and nathan was downing a second helping of golden french toast and apple chutney he couldnt remember when hed ever enjoyed a meal more hows it coming gifp brian stepped around giff to set a completed order under the warmer fair to middlin you dont get that thing up and running by end of shift nate heres going to be washing those dishes by hand i am nathan swallowed the next bite i only used one house rules you eat in the kitchen you pick up the slack right giff yep dont think its going to come to that though ill get her he glanced over as lexy swung through the door yep he said with a grin ill get her in my own time she spared him a sidelong flick of lashes annoyed that he managed to look so cute in a silly baseball cap and grubby tshirt two more specials one with ham one with bacon two eggs over light bacon side of grits wheat toast giff keep your big feet out of the way she complained stepping around them to pick up her orders under the warmer gaffs grin was already spreading wide as she swung out the door again that sister of yours is the prettiest damn thing bri so you say giff brian cracked two eggs slid them into a skillet shes crazy about me i could tell the way she bubbled over when she saw you was embarrassing giff snorted tapped the handle of his screwdriver against his palm thats just her way she wants a man sniffing after her like a puppy gets her nose up in the air when you dont shell come around you just got to understand how a particular female works is all who the hell understands how any females work brian gestured with his spatula at nathan do you understand nate nathan contemplated the next bite of french toast watched the syrup drip lazily no he decided no i cant say that i do and ive done considerable studying on the subject you could even say ive dedicated a small portion of my life to it with mixed results its not a matter of how they all work patiently giff began replacing screws you gotta focus in on the one its like an engine one dont necessarily run the same as another even if theyre the same make and model theyve just got their particular quirks now alexa he trailed off carefully sending another screw home selecting the next shes almost too pretty for her own good she thinks about that a lot worries over it shes got enough glop on her bathroom counter to paint up a vegas chorus line brian put in some women feel thats a responsibility now lex she gets ticked off if a mans not dazzled by her twentyfour hours a day and if he is dazzled twentyfour hours a day she figures hes an idiot cause hes not seeing anything but the surface the trick is to find the line then choose the right time and place to cross it brian flipped eggs onto a plate it was lexy to a tee he mused contrary and annoying seems like too much work to me hell bri women arent anything but work gaff flicked up the brim of his hat dimples flashing thats part of the appeal shell run for you now he added nodding at the dishwasher gauging the time he calculated that lexy would be coming back in for her orders any moment ginny and me and some of the others are thinking of having a bonfire on the beach tonight he said casually down around by osprey dunes i got a lot of scrap wood put by and its going to be a clear night when lexy pushed through the door gaff was a satisfied man i thought you might want to tell your guests here let the cottagers and campers know inow what lex demanded about the bonfire tonight her eyes lit as she set dishes on the counter where down around osprey gaff carefully replaced his tools in his dented metal box youll come on down wont you brian i dont know giff ive got some paperwork to catch up on oh come on bri lexy nudged him as she reached for the new orders dont be such a stick well all come hoping to irritate giff she flashed an inviting smile at nathan youll come down wont you theres nothing like a bonfire on the beach wouldnt miss it he slid a cautious glance at giff hoping the man had put his hammer away terrific she beamed at him as she walked by the fullcandlepower smile she saved for special occasions ill start spreading the word giff scratched his chin as he unfolded himself and rose no need to look so uneasy nate flirting comes naturally to lexy ulihuh nathan eyed the toolbox thought of all the potential weapons inside doesnt bother me any at home gaff took a biscuit out of a bowl and bit in man decides to take on a beautiful woman hes got to expect a little flirting on her side a lot of looking from other men so you go right on and look gaff hefted his toolbox and winked now you do more than look wed have to go around some see you tonight he went off whistling you know bri nathan picked up his plate to carry it to the sink that guy has biceps like rock i dont believe im even going to look good thinking now you can pay for that breakfast by loading the dishwasher i i dont feel like socializing kate im going to do some darkroom work tonight youre not doing any kind of work kate marched over to jos dresser picked up the simple woodenhandled hairbrush and shook it at her youre going to put on some lipstick fix your hair and go down to that bonfire youre going to dance in the sand drink some wine and by god youre going to have a good time before jo could protest again kate held up a hand trafficcop style save your breath girl ive already had this round with brian and won you might as well just throw in the towel now when she tossed the hairbrush jo caught it before it beaned her i dont see why it matters it matters kate said between her teeth and wrenched open the door on the rosewood armoire it matters that people in this house learn how to have a little tin now and then when im through with you im going to go browbeat your father jo snorted flopped back on the bed not a chance hell go kate said grimly as she studied what there was of jos wardrobe if i have to knock him unconscious and drag him down to the beach dont you have a blouse in here that looks remotely like you care what you have on your back disgusted she shoved aside hangers something the least bit stylish or attractive without waiting for an answer she went to the door calling out alexa you pick out a blouse for your sister and bring it down here i dont want one of her shirts alarmed now jo hopped up if i have to go ill go in my own clothes and im not going so it doesnt matter youre going put some curl in your hair im tired of seeing it just hang there i dont have anything to put curt in it with if i wanted curl in it which i dont hah was kates only response alexa you bring that blouse and your hot rollers down here to your sisters room you stay out of here lex jo shouted kate im not sixteen years old no youre not kate gave a decisive nod the little gold drops in her ears bobbing at the movement youre a grown woman and a lovely one its long past time you took some pride in it now youre going and youre going to put some effort into your appearance and i wont take any sass about it damn kids fighting me every which way she muttered and swung into jos bathroom not even a wand of mascara in here you want to be a nun enter a convent lipstick is not a tool of satan with a blolisc slung over her shoulder and a ease of hot rollers in her hand lexy came in her mood was up in anticipation of the night ahead so she grinned and wiggled her eyebrows at jo on one of her rampages bigtime one i dont want my hair curled oh loosen up jo ellen lexy dumped the rollers on the dresser then checked out her own appearance in the mirror shed kept the makeup subtle to suit the casual event in any case firelight was terrifically flattering most would be wearing jeans she knew so her long flowing skirt covered with red poppies would make an interesting contrast and im not wearing your clothes suit yourself lexy turned pursed her lips and gave her sister the onceover she was feeling just good enough to be companionable hmm frills arent your style now theres news just let me note that down lexy let the sarcasm roll off her perfumed shoulders and walked a slow circle around her sister got a plain black tshirt that isnt so baggy two of you could slide into it wary jo nodded probably black jeans at jos assenting shrug lexy tapped her finger to her rps thats the way well go then sleek and hip maybe some dangles at the ears and a good belt to accessorize but thats all no curls either no curls nope but you need a new do lexy continued to tap her finger her eyes narrowing her head nodding i can fix that a little snip here a little snip there snip jo put both hands to her hair in defense what do you mean snip im not letting you cut my hair what do you care its just hanging there anyway exactly kate breezed back in lexys got a nice touch with hair she trims mine up if i cant get over to the mainland go wash it jo lexy go get your scissors fine defeated jo threw up her hands just fine if she scalps me i wont have to go sit on the sand with a bunch of fools half the night listening to somebody sing icum ba yah fifteen minutes later she found herself sitting with a towel bibbed around her and bits of hair falling jesus jo squeezed her eyes tight i have lost my mind its now official stop squirming lexy ordered but there was a laugh in the order rather than a sting ive barely done anything yet and think how long this is going to keep cousin kate off your back yeah jo forced her shoulders to relax yeah there is that youve got great hair jo good body a nice natural wave she pouted a little studying her own wildly spiraling mane in the mirror dont know why i have to pay such money for curl myself my hairs straight as a pin with a shrug for lifes vagaries she concentrated again on the job at hand a decent cuts all you need what im doing is giving you one that you wont have to do a thing with i already dont do a thing and it tooks it this wont just dont cut off too jos eyes went huge her throat closed as she watched three inches of hair flop into her lap christ oh christ what have you done relax im giving you bangs thats all bangs bangs i didnt ask for bangs well youre getting them a nice fringe to the eyebrow your eyes are your best feature this will highlight them and its a nice casual look that suits you she continued to comb and snip stood back scowled and snipped some more i like it yes i like it good for you jo muttered you wear it youre going to owe me an apology lexy squirted some gel in her palm rubbed her hands together then slicked them through jos damp hair you only need a little of this about the size of a dime jo scowled at the tube i dont use hair gunk youre going to just a little she repeated then switched on her blowdryer you can airdry it too but thisll give it a little more volume wont take you more than ten minutes in the morning to fuss with it doesnt take me more than two now whats the damn point jo told herself she didnt care about the cut she was tired of sitting there being fussed with that was all she wasnt nervous fine lexy switched off the dryer tugged out the plug all you do is bitch and find fault go ahead and look like a hag i dont give a shit she stormed out leaving jo to tug the towel aside badtemperedly but when she caught her reflection in the mirror she stopped stepped closer it looked nice she decided and lifted a hand to brush the tips instead of hanging it skimmed she supposed angled over the cars graduated toward the back it was sort of breezyshe decided the bangs werent such a bad touch after all experimentally she shook her head everything fell back into place more or less nothing drooped into her eyes to irritate her she picked up her brush ran it through and watched her hair rise and fall in nice neat blunt ends tidy she mused fussfree but with well style she had to admit it had style and the style flattered the memory snuck through of sitting on the edge of her bed while her mother brushed her hair youve got beautiful hair jo ellen so thick and soft itsgoing to be your crowningglory its the same color as yours mama i know and annabelle laugbed and bugged her close youll be my little twin i cant be your twin mama jo whispered now i cant be like you wasnt that why shed never done anything more with her hair than scrape it back into an elastic band wasnt that why there was no tube of mascara in the bathroom was it stubbornness jo wondered or was it fear that kept her from spending more than five minutes a day on her appearance from really looking at herselp if she was going to keep herself sane jo thought she was going to have to learn how to face what she saw in the mirror every day and facing it she realized she would have to learn to accept it taking a bracing brcatli she left her room and walked down to lexys she found lexy in the bathroom choosing a lipstick from among the clutter of cosmetics on the counter im sorry when lexy said nothing jo took the last step forward lexy i am sorry you were absolutely right i was being bitchy i was finding fault lexy stared down at the little gold tube watched the slick red stick slide up and down why im scared of what everything it was a relief to admit it finally everything scares me these days even a new haircut she managed to work up a smile even a terrific new haircut lexy relented enough to smile back when their eyes met in the mirror it is pretty terrific it would look better if you had some color fixed up your eyes jo sighed looked down at the personal department store of cosmetics why not can i use some of this stuff anything there would work were the same coloring lexy turned back to the mirror carefully painted her lips jo are you scared of being alone no i do along really well jo picked up blusher sniffed at it thats about all that doesnt scare me funny thats about the only thing that does scare me i the fire speared up rose out of white sand and toward a black diamondstudded sky like some druid ritual fire nathan thought as he sipped an icy beer and watched the flames he could imagine robed figures dancing around it offering sacrifices to some primitive and hungry god and where the hell had that come from he wondered and took another swig to wash the image away the night was cool the fire hot and the beach so often deserted was filled with people and sound and music he just wasnt quite ready to be part of it he watched the mating dances the ebb and flow of male and female as basic as the tide and he thought of the photos jo had shown him that morning those frozen slices of lonely maybe it had taken that he realized to make him see how lonely hed become hey handsome ginny plopped down on the sand beside him whatcha doing over here all by yourself searching for the meaning of life she hooted cheerfully well thats easy its living it she offered him a hot dog fresh out of the fire and burned to a crisp eat up nathan took a bte tasted charcoal and sand yum she laughed squeezed his knee companionably well outdoor cookings not my strong point but i whip up a hell of a southernstyle breakfast if you ever find yourself in my neighborhood as a comeon it was both obvious and easy there was her acre of smile slightly off center now from the tequila shed been drinking he couldnt help but smile back at her thats a very attractive offer well sugar its one every single woman on the island between sixteen and sixty would dearly love to make you i just figure im getting to the head of the line not entirely sure how he was supposed to respond now nathan scratched his chin im really fond of breakfast but now dont you fret over it this time she squeezed his arm as if testing and approving the biceps you know what youve got to do nathan whats that youve got to dance do you sure do she hopped up shot down a hand with me come on big guy lets kick up some sand he put a hand in hers found it so warm and alive it was easy to grin all right ginnys got herself a yankee gaff commented watching ginny pull nathan toward the damp sand looks like yirby licked marshmallow off her thumb she sure knows how to have a good time it isnt so hard with a beer dangling between his fingers gaff scanned the beach some people were dancing or swaying others were sprawled around the blazing fire still others strolled off into the dark to be alone yids whooped and hollered and the old sat in beach chairs exchanging gossip and watching the youth not everybody wants to have a good time yirby glanced toward the dunes again but saw no one coming over them from the direction of sanctuary you know you got your eye cocked for brian and ive got mine cocked for lexy gaff threw a friendly arm around her shoulder why dont we go dance well keep our eyes cocked together thats a fine idea brian came over the dunes lexy on one side jo on the other he paused at the top took a long slow survey and this my children all this will one day be yours oh bri lexy elbowed him dont be such a grump she spotted gaff immediately and felt little toothy nips of jealousy as she saw him slide yirby into his arms for a slow dance ive got a hankering for some crab she said lightly and started down toward the beach we could probably escape now jo began kates still dragging daddy down we could head north circle around and be back home before she gets here shed only make us pay for it later resigned he jammed his hands in his back pockets why do you suppose were so bad at social occasions jo ellen too much hathaway she began not enough pendleton he finished guess lexy got our share of that he added nodding down to where their sister was already in the thick of things surrounded by people lets get it over with theyd barely reached the beach before ginny raced over and greeted them both with loud kisses what took yall so long im half lit already nate lets get these people some beer so they can catch up she whirled away to do so ran into someone and giggled well hey morris you wanna dance with me come on nathan blew out a breath i dont know where she gets the energy she damn near wore me out want that beer ill get it brian told him and walked off i like your hair nathan lifted a finger to brush under jos bangs very nice lexy whacked at it thats all you look lovely he skimmed his hand over her shoulder down her arm until it captured her own hand is that a problem for you no i dont start on me nathan too late he moved in a little closer i already have her scent was warm lightly spicy intriguing youre wearing perfume lexy i like it he leaned in stunning her by sniffing her hair her neck la lot she was having trouble drawing a full breath and annoyed she took a step back thats not why i wore it i like it anyway you want to dance no good neither do i lets go sit by the fire and neck it was so absurd she nearly laughed lets just go sit by the fire if you try anything ill have my daddy go get his gun and dispatch you and you being a yankee no one will turn a hair he laughed and slipped an arm around her waist ignoring what hed come to realize was her instinctive jolt at being touched well just sit then he got her a beer poked a stick through a hot dog for her then settled down beside her i see you brought your camera automatically she laid a hand on the scarred leather bag at her hip habit ill wait a while before i take it out sometimes a camera puts people offbut after theyve had enough beer they dont mind so much i thought you didnt take portraits as a rule i dont conversation always made her feel pressured she dipped into her pocket for a cigarette you dont have to prime inanimate objects with flattery or liquor to get a shot ve only had one beer he took the lighter from her cupped a hand around it to shield it from the wind off the ocean and lit her cigarette his eyes met hers over the flame and you havent exactly primed me with flattery but you can take my picture anyway she considered him through the smoke strong bones strong eyes strong mouth maybe she took the lighter back and tucked it in her pocket what would she see through the lens she wondered what would what she saw pull out of her maybe i will how uncomfortable will it make you if i tell you ive been waiting here for you her gaze shifted to his again then away very very uncomfortable then i wont mention it he said lightly or bring up the point that i watched you stand up there between the dunes and i thought there she is what took her so long jo anchored the stick between her knees to free up a hand for her beer and the hand was damp with nerves i wasnt that long the fire hasnt been going more than an hour i dont mean just tonight and i dont suppose i should mention how incredibly attracted i am to you i dont think so well talk about something else altogether he smiled at her delighted with the baffled look in her eyes the faint frown on that lovely topheavy mouth lots of faces to study around here you could do another book just on that the faces of desire he shifted slightly so that their knees bumped jo stared at him amazed at the smoothness of his moves certainly thats what they were just moves any man who could get a womans heart tripping in her chest with no more than a few careless words and a grin must have a trunkful of moves i havent finished the book im contracted for much less thought about another but you will eventually youve got too much talent and ambition not to but for now why dont you just satisfy my curiosity and tell me about some of these people who are you curious about all of them any of them jo turned the dog tist over the flames watched the fat rise and bubble thats mr brodiethe old man there with the white cap and the baby on his lap that would be his greatgrandchild his fourth if im counting right his parents were house servants at sanctuary around the turn of the century he was born on desire raised here and grew up in the house hed have spent a lot of time in it but his family was given a cottage of their own and some land for their long and loyal service he fought in world war two as a gunner and brought his wife back from paris her name was marie louise and she lived here with him till she died three years back they had four children ten grandchildren and now four greats he always carries peppermint drops in his pocket she turned her head is that what you mean thats just what i mean he wondered if she knew how her voice had warmed as she slipped into the story pick another she sighed finding it a little foolish but at least it wasnt making her nervous theres lida verdon cousin of mine on the pendleton side shes the tired pregnant woman scolding the toddler thisll be her third baby in four years and her husband wallys handsome as six devils and just no damn good hes a truck driver goes off on long runs makes a decent living but lida doesnt see much of it a child ran by screaming with pleasure chased by an indulgent daddy jo crushed her cigarette out in the sand buried it when wallys home she continued hes mostly drunk or working on it shes kicked him out twice now and taken him back twice and shes got one baby on leading strings and another under her apron as proof of the reconciliations were the same age lida and i born just a couple of months apart i took the pictures at her wedding she looks so pretty and so happy and young in them now four years later shes just about worn out its not all fairy tales on desire she said quietly no he slipped his arm around her its not all fairy tales any where tell me about ginny ginny with a quick laugh jo scanned the beach you dont have to tell anything about ginny you just have to look at her see the way shes making brian laugh he hardly ever laughs like that she just brings it out of you you grew up with her yeah almost like sisters though shes closest with lexy ginny was always the first of us to try anything especially if it was bad but there was never any harm in it or in her its just a matter of ginny liking everything and a lot of it anduhoh i bet she helped stir that up he was too busy looking at jo to notice everything about her had brightened relaxed what see there jo leaned back against his arm and gestured toward the edge of the water lex and gaff are tangling theyve been blowing hot and cold on each other since they were in diapers ginnys mighty fond of both of them and probably did something to have them blowing hot tonight she wants them to fight no you pinhead laughing jo lifted the sizzling hot dog from the fire anchored the stick in the sand she wants them to make up nathan considered then lifted his brows as gaff scooped lexy up hefted her rhett butlerstyle in his arms and strodewith her kicking and cursingdown the beach if thats how it works im going to have to talk to ginny about stirring things up for me im a much harder sell than my sister jo said dryly maybe nathan plucked the hot dog off the stick and tossed it from hand to hand to cool it but ive already got you cooking for me i despite the struggling woman in his arms gaff kept his pace steady until the bonfire was a flicker in the distance satisfied that they were as private as they were going to get he set her on her feet who the hell do you think you are she shoved him hard with both hands same person ive always been he said evenly its time you took a good look ive looked at you before and i dont see anybody whos got a right to haul me off when i dont want to go no matter how exciting it had been she told herself no matter how romantic i was having a conversation no you werent you were coming on to that guy to piss me off this time it worked i was being polite and friendly to a man ginny introduced me to an attractive man from charleston a lawyer whos spending a few days on the island camping with some friends a charleston lawyer who was just about to drool on your shoulder giffs normally mild eyes spit fire youve had time to sow your oats lexy and i gave you plenty of space to sow them in now youre back and its time to grow up grow up she planted her hands on her hips ignoring the water that foamed up the sand inches from her feet ive been grown and youre just one of the many who hasnt had the sense to see it i do what i want when i want and with whom i want she turned on her heel and began to stalk off her nose in the air giff rubbed his chin and told himself he shouldnt have lost his temper even if lexy had been sliding herself around some charleston lawyer but the damage was done he moved fast by the time she heard him coming and turned she had time only to squeal before he tackled her why you fleabrained idiot youll ruin my skirt furious now she used elbows knees teeth rolling with him while the surf lapped up and soaked them both i hate you i hate every inch of you gaff verdon no you dont lexy you love me hah you can kiss my ass ill be glad to honey he pinned her arms levered himself up to grin down at her but i believe ill work my way down to it he lowered his head and when she turned hers aside brushed his lips over the soft skin just below her ear this is a fine place to start shudders coursed through her liquid and hot i hate you i said i hate you i know what you said he nibbled slowly down to her throat thrilled with the way her body went lax beneath him kiss me lexy come on and kiss me on a sob she turned her head found his mouth with hers hold me touch me oh i hate you for making me want you i know the feeling he stroked her hair her checks while she trembled and strained beneath him dont fret so id never hurt you desperate she gripped his hair dragged him down harder inside me i need you inside me im so empty she arched up groaning he closed a hand over her breast filled his palm with her then giving in to his hunger tugged the scooped neck of her blouse down so he could take her into his mouth the taste of her hot damp pungent pumped through his blood like whiskey he wanted it to be slow and sweet had waited all his life just for that but she was moving restlessly beneath him her hands tugging pulling reaching when he closed his mouth over hers again he couldnt think could barely breathe it was all taste and sound he was panting as he fought with her wet skirt yanking at the thin clinging material until his hand could skim up her thigh until he found her already wet she jerked against his hand and climaxed before he could do more than moan jesus jesus lexy now giff ill kill you if you stop i swear ill kill you you wont have to he managed ill already be dead get these goddamn clothes off he tugged at her skirt with one hand his jeans with the other for gods sake lexy help me im trying she was laughing now trapped in a dripping skirt still flying on the fast hard orgasm her blood singing so high she could barely hear the sea i feel drunk i feel wonderful oh hurry hell with it he tossed his jeans aside dragged off his shirt and pulled her into the water skirt and all what are you doing this is brandnew ill buy you a new one ill buy you a dozen only for gods sake let me have you he dragged the skirt down by the elastic waist and was inside her almost before she could kick her way clear she cried out in shock in delight she wrapped her legs around him dug her fingers into his shoulders and watched his face dark eyes never leaving hers seeing only her when the wave swamped her outside and in she burrowed against him and knew he would always bring her back i love you he murmured it to her as his body raced toward the edge i love you lexy he let himself go shuddering with her until they both went limp then he gathered her close and let the waves rock them it had been perfect he thought free and simple and right just as hed always known it would be hey out there he glanced over lazily spotted the figure on the shore waving both arms then he snorted pressed his lips to lexys hair hey ginny i see some clothes thrown around here look familiar yall naked out there appear to be he grinned as he felt lexy chuckle against him ginny he drowned my skirt about time too she blew them elaborate kisses im walking a while gotta clear my head some lexy miz kate got your daddy to drop in down at the bonfire id make sure i had something covering my butt before i went back weaving more than a little and chuckling herself ginny headed down the beach it made her heart happy to see the two of them together like that why poor old giff had been pining away for her for years and lexy well shed just been chasing her own tail waiting for gaff to catch hold of her she had to stop a moment waiting for her spinning head to settle back on her shoulders shoulda skipped the tequila shooters she told herself but then life was too short to go skipping things one day she was going to find the right man to catch hold of her too and until then she was going to have a high old time looking for him as if shed conjured him a man walked across the sand toward her ginny cocked a hip aimed a grin well hey there handsome whatcha doing out here by yourself looking for you beautiful she shook her hair back aint that a coincidence not really i prefer to think of it as fate he held out a hand and thinking it was her lucky night she took it just drunk enough to make it easy he thought as he led her farther into the dark and sober enough to make it fun for the first time in weeks jo woke rested and with an appetite she felt settled she realized and very nearly happy kate had been right jo decided as she gave her hair a quick fingercomb shed needed the evening out the companionship the music the night and a few hours in the company of a man who apparently found her attractive hadnt hurt a thing in fact jo was beginning to think it wouldnt hurt a thing to spend a bit more time in nathans company she passed her darkroom on the way downstairs and for once didnt think of the envelope filled with pictures that shed hidden deep in a file drawer for once she didnt think of annabelle instead she thought of wandering down to the river again and the possibility of bumping into nathan accidentally casually she was getting as bad as ginny she decided with a laugh plotting ways to make a man notice her but if it worked for ginny maybe it would work for her what was wrong with a little flirtation with a man who interested her excited her there now she paused on the stairs curious enough to take stock it wasnt so hard to admit that he excited herthe attention paid the breezy way he would take her hand the deliberate way his eyes would meet and hold hers the coot and confident way hed kissed her just moved in she recalled sampled approved and backed off as if hed known there would be ample opportunity for more at a time and place of his choosing it should have infuriated her she mused the cocky and blatantly male arrogance of it and yet she found it appealed to her on the most primitive of levels she wondered how she would play the game and if she would show any skill at it she smiled continued downstairs she had a feeling she might just surprise nathan delaney and herself id go sam but i have quite a few turnovers here this morning kate glanced over as jo stepped into the kitchen raking a hand through her hair she sent jo a distracted smile morning honey youre up early sos everyone it seems jo glanced at her father as she headed to the coffeepot he stood by the door all but leaning out of it the desire to escape was obvious problem jo asked lightly just a little one weve got some campers coming in on the morning ferry and some going out on the return i just got a call from a family whos packed up and ready to go and theres no one to check them out ginnys not at the station she doesnt answer there or at home i imagine she overslept kate smiled wanly somewhere im sure the bonfire went on quite late it was still going strong when i left about midnight jo sipped her coffee frowning as she tried to remember if shed seen ginny around before she headed back home girl got a decent nights sleep in her own bed sam added she wouldnt have any trouble getting herself to work sam you know very well this isnt like ginny shes as dependable as the sunrise with a worried frown kate glanced at the clock maybe she isnt feeling well hung over you mean as some human beings are occasionally in their lives kate snapped back and thats neither here nor there the point is we have people waiting to check out of camp and others coming in i cant leave here this morning and even if i could i dont know anything about pitching tents or portsjohns youll just have to give up a couple of hours of your valuable time and handle it sam blinked at her it was a rare thing for her voice to take on that scathing tone with him and it seemed hed been hearing it quite a bit lately because he wanted peace more than anything else he shrugged ill head over jo will go with you kate said abruptly which caused them both to stare you might need a hand she spoke quickly now her mind made up if she could force them into each others company for a morning maybe the two of them would hold an actual conversation jo you can walk over from the campground and check on ginny maybe her phones just out or shes really not feeling well ill worry about her until we get in touch jo shifted the camera on her shoulder watched her tentative morning plans evaporate sure fine let me know when you get it straightened out kate shooed them to the door and out and dont worry about housekeeping detail lexy and i will manage well enough because their backs were turned kate smiled broadly brushed her hands together there she thought deal with each other jo climbed in the passenger seat of her fathers aged blazer snapped her seat belt on it smelled of him she realized sand and sea and forest the engine turned over smoothly and purred hed never let anything that belonged to him suffer from neglect she mused except his children annoyed with herself she pulled her sunglasses out of the breast pocket of her camp shirt slid them on nice bonfire last night she began have to see if that boy policed the beach area that boy would be giff jo noted and was aware they both knew giff wouldnt have left a single food wrapper to mar the sand the inns doing well lots of business for this time of year advertising sam said shortly kate does it jo struggled against heaving a sigh id think word of mouth would be strong as well and the restaurants quite a draw with brians cooking sam only grunted never in his life would he understand how a man could want to tie himself to a stove not that he understood his daughters any better than he understood his son one of them flitting off to new york wanting to get famous washing her hair on tv commercials and the other flitting everywhere and back again snapping photographs there were times he thought the biggest puzzle in the world was how they had come from him but then theyd come from annabelle as well jo jerked a shoulder and gave up rolling down her window she let the air caress her cheeks listened to the sound of the tires crunching on the road then the quick splashing through the maze of duckweed that was life in the slough wait without thinking she reached out to touch sams arm men he braked she hopped out quickly leaving him frowning after her there on a hummock a turtle sunned himself his head raised so that the pretty pattern on his neck reflected almost perfectly in the dark water he paid no attention to her as she crouched to set her shot then there was a rustic and the turtles head recoiled with a snap jos breath caught as a heron rose up like a ghost an effortless vertical soar of white then the wings spread stirring wind it flew over the chain of small lakes and tiny islands and dipped beyond into the trees i used to wonder what it would be like to do that to fly up into the sky like magic with only the sound of wing against air i recollect you always liked the birds best sam said from behind her didnt know you were thinking about flying off though jo smiled a little i used to imagine it mama told me the story of the swan princess the beautiful young girl turned into a swan by a witch i always thought that was the best she had a lot of stories ye s jo turned studied her fathers face did it still hurt him she wondered to remember his wife would it hurt less if she could tell him she believed annabelle was dead i wish i could remember all of them she murmured and she wished she could remember her mother clearly enough to know what to do she took a breath to brace herself daddy did she ever let you know where shed gone or why she left no the warmth that had come into his eyes as he watched the herons flight with jo iced over she didnt need to she wasnt here and she left because she wanted to wed best be going and getting this done he turned and walked back to the blazer they drove the rest of the way in silence i jo had done some duty at the campground during her youth learning the family business kate had called it the procedure had changed little over the years the large map tacked to the wall inside the little station detailed the campsites the paths the toilet facilities blueheaded pins were stuck in the sites that were already occupied red was for reserved sites and green was for those where campers had checked out green sites needed to be checked the area policed the restroom and shower facilities were also policed twice dally scrubbed out the supplies renewed since it was unlikely that ginny had done her duty there since before the bonfire jo resigned herself to janitorial work ill deal with the bathrooms she told sam as he carefully filled out the paperwork needed to check a group of impatient campers out then ill walk over to ginnys cabin and see whats up go to her cabin first sam said without looking up the facilities are her job all right shouldnt take more than an hour ill meet you back here she took the path heading east if shed been a heron she thought with a little smile shed have been knocking on ginnys door in a blink but the way the path wound and twisted sliding between ponds and around the high duck grass it was a good quarter mile hike she passed a site with a neat little popup camper obviously no early risers there she mused the flaps were zipped tight a pair of raccoons waddled across the path eyed her shrewdly then continued on toward breakfast ginnys cabin was a tiny box of cedar tucked into the trees it was livened up with two big brightred pots filled with wildly colored plastic flowers they stood by the door guarded by an old and weathered pair of pink flamingos ginny was fond of saying she dearly loved flowers and pets but the plastic sort suited her best jo knocked once waited a beat then let herself in the single main room was hardly thirty square feet with the kitchen area separated from the living area by a narrow service bar the lack of space hadnt kept ginny from collecting knickknacks crowded every flat surface water globes souvenir ashtrays china ladies in frilly dresses crystal poodles the walls were painted bright pink and covered with really bad printsstill lifes for the most part of flowers and fruit jo was both touched and amused to see one of her own blackandwhite photos crammed in with them it was a silly shot of ginny sleeping in the rope hammock at sanctuary taken when they were teenagers jo smiled over it as she turned toward the bedroom ginny if youre not along in there cover up im coming in but the bedroom was empty the bed was unmade and it as well as a good deal of the floor was covered with clothes from the looks of it jo decided ginny had had a hard time picking out the right outfit for the bonfire she looked in the bathroom just to be sure the cabin was empty the plastic shelf over the tiny pedestal sink was crammed with cosmetics the bowl of the sink was still dusted with face powder three bottles of shampoo stood on the lip of the tub one of them still uncapped a doll smiled from the top of the toilet tank her pink and white crocheted gown spread full over an extra roll of toilet paper it was so ginny whose bed are you sleeping in this morning ginny jo murmured and with a little sigh left the cabin and prepared to scrub public rest rooms when she reached the facilities jo took keys out of her back pocket and opened the small storage area inside cicaning paraphernalia and bathroom supplies were ruthlessly organized it was always a surprise to realize how disciplined ginny could be about her work when the rest of her life appeared to be an unpredictable and often messy lark armed with mop and bucket commercial cleaners rags and rubber gloves jo went into the womens shower a woman of about fifty was busily brushing her teeth at one of the sinks jo sent her an absentminded smile and began to fill her bucket the woman rinsed spat wheres ginny this morning oh jo blinked her eyes against the strong fumes of the cleaner as it bubbled up apparently among the missing overpartied the woman said with a friendly laugh it was a great bonfire my husband and i enjoyed itso much that were getting a very late start this morning thats what vacations are for enjoyment and late starts its hard to convince him of the second part the woman took a small tube out of her travel kit and squirting moisturizing lotion on her fingers began to slather it on dicks a real bear about time schedules were nearly an hour late for our morning hike the islands not going anywhere tell that to dick she laughed again then greeted a young woman and a girl of about three who came in morning meg and hows pretty lisa today the little girl raced over and began to chatter jo used the voices for background music as she went about her chores the older woman was joan and it seemed she and dick had the campsite adjoining the one meg and her husband mick had claimed theyd formed that oddly intimate vacationers friendship over the past two days they made a date to have a fish fry that night then meg slipped into one of the shower stalls with her little girl jo listened to the water drum and the childs voice echo as she mopped up the floor this was what ginny liked she realized collecting these small pieces of other peoples lives but she was able to join in with them be a part of them people remembered her they took snapshots with her in them and slipped them into their family vacation albums they called her by name and repeaters always asked after ginny because she didnt hide from things jo thought leaning on her mop she didnt let herself fade into the background she was just like her brightly colored plastic flowers cheerful and bold maybe it was time she herself took a few steps forward jo thought out of the background into the light she gathered her supplies and walked out of the ladies section rounding the building to the door of the mens facilities she used the side of her fist to knock giving the wooden door three hard beats waited a few seconds and repeated wincing a little she eased the door open and shouted cleaning crew anyone inside years before when shed been helping ginny jo had walked in on an elderly man in a skimpy towel whod left his hearing aid back at his campsite she didnt want to repeat the experience she heard nothing from insideno sound of water running urinals whooshing but she made as much noise as possible herself as she clamored in as a final precaution she propped the door open and hung the large plastic keeping your rest rooms clean sign in plain sight satisfied she hauled her bucket to the sinks and dumped in cleaner twenty minutes thirty tops and shed be done she told herself to get through it she began to plan the rest of her day she thought she might drive up to the north shore there were ruins there from an old spanish mission built in the sixteenth century and abandoned in the seventeenth the spaniards hadnt had much luck converting the transient indians to christianity and the settlement that historians suspected had been planned had never come to pass it was a nice day for a drive to the north tip the light would be excellent by midmorning for photographing the ruins and the terraces of shells accumulated and left by the indians she wondered if nathan would like to go along with her wouldnt an architect be interested in the ruins of an old spanish mission she could ask brian to put together a picnic lunch and they could spend a few hours with the ghosts of spanish monks and who was she fooling jo demanded she didnt give a hang about the monks or the ruins it was the picnic she wanted the afternoon with no responsibility no agenda no deadline it was nathan she wanted she straightened and pressed a hand to her stomach as it fluttered hard and fast she wanted the time alone with him perhaps to test them both to see what would happen if she found the courage to just let herself go to be with him to be jo and why not she thought she would call his cottage when she got back home shed make it very casual impromptu unplanned and whatever happened happened when the lights switched off she yelped splashed water all over her feet she spun around leading with her mop like a lance and heard the echo of the heavy door closing hello the sound of her own voice too thin and too shaky made her shiver whos there she demanded and in the dim light filtering through the single high and frosted window she edged toward the door it resisted her first shove panic reared up too and snapped at her throat she shoved again then pounded then she whirled heart booming in her cars she was certain that someone had slipped in and stood behind her she saw nothingjust empty stalls the dull gleam of the wet floor heard nothing but her own racing breath still she leaned against the door terrified to turn her back on the room and her eyes wheeled left and right searching for movement in the shadows sweat began to run down her back icy panic sweat she couldnt draw enough air no matter how fast and hard she tried to gulp it in part of her mind held firm lecturing her you know the signs jo ellen dont let it win dont let go if you break down youll be back in the hospital again just get a grip get a grip she pressed a hand to her mouth to hold back the screams but they came through in whimpers she could feel herself begin to crack terror pushing viciously against will until she simply turned her face to the door slapping it weakly with her palm please please let me out dont leave me in here alone she heard the sound of feet crunching on the path opened her mouth to shout then the fear grew monstrous shoved her stumbling back her eyes were wide and fixed on the door her pulse pounding painfully against her skin there was a scrape and an oath her vision spun grayed then went blind as the door swung open and brilliant sunlight poured in she saw the silhouette of a man as her knees buckled she fumbled for the mop again jabbing it out like a sword dont come near me jo ellen what the hells going on daddy the mop clattered to the floor she nearly followed it but his hands cau lit her arms drew her up what happened here i couldnt get out i couldnt hes watching i couldnt get away at the moment all sam knew was that she was pale as death and shaking so hard he could almost hear her bones rattle moving on instinct he picked her up and carried her out into the sun its all right now youre all right pudding it was an old endearment both of them had forgotten jo pressed her face to his shoulder holding tight when he sat on a stone bench with her cradled on his lap she was so small still sam thought with surprise how could that be when she always looked so tall and competent whenever shed had nightmares as a child shed curled up in his lap just this way he remembered shed always wanted him when her dreams were bad dont be afraid nothing to be afraid of now i couldnt get out i know somebodyd braced some wood against the door kids thats all playing pranks y ids she shuddered it out clung to it as she did to him yids playing pranks yes they turned the lights off shut me in i panicked she kept her eyes closed a moment longer trained her breathing back to level i didnt even have the sense to turn them back on i just couldnt think you had a scare didnt used to scare so easy no she opened her eyes now i didnt time was youd have busted down that door and torn the hide off whoever was fooling with you it nearly made her smile his memory image of her would i always had a mean streak because shed stopped trembling and she was a grown woman and no longer the child hed once comforted he patted her shoulder awkwardly guess you softened up some more than some i dont know i thought you were going to run that mop handle clean through me for a minute whod you mean was watching you what you said he was watching you whod you mean the photographs she thought her own face annabelles jo shook her head quickly and shifted away not now was all she could think not yet i was just babbling scared stupid im sorry no need to be girl youre white as a sheet yet well get you home i left all the stuff inside ill tend to it you just sit here until you get your legs back under you i think i will but when he started to rise she reached for his hand daddy thanks for chasing the monsters away he looked at their sined hands hers was slim and whiteher mothers hand he thought with unbearable sadness but he looked at her face and saw his daughter i used to be pretty good at it i guess you were great at it you still are because his hand suddenly felt clumsy he let hers go and stepped back ill put the things away then well head home you probably just need some breakfast no jo thought as she watched him walk away she needed her fa their and until that moment she hadnt had a clue just how much wasnt in a culinary mood any longer even the thought of food curdled in her stomach she would go out alone she decided over to the salt marsh or down to the beach if shed had the energy she would have raced down and tried to catch the morning ferry back to the mainland she could have lost herself in the crowds in savannah for a few hours she washed her face with icy water pulled a fielders cap over her hair but this time when she passed the darkroom she was compelled to go in to open the file drawer dig out the envelope her hands trembled a little as she spread the pictures out on her workbench but the photograph of annabelle hadnt magically reappeared there was just jo shot after shot and eyes those artfully cropped studies of her eyes or annabelles eyes how could she be sure there had been a photograph of her mother there had been a death photo she couldnt have imagined it no one could imagine such a thing it would make her insane it would mean she was delusional and she wasnt couldnt be shed seen it goddamn it it had been there with a snap of will she forced herself to stop to close her eyes to count her breaths slowly in and out in and out until her heart stopped dancing in her chest she remembered too clearly that sensation of cracking apart of losing herself she would not let it happen again the photo wasnt there that was fact it had existed that was fact too so someone had taken it maybe bobby had realized it upset her and gotten rid of it or someone else had broken into her apartment while she was in the hospital and taken it away whoever had sent it had come back and taken it away briskly jo stuffed the photos back in the manila envelope she didnt care how crazy that sounded she was holding on to that idea someone was playing a cruel joke and by obsessing over it she was letting them win she stuffed the envelope back in the file drawer closed it with a slam and walked away but she could confirm or eliminate one possibility with a single phone call hurrying back to her room she pulled her address book out of the desk and thumbed through quickly she would ask that was all she told herself as she dialed the number of the apartment bobby banes shared with a couple of college friends she could keep it casual and just ask if hed taken the print her nerves were straining by the third ring hello bobby no this is jack but im available darling this is jo ellen hathaway she said crisply id like to speak to bobby oh there was the sound of a throat clearing sorry miss hathaway i thought it was one of bobbys ah well hes not here would you ask him to get in touch with me ill give you a number where i can be reached sure but i dont know when hell be back exactly or exactly where he is either he took off right after finals photo safari he was really hot to put together some new prints before next semester ill leave you the number in any case she said and recited it if he checks in pass that along will you sure miss hathaway i know hed like to hear from you hes been worried about i mean wondering hes been wondering about continuing his internship with you in the fall urn hows it going there was no doubt in her mind that bobbys roommate knew about her breakdown shed hoped but hadnt expected otherwise its going fine thanks her voice was cool cutting off the possibility of deeper probing if you hear from bobby tell him its important that i speak with him ill do that miss hathaway ah goodbye jack she hung up slowly closed her eyes it didnt matter that bobby had shared her problem with his friends she couldnt let it matter couldnt let herself be embarrassed it was too much to expect him to have kept it to him or upset over it self when his trainer went crazy on him one morning and was carted off to the hospital her pride would just have to stand it she decided shaking off the clinging shame she headed downstairs with any luck bobby would call within the next couple of weeks then shed have at least one answer when she reached the kitchen door she heard voices inside and paused with her hand on the panel somethings wrong with her brian shes not herself has she talked to you kate jo never talks to anyone why would she talk to me youre her brother youre her family jo heard the clatter of dishes caught the lingering odor of grilled meat from the breakfast shift a cupboard door opening shutting what difference does that make brians voice was testy impatient jo could almost see him trying to shrug kate off it should make all the difference brian if youd just try she might open up to you im worried about her look she seemed fine to me last night at the bonfire she hung out with nathan for a couple of hours had a beer a hot dog and she came back from the campground this morning pale as a sheet shes been up and down like that ever since she got back and coming back the way she did out of the blue she wont talk about whats going on in her life when shes going back you cant tell me you havent noticed how shaky she is jo didnt want to hear any more she backed away quickly turned on her heel and hurried to the front of the house now they were watching her she thought wearily wondering if she was going to snap if she told them about her breakdown she imagined there would be sympatheticand knowingnods and murmurs the hell with it she stepped outside into the sunlight took a long gulp of air she could handle it would handle it and if she couldnt find peace here just be left alone to find it she would leave again and go where despair washed over her where did you go when youd left the last place her energy drained bit by bit her feet dragged as she descended the stairs she was too damn tired to go anywhere she admitted she walked to the rope hammock slung in the shade of two live oaks and crawled into it like climbing into a womb jo thought as the sides hugged her and let her sway sometimes on hot afternoons she had found her mother there and had slipped into the hammock with her annabelle would tell stories in a lazy voice she would smell soft and sunny and they would rock and rock and look up through the green leaves to the pieces of sky the trees were taller now she mused they had had more than twenty years to growand so had she but where was annabelle i he strode along the waterfront in savannah ignoring the pretty shops and busy tourists it had not been perfect it had not been nearly perfect the woman had been wrong of course hed known that even when hed taken her hed known it ha i been exciting but only momentarily a flash then over like coming too soon he stood staring at the river and calmed himself a little game of mental manipulation that slowed his pulse rate steadied his breathing relaxed his muscles hed studied such mindoverbody games in his travels soon he began to let the sounds in againpiece by piece the jingle of a passing bicycle the drone of tires on pavement the voices of shoppers the quick laugh of a child enjoying an ice cream treat he was calm again in control again and smiled out over the water he made an attractive picture and he knew ithis hair blowing lightly in the breeze a man handsome of face and fit of body who enjoyed catching the female eye oh hed certainly caught ginnys shed been so willing to walk with him on the dark beach and over the dunes tipsily flirting with him the southern in her voice slurred with tequila shed never known what hit her literally he had to bite back a chuckle thinking of that one short swift blow to the back of the head and shed toppled it had been nothing to carry her into the trees hed been so high on anticipation shed seemed weightless undressing her had been stimulating true her body had been lusher than hed wanted but shed only been practice still hed been in too much of a hurry he could admit that now he could analyze now hed rushed through it had fumbled a bit with the equipment because hed been so anxious to get those first shots her naked with hands bound above her head and secured to a sturdy sapling he hadnt taken the time to fan her hair out just so to perfect the lighting and angles no hed been too overwhelmed with the power of the moment and had raped her the instant she regained consciousness hed meant to talk to her first to capture the fear growing in her eyes as she began to understand what he meant to do the way it had been with annabelle she struggled tried to speak her lovely long legs worked drawtng up pumping her back arched now ifelt that calm cold control snick into place she was subject i as artist the way it had been with annabelle he thought again the way it should have been now this time but the first orgasm had been a disappointment so ordinary he thought now he hadnt even wanted to rape her again it had been more of a chore than a pleasure he remembered nothing more than an additional step to manipulate the final shot but when hed taken the silk scarf out of his pocket slipped it around her neck tightened it tightened it watched her eyes go huge her mouth work for air for a scream that had been considerably better the orgasm then had been beautifully brutally hard and long and satisfying and he thought the last shot of her that decisive moment might be one of his finest hed title it death of a tramp for really what else had she been hardly one of the angels shed been cheap and ordinary he decided nothing but a throwaway that was why it hadnt been even close to perfect it hadnt been his fault but hers it brightened his mood considerably now that it had come clear she had been flawedthe subject not the artist yet he had picked her hed chosen her hed taken her he had to remind himself again that she had simply been practice the entire incldent had been no more than a runthrough with a standin it would be perfect next time with jo with a little sigh he patted the leather briefcase that held the photographs hed developed in his rented rooms nearby it was time to head back to desire i since lexy was nowhere to be found again brian headed out to the garden to attack more ecceds lexy had promised to do it but he was more than certain shed run off to hunt up gaff and seduce him into a lunchtime roll hed seen the two of them the night before from his bedroom window soaking wet sandy and giggling like children as they came up the path it had been obvious even to his tired brain that theyd been doing more than taking a midnight swim hed been amused even a little envious it seemed so easy for them just to take each other as they were to live in the moment though he imagined that gaff had in mind a great deal more than the moment and that lexy would do a quick tap dance on his heart on her way still gaff was a clever and a patient man and he might have lexy dancing to his tune before he was done brian thought it would be interesting to watch from a safe distance that was really all he wanted brian mused a safe distance he glanced down at the columbine its lavender and yellow trumpets open and celebrational it was pretty it was cheerful and it was up to him to keep it that way he reached into the pocket of the short canvas apron hed slung around his waist for the cultivator and heard the whimper he looked over saw the woman in the hammock and his heart skipped her hair was darkly red in the green shade her hand falling limply over the side slim and pale and elegant shock had him taking a step forward then she turned her head restless and he backed off not his mother for christs sake his sister it was staggering how much she looked like annabelle at times at the right angle with the night light it made it difficult to let go of the memories and the pain his mother had loved to swing in the hammock for an hour on a summer afternoon and if brian came across her there he would sometimes sit crosslegged on the ground beside her she would lay a hand on his head ruffle his hair and ask him what adventures hed had that day and she would always listen or so hed once thought more likely shed been daydreaming while he chattered dreaming of her lover of her escape from husband and children of the freedom she must have wanted more than she wanted him but it was jo who slept in the hammock now and from the looks of her she wasnt sleeping peacefully a part of hima part he viewed with disdain and something close to hatewanted to turn around walk away and leave her to her own demons but he went to her his brow furrowing in concern as she twitched and moaned in her sleep jo he laid a hand on her shoulder and shook it come on honey snap out of it in the dream whatever it was pursuing her through the forest with its ghost trees and wild wind reached out and dug its sharp nails into her flesh dont she swung out ripping herself away dont touch me easy hed felt the mind of her fist brush his face and wasnt sure whether to be concerned or impressed i could do without the broken nose her breath ragged she stared blindly at him brian the damn shudders won so she flopped back down and closed her eyes sorry bad dream so i gathered it was concern after all and more than hed expected kate was right as usual something was very definitely wrong here he took a chance and eased himself down on the edge of the hammock you want something water no the surprise showed in her eyes when she opened them and looked down at the hand hed laid over hers she couldnt remember the last time hed taken her hand or she his no im fine just a dream you used to have bad ones as a kid too wake up hollering for daddy yeah she managed a weak smile you dont grow out of everything i guess still get them a lot he tried to make it sound casual but he saw the flicker in her eyes i dont wake up hollering for anyone anymore she said stiffly no i dont suppose you would he wanted to get up move away hadnt her problems stopped being his years ago but he stayed where he was rocking the hammock gently its not a flaw to be selfsufficient brian no and its not a sin to want to handle problems on your own is that what youre doing jo handling problems well rest easy ive got enough of my own without taking on yours but still he didnt leave and they rocked together quietly in the green shade the comfort of it made her eyes sting cautious and needy she took a tentative step ive been thinking a lot about mama lately his shoulders tensed why ive been seeing her in my mind the photograph that isnt there dreaming about her i think shes dead the tears had slipped out without either of them realizing it when he glanced back saw them sliding down her cheeks his stomach clutched whats the point of this jo ellen whats the point in making yourself sick over something that happened twenty years ago and cant be changed i cant stop iti cant explain it its just there she left us we lived through it thats just there too but what if she didnt leave what if someone took her what if what if she was abducted by aliens he said shortly for christs sake the cops kept the case open more than a year there was nothing no evidence shed been kidnapped no evidence of foul play she left thats that stop driving yourself crazy she shut her eyes again maybe that was what she was doing slowly driving herself toward insanity is it better to think that every time she told us she loved us it was a lie is that more stable brian its better to leave it alone and be alone she murmured every last one of us because someone else might say they love us and that might be a lie too better to leave it along better not to take the chance better to be alone than left alone it hit close enough to home to make him bristle youre the one with the nightmares jo not me he made his decision quickly and rose before he could change his mind come on come on where were going for a drive lets go he took her hand again hauled her to her feet and began to pull her with him to his car where what just do what youre told for once goddamn it he bundled her in slammed the door and saw with satisfaction that she was stunned enough to stay put ive got kate on my back he muttered as he piled in and turned the key you crying ive had just about enough ive of my own life you know yeah she sniffled rubbed the back of her hand over her cheeks to dry them youre really living it up brian just shut up the wheels spun as he whipped the car around and headed down the road youre going to come back here looking like a sheetwhite bag of bones were going to get to the bottom of it then maybe everybodyll go back to their respective corners and leave me the hell alone eyes narrowed now she clutched the door handle where are we going youre going he corrected to the doctor the hell i am surprise warred with sick alarm stop this car right now and let me out he set his mouth grimly and accelerated youre going to the doctor and if i have to ill cart you in well find out if kirbys half as good as she thinks she is i am not sick then you shouldnt be afraid to let her look you over im not afraid im pissed and i have no intention of wasting y yirbys time he swung up the little drive squealed to a halt at yirbys cottage then clamped a hand on his sisters shoulder his eyes were hot and dark and level you can walk in or you can embarrass both of us by having me haul you in over my shoulder either way youre going so choose they glared at each other jo figured her temper was every bit a match for his in a verbal battle she had a decent shot of taking him down if he decided to get physicaland she remembered from their youth that it was very possibleshe didnt have a prayer taking the high road she shifted pride to the forefront with a toss of her head she stepped lightly out of the car and walked up the steps to yirbys cottage they found kirby at the kitchen counter slathering peanut butter on bread hi she licked her thumb and let her greeting smile stay in place as she scanned first one coldly furious face then the other strange she thought how suddenly strong the family resemblance want some lunch got any time to do a physical brian demanded and gave his sister a firm shove forward kirby took a small bite of the openfaced sandwich as jo turned and hissed at her brother sure my next appointment isnt until onethirty she smiled brightly which one of you wants to get naked for me today shes having her lunch jo informed brian grandly peanut butters not lunch unless youre six he gave her another shove go in there and strip were not leaving until shes looked you over head to foot i see this is my first appointment by abduction kirby eyed brian conspiringly shed hoped he cared enough about his sister to be tough with her but she hadnt been sure go ahead jo back in my old room ill be right in theres nothing wrong with me good thatll make my job easier and give you an excuse to punish brian afterward she skimmed a hand over her neat french twist and smiled again ill help you fine she spun around and stomped down the hall whats all this about brian kirby murmured when the door slammed shes having nightmares shes not eating she came back from the campground this morning white as a sheet what was she doing at the campground ginny didnt show up for work today ginny thats not like her yirby frowned then waved it away that was a different worry im glad you brought her in ive been wanting to take a look at her i want you to find out whats wrong with her bran ill give her a physical and if theres a physical problem ill find it but im not a psychiatrist frustrated he dug his hands into his pockets just find out whats wrong with her kirby nodded handed him the rest of her sandwich theres milk in the fridge help yourself when she stepped into the examining room jo was still fully dressed and pacing look kirby jo you trust me dont you that has nothing to lets just do this get it done then everyone will feel better she picked up a fresh gown go into the bath across the hall put this on and pee in the cup she took out a fresh chart and a form as jo frowned at her im going to need some medical historylast period any physical problems any prescriptions youre on any allergies that sort of thing you can start filling that out once youve donned the latest fashion there and im doing the urinalysis she bent over to print jos name on the chart better give in gracefully fjrby murmured brians bigger than you jo shrugged once then stalked off to the bathroom i blood pressures a little high kirby removed the cuff nothing major and likely due to a slight temper fluctuation very funny kirby warmed her stethoscope between her palms then pressed it to jos back deep breath in out again youre a tad underweight too which makes the female in me green with envy and the sensible physician cluck her tongue my appetites been a little off lately the cooking at sanctuary should take care of that and if it didnt yirby intended to reevaluate she took out her ophthalmoscope began to examine jos eyes headaches now or ever either now yes but id say thats a direct result of tangling with brian the bully then she sighed i suppose ive been getting more of them in the last few months than usual dull and throbbing or sharp and piercing mostly the dull and throbbing variety dizziness fainting nausea i no not really yirby leaned back leaving one hand resting on jos shoulder no or not really when jo shrugged kirby set the instrument aside honey im a doctor and im your tend i need you to be straight with me and you need to know that anything you tell me inside this room stays between us jo took a deep breath clutched her hands hard in her lap i had a breakdown the wind whooshed out of her part fear part relict about a month ago before i came back here i just fell apart i couldnt stop it saying nothing yirby laid both hands on jos shoulders massaged gently jo lifted her head and saw nothing but compassion in those soft green eyes her own filled it makes me feel like such a fool why should it ive never felt that helpless ive always been able to handle things yirby to deal with them as they came and then everything just piled up heavier and heavier and im not sure if i was imagining things or if they were really happening i just dont know and then i collapsed just broke did you see someone i didnt have any choice i fell apart right in front of my assistant he carted me off to the er and they hospitalized me for a few days a mental breakdown i dont care if we are nearing the twentyfirst century i dont care how its intellectualized im ashamed im telling you theres nothing shameful about it and that you have right to feel whatever you want to feel jos lips curved a little so i dont have to be ashamed that im ashamed absolutely not what was your work schedule like tight but i liked it tight your social life nil but i liked it nil and yes that pretty much goes for my sex life too i wasnt depressed or pining over a man or the lack of one ive been thinking about my mother a lot jo said slowly im nearly the same age she was when she left when everything changed and your life fell apart yirby thought and you wondered worried if everything was going to change again beyond your control im not a shrink jo just an oldfashioned gp thats a friends speculation what was the prognosis when you were released i dont know exactly jo shifted crinkling the paper beneath her i released myself i see you didnt note any prescriptions down on your form im not taking any and dont ask me what they prescribed i never filled anything i dont want drugsand i dont want to talk to a shrink all right for now well handle this the oldfashioned way well eliminate any physical cause ill prescribe fresh air rest regular meals and some good safe sex if you can get it she added with a smile sex isnt one of my priorities well honey then you are crazy jo blinked then snorted out a laugh as yirby dabbed the inside of her elbow with alcohol thanks no charge for insults and the last part of the prescription is to talk with me with your family with whoever you can trust to listen dont let it build up again youre cared for jo lean a little she shook her head before jo could speak your brother cares enough to drag you in herehere to a place hes avoided like the plague since i moved in and if im any judge of character hes out there right now pacing and muttering and worried sick that im going to go out and tell him his sister has three weeks to live it would serve him right jo sighed heavily even if i do feel better now than i have in weeks then her eyes fastened on the stringe and widened what the hell is that for just need a little blood needle poised yirby grinned want to scream and see how long it takes him to run in here jo averted her eyes held her breath i wouldnt give him the satisfaction i when jo was dressed again yirby tossed her a fat plastic bottle theyre just vitamins she said highpotency if you start eating right you wont need them but theyll give you a boost for now ill let you know when the blood work comes back from the lab but everything else is within normal range i appreciate it really show it then by taking care of yourself and talking to me when you need to i will it always felt a bit odd for her to make an overtly affecnonate move but she stepped over and kissed kirbys cheek i will and i meant what i said i feel better than i have in a long time good follow doctor yirbys orders and you should feel better yet keeping her concerns to herself she led jo out brian was exactly where shed expected restlessly pacing her living room he stopped and scowled at them both kirby met the look with a bright smile you have a bouncing onehundredandtenpound girl daddy congratulations very funny what the hells wrong with you he demanded of jo she angled her head narrowed her eyes bite me she suggested then strolled to the door im walking back thanks for squeezing this idiots whims into your schedule kirby oh ive been working on doing just that for months she chuckled as the screen door slammed i want to know whats wrong with my sister shes suffering from acute brotheritis at the moment while extremely irritating its rarely fatal i want a tucking straight answer he said between his teeth and she nodded approvingly i like you even better when youre human she turned to the coffeepot pleased to see hed made himself useful and had brewed fresh all right straight answers would you like to sit down his stomach jittered painfully how bad is it not nearly as bad as you apparently think you take it black dont you like a real man her breath caught when he closed a hand hard over her arm im not in the mood for this okay so my witty repartee isnt going to relax you itll take a couple of weeks to get full test results back but i can give you my educated opinion from the exam jos a little rundown shes edgy and shes stressed and shes annoyed with herself for being edgy and stressed what she needs is exactly what youve shown me you can give her supporteven when she kicks against it the first trickle of relief loosened the pressure in his chest thats it thats all she turned away to finish pouring the coffee theres doctorpanent confidentiality jos entitled to her privacy and to my discretion jos my sister yes and on a personal level im happy to see you take that relationship to heart i wasnt sure that you did here she pressed the cup into his hand she came home because she needed to be home she needed her family so be there thats all i can tell you anything else has to come from her he paced away sipping coffee without realizing it all right he thought she wasnt suffering from any of the mysterious and deadly diseases hed conjured up while hed been waiting shed just run her self out of energy it wasnt cancer or a brain tumor all right this time he said it aloud i can probably browbeat her into eating regularly and threaten lexy away from picking fights with her youre very sweet kirby murmured no im not he set the cup down abruptly and stepped back his worry had faded enough to allow him to see kirby clearly the way those mermaid eyes were smiling at him the way she stood there all cool and composed all pink and gold im just looking out for myself i want my routine back and i wont get it until shes steadied out eyes warm kirby walked toward him liar fraud softie back off not yet she reached up to catch his face in her hands hed stirred more than her lust this time and she couldnt resist it you booked the physical for her and you havent paid the bill she rose to her toes my services dont come cheap and brushed her lips to his his hands were at her waist as the taste of her flooded into him i keep telling you to back off he tilted his head deepened the kiss why dont you listen her breath was already starting to back up clog her lungs a glonous sensation im stubborn persistent right youre aggressive his teeth nipped into her bottom lip tugged i dont like aggressive women mmm yes you do no i dont he pushed her back against the counter until his body was pressed hard and hot to hers until his mouth could fix firmly and devour but i want you happy now she tipped her head back moaning when his mouth raced down her throat give me five minutes to cancel my afternoon appointments and well both be ecstatic brian put your hands on me for gods sake its not going to be easy he nipped at her ear where a little emerald stud winked at the lobe worked his way restlessly back to her mouth to plunder until her nails dug into his shoulders he saw himself taking her there where they stood just dragging down his fly dragging down her neat trousers and plunging in until this desperate need this vicious frustration was behind him but he didnt touch her didnt take her instead he used the ache churning inside him to control tlicm both he wrapped his hand around her throat drew lier head back until their eyes met hers were the green of restless seas urging him to dive in its going to be my way youre going to have to accept that nerves shuddered through desire listen no were done with that done with the games too you couldve backed off but you didnt now its going to be my way when i come back were going to finish this her breath was coming fast her blood pumping hot for a moment she hated him for being able to study her with eyes so cool and controlled do you think that scares me i dont think youve got sense enough to let it scare you and he smiled slowly dangerously but it should when i come back he repeated and stepped away from her and i wont give a damn if youre ready she steadied herself and grabbed for some pride why you arrogant bastard thats right he walked toward the door praying he could make it out before the aching for her made him groan aloud he shot her a last look skimming his gaze over the tousled sunlit hair the eyes that sparkled with a range of dangerous emotions the mouth that was still swollen from his id go tidy myself up a bit doc your next patient just pulled up he let the screen slam behind him the desire cottage wasnt much of a detour on the way back to sanctuary in any case jo thought scrambling to justify it the walk would do her good maybe she wanted to take some afternoon shots of the river see how many more wildflowers had blooined and since shed be walking by it would be rude not to at least stop in besides it was family property she even worked out a little justpassing by excuse did some mental rehearsing to perfect just the right casual long so it was quite a letdown to get to the cottage and see that nathans jeep was gone she stood at the base of the stairs a moment debating then quickly mounted them before she could change her mind there was nothing wrong with slipping in just for a second leaving a note it wasnt as if she would disturb anything or poke around she just wanted to damn it his door was locked it was another minor jolt people on desire rarely locked their doors too curious now to worry about manners she pressed her face to the glass panel and peered in on the long table that served the kitchen area sat a compact laptop computer frustratingly and neatly closed a streamlined printer stood beside it long tubes that she assumed held blueprints were stacked nearby one large square of paper was unrolled and anchored at the corners with a jar of instant coffee an ashtray and two mugs but no matter how she shifted or angled her head she couldnt make out what was printed on it none of my business anyway she reminded herself straining to see at a crash of leaves behind her she stepped back quickly looked over her shoulder a wild turkey cut loose with its quick gobbling call and lumbered into flight with a roll of her eyes jo patted her skipping heart it would be perfect if nathan himself strolled out of the trees and caught her spying into his house she reminded herself that she had dozens of things she could do dozens of places she could go it wasnt as though shed gone out of her way to see him by much it was probably best that shed missed him she told herself as she jogged back down the stairs and headed home taking the palmetto trail she followed the bend of the river into the thick shade where muscadine things and resurrection ferns turned forest to verdant jungle she didnt need the kind of distraction the kind of complication that nathan delaney was bound to bring to her life just now she was just getting back on her feet if she pursued a relationship with him shed have to tell him about things and if she told him that would be the end of the relationship who wanted to get tangled up with a crazy woman on their vacation the path twisted crowded in by the saw palmettos that gave it its name she heard the turkey call again and the long liquid notes of a warbler her camera bag thudded at her hip as she quickened her pace and argued with herself so by not starting anything she was just saving them both time and embarrassment why the hell hadnt he been home ssh gaff put a hand over lexys mouth when he heard footsteps coming along the path near the clearing that was guarded by thick oak limbs and cabbage palms someones passing by he whispered oh in a lightning move lexy grabbed her discarded blouse and pressed it to her breasts i thought you said nathan had gone over to the mainland for the day he did i passed him on his way to the ferry then whooh lexy snickered as she peeked through palm fronds its just jo looking annoyed with the world as usual quiet gaff ducked lexys head down with his id just as soon your sister not catch me with my pants down but youve got such a nice she made a grab for him and muffling giggles they tussled until jo passed out of sight youre a bad one lex gaff pinned her grinned down into her face she still wore her brathey hadnt quite gotten around to disposing of itand he enjoyed the sensation of the slick material rubbing against his chest just how would i have explained myself if shed come over this way if she doesnt know whats going on its time someone showed her with a shake of his head he leaned down to kiss the tip of her nose youre too hard on your sister im too hard on her lexy snorted lets try that the other way around it fits much better well maybe youre too hard on each other looks to me like jos had a rough time with something lately her lifes perfect for her lexy disagreed pouting and twirling a lock of gaffs hair around her fingers shes got her work all that traveling people ooh and aah over her photographs like they were newborn babies or they study them like stupid textbooks and she makes piles of money enough so that she doesnt have to worry about stingy trust funds love tugged at him as he skimmed his knuckles over her chin honey its a pure foolish waste of time for you to be jealous of jo jealous at the shock of the insult her eyes went dark and wide why in holy hell would i be jealous of jo elien exactly he kissed her just a little nibbling peck the two of you are after the same thing the way you are and the way you go after it are as different as night and day but the goals the same really her voice was cool and smooth as fresh milk and what goal would that be to be happy thats what most people want down under the rest of it and to make their mark just because shes made hers before you doesnt make yours less important and after all she had three years head start it didnt placate lexy in the least her voice went from cool to icy i dont know why you brought me out here if all you wanted to do was talk about my sister honey you brought me he grinned and kept her pinned under him despite her badtempered wiggles as i recall you moseyed on down to sand castle cottage where i was minding my own business replacing screens you whispered a little something in my car and as you already had this here blanket in your tote what was a man to do she lifted her chin raised a brow why i dont know giff what is a man to do i guess ill han e to show you he took his time and that left her a little weak and trembling the night before everything had poured over her in a hot rush need on top of pleasure pleasure clawing at need but today in the cool air and dim light his hands were slow calluses scraping gently over her skin fingers pressing then skimming aild though his mouth was hot it didnt hurry it came back to hers again and again as if hers was the only flavor he riceded when she sighed it came from deep within she could be seduced as well as taken hed waited a lifetime to do both to watch her let him do both there was nothing about her that wasnt precious to him now he could show her inch by inch one day soon he would tell her word by word when he slipped inside her her moan of welcome was sweet and silky he braced himself over her to give more to take more and his pace was as lazy as the river that flowed nearby she whimpered when he lowered his head to suck gently on her breasts you come first he murmured so i can see you she couldnt have stopped herself she was being carried along like a weightless leaf on the rivers current the orgasm flowed through her long and lovely and deep she could barely sigh out his name as it slid through her system his mouth came back to hers as it curved and he emptied himself into her mmmm it was all she could manage as he rolled her over and snuggled her head on his chest shed never had a climax like that one that crept up from the toes like silkdipped fingers and hed seemed so in control so completely aware of her only the thunder of his heart under her cheek proved that hed been as undone as she she smiled again and turned her lips to his chest you must have done a lot of practicing he kept his eyes closed enjoying the air on his face and her hair under his hand im a strong believer that you keep working on a skill until you get it right id say you got it right ive wanted you all my life lexy it made something inside her shiver to hear him say it so simple so easy caught in the afterglow she lifted her head and when she looked at him that something shivered again i guess deep down ive always wanted you too when his eyes opened and the look in them made her mouth go dry she put on a sassy grin but you used to be so skinny you used to be flatchested she chuckled when he reached down to cup her breasts things do change scooting up she straddled him and you used to pull my hair you used to bite me ive still got your teeth marks back of my left shoulder laughing she shook her hair back it was going to be painful to brush the tangles out but she had to admit it had been well worth it you do not hell i dont mama calls it my hathaway brand lets just see she tugged at him until he rolled toward his side she peered down squinted though she could see the faint white scar clearly enough her brand it gave her an odd little thrill to know he carrled it where i dont see anything she shifted closer oh you mean that little thing why thats nothing i can do much better now before he could defend himself she clamped her teeth on his shoulder he yelped flipped her over and rolled until they were tangled in the blanket his hands managed to reach here reach there so that she was as breathless with freshening desire as with laughter id say its time i put my mark on you dont you dare bite me giff she giggled struggled rolled ouch damn it i didnt bite you yet well something did he moved fast visions of snakes slicing into his brain he rolled her gained his feet and scooped her into his arms in one lightning move her jaw dropped open as she watched his eyes suddenly hard and cold scan the ground golly was all she could manage as her romantics heart flopped in her chest nothing slithered or crept or crawled but he saw a glint of silver he set lexy on her feet turned her around a faint red scrape marred her delicate shoulder blade you just rolled over something thats all he kissed the scrape lightly then bent to pick up the dangle of silver somebodys earring brighteyed lexy reached back to rub absently at the little pain why hed picked her up as if she weighed nothing at all she thought dreamily and hed stood there holding her as if he would have defended her against a firebreathing dragon images of lancelot and guinevere of misty castles floated into her head before she managed to focus on the earring gaff was holding it was a bright trail of small silver stars thats ginnys with a slight frown she reached out and took it from him its from her favorite pair wonder how it got here gaff lifted his brows wiggled them i guess were not the first people to use the forest for something other than a nature walk with a laugh lexy sat on the blanket again setting the earring carefully beside her before she reached for her bra i guess youd be right long detour from the campground and her cottage though was she wearing them last night i dont pay much mind to my cousins earbobs gaff said dryly im almost sure she trailed off trying to bring back the picture ginnyd been wearing a brightred shirt with silver studs tight white jeans cinched with a concho belt and yes lexy thought almost certainly her favorite silver star dangles ginny liked the way they swung and caught the light well doesnt matter ill get it back to her if i can find her he sat down to pull on his jockeys what do you mean she must have found herself a hot date at the bonfire last night she didnt show up for work this morning what do you mean she didnt show up ginny always shows up well she didnt this morning i heard the hubbub over it when i came down for the breakfast shift lexy dug in her tote for a hair pick and began the arduous process of dragging out the tangles ouch damn it we had a bunch of checkins and outs over at the campground and no ginny kate sent daddy and jo over to handle it gaff pulled on his jeans rising to snap them they checked her cabin i finished up before they got back but id expect so i can tell you kate was in a tizzy thats not like ginny shes wild but shed never leave the in the lurch that way maybe shes sick lexy rubbed the earring between her fingers before tucking it into the little pocket of the shorts shed put on to drive giff crazy she was knocking back the tequila pretty steady he nodded in agreement but he knew that even hung over shed have done her job or seen to her own replacement he remembered the way shed looked staggering over the beach in the dark waving at him and lexy blowing them kisses ill go check on her you do that lexy rose enjoying the way he watched her legs unfold and maybe later she slid her arms around him up his back youll come check on me i was giving that some thought i was figuring id come by have dinner at the inn let you serve me oh her lips took on a feling curve as she stepped back slowly pulling the pick through her long corkscrew curls were you figuring that yeah then i was figuring how about if i just wandered on up stairs afterward maybe wandered right on into your room we could try this in a bed for a change well she ran her tongue over her top lip i might just be available tonightdepending on what kind of tipper you are he grinned and captured her justmoistened lips with his in a kiss that rocked her straight back on her heels when she could breathe again she exhaled slowly thats a real good start she bent down to gather the blanket deliberately turning to tease him with tight buns in tight shorts then turned her head im going to give you excellent service i by the time gaff was back in his truck and on the road to the campground his heart rate was nearly back to normal the woman was potent he thought and life with her was going to be a continual adventure he didnt think she was quite ready to have her notions adjusted to a lifetime with him but he was going to work on that too he smiled to himself flipped the radio up so clint black wailed through the speakers he had it all planned gaff mused the courtshipwhich was progressing just fine in his opinion the proposal the marriage the life as soon as he convinced her that he was exactly what she needed that would be that meanwhile they would give each other a hell of a ride he turned into the campground frowning a little as he saw the teenager inside the booth instead of ginny hey colin gaff braked leaned out his window got you manning the post today looks like seen ginny not hide nor hair the boy tried out a lascivious wink she musta caught a live one ye ah but there was an uncomfortable shift in giffs gut im going to look in at her cabin see whats up help yourself giff drove slowly mindful of the possibility that a child might dart out in front of him with summer just around the corner he knew more would be coming stacking up in the campground the cottages spreading towels on the beach those in the cottages would fry themselves in the sun half the day then come back and run their acs to the max which usually meant hed be kept busy replacing coils not that he minded it was good honest work and though he dreamed now and then of taking on something more challenging he figured his time would come he pulled up into ginnys short drive and climbed out he hoped to find her in bed moaning with her head in a basin that would explain why it was so damn quiet when she was home ginny always had the radio blaring the fv on her voice raised in song or in argument with one of the talk shows she was addicted to the noises clashed cheerfully she said it kept her from feeling lonesome but he heard nothing except the click of palm fronds in the breeze the hollow plop of frogs in water he walked to the door and because hed run as tame in her cabin as he did in his own home he didnt bother to knock he nearly jumped out of his skin as he pulled open the door and a mans form filled it jesus christ almighty bri you might as well shoot me as scare me to death sorry brian smiled a little i heard the truck thought it might be ginny his gaze shifted over giffs shoulder shes not with you is she no i just heard she wasnt at work and came to check shes not here it doesnt look like shes been around today though its hard to tell he glanced back over his shoulder womans messy as three teenage girls on a rampage maybe shes at one of the sites brian scanned the trees that crowded close around the tufts of go iden marsh grass there were a couple of pinta ducks taking a breather in the slough on their trek along the atlantic flyway a marsh hawk circled lazily overhead near the narrow path where spiderwort tangled a trio of swallowtail butterflies flitted gaily but he saw no sign of the human inhabitant of this small corner of the island i parked over near number one circled around to here i asked after her but nobody i ran into has seen her since yesterday thats not right the discomfort in gaffs stomach escalated into dull pain bri thats just not right i agree with you its after two oclock even if shed spent the night somewhere else she should have surfaced by now worry was a fist pressing at the back of his neck he rubbed it absently as he looked back into the living mess of ginnys cabin its time we started to make calls ill go by tell my mother shell have half a dozen calls made before either of us can make one come on ill drop you back at your car appreciate it she was pretty drunk last night giff added as he slipped behind the wheel i saw herlexy and i saw her we were in the water taking a swim he added with a quick glance over swimmingright gaff waited a beat tugged at the brim of his cap how am i supposed to tell you im sleeping with your sister brian pressed his fingers to his eyes i guess that was one way its a little difficult for me to get my tongue around the word congratulations under the circumstances you want to know my intentions i dont brian held up a hand i really really dont im going to marry her now im never going to be able to say the word congratulations again shifting in his seat brian aimed a level stare at giff are you crazy i love her giff slapped the truck into reverse and backed up i always have brian got a vividly clear picture of lexy gleefully kicking gaffs still bleeding heart off a cliff youre a big boy giff you know what youre getting into thats right just like i know that you and everybody else in your family never give lexy enough credit gaffs normally mild voice took on a defensive edge that made brian raise his eyebrows shes smart shes strong shes got a heart as big as the ocean and when you shake the nonsense away shes as loyal as they come brian blew out a long breath she was also reckless impulsive and self absorbed but giffs words had struck a chord and made brian ashamed youre right and if anyone can polish up her better qualities id say it would be you she needs me gaff tapped his fingers on the wheel id appreciate it if you didnt mention any of this to her i havent gotten to that part yet believe me the last thing i want to discuss with alexs is her love life good well i veered off from where i was heading like i was saying i saw ginny last night must have been somewhere around midnight wasnt paying much attention to the time she was walking south on the beachstopped and waved at us was she alone yeah said she needed to clear her head i didnt notice her walk back but i was kind of uh busy for a while well if she assed out on the beach someone would have come p across her by now so she must have walked back or cut up over the dunes we found one of her earrings in that clearing on the sanctuary side of the river when little bit ago giff said as he pulled up beside brians car lexy and i were oh please dont put that image in my brain what are you rabbits he shook his head are you sure it was ginnys earring lexy wasand she was pretty sure ginny was wearing it last night thats the kind of thing lex would notice but its a funny way for ginny to walk if she was heading home thats what i thought still she might have been with someone by then its not like ginny to leave a party before its overunless shes got another kind of party planned none of this is like ginny no its not im getting worried brian yeah he got out of the truck then turned and leaned in the window go get your mother started on those calls im going to head down to the ferry who knows maybe she met the man of her dreams and eloped to savannah i by six there was a fullscale search under way through the forest paths along the rugged hiking trails to the north down the long curve of beach and around the winding paths that twisted through the sloughs some of those who scoured the island remembered another search for another woman twenty years hadnt dimmed the memory and while they looked for ginny many murmured about annabelle probably shed taken off just the way belle had that was what some thought shed gotten an itchy foot and decided to scratch it the pendleton girl always had been wild no not annabelle some said but ginny annabelle had been still water running deep and ginny was all crashing surf but both of them were gone just the same nathan walked in on one of the conversations as he lingered at the dock tossing his briefcase into the cab loading his supplies in the back it made his heart beat just a little too fast a little too hard it made his stomach churn he heard annabelles name tossed back and forth and it made his cars ring hed come to face it nathan reminded himself then had tried to ignore it he wasnt sure how much longer he could do either or if he was going to be able to live with whichever path he took he drove to sanctuary he saw jo sitting on the grand front steps her head resting on her drawnup knees she lifted it when she heard his jeep and he saw all the ghosts in her eyes we cant find her she pressed her lips together ginny i heard not knowing what else to do he sat beside her draped an arm around her shoulders so she could lean against him i just came in on the ferry weve looked everywhere hours now shes vanished nathan just vanished like she couldnt say it wouldnt say it and drawing a breath slammed the door on even the thought of it if she was on the island someone would have seen her someone would have found her tilts a lot of ground to cover no she shook her head if she was trying to hide sure she could keep one step ahead ginny knows the island as well as anyone every trail and cove but theres no reason for that shes just gone i didnt see her on the morning ferry i kicked back and slept most of the way but shes tough to miss we already checked that she didnt take the ferry okay he ran his hand up and down her arm as he tried to think private boats theres a number of them aroundislanders and outlanders she can pilot a boat but none of the natives report one missing no ones reported one missing or come in to say they took ginny out a daytripper yeah she nodded tried to accept it thats what most people are starting to think she got a wild hair and took off with someone shes done it before but never when she was scheduled to work and never without leaving word he remembered the way shed smiled at him hey handsome she was hitting the tequila pretty steady last night yeah theyre saying that too she jerked away from him ginnys not some cheap irresponsible drunk i didnt say that jo and i didnt mean that its so easy to say she didnt care didnt give a damn she just left without a word to anyone without a thought to anyone jo sprang up as the words tumbled out left her home and her family and everyone who loved her without a second thought for how sick with worry and hurt they would be her eyes glittered with fury her voice rose with it she no longer cared that it was her mother she spoke of now no longer cared that she could see by the sober and sympathetic look on his face that he knew it i dont believe it she caught her breath let it out slowly and ive never believed it im sorry he got to his feet put his arms around her though she shoved strained against him he kept them firm im sorry jo i dont want your sympathy i dont want anything from you or anyone else let me go no shed been let go too often and by too many nathan thought he pressed his cheek to her hair and waited her out she stopped struggling abruptly and wrapped her arms tight around him oh nathan im so scared its like going through it all again and still not knowing why he stared over her head to the rioting garden of snapdragons and canterbury bells would it make a difference would it help to know why maybe not sometimes i think it would make it worse for all of us she turned her face into his throat pathetically grateful that he was there that he was solid i hate seeing my father remember and brian and lexy we dont talk about it cant seem to bring ourselves to talk about it but its there pushing at us and i guess its pushed us away from each other most of our lives she let out a long sigh lulled by the steady beat of his heart against hers i find myself thinking more about mama than ginny and i hate myself for it dont he touched his lips to her temple her cheekbone then her mouth dont he repeated and slid more casity and more deeply into the kiss than hed intended she didnt pull away but opened to him the simple comfort hed meant to offer grew into something with the backbeat of urgency his hands came up framed her face then slid down her in one long slow caress that made her stomach drop away to her knees the need that rose up in her was so sweet so ripe so huge she wanted nothing more than to fall into it where did this come from she thought dizzily and where could it go she wished suddenly and with all her heart that they could just be two people drowning each other in this slow endless kiss while the sun dipped low in the sky and shadows grew long and deep i cant do this she murmured i have to he changed the angle of the kiss and took her under again hold on to me again for just a minute he said when her arms dropped limply away need me again for just a minute she couldnt resist it couldnt deny either of them so she held close and held tight and let the moment spin out around them dimly she heard tires spin on the road below reality slipped back in and she drew back i have to go he reached out took her by the fingertips come back with me come home with me get away from this for a while emotions surged into her eyes filled them made them intensely blue i cant she backed up then rushed up the stairs closing the door behind her quickly and without looking back yirbysix hours after ginny had failed to show up for work brian dragged into the family parlor and stretched out on the ancient davenport he was exhausted and there was simply nothing else to be done the island had been searched in every direction dozens of calls had been made finally the police had been notified not that theyd seemed terribly interested brian thought as he studied the plaster rosettes edging the coffered ceiling after all they were dealing with a twentysixyearold womana woman with a reputation a woman who was free to come and go as she pleased had no known enemies and a predilection for taking strolls on the wild side he already knew the authorities would give the matter a glance do the basics then file it they had done a bit more than that twenty years before he remembered when another woman had vanished theyd worked harder and longer to find annabelle cops prowling the island asking questions taking notes looking soberly concerned but money had been involved theretrust funds property inheritances it had taken him some time to realize that the police had been pursuing an angle of foul play and that briefly his father had been the prime suspect it had scared the hell oat of him but no evidence of foul play had ever been found and interest eventually waned brian imagined interest would wane in ginny pendletons case much sooner and hed simply run out of things to do he thought fleetingly about reaching for the remote switching on the television or stereo and just zoning out for an hour the parloror the family room as kate insisted on calling itwas rarely used it was kate whod chosen the casual and comfortable furnishings mixing the deep wide chairs the heavy old tables the stretchoutandnap sofa shed tossed in colorful floor pillows with some idea brian imagined that the room might actually be too crowded now and then for everyone to have a traditional seat but most often the room was occupied by no more than one person at a time the hathaways werent the gathertogethertowatchtheeveningnews type they were loners he thought every one of them finding more excuses to be apart than to bond together it made life less complicated he sat up but lacked the energy to distract himself with someone eiscs news instead he rose and went to the little refrigerator behind the mahogany bar that was another of kates stubborn fantasies keeping that bar and cold box stocked as if the family might stop in after a long day share a drink some conversation a little entertainment brian gave a half laugh as he popped open a beer not bloody likely with that thought still lying bitter in his head he glanced up and saw his father in the doorway it was a tossup as to who was more surprised to find himself faced with the other silence hung in the air the thick and sticky kind that only family could brew at length brian tipped back his beer took a long cold swallow sam shifted his feet hooked his thumbs in his front pockets you finished for the day he asked brian looks that way nothing else to do since just standing there made him feel foolish brian shrugged his shoulders and said want a beer wouldnt mind brian got another bottle from the fridge popped the top as his fa their crossed the room sam took a swallow and fell back on silence it had been his intention to relax his mind with a few innings of baseball maybe knock back a few fingers of bourbon to help him sleep he had no idea at all how to have a beer with his son rains come in he said groping brian listened to it patter against the windows its been a pretty dry spring sam nodded shifted again water levels dead low on some of the smaller pools thisll help the outlanders wont like it no sams frown was a reflex but we need the rain silence crept in again stretched until brian angled his head well looks like that uses up the weather as a topic whats next he said coolly politics or sports sam didnt miss the sarcasm he just chose to ignore it didnt think you had much interest in either right what would i know about such manly subjects i cook for a living thats not what i meant sam said evenly his nerves were scraped raw his temper closer to the surface than he liked he concentrated on not losing it i just didnt know you had an interest you dont have a clue what interests me you dont know what i think what i want what i feel because thats never interested you brian hathaway kates voice snapped as she stepped into the room with lexy beside her dont you speak to your father in that tone let the boy have his say sam kept his eyes on his son as he set his beer aside hes entided hes not entitled to show disrespect kate sam shot her one quelling look then nodded at brian you got something in your craw spit it out it would take years and it wouldnt change a goddamn thing sam moved behind the bar he wanted that sour mash after all why dont you just get started anyway he poured three fingers of jim beam in a short glass then after a brief hesitation poured a second and slid it down the bar to brian i dont drink bourbon which probably makes me less of a man as well sam felt a dull pain center in his gut and lifted his own glass a mans drink of choice is his own business and youve been till grown for a time now why should it matter to you what i think it took me thirty years to get here brian shot back where the hell were you for the last twenty the lock hed put on the questions and the misery behind them gave way to frustration and snapped open as though it had been rusted through and just waiting for that last kick you walked away just like she did only you were worse because you let us know every tucking day of our lives that we didnt matter we were just incidentals that you dumped on kate war in her eyes kate surged forward now you listen to me brian william hathaway leave him be sam ordered his voice cold to mask the hot needles pricking at his throat finish it out he told brian youve got more what difference will it make will it make you go back and be there when i was twelve and a couple of outlander kids beat the hell out of me fer sport or when i was fifteen and sicked up on my first beer when i was seventeen and scared shitless because i was afraid id gotten molly brodie pregnant when we lost our virginity together his fists balled at his sides with a rage he hadnt known lived inside him you werent ever there kate was shes the one who mopped up the spills and held my head shes the one who grounded me when i needed it and taught me to drive and pictured and praised never you never once nong of us needs you now and if you treated mama with the same selfish disregard its no wonder she left sam flinched at that the first show of emotion during the long stream of bitterness his hand shook slightly as he reached for his glass again but before he could speak lexy was shouting from the doorway yirby are you doing this why are you doing this now somethings happened to ginny her voice shattered on a sob as she raced into the room something terribles happened to her i know it and all you can do is stand here and say these awful things tears streaming she clamped her hands over her ears as if she could block it all out why can t you leave it alone just leave it all alone and pretend it doesnt matter because it does furious that even now she wouldnt stand with him brian whirled on her because it does matter that were a pathetic excuse for a family that youre running off to new york and trying to replace the hole he put in your life with men that jos made herself sick and that i cant be with a woman without thinking ill end up pushing her away the way he did mama it matters goddamn it because theres not one of us who knows how to be happy i know how to be happy lexys voice rose and stumbled as she shouted at him she wanted to scream out the denial to make it all a lie im going to be happy im going to have everything i want what the hells going on here jo braced a hand on the doorjamb and stared the raised voices had brought her out of her room where shed been trying to nap to make up for the sleep shed lost worrying over ginny brians hateful just hateful on another wild sob lexy turned and rushed into jos arms the shock of that and the sight of her brother and her father facing each other across the bar like boxers at the bell had her gaping kate stood in the middle weeping quietly whats happening here jo managed as her head began to throb is it about ginny they dont care about ginny lost in grief lexy sobbed into jos shoulder they dont care its not about ginny sick now with fiery and guilt brian stepped away from the bar its just a typical hathaway evening and ive had enough of it he strode out pausing briefly by lexy he lifted a hand as if to stroke her hair then dropped it again without making contact jo took a quiet shallow breath kate kate brushed briskly at the tears on her cheeks honey will you take lexy to your room for a bit ill be along shortly all right jo took a quick glance at her fatherthe stony face the enigmatic eyes and decided it was best to save her questions come on lexy she murmured come on with me now when theyd gone kate took a hankie from her pocket and blew her nose not that its any excuse for his behavior she began but brians worried sick and exhausted all of us are but hes been talking to the police and still running the inn on top of everything else hes just worn out sam hes also right sam sipped wondering if the liquor would wash the harsh taste of shame out of his throat i havent been a father to them since belle walked out on us i left it all up to you sam he looked over at her are you going to tell me thats not true she sighed a little then because her legs just seemed too tired to hold her up another minute slid onto a stool at the bar no theres no point in lying sam huffed out what passed for a laugh youve always been honest to a fault its an admirableand irritatingquality i didnt figure you paid much notice ive been chorusing a more polite variation on what brians just poured out for years she angled her head and though her eyes were redrimmed they were steady when they met his never made a dent in you it made a few he set his glass down to rub his hands over his face maybe it was because he was tired and heartsick and remembering too damn clearly what hed let fade but the words he hadnt known he could say were there i didnt want them to need me didnt want anyone to and i sure as hell didnt want to need them he started to leave it at that it was more than hed ever said before to anyone other than himself but she was watching him so patiently with such quiet compassion he found the rest of it pouring out the fact is kate belle broke my heart by the time i got over it you were here and things seemed to run smooth enough if i hadnt stayed theyd have had nobody you did a good job with them kate i dont know that i realized that until that boy hit me between the eyes just now it took guts to do that kate shut her eyes ill never understand men not if i live another half century youre proud of him for shouting at you swearing at you i respect him for it it occurs to me that i havent shown him the proper respect a grown man deserves well hallelujah she muttered and picked up brians untouched bourbon and drank and choked sams lips curved she looked so pretty he thought sitting there thumping a fist to her heart with her face red and her eyes wide youve never been one for hard liquor she gulped in a breath hissed it out because it burned like the flames of hell im making an exception tonight im about worn to the bone he took the glass out of her hand youll just get sick he reached down into the fridge and found the open bottle of the chardonnay she preferred as he poured it for her she stared at him i didnt realize you knew what i like to drink you cant live with a woman for twenty years and not pick up on some of her habits he heard the way it sounded and felt dull color creep up his neck live in the same house i mean hmm well what are you going to do about brian do sam impatient she took a quick sip to knock the taste of hour bon out of her mouth are you going to throw this chance away there she was again was all he could think poking at him when all he wanted was a little peace hes pissed off and i let him have his say now thats done it is not done she leaned forward on the bar snagging his arm before he could evade her brian just kicked the door open sam now you be father enough you be man enough to walk through it he doesnt have any use for me oh thats the biggest pile of bull slop ive ever heard she was just angry enough not to notice that his cough disguised a chuckle the lot of you are so stubborn every gray hair i have is a result of hathaway muleheadedness he skimmed a glance over her neat cap of rich russet you dont have any gray hair and i pay good money to keep it away she huffed out a breath now you listen to me sam and keep your ears open for once i dont care how old those three children are they still need you and its past time you gave them what you stopped giving them and yourself years ago compassion attention and affection if ginny pulling this awful stunt has brought this to a head then im almost glad of it and im not going to stand by and see the four of you walk away from each other again she pushed off the stool snagged her glass now im going to try to calm lexy down which should take me half the night that gives you plenty of time to find your son and start mending fences with him kate when she paused at the door and turned those sparkling eyes back on him nerves had him reaching for the bottle of jim beam setting it aside again i dont know where to start you idiot she said with such gentle affection that the heat rose up his neck a second time you already have i brian knew exactly where he was going he didnt delude himself that he was just taking a long walk to cool off he could have rounded the island on foot and his blood would still have been hot he was frious with himself for losing his temper for saying things it did no good to say it ripped at him that hed made both lexy and kate cry life was simpler when you kept things inside he decided when you just lived with them and went about your business wasnt that what his father had done all these years brian hunched his shoulders against the rain annoyed that hed come out without a jacket and was now soaked through he could hear the sea pounding as he trudged along the soggy sand between the dunes lights glowed behind the windows of cottages and he used them as a compass in the dark he heard a drift of classical music as he mounted kirbys stairs he saw her through the rainsplattered glass of the door she wore soft and baggy blue sweats her feet bare her hair swung forward to curtain her face as she bent to poke inside the refrigerator one dainty foot with sassy pink toenails tapping time to the music the quick punch of lust was very satisfying he opened the door without knocking she straightened quickly and with a short audible gasp oh brian i didnt hear you off guard she balanced a hand on the open refrigerator door is there word on ginny no oh i thought nerves drummed in her fingers as she raked them through her hair from brow to tip his eyes were dark and direct with something unquestionably dangerous smoldering in them her heart took a rabbit leap into her throat youre soaked its raining he said and began to walk toward her ah it didnt matter how ridiculous she told herself it was her knees were starting to shake i was about to have a glass of wine why dont you pour some and ill get you a towel i dont need a towel okay she could smell the rain on him now and the heat ill get the wine later he reached out and shut the refrigerator door then trapped her against it with his body and crushed his mouth to hers in a scaring greedy kiss even as the moan strangled in her throat his hands snaked under her shirt closed possessively over her breasts his teeth nipped at her tongue shooting tiny thrills of pain and fear through her then his hands slid down around her cupping her bottom and lifting until she was inches off the floor and wet straining denim was pressed against the wicked ache between her thighs she managed to shudder out a breath when his lips fastened on her throat so much for small talk hungrily she attacked his ear that quick bite of flesh stirred a craving for more the bedrooms down the hall i dont need a bed his smile sharpedged and feral he lifted his head and looked at her my way remember and i do my best work in the kitchen her feet hit the floor again before she could blink he pulled her arms over her head capturing her wrists in one hand as he pushed her back against the door look at me he demanded then slid his free hand under the elastic of her pants and plunged his fingers into her she gave one choked cryshock and pleasure colliding in a brutal assault on the system that had her hips jerking against him matching his ruthless rhythm in primal response her vision narrowed her breath shortened and she came in an explosive gush shed already been wet hed found her slick and ready and that alone had been brutally arousing but when her eyes went blind and she flooded into his hand fists of vicious need pounded at his body his breath was a snarl as he yanked the shirt over her head fastened his mouth to her breast she was small and firm and tasted of peaches he wanted to deyour her to feed until he was sated or dead his murmurs of approval mixed with tirecats neither of them could comprehend her hands were raking through his hair tugging at his wet shirt those always competent fingers fumbling in their haste her very lack of control was another layer of arousal for him more he muttered dragging her pants over her hips i want more when his mouth raced down she gnpped his shoulders and sobbed you canti cant oh god what are you doing to me im having you then his mouth was on her teeth and tongue relentlessly driving her beyond sanity her head fell back against the humming refrigerator door as heat swamped her as it sucked her down as it coated her skin with sweat the force of the climax struck her like a runaway train speeding through the tunnel where he held her trapped and helpless her body went limp her head lolling back when he lifted her nothing shocked her now not even when he laid her on the kitchen table like a main course he had skillfully prepared for his own appetite he stripped off his shirt his eyes never leaving hers bracing one foot on the edge of the table he pulled off one sneaker then the other tossing them both aside he unbuttoned his jeans dragged the zipper down her eyes were clearing good he thought he wanted to watch them go blind again as he stripped off his jeans he let his gaze wander over her rosy damp skin delicate curves her hair tumbled against dark wood she was beautiful breathtaking when he was sure he could form words he would tell her now he mounted her and feeling her tremble beneath him smiled say take me brian she had to concentrate on pulling in enough air to survive then let it out on a moan as his thumbs brushed over her nipples say it mindlessly she arched for him take me brian for gods sake he drove inside her in one fast hard stroke holding them both on the edge as he watched those mermaid eyes glaze now take me kirby yes she lifted a hand to his face wrapped her legs around him and gloried in the fast dark ride he was breathless when he collapsed on her and for the first time in days both his body and his mind were relaxed he could feel her still quivering lightly beneath him the solid aftershocks of good hard sex he rubbed his face in her hair enjoying the scent of it that was just to whet the appetite oh my god he chuckled and pushing himself up was delighted to see her smiling at him you tasted like peaches id just had bubble bath before you came around to ravish me good timing on my part she reached up to brush the hair back from his facea casually affectionate gesture that intrigued them both as it turned out i suppose it was you looked very dangerous and exciting when you walked in here i was feeling dangerous we had a family scene at sanctuary im sorry not your problem i could use that wine now he shifted slid off the table and went to the refrigerator kirby allowed herself to enjoy the view as a doctor she could give him high marks for keeping in shape as his lover she could be grateful for that long hard body wineglasses are in the second cabinet to the left she told him ill get a robe dont bother he said as she hitched herself off the table im not going to stand around the kitchen naked yes you are he poured two generous glasses before his gaze slid in her direction roamed over her and you wont be standing for all that long anyway amused she arched a brow i wont no he turned handed her a glass then tapped his against it i figure the counter there will put you at about the right height she was grateful shed yet to sip her wine the kitchen counter yeah then theres the floor yirby looked down at the shiny white linoleum her grandmother had been proud to have installed three years before the floor i figure we might make it to the bedif youre set on being traditionalin a couple three hours he glanced at the clock on the stove plenty of time we dont serve breakfast until eight she didnt know whether to laugh or gulp awfully confident of your staying power arent you confidct enough hows yours the thrill of challenge made her smile ill match you brianand more ill make sure we ilve through it her eyes laughed at his over the rim of her glass after all im a doctor well then he set his glass aside she squealed when he nipped her around the waistthen yelped when her butt hit the formica hey its cold sos this brian dipped a finger into his wine then let it drip onto her nipple he bent forward licked it delicately away well just have to warm things up am supposed it was a bad sign when a man had to pump up his couragejust to speak to his own i son and it was worse when youd worked your self up to it then couldnt find the boy tow the kitchen was empty with no sign of coffee on the brew or biscuits on the rise sam stood there a moment feeling outsized and awkward as he always did in what he persisted in thinking of as a womans area he knew brian habitually took a walk in the morning but he also knew brian just as habitually started the coffee and the biscuit or fancy bread dough first in any case brian was usually back by this time another half hour forty minutes people would be wandering into the dining room and wanting their grits just because sam didnt spend much time around the house and as little as possible around the guests didnt mean he didnt know what went on there sam ran his cap around in his hands hating the fact that worry was beginning to stir in his gut hed woken up on another morning and found a member of his family gone no preparation then either no warning just no coffee brewing in the pot and no biscuit dough rising in the big blue bowl under a thick white cloth had he driven the boy off and would he have more years now to wonder if he was responsible for pushing another out of sanctuary and away from himselip he closed his eyes a moment until he could tuck that ugly guilt away damned if hed hang himself for it brian was a fullgrown man just as annabelle had been a fullgrown woman the decisions they made were their own he tugged his cap onto his head started toward the door and felt twin trickles of relief and anxiety when he heard the whistling heading down the garden path brian stopped whistlingand stopped walkingwhen he saw his father step through the door on the screened porch he resented having his mood shoved so abruptly from light to dismal resented having his last few moments of solitude interrupted brian nodded briefly then moved past sam into the kitchen sam stood where lie was for a minute debating it wasnt hard for one man to spot when another had spent the night rolling around with a woman on hot tangled sheets seeing that relaxed satisfied look on his sons face had made him feel foolishand envious and he thought of how easier it would be all around for him to keep walking and just leave things where they lay with a grunt he pulled off his cap again and went back inside need to have a word with you brian glanced over hed already donned a butchers apron and was pouring coffee beans into the grinder im busy here sam planted his feet i need a word with you just the same then youll have to talk while i work brian flicked the switch on the grinder and filled the kitchen with noise and scent im running a little behind this morning uhhlih sam twisted his cap in his hands and decided to wait the grinder was finished rather than trying to take over t he watched brian measure out coffee measure out water then set the big omatic on to brew i ali was surprised you werent already in here at this brian took out a large bowl and began to gather the basics for his biscuits i dont punch a time clock for anybody but myself no no you dont he hadnt meant it that way and wished to god he knew how to talk to a man wearing an apron and scooping into flour and lard what i wanted to say was about yesterdaylast night brian poured milk eyeballing the amount i said all i had to say and i dont see the point in rehashing it so you figure you can say your piece but im not entitled to say mine brian snatched up a wooden spoon cradled the bowl in his arm out of habit and began to beat the dreamy afterglow of allnight sex had dulled to lead what i figure is youve had a lifetime to say yours and ive got work to do youre a hard man brian i learned by example it was a neat and wellaimed little dart sam acknowledged it accepted it then weary of playing the supplicant he tossed his cap aside youll listen to what i have to say then well be done with it say it then he dumped the dough on a floured board and plunged his hands into it to knead violently and lets be done with it you were right sam felt the click in his throat and swallowed it everything you said was right and true wristdeep in biscuit dough brian turned his head and stared what and i respect you for having the courage to say it what you got flour in your ears sam said impatiently i said you were right and you were right to say it how long does it take that goddamn contraption to make a goddamn cup of coffee he muttered staring accusingly at the machine slowly brian began to knead again but he kept his eyes on sam you could squeeze off a cup if you need one well i do he opened a cupboard door then scowled at the glasses and stemware coffee cups and mugs havent been kept there for eight years brian said mildly two cupboards down to the leftright over the coffee beverage area coffee beverage area sam murmured fancy names for fancy drinks when all a man wants is a cup of black coffee our cappuccino and lattes are very popular sam knew what cappuccino was right enoughor was mostly sure but lattes baffled him he grunted then carefully slid the glass carafe out to pour coffee into his mug he sipped felt a little better and sipped again its good coffee its all in the beans i guess grinding them fresh makes some difference aji the difference in the world brian dropped the dough in the bowl covered it then walked to the sink to wash up now i believe we have what could pass as an actual conversation for the first time in oh most of my life i havent done right by you sam stared down into the rich black liquid in his mug im sorry brian stopped drying his hands and gaped what damned if im going to keep repeating myself sam jerked his head up and his eyes were filled with frustration im giving you an apology and you ought to be big enough to take it brian held up a hand before it all descended into an argument again you caught me off guard knocked me flat brian corrected and went to the refrigerator for breakfast meats and eggs maybe i could accept it if i knew what you were apologizing for for not being there when you were twelve and getting pounded on when you were fifteen and sicking up your first beer when you were seventeen and too stupid to know how to make love to a girl without becoming a father more than a little shaky brian took out a skillet kate took me over to savannah and bought me condoms she did not if the boy had slapped him over the head with the sausage meat hed have been less shocked kate bought you rubbers she did brian found himself smiling over the memory as he heated the skillet lectured me up one side and down the other about responsibility and restraint abstinence then she bought me a pack of troans and told me if i couldnt control the urge id do a damn sight better to wear protection sweet jesus the chuckle escaped as sam leaned back on the counter i just cant picture it then he straightened cleared his throat it should have been me telling you yes it should have been you as if the arrangement were vital brian set sausages in the skillet why wasnt it i didnt have your mother telling me that id better go talk to that boy something was on his mind or that lexy had new dress shoes and wanted to show them off i saw those things for myself but i got used to her prodding me on them then when i didnt have her i let it all go he set the coffee down shot his hands in his pockets im not used to explaining myself i dont like it brian took out another bowl broke the first egg for pancake batter your choice i loved her it scared his throat and sam was grateful that brian continued to focus on his work its not easy for me to say that maybe i didnt tell her enoijghthe feeling came a lot easier than the words i needed her serious sam shed call me and wouldnt let me stay that way for long she loved being around new people talking about everything under the sun she loved this house this island and for a while she loved me brian didnt think hed ever heard a longer speech from sam hath away not wanting to break the flow he poured the butter hed melted into the bowl and said nothing we had our problems im not going to pretend we didnt but we always got through them the night you were born jesus i was scared pissyourself scared but belle wasnt it was all a big adventure to her and when it was over and she had you cuddled right up in her arms and nursing she laid back against the pillows smiling look what a beautiful baby we made ourselves sam well have to make lots more a mans got to love a woman like that sam murmured he doesnt even have a choice i didnt think you did love her i did sam picked up his coffee again all the talk had dried out his throat it took me a lot of years of being without her to stop loving her maybe i did push her away but i dont know how the not knowing ate at me bad for a lot of years im sorry he saw the flicker of surprise in his fathers eyes i didnt think it mattered to you i didnt think any of it really mattered it mattered but after a while you learn to live with what youve got and you had the island it was what i could depend on what i could tend to and it kept me from losing my mind he took a deep breath but a better man would have been around to hold his sons head when he puked up too much budweiser christ an import no wonder i dont understand you sam sighed and took a long look at the man his son had become a man who wore an apron to work and baked pies a man be corrected with cool and steady eyes and shoulders strong and broad enough to carry more than his own load weve both had our say and i dont know as itll make any difference but im glad we said it sam held out a hand and hoped it was the right thing jo walked in on the surprising tableau of her father and brother shaking hands in front of the stove they both looked at her identical flickers of embarrassment on their faces just then she was too damn tired and irritable to analyze it lex isnt feeling well ill be taking her breakfast shift brian grabbed a kitchen fork and hurriedly scooted the sausage around before it burned youre going to wait tables thats what i said she grabbed a short apron from a peg and tied it on whens the last time you waited tables brian demanded the last time i was here and you were shortstaffed youre a lousy waitress well im all youve got pal lexys got a crying ag headache and kates heading over to the campground to straighten out the mess there so live with it sam picked up his cap and edged toward the door dealing with his son was one thing and that had been hard enough he wasnt about to take on a daughter in the same day ive got things to do he muttered and nearly winced when jo shot him a killing look well so do i but im waiting tables because the two of you decided to go at each other and kate and i had to spend half the damn night listening to lexy cry and carry on now the two of you i see have shaken hands like real men so everythings fine and dandy where are the damn order pads top drawer under the cash register out of the corner of his eye brian saw his father slip out the door typical he thought grimly and drained the sausage the computers new he told jo you ever work a cash register computer why the hell would i im not a sales clerk im not a waitress im a goddamn photographer brian rubbed the back of his neck it was going to be a long morning go up and pour some aspirin down lexys throat and get her down here you want her you get her ive had more than my fill of lexy and her drama queen routine she was wallowing in it jo slapped the pad down on the counter and stalked to the coffeepot center of attention as always she was upset maybe she was until she began to enjoy the role but it wasnt my fault and im the one who was stuck with her it was after two before kate and i got her calmed down and out of my room now shes the one who claims to have a headache jo rubbed hard at the center of her forehead any aspirin down here brian took a bottle from a cupboard and set it on the counter take the pot in and make the first rounds blueberry pancakes are the special if you have to scowl scowl in here out there you smile tell the customers your name and pretend you can be personable it should offset the slow service kiss my ass she snarled but grabbed the pot and the pad and swung through the door it didnt get any better brian was slicing a grapefruit and grinding his teeth at the two orders that had been sitting under the warming light for a full five minutes another two he thought and hed have to dump them and start again where the hell was jo busy morning nathan breezed in the back door i got a glimpse of the dining room through the windows looks like a pretty full house sunday morning brian flipped what he thought must have been the millionth pancake of the day people like a big breakfast on sundays me too nathan grinned at the grill blueberry pancakes sound perfect get in ling goddamn it whats she doing out there building the pyramids you know computers im the proud owner of three why youre now manning the cash register brian jerked a thumb behind him go over there and figure it out i cant keep stopping what im doing to fix it every time she flicks up a bill you want me to work the cash register you want to eat why dont i work the cash register nathan decided and walked over to study it jo rushed in her face pink and harassed her arms loaded down with dishes she had to know she had to know what it would be iike today im going to kill her if i live through this what the hell are you doing here she shot at nathan apparently ive been put on the payroll he eyed her as she dumped the dishes in the sink and grabbed the waiting orders you look real cute today jo ellen bite me she muttered and shouldered out the door i imagine shes been just that pleasant to the customers dont spoil my fantasy nathan told him i like to believe she saves those ass kicks just for me going to push her in the river again she slipped and ive got something else in mind for me and jo brian scrubbed a hand over his face i dont want to hear about it i dont want that particular image in my head either i just figured you should know what direction im planning to take to illustrate nathan grabbed her when she swung back through the door hauling her against him he kissed her scowling and surprised mouth are you crazy she shoved an elbow in his gut to free herself then pushed orders and cash and credit cards into his hands here figure it out she darted over to snag a fresh pot of coffee and tossed scribbled orders on the counter two specials eggs scrambled side of bacon whole wheat toast one i dont remember but its written down there and were running low on biscuits and cream and if that monster kid at table three spills his juice one more time im going to strangle him and his idiot parents nathan grinned as she stalked out again bri i think it could be love more likely insanity now keep your hands off my sister and ring up those orders or im not feeding you i at tenthirty jo staggered into her room and fell facedown on the bed everything hurt her back her feet her head her shoulders nobody she thought nobody who hadnt been there could possibly know how hard waitressing was shed hiked up mountains waded through rivers spent sweltering days in the desertand would do so again for the right shot but she would slit her wrists with a smile on her face if she ever had to wait another table and she hated having to admit that lexy not only wasnt a lazy malingerer but she made the job look easy still if it hadnt been for lexy jo wouldnt have missed that glorious watery aftertherain light that morning she wouldnt be grittyeyed from three hours sleep and her feet wouldnt be screaming she set her teeth when she felt the mattress give under someones weight get out lexy or i might find the energy to kill you dont bother shes not here she turned her head narrowed her eyes at nathan what are you doing here you keep asking me that he reached out to tuck her hair behind her ear and clear his view of her face right now im checking on you tough morning huh she groaned closed her eyes go away ten seconds into the foot rub and youre going to beg me to stay foot rub she pulled her leg back but he closed his fingers around her ankle holding it steady as he pried off her shoe ten nine eight and when he ran the heel of his hand firmly up her arch sheer pleasure shivered through her system and made her roan see i told you just relax happy feet are the key to the universe galilee carl sagan he said with a grin did you get anything to eat down there if i so much as look at another pancake ill throw up i to light not i brought you something else slic blinked one eye open what hmm youve got very attractive feet long narrow an elegantly high instep one of these days im going to start nibbling on them and work my way up oh you meant what did i bring you to eat he pressed his fingers against the ball of her foot worked them down to the heel strawberries and cream one of brians miraculous biscuits with homemade jam and some bacon for protein why because you need to eat he glanced back at her or did you mean why am i going to nibble on your feet never mind okay why dont you roll over sit up and eat then i can do this right she started to say she wasnt hungryan automatic response but she remembered kirbys orders to eat and the idea of strawberries had some appeal she sat up trying not to feel foolish when nathan settled down crosslegged with her foot cradled in his lap she took the bowl of strawberries and picked one out with her fingers she studied him in silence a moment he hadnt bothered to shave that morning and his hair was in need of a trim but the just a bit unkempt style suited him as did the gold the island sun was teasing out of his thick brown hair you dont have to go to all this trouble she told him im thinking about sleeping with you well thats a load off my mind she took a bite of a strawberry and the taste was so sweet and unexpectedly bright she smiled i guess im a little out of sorts this morning are you he gripped her toes worked them gently back and forth i hadnt noticed which is your sly yankee way of saying im always bitchy not always and i think the word id have chosen would have been troubled a hathaway legacy because the strawberries had stirred an appetite she picked up a slice of bacon and bit in we had a family brawl last night which was why lexy was in bed with her head under the covers and i was waiting tables do you always pick up the slack surprised she shook her head no i wouldnt say i pick up much of anything im rarely here and when you are youre waiting tables changing linen scrubbing toilets how did you hear about that her voice had gone sharp puzzling him you told me you were on housecleaning detail here at the inn oh that feeling foolish she reached for the biscuit broke it in half what else nothing she jerked a shoulder just some kids playing a prank a couple of days ago they locked me in the mens showers over at the campground i got a little freaked thats not funny no at the time i didnt find it amusing did you catch them no they were long gone by the time my father came along and got me out it wasnt a big deal just annoying so we can add cleaning the mens showers to the list of slack you dont pick up and in between all that youre putting a photography book together and finding time to work on new pictures what about fun photography is fun for me when he only lifted a brow she sampled another strawberry i went to the bonfire and stayed till nearly midnight you wild woman the line formed between her brows im not much on parties what are you much on besides photography books movies art music this is called the science of getting to know each other he told her when she said nothing its very handy especially when one person is thinking about sleeping with the other he leaned forward amused when she edged back are you going to share any of those strawberries jo ordered her pulse to level and because he was still rubbing her feet fed him a berry he caught the tips of her fingers in his teeth sucked them in as well smiling slowly he released them thats subliminal sensory stimulation or whats more commonly known as im coming on to you i think i got that good now movies she tried to think if there was another man who had ever disconcerted her so easily or so often the answer was a solid no i lean to the old blackandwhite especially film noir the cinematography the light and shadows are so incredibic the maltese falcon the best of the best look at that he patted her foot common ground what about contemporary stuff there i head for straight action art films rarely grab me id rather see schwarzenegger mow down fifty bad guys than listen to a handful of people expressing their angst in a foreign language this is a big relief for me we could never have settled down to raise five children and golden retrievers if id had to face art films it made her laugh a low smoky sound he found ridiculously arousing if those are my choices i may reconsider subtitles your favorite city anywhere florence she said before shed known it was true that bright wash of sunlight the colors the buildings the age and grandeur of them the pitti palace the palazzo vecchio i have a wonderful shot of the pitti just before sunset id love to see it i didnt bring it with me she said absently remembering the moment the slant of light the quick whoosh of air and noise as a flock of pigeons rose in a wave its back in charlotte i can wait before she had a chance to react he squeezed her foot so when youve finished breakfast how about taking me on a real tour of the island its sunday yeah i heard a rumor about that no i mean thats turnover day most of the cottages turn over on sunday they have to be cleaned and resupplied for incoming guests by three more housekeeping what the hell did they do when you werent here kate lost the two girls she had on cottage duty the week before i got here they took jobs on the mainland and since im here and sos lexy she hasnt bothered to replace them yet how many are on your list six he considered nodded rose well then wed better get started we sure i can handle a vacuum cleaner and a mop and this way youll get done faster and well have time to find the least occupied spot on the beach and neck for a while she shifted slid her feether incredibly happy feet she had to admitinto her shoes maybe i know a couple of spotsif youre as handy with a vacuum cleaner as you are with reflexology jo ellen he put his hands on her hips in a gesture she found shockingly intimate theres something you should know he was still married he was under federal indictment he preferred bondage to straight sex she let out a little breath amazed at herself she hadnt been aware she possessed that much imagination what is it im thinking about sleeping with you too she snorted a laugh backed up nathan thats been a load on my mind since you found your way back to desire i he was so happy to be back to be so close to her just watching her brought him that quick zing of anticipation for what was to come in his own good time he thought he might prolong it after all hed planned carefully and money was no problem he had all the time in the world it would beevenmoresatis ingtolullherintocomplacencytowatchhcrrelax bit by bit then he would yank her back a brisk tug on the chain she wasnt aware linked them shed be afraid shed be confused she would be all the more vulnerable because of the calm hed provided before he rearranged the composition yes he could wait he could enjoy the sun and the surf and before long he would know every minute of her routine just the way hed known her habits in charlotte he would let her drift along maybe even fall in love a little and what delicious irony that was all the while she would have no idea that he was there to control her fate to grasp his own destiny and to take her life dont see why you cant take one day off just one and spend some time with me giff put his nail gun down sat back on his heels and studied lexys sulky face it was one of those wicked whims of nature he supposed that made that pouty look so damned appealing to a man honey i told you this was going to be a busy week for me and its only tuesday what difference does it make what day it is she threw her hands up in the air every day around here is the same as the other well ill tell you what difference it makes to me he skimmed a hand over the edge of the decking hed completed i told miss kate that id have this porch addition finished and screened in by saturday so youll have it done by sunday i told her saturday that to giff said everything but since it was lexy he was talking to he worked up the patience to spell out the rest the cottage is booked for next week since she needs colin at the campground tilltime right now and jeds got this week of school to finish before the summer break ive got to see to it on my own she didnt care about the damn porch the floor was nearly finished anyway how long could it take to put a silly roof on it and screen it in just a day gaff she crouched down next to him letting all her charm slide into her voice as she kissed his cheek just a few hours we can take your boat over to the mainland have a nice lunch in savannah lex i just cant spare the time now if i can get this done we can go next saturday i can juggle some things around and we can take the whole weekend if you want i dont want to go saturday her voice lost its purr and edged toward mulish i want to go now gaff had a fiveyearold cousin who was just as insistent on having her way and having it now but he didnt think lexy would appreciate the comparison i cant go now he said patiently you can take the boat if youre so antsy to get gone go do some shopping by myself take your sister take a friend i cant think of anyone i less want to spend the day with than jo and i dont have any friends ginnys gone he didnt need to see the tears flood her eyes to know that was the root of the problem and the greatest source of her newest discoitent there was nothing he could do about it just as there was nothing he could do about the raw spot in his own heart since ginnys disappearance if you want me to go you have to wait till saturday ill get the weekend cicar we can book a hotel room and ill take you out for a fancy dinner you dont understand anything she thumped a fist on his shoulder as she sprang to her feet saturdays not today and ill go crazy if i dont get away from here why wont you make time for me why wont you just make time im doing my best even his patience could wear thin giff picked up the nail gun and shot a bolt home you cant even stop work and pay attention for five minutes you just shuffle me in between jobs and now a stupid porch is more important than being with me i gave my word on the porch he rose and hefting a new board laid it across the sawhorse to measure i keep my word lexy you still want to go to savannah on the weekend ill take you thats the best i can do its not good enough she jerked her chin up and im sure i wont have any trouble finding someone whod be happy to take me today he scraped his pencil over the board to make his mark then looked up at her with cool narrowed eyes he recognized the threat and the very real possibility that shed make good on it no you wont he said in calm measured tones and that will be up to you it was like a slap shed expected him to rage to have a jealous fit and tell her exactly what hed do if she looked at another man then they could have had a loud satisfying fight before shed let him drag her into the empty house for makeup sex then she would have convinced him to take her to savannah the scene shed already staged in her head dissolved because she wanted to cry she tossed her head and turned away fine then you go right on and build your porch and ill do what i have to do gaff said nothing as she stalked down the temporary steps he had to wait until his vision cleared of blind rage before he picked up the skill saw temper could cost dearly he knew and he didnt want it to cost him a finger he was going to need all of them he thought if she followed through it would take four fingers to make the fist he was going to plow into some guys face lexy heard the saw buzz and gritted her teeth selfish bastard thats all he was he certainly didnt care about her she walked fast across the sand her eyes stinging her breath short no one cared about her no one understood her even ginny she had to stop a moment as the muscles in her stomach seized ginny had left just gone away everyone she let herself care about left her one way or another she never mattered enough to make them stay at first shed been sure something terrible had happened to ginny shed gotten herself kidnapped or shed stumbled half drunk into a pond and been eaten by a gator that was ridiculous of course it had taken her days but lexy had resigned herself to the fact that shed been left behind again because no one stayed no matter how much you needed them to but this time she shot a defiant look over her shoulder at the cottage where giff was working this time shed do the leaving first she headed for the line of trees the sun was too hot on her skin the sand too gritty in her sandals at that moment she hated desire and everything on it with a wild and vicious passion she hated the people who came and expected her to serve them and clean up after them she hated her family for thinking of her as an irresponsible dreamer she hated the beach with its blinding white sun and endless lapping waves and the forest with its pockets of dim shadows and screaming silence and most of all she hated gaff because shed been thinking about falling in love with him she wouldnt now she wouldnt give him the satisfaction instead she thought as she left sun for shade she would set her sights on someone else and make giff suffer when she caught sight of little desire cottage and the figure sitting on the screened porch she smiled slowly she didnt know why she hadnt thought of it before of him before nathan delancy he was perfect he was successful sophisticated educated hed been places and done things he was gorgeous to look atgorgeous enough that even jo had taken notice shed bet nathan delancy knew how to treat a woman lexy opened the little red bag she wore strapped across her body after popping a cherry lifesaver in her mouth to sweeten her breath she took out her compact carefully dusted her nose and brow her color was up so her cheeks needed no blusher but she methodically painted her mouth a young inviting red she spritzed on some joy and fluffed back her hair while calculating exactly how to play the scene she wandered closer to the cottage then looked up with a friendly smile why hello there nathan hed brought his computer out on the picnic table on the porch to enjoy the breeze while he worked the design he was tinkering with was nearly perfected at the interruption he looked up distractedly and realized his neck had stiffened up again hello lexy he rubbed at the ache dont tell me youre working on such a beautiful morning just fiddling with final details why is that one of those little computers how in the world do you draw whole buildings on that painstakingly she laughed and cocking her head skimmed a finger down her throat oh now ive interrupted you and you probably wish id scoot not at all it gives me an excuse to take a break really would you just hate me if i asked to come up and take a peek or are you temperamental and dont like to show your work in progress my works just the beginning of progress so its tough to be temperamental about it sure come on up he glanced at his watch as she turned to go to the steps he really wanted a couple of hours more to refine the plans and he had a date at one a drive up to the north end of the island a picnic lunch and some more time to get to know jo ellen hathaway still he smiled at lexyit was impossible not to she was pretty as a picture smelled fresher than the spring breeze teasing through the screens and the short white skirt she wore hinted that she had legs approximately up to her ears want something cold mmm ill just have a sip of yours okay she picked up the large insulated glass on the table and sipped slowly iced coffee perfect she detested iced coffee and had never understood why people chilled a perfectly nice hot drink she ran her tongue over her top lip and sat companionably beside him not too close a woman didnt want to be obvious she glanced at the monitor and was so surprised by the complex and detailed floor plan that she nearly forgot the point of the visit why isnt that fantastic how in the world do you do all that with a computer i thought architects used pencils and slide rules and calculators not as much as we used to cad makes our lives easier computerassisted drawing he explained you can take out walls change angles and pitch widen doorways lengthen rooms then change your mind and put it all back the way it was and you dont wear out erasers its just amazing is this going to be someones house eventually a vacation home on the west coast of mexico a villa images of hot music exotic flowers and whitesuited servants popped into her mind bris been to mexico ive never been anywhere she slanted him a look under her lashes youve been all over the world havent you i wouldnt say all over but here and there a little alarm bell rang in his brain but he ignored it as foolish and egocentric wonderful cliffs on the west coast great vistas this place will look out over the pacific ive never seen the pacific ocean it can be wild down this way this area herehe tapped the monitoritll be the solarium arched glass sides and roofmotorized roof theyll be able to open it for parties or whatever when the weathers right the pool goes there were keeping it freeform and building up the west side with native rock and flora small waterfall trickling down here itll look like a lagoon a swimming pool right inside the house she gave a long wistful sigh isnt that something they must be millionaires and then some she filled her eyes with dreamy admiration and stared deeply into his you must be the very best then so important so successful designing mexican villas for millionaires she laid her hand on his thigh i cant even imagine what it would be like being able to build such beautiful things uhoh the second alarm bell was louder and impossible to ignore he considered himself a fairly intelligent man an intelligent man knew when a woman was hitting on him a lot of people work on a project like this engineers landscapers contractors wasnt he sweet she thought and slid a little closer but without you they wouldnt have anything to work on youre the one who makes it happen nathan retreat was often the intelligent mans choice nathan decided he shifted managed to put the best part of an inch between them not ifi dont get these plans done he gave her a quick smile that he hoped wasnt as nervous as it felt and im running a bit behind on them so they look wonderful her hand trailed up a little higher on his thigh intelligent or not he was also human his body reacted as nature dictated listen lexy im just so impressed she leaned in inviting id just love to see more her breath fluttered out onto his lips lots more deciding he was either too much of a gentlemanor too blockheaded to make the next move she pressed her mouth to his and wound her arms around his neck it took him a minute she was warm and tasty and most of the blood had drained out of his head making it difficult to think rationally but he managed to take hold of her wrists unwind her and ease away you know he found it necessary to clear his throat you know lexy youre a very appealing woman im flattered good her pulse picked up a little the image of gaffs face enraged with jealousy slipped into her mind and the pulse picked up a bit more then why dont we go inside for a little while theres this other thing he drew her arms down kept his hands firmly over hers i really like my face the way it is ive gotten used to it hardly ever cut myself shaving anymore i like it too its a wonderful face appreciate that and i dont want gaff to feel obliged to try to remodel it for me oh what do i care about gifp she gave a careless toss of her head he doesnt own me the edge that came into her voice and the sulky heat in her eyes amused him and told him that a lovers spat was certainly at the root of this current attempt at seduction have a fight did you i dont want to talk about giff why dont you kiss me again nathan you know you want to part of him did a very primal part that was just a little too close to the surface right then okay we wont talk about gaff well talk about jo she doesnt own me either no im he wasnt quite sure how to put it interested in her he decided i think youre interested in me to prove it she freed a hand and made a beeline for his crotch managing not to yelp he caught her hand firmly cut that out his voice took on a lecturing tone that would have made any mother proud youre worth more than this lexy a hell of a lot more why would you want jo more than me shes cold and bossy and stop it he gave her captured hands one quick hard squeeze i dont want to hear you talk about her that way i care about her and so do you you dont know what i care about nobody does because her voice had cracked at the end he felt suddenly and pitifully sorry for her gently he lifted her hands and when he kissed them had her blinking in surprise maybe thats because you havent really made up your mind yourself yet hoping it was safe he released one of her hands to brush the hair back from her face i like you lexy i really do thats another reason im not taking you up on your very tempting offer shame washed over her rushing hot to her cheeks i made a fool of myself no i damn near did though steadier at last he eased back reached for his now tepid coffee to cool his throat most likely youd have changed your mind somewhere along the way then where would i be she sniffled maybe i wouldnt have sex is easy its the rest that messes things up tell me about it when he offered her the coffee she managed to smile and shake her head i hate iced coffee i only drank it to seduce you nice touch you want to tell me about your fight with gifp doesnt matter misery settled over her so heavily she rose and paced hoping to shake it off he doesnt care about me doesnt care what i do or who im with he couldnt even spare an hour of his precious time for me today sweetheart hes crazy about you she let out a quick laugh being crazy about somebodys easy too not always not when youre trying to make it all work lips pursed she looked back at him do you really have feelings for jo apparently shes not easy about anything im finding that out are you sleeping with her lexy not yet she decided and her lips curved and its making you twitchy she came back sat on the edge of the table want some tips i dont think its appropriate for us to discuss he trailed off then simply abandoned dignity what kind of tips she likes to be in charge in control of things you know its how she works how she lives and always she keeps that little space that maneuvering room between herself and someone else he found himself smiling again and liking alexs hathaway even more shed never guess how well you know her most people underestimate me lexy said with a shrug and mostly i let them but i figure you did me a good turn today so ill do you a good turn back dont let her maneuver too much when the time comes you sweep her away nathan i dont think anybodys ever swept jo ellen away and its just what she needs she gave him a long measuring and very female look then smirked i figure you can handle that part just fine and i also figure youre smart enough not to tell her what went on around here not in this lifetime then the sassy look faded find out whats wrong with her nathan wrong somethings eating at her and whatever it is she came here to get away from it but she isnt getting away from it the first week or so she was here shed cry in her sleep or pace the floor half the night and now and then theres a look in her eye like shes afraid jos never afraid have you talked to her me she laughed again jo wouldnt talk to me about anything important im the silly little sister theres nothing silly about you lexy and i for one dont underestimate you touched she leaned over and kissed him i guess that makes us friends id like to think so gaffs a very lucky man only if i decide to give him a second chance she tossed her head and rose maybe i willafter he crawls some and begs a lot as a friend id appreciate it if you didnt mention this to gaff either hed feel really bad about pounding me oh i wont name names she sauntered to the door glanced back but i think youd handle yourself nathan i do believe youd handle yourself just fine bye now along nathan rubbed his eyes his heart then his stomach handling that one he thought would be a real challenge and he wished giff the very best of luck jo was just loading the picnic hamper when lexy strolled into the kitchen her camera bag sat on the counter carefully packed her tripod leaned against it going on a picnic lexy asked airily i want to shoot some pictures on the north end thought id make an afternoon of it all by yourself no jo tucked the wine shed decided on into the basket nathans going along nathan lexy hitched herself up on the counter to sit chose a glossy green apple out of the stoneware fruit bowl why isnt that a coincidence smiling lexy polished the apple on her blouse just between her breasts is it i just came from his place oh though her back went stiff jo managed to keep her tone casual mmmhmm enjoying dancing on the edge and iceding her sister to it lexy bit into the apple i was passing by the cottage and there he was sitting out on the screened porch having some iced coffee he invited me up you dont like iced coffee lexy tucked her tongue in her cheek tastes do change he showed me some floor plans hes working on a mexican villa i wouldnt think youd be interested in floor plans oh im interested in all kinds of things the devil in her eyes lexy took another crunchy bite of apple especially goodlooking men that ones prime beef im sure hed be flattered you think so jo said dryly and slapped the lid down on the hamper i thought you were going to see gaff i saw him too youve been busy jo hefted the hamper slung her camera bag over her shoulder ive got to get going or ill lose the light toddle on along then and have a nice picnic oh and jo give nathan my best wont you when the door slammed lexy wrapped an arm around her stomach and howled with laughter another tip nathan she thoughttile up that greeneyed monster a bit then reap the rewards she wasnt going to mention it she would absolutely not lower herself to bring it up in even the most casual manner jo shifted her tripod then bent to look through the viewfinder to perfect the angle she wanted the sea beat more violently here whipping and lashing at the rough beach below the jutting bluff gulls wheeled and screamed white wings slashing across the sky heat and humidity were soaring making the air shimmer the south wall of the old monastery was still standing the lintel over the narrow doorway had held through it light and shadow tangled and wild vines flourished she wanted that abandoned lookthe tufts of high grass the hillocks of sand the wind built then destroyed she wanted no movement and had to wait judge the instants of stillness between gusts of wind a broad depth of field she thought everything in sharp focusthe textures of the stone the vines the sand all the varying shades of gray to accomplish it she had to stop down decreasing the aperture slowing the shutter speed tilting her lens slightly more toward horizontal she framed in careful to block out the ruin of the remaining walls she wanted it to look as though the building could be whole yet was still empty and deserted alone she took her shots then carried tripod and camera to the east corner the texture was excellent there the pits and scars that wind and sand and time had dug into the stones this time she used the tumbled walls capturing desolation and loss when she heard a quiet click she straightened nathan stood just to her left lowering his camera what are you doing taking your picture hed managed three before she caught him at it you had a nice intense look about you her stomach shuddered pictures of her without her being aware but she forced her lips to curve here let me have the camera ill take yours betterset the timer on yours and take both of us in front of the ruins this type of view camera this light they arent made for portraits so we wont mat t for your next show it doesnt have to be perfect jo he set his camera down it just has to be us if i had a diffuser turning her head she squinted into the sun then muttering changed the cameras viewpoint to cut back on shadows calculated the aperture adjusted shutter speed she shrugged her shoulders jo it was a struggle not to laugh think of it as a snapshot i mill not go stand to the left of the opening in the front wall about two feet over she waited until hed walked to the spot shed pointed out through the viewfinder she watched him grin at her she could do so much better she thought if she had some control had the necessary equipment to manipulate the light and shadows shed have been able to highlight his windblown hair bring out all those different shades of light and dark the light was hard she decided it should have been softer just a little romantic to show off those wonderful eyes that strong bone structure with a reflector some backfill a diffuser she could have made this shot sing god he was attractive standing against that worn and pitted stone he looked so strong and alive so male and capable so sexy with that plain gray tshirt over a broad chest those faded and worn jeans snug over narrow hips i see why you dont do portraits as a rule she blinked straightened what your model would lapse into a coma waiting for you to set the shot smiling he stretched out his arm giving her a comeahead curl with his fingers it doesnt have to be art it always has to be art she corrected she fussed for another moment then set the timer and went to stand beside him ten seconds hey he shifted pulled her in front of him and wrapped his arms around her waist i like this pose relax and smile she did leaning back against him as the shutter clicked when she started to move he nuzzled her hair i still like this pose he turned her around arms sliding and continuing to circle as he lowered his mouth to hers and this one even more i have to put my equipment away okay he simply moved his mouth from hers and skimmed it down her throat nerves and desire did a pitch and roll inside her i the lights changed its not right anymore because her knees were going to shake she drew back i didnt mean to take so long its all right i liked watching you work ill help you stow your gear no ill do it i get edgy when anyone fools with my equipment then ill open the wing yeah thatd be nice she walked back to her tripod easing out a long quiet breath she was going to have to make up her mind and very soon she thought as to whether she was going to advance or retreat she unhooked her camera carefully packed it away lexy said shed been with you this morning what he could only hope the pop of the cork masked part of the shock in his voice she said she went by your cottage jo was already cursing herself for bringing it up and kept her eyes firmly on her work nathan cleared his throat and suddenly wanted a glass of wine very badly ah yeah she did for a minute why no reason jo collapsed the tripod she said youd shown her some plans you were working on maybe hed underestimated lexy after all he mused and poured two hefty portions of wine the mexico job i was doing some finetuning on it when she dropped in jo carried her equipment over stacked it neatly at the far edge of the blanket hed spread over the ground you sound a little nervous nathan no just hungry he handed her the wine took a deep gulp of his own before sitting down and diving into the basket so what do you have to eat jos muscles tensed did something happen with lexy something happen nathan pulled out a plastic container of cold fried chicken i dont know what you mean her eyes narrowed at the alltooinnocent look on his face oh dont you what are you thinking when you didnt want to defend he decided attack you think i with your sister insult coated his voice all the more effective from the desperation that pushed it there shes a beautiful woman jo slapped a covered bowl of sliced fruit down on the blanket she certainly is so of course that means i jumped her at the first opportunity what the hell kind of man do you take me for temper snapped out some of it real and nathan felt all of it justified i go after one sister in the morning and switch to the other for the afternoon maybe ill give your cousin kate a roll before nightfall and make my points off the whole family i didnt meani was only asking just what were you asking i his eyes were dark and hot fury streaking out of them the jitter of alarm came first which surprised her then it was smothered quickly by self disgust nothing im sorry she was baiting me annoyed with herself jo dragged a hand through her hair i knew she was baiting me she knew i was coming up here with you and that ive been seeing you more or less and she wanted to get a rise out of me she blew out a breath cursed herself again for not keeping her mouth shut i wasnt going to mention it she went on when nathan said nothing i dont know why i did it just slipped out he cocked his head jealous she would have been relieved that the heat had died out of his eyes but the question tightened her up all over again no i was just i dont know im sorry she reached for his hand closing the distance i really am lets forget it since he had her hand he brought it to his lips it never happened when she smiled leaned over and kissed him lightly on the mouth he rolled his eyes skyward wondering if he should thank lexy or throttle her yirby checked yancy brodies temperature while his mother looked on anxiously he was up most of the night doc yirby i gave him tylenol but the fever was night back up this morning jerry had to leave before dawn to go out on the shrimp boat and he was just worried sick i dont feel good yancy said fretfully and looked up into kirbys eyes my mama said you were gonna make me feel better well see what we can do about that kirby ran a hand over fouryearold yancys strawcolored tuft of hair did you go to betsy pendletons birthday parry a couple of weeks ago yancy she had ice cream and cake and i pinned the tail on the ackass donkey his mother corrected daddy calls it a ackass yancy grinned then laid his head on yirbys arm i dont feel good i know sweetie and you know what else betsy doesnt feel good today either and neither do brandon and peggy lee what weve got here is an outbreak of chicken pox chicken pox but he doesnt have any spots he will shed already noted the rash starting under his arms and youve got to try really hard not to scratch when it starts to itch honey im going to give your mom some lotion to put on you that will help annie do you know if you and jerry ever had the chicken pox we both did annie let out a long sigh fact is jerry gave it to me when we were kids then its likely you wont get it again yancys incubating now so you want to keep his exposure to other kids and adults who havent had it to a minimum youre quarantined buster she said tapping yancy on the nose tepid baths with a little cornstarch will help once it breaks out and im going to give you both topical and oral medications ive only got samples here so youll have to get jerry to fill some prescriptions over on the mainland tylenol for the fevers fine she added laying a cool hand on yancys cheek ill drop by your place in a few days to take a look at him noting the look of distress on annies face yirby smiled touched her arm hell be fine annie the three of you are in for a couple of tough weeks but i dont foresee any complications ill go over everything with you before you take him home i just could i talk to you for a minute sure hey yancy yirby removed the stethoscope from around her neck and slipped it around his you want to hear your heart go thump she cased the earpieces in place guided his hand his tired eyes went big and bright you listen to that for a minute while i talk to your mom she led annie into the hallway leaving the door open yancys a strong healthy completely normal fouryearold boy she began you have nothing to worry about chicken pox is inconvenient irritating but its very rarely complicated i have some literature if youd like its not she bit her lip i took one of those home pregnancy tests a couple of days ago it was positive i see are you happy about that annie yeah jerry and me weve been trying to make another baby for the best part of a year now but is it going to be all right is it going to get sick exposure to the virus during the first trimester carried a slight risk you had chicken pox when you were a child yeah my mother put cotton gloves on me to stop me from scratching and scarring its really unlikely youd contract it again if she did iyirby thought with a tug of worry they would deal with that when it happened even if you did contract the virus the odds are the baby will be fine why dont you let me run a backup pregnancy test now just to confirm and give you a quick look well see how far along you are and go from there itd make me feel a lot better then thats just what well do whos your regular obi went to a clinic over to the mainland for yancy but i was hoping you could take care of things this time well well talk about that irene verdons in the waiting room lets see if she can keep an eye on yancy for a few minutes then i want the two of you to go home and get some rest youre going to need i feel better knowing youre looking after us doc kirby annie laid a hand on her stomach all of us by one oclock yirby had diagnosed two more cases of chicke pox splinted a broken finger and treated a bladder infection such she thought as she grabbed a jar of peanut butter was the life of a general practitioner she had thirty minutes before her next appointment and hoped to spend it sitting down and stuffing her face she didnt groan when her door opened but she wanted to this was a stranger she knew every face on the island now and shed never seen this one she tagged him immediately as a beach rover one of the type who popped up on the island from time to time in search of sun and surf his hair was streaky blond and skimmed his shoulders his face was deeply tanned he wore ragged cutoffs a tshirt that suggested she sun her buns in cozumel and darklensed wayfarer sunglasses late twenties she judged clean and attractive she set her sandwich aside and returned his hesitant smile sorry he dipped his head have i got the right place i was told there was a doctor here im doctor fitzsimmons what can i do for you i dont have an appointment or anything he glanced at her sandwich should i make one why do you need one i just have this ah he shrugged his shoulders then held out a hand the palm was badly burned with a red welt across it oozing with blisters that looks nasty automatically she stepped forward taking his hand gently to examine it it was stupid coffee was boiling over and i just grabbed the pot without thinking im down at the campground when i asked the kid at checkin if there was someplace i could get some salve or something he told me about you lets go in the back ill clean and dress this for you im horning in on your lunch goes with the territory so youre camping she continued as she led him back to the examining room yeah i was planning on heading down to the keys doing some work im an artist he sat in the chair she indicated then frowned at his palm i guess this will put the skids on work for a couple of weeks unless you want to paint lefthanded she said with a smile as she washed up snapped gloves on well i was thinking about hanging out here longer anyway great place he sucked in his breath as she began to clean the burn hurts like a bitch i bet it does id recommend aspirin and a potholder he chuckled then set his teeth against the pain i guess im lucky theres a doc around this kind of thing can get infected right mmm but well see that it doesnt what kind of things do you paint whatever strikes me he smiled at her enjoying her scent the way her hair swept down gold over her cheek maybe youd like to pose for me she laughed then rolled her chair over to a drawer for salve i dont think so but thanks youve got a terrific face i do good work with beautiful women she glanced up his eyes were hidden by the lenses though his smile was wide and friendly there was something around the edges that made her suddenly ill at ease doctor or not she was a woman and she was alone with a stranger one who was watching her just a little too closely im sure you do but being the only doctor on the island keeps me pretty busy she bent her head again to coat the burn with salve foolish she told herself she was being ridiculous he had a seconddegree burn on his hand and he was letting a stranger treat it and he was an artist naturally he was watching her if you change your mind i guess im going to be hanging here for a while jesus that feels better he blew out a long breath and she felt his hand relax in hers feeling even more foolish now she offered him a sympathetic smile thats what were here for i want you to keep this dry you can put a plastic bag around it when you shower i wouldnt try swimming for the next week the dressing should be changed daily if you dont have someone around to help you with it just come in and ill do it i appreciate it youve got good hands doc he added as she wound gauze around his hand thats what they all say no i mean itnot just good doctor hands artistic hands angel hands he said with another smile id love to sketch them sometime well see about that when you can hold a pencil again she rose im going to give you a tube of salve and i want you to check in with me in two days unless you leave the island in that case youll want to have it looked at eiscwhere okay what do i owe you insurance no twentyfive for the office visit and ten for the supplies more than fair he got up tugged his wallet out of his back pocket with his left hand gingerly he plucked bills out with the fingers of his wrapped hand guess its going to be awkward for a while theyll help you out at the campground if you need it its a friendly island so ive noticed ill get you a receipt no thats all right he shifted and she felt that little jolt of nerves again listen if youre over that way maybe you could stop in you could see some of my work or we could kirby you back there she felt a warm rush of relief so fast and frill it nearly made her giddy brian im just finishing up with a patient you be sure to keep that gauze dry she said briskly and pulled off her gloves and dont be stingy with the salve youre the doctor he sauntered out ahead of her then lifted his brows at the man who stood in the kitchen with a bloody rag around his left hand looks like youve got a problem there good eye brian said dryly and glanced at the gauzewrapped hand looks like im not the only one busy day for the doc the doc kirby said as she walked in hasnt had five minutes tobrian what the hell have you done heart in her throat she leaped forward grabbed his wrist and quickly unwrapped the rag damn knife slipped i was justim dripping blood all over the floor oh be quiet her heart settled back when she studied the long slice on the back of his hand it was deep and bleeding freely but nothing had been lopped off you need stitches no i dont yes you do about ten of them look just wrap it up and ill get back to work i said be quiet she snapped youll have to excuse me i she glanced over frowned oh i guess he left come into the back i dont want you sewing on me i only came because lexy and kate went half crazy on me and if lexy hadnt been pestering me i wouldnt have cut myself in the first place so just dump some antiseptic on it wrap it up and let me go stop being a baby taking his arm firmly she pulled him into the back sit down and behave yourself whens the last time you had a tetanus shot a shot oh listen that long ago she washed up quickly put the necessary tools in a stainlesssteel tray then sat down in front of him with a bottle of antiseptic well take care of that afterward im going to clean this disinfect then ill give you a local he could feel the wound throbbing in time with his heart both picked up speed a local what anesthetic itll numb the area so i can sew you back together what is this obsession of yours with needles let me move your fingers she ordered good good i didnt think youd cut through any tendons are you afraid of needles brian no of course not then she picked up the hypo and he felt all the blood drain out of his face ye s damn it kirby keep that thing away from me she didnt laugh as hed been dead certain she would instead she looked soberly into his eyes take a deep breath let it out then take another and look at the painting over my right shoulder just keep looking at the painting and count your breaths one two three thats it little stick thats all she murmured and slid the needle under his skin keep counting okay all right he could feel the sweat crawling down his back and focused on the watercolor print of wild lilies this is the perfect time for you to make some snotty comment i worked in er saw more blood during that year than a layman does in three lifetimes gunshots knifings car wrecks i never panicked the closest ive ever come to panicking was just now when i saw your blood dripping onto my kitchen floor he looked away from the print and into her eyes ill mop it up for you dont be an idiot she grabbed a swatch of surgical paper to make a sterile field then paused when he touched his hand to hers i care too he waited until she looked at him again i care a lot how the hell did this happen i dont know what do you think we should do about it its probably not going to work you know you and me no she picked up the suture probably not keep your hand still brian he glanced down saw her slide the suturing needle under his skin his stomach rolled taking another deep breath he looked back at the painting dont worry about making it neat just make it fast im famous for my ladylike little stitches just relax and keep breathing since he figured it would be more humiliation than he could stand to pass out on her he tried to obey im not afraid of needles i just dont like them its a common phobia i dont have a phobia i just dont like people sticking needles in me she kept her head bent so he wouldnt see her smile perfectly understandable what was lexy pestering you about the usual everything he tried to ignore the slight tug as she drew the edges of the wound together im insensitive i dont care about heror anyone else for that matter i dont understand her no one does if i was a real brother id lend her five thousand dollars so she could go back to new york and be a star i thought shed decided to stay here through the summer she had some sort of goround with giff since he hasnt come crawling after her shes gone from the sulky stagewhich was our big treat yesterday the nasty stage are you almost done halfivay slic said patiently half great wonderful his stomach rolled again okay think about something else who was the beach bum hmm oh the burn tussle with a coffeepot says hes an artist on his way to the keys he may be over at the campground for a while i never did get his name what kind of an artist a painter i think he wanted me to pose for him damn it be still she said when his hand jerked what did you tell him that i was flattered thank you very much but didnt have time he made me nervous brians free hand shot out and grabbed her shoulder making her curse only a couple more she began did he touch you what no it wasnt fear or pain in his eyes she realized it was fury and that was wonderfully satisfying why yes of course brian onehanded he wrestled me to the floor in a wild burst of lust and pulled off my clothes brians fingers dug in i want a straight answer did he put his hands on you no of course he didnt i just got nervous for a minute because the office was empty and he seemed over interested then it turned out he just wanted to sketch my hands she fluttered the fingers of her left one angel hands now be still before you ruin my work and end up with a nasty scar not that your jealousy isnt flattering im not jealous he removed his hand and willed the green haze over his vision to subside i just dont want some beach bum hassling you he didnt hassle me and if he had i could have handled it one more now she tugged knotted snipped then examined the neat line of stitches carefully a lovely job if i do say so myself she rose to prepare his tetanus shot how would you have handled it handled what oh were still on that are we with a polite rebuff and if that hadnt worked one good squeeze on that burn and hed have been on the floor screamingn pain when she turned back careful to keep the hypo behind her back she saw brian smiling you would have too absolutely i once cooled the ardor of an oversexed patient by pressing ever so gently on his larynx he quickly decided to stop making obscene suggestions to me and the nursing staff now you want to look at the lilies again brian he paled what have you got behind your back just look at the lilies oh christ he turned his head then a moment later yelped and jerked brian that was the alcohol swab thisll be over in ten seconds youre going to feel a prick he hissed a prick my ass what are you using an upholstery needle there all done she smoothed a bandage over the needle prick then sat down to wrap his hand keep this dry ill change the dressing for you when it needs it in about ten days two weeks well see about taking the stitches out wont that be fun here she reached in the pocket of her smock and took out a tootsie pop for being such a good boy i know sarcasm when i hear it but ill take the sucker she unwrapped it for him stuck it in his mouth take a couple of aspirin she advised the locals going to wear off quickly and its going to hurt some you want to get ahead of the pain not chase it arent you going to kiss it i suppose she lifted his hand touched her lips lightly to the gauze be more careful with your kitchen tools she told him i like your hands just the way they are then i dont suppose youd object if i moseyed on over here later tonight wrestled you onehanded to the floor and tore your clothes off i dont suppose i would she leaned forward until her lips met his then with a little sigh lingered there the sooner the better brian glanced over at the examination table and his grin spread slowly well since im here now maybe you should give me a complete physical havent had one in a couple three years you could wear your stethoscope just your stethoscope the idea made a nice curl of lust slide into her stomach the doctor is in she began then came back to earth when she heard the outside door open but ill have to give you an evening appointment she eased back then stood to remove the tray ive had a morning full of chicken pox and thats my next patient he didnt want to go he realized he wanted to sit there and watch her he wanted to study her the competent way she handled her instruments the brisk and graceful way she moved so he stalled and did just that whos got the chicken pox who under ten doesnt is more like it were at seven and counting she glanced around have you had it oh yeah the three of us got it at the same time i think i was nine so that would have made jo about six lex just under three i guess my mother went through a couple of gallons of calamine must have been great tin for all of you it wasnt so bad after the first couple of days my father went over to the mainland and brought back this huge box of lincoln logs at least a dozen coloring books and that llmbo box of crayolas barbie dolls matchbox cars because the memory made him sentimental brian shrugged i guess he was desperate to keep us all occupied and to give your mother a little peace yirby mused i imagine three sick kids are pretty hard to handle sounds like he had the right idea yeah i guess they worked through it together i used to think that was the way it was with them until she took off telling himself it didnt matter he stood up ill get out of your way thanks for the repair job because his eyes looked suddenly sad she framed his face in her hands and kissed him lightly ill bill you but the physical weve scheduled thats free it made him smile thats quite a deal he turned to the door he didnt look back at her and the words just seemed to come out before he considered them or knew they were there i think im falling in love with you yirby i dont know what were going to do about that either he walked out quickly leaving her staring she eased herself down on her stool and decided her next patient was just going to have to wait another moment or two until the doctor got her breath back just before sunset kirby took a walk on the beach she needed some quiet time she told herself just a little space to think before brian came back he loved her no he thought he loved her she corrected that was a different level entirely still it was a step she hadnt expected him to take and one she was afraid of tripping over she walked to the waters edge let the surf foam over her ankles there she thought when the tide swept back and sucked the sand down under her feet that was exactly the same sensation he was causing in her that slight and exciting imbalance that feeling of having the ground shift under you no matter how firmly you planted your feet shed wanted him and she chipped away at his defenses until she won that battle now the stakes had gone up considerably higher than shed ever gambled on before shed been very careful to do the picking and choosing in personal relationships and shed chosen brian hathaway but somewhere along the way the angle had changed on her he wouldnt speak of love lightly not brian she could but not with brian she realized if she said those words she would have to mean them and if she meant them she would have to build on them words were only the foundation home family permanence she would have to decide if she wanted those things at all and if she wanted them with him then she would have to convince him that he wanted them with her it wouldnt be simple the bruises and scars from his childhood kept anything about brian from being simple she lifted her face to the wind hadnt she already decided hadnt she known in that split second when she saw him bleeding when fear swept all professional calm aside that her feelings for him had gone well beyond lust it scared her she was afraid she would indeed trip over that step and more she was afraid to commit to taking it better to take it slow she decided to be sure of her footing she handled things better if she was calm and clearsighted certainly something as important as this should be approached with caution and a cool head she ignored the little voice snickering inside her head and turned back to walk home the glint far across the dunes made her frown the second time it flashed she realized it was the setting suns reflection off glass binoculars she thought with a shiver with a hand shielding her eyes she could just make out a figure the distance made it impossible to tell whether it was male or female she began to walk more quickly wanting to be inside again behind closed doors it was foolish she knew it was just someone watching the beach at sunset and she simply happened to be on the beach but the sensation of belng watched of being studied stayed with her and hurried lier steps toward home shed spotted him and that only made it more exciting hed frightened her just by being there chuckling softly he continued to frame kirby in the telephoto lens snapping methodically as she rushed along the beach she had a beautiful body it had been a pleasure to watch the wind plaster her shirt and slacks to it outline the curves the sunlight had glowed on her hair turning it a rich burning gold as the sun had dipped lower at his back all the tones and hues had deepened softoned he was pleased that hed used color film this time oh and that look in her eyes when shed realized someone was there the lens had brought her so close hed nearly been able to see her pupils dilate such pretty green eyes he thought they suited her just as the swing of blond hair suited her and that soft soothing voice he wondered what her breasts would taste like shed be a hot one in the sack he decided snapping quickly before she disappeared around the dunes the small delicate types usually were once you got them revving he imagined she thought she knew all there was to know about anatomy but he figured he could show her some tricks oh yes he could show the lady doctor a few things he remembered an excerpt from the journal that seemed to fit the moment and his mood the rape of annabelle i experimented allowing myself full range to do things to her that i have never done to another woman she wept tears streaming down her cheeks and dampening the gag i bad her agatn again it was beyond me to stop it wasnt sex was no longer rape it was unbearable power yes it was the power he wanted the full scope of it which he had not achieved with ginny because ginny had been defective he reminded himself she had been whore instead of angel and a poor choice if he decided toif he decided he needed just a little more practice before the main cyentyirby with her pretty eyes and angel hands would be a fine subject she would work out just fine something to think about he mused something to consider but for now he thought hed wander toward sanctuary and see if jo ellen was out and about it was nearly time to remind her he was thinking about her gaff drove up the road to sanctuary he saw lexy she stood on the second floor terrace her long legs prettily displayed in cuffed cotton shorts her hair bundled messily on top of her head she was washing windows which he was sure would have her in one of her less hospitable moods as appealing a picture as she made she would have to wait he needed to talk to brian she saw gaff park his pickup but barely spared him a glance her smile was smug as she polished off the mixture of vinegar and water with newspaper until the windowpane shone shed known he would come around though it had taken him longer than shed expected but she decided to forgive himafter he crawled just a little she bent to soak her rag again turning her head a bit slanting her eyes over and down then sprang straight up when she saw gaff was heading not toward the house and her but toward the old smokehouse where brian was painting porch furniture why that rattlesnake she thought slapping the cleaning solution on the next window if he was waiting for her to come to him he was going to be sorely disappointed shed never forgive him now not if she lived to be a thousand years old he could crawl over hot coals she thought furiously polishing the window he could beg and plead and call her name on his deathbed and she would laugh gaily and walk on from this moment on giffverdon meant less than nothing to her she picked up her bucket and moved three windows down so she could keep an eye on him at the moment lexy and her moods werent at the forefront of gaffs mind he caught the oversweet smell of fresh paint heard the hiss of the sprayer he worked up a smile as he rounded the stone corner of the smokehouse and saw brian little dots of seablue paint freckled his arms to past the elbows polkadotted the old jeans he wore an armygreen tarp was spread out and covered with chaises and chairs brian was giving the old glider a second coat nice color gaff called out brian moved the nozzle slowly back and forth another stroke before disengaging it you know cousin kate every few years she wants something differentand always ends up going with blue freshens them up nice though it does brian flicked the motor off set the sprayer down shes ordered new umbrellas for the tables pads for the chairs should be in on the ferry in another day or two she wants the picnic tables painted over at the campground too i can take care of that if you dont have time ill probably do it brian rolled his shoulders free of kinks gets me out in the air gives me some daydreaming time hed just been having a nice one too replaying his night with yirby he knew he would never think of a stethoscope in quite the same way again hows that porch coming got the screening in the truck the weather looks like its going to hold so i should be finished by end of the week like miss kate wanted good ill try to come by and take a look at it hows the hand doing gaff asked nodding toward the bandage oh frowning brian flexed his fingers a little stiff is all brian didnt ask how gaff had heard about it news simply floated on the is lands airespecially the juiciest tidbits the fact was he considered it a wonder no one knew that hed spent most of the night on the good doctors examining table you and doc yirby huh what you and doc kirby gaff adjusted his cap my cousin ned was down to the beach early this morning you know how he collects sheers polishes them up and sells them off to daytrippers down to the ferry seems he saw you leaving the docs this morning about daybreak you know how ned runs his mouth so much for wonders brian mused yeah i do how long did it take him to pass the news well amused gaff rubbed his chin i was heading down to the ferry to see if the screen came in saw ned on shell road and gave him a lift that would make it oh about fifty minutes give or take neds slowing down well hes getting up in age you know be eightytwo come september doc kirbys a fine woman giff added dont know anybody on the island doesnt think high of her or you bri weve spent a few evenings together brian muttered and crouched down to rub the nozzle tip with a rag people shouldnt start smelling orange blossoms gaff lifted a brow didnt say they were were just seeing each other some okay nobodys thinking about making it a permanent relationship or tangling it up with strings giff waited a moment you trying to convince me bri or is somebody else here im just saying brian caught himself lifting his hands as if to signal himself to call a halt he straightened again and tried not to be irritated by the bland and innocent smile on giffs face did you come by here just to congratulate me on sleeping with yirby or is there something else on your mind gaffs smile faded ginny brian sighed discovered that the tension balled dead center at the back of his neck couldnt be rubbed away the cops called here this morning i guess they talked to you too didnt have squat to say i dont think theyd have bothered to call if i hadnt been hassling them damn it brian you know theyre not looking for her theyre barely going through the motions i wish i could tell you different they said we could make up flyers hand them out around in savannah what the hell good is that next to none giff i wish i knew what to say to you but you know ginnys twentysix years old and free to come and go as she pleases thats how the cops look at it thats the wrong way to look at it ginny has family here she has a home and friends no way shed have taken off without a word to anyone sometimes brian said slowly people do things you never expect they would do never believe they could do but they do them just the same ginnys not your mama brian im sorry this brings back a bad time for you and your family but this is now this is ginny its not the same no its not brian forced himself to keep his voice and his term per even ginny didnt have a husband and three children if she decided to shake the sand out of her shoes she wasnt leaving lives broken behind her now ill keep talking to the police ill see theyre called at least once a week to keep ginny in their heads well make up the flyers for you in the office i just cant do any more than that gaff im not having my life turned inside out a second time thats fine gaff nodded stiffly thats fine then ill get out of your way so you can go about your business fury lengthened his stride as he stalked back to the truck he climbed in slammed the door behind him then just lowered his head onto the steering wheel hed been wrong all the way wrong sniping at brian that way going stiff and snooty on him it wasnt brians fault or his responsibility and it wasnt right gaff added as he sat back and closed his eyes for a friend to cut into another that way hed just give himself a moment to calm and to settle then hed go back and apologize lexy sauntered out of the house shed streaked down the inside stairs nearly breaking her neck in her hurry to be sure gaff didnt drive off before she could taunt him with what he couldnt have and her heart was still racing but she moved slowly now one hand trailing along the banister a distant smile on her face she moseyed up to the truck and forgetting that her hands smelled of vinegar propped them on the bottom of the open window why hello there giff i was about to take a little walk in the woods to cool off and saw your truck he opened his eyes looked into hers go on then lexy he murmured and leaned over to turn the key what is it the misery in his eyes was a balm for her soul you feeling poorly giflp maybe youre feeling blue she trailed a fingertip up his arm maybe youre wishing you knew how to apologize to me so you wouldnt be so lonely these days his eyes remained dark but the shadows in them shifted from misery to temper he pushed her hand aside you know what alexa even my limited little world doesnt revolve only around you youve got your nerve thinking you can talk to me that way if you think i care what your world revolves around giff youre very mistaken i couldnt care less right now that makes two of us get away from the truck i will not not until ive had my say i dont give a damn what you have to say now back off before you get hurt she did just the opposite stretching through the open window to turn the key and shut the engine down dont you order me around she stuck her face in his dont you think for one minute you can tell me what to do or threaten me into doing it she sucked in a breath prepared to scold him properly but there was misery in his eyes again more than shed ever seen or expected to her temper subsided and she laid a hand on his cheek whats the matter honey whats hurting you he started to shake his head but she kept her hand in place we can be mad at each other later you talk to me now tell me whats wrong ginny he let out an explosive breath that scalded his throat not a word from her lexy not a single word i dont know what to do anymore what to say to my family anymore i dont even know how to feel i know she slipped back opened the door come on ive got work to do you do what i say for once in your life now come on with me she took his hand tugging until he climbed out saying nothing she led him around the side of the house toward the shade sit down here she drew him down on the side of the rope hammock and slipping an arm around him nudged his head down to her shoulder you just rest your mind a minute i dont think about it all the time he murmured you go crazy if you do i know reaching around she took his hand in hers it just sneaks up on you now and again and it hurts so much you dont think you can stand it but you do till the next time i know what people are saying she just got a wild hair and took off itd be easier if i could believe that it wouldnt not really it hurts either way when mama left i cried and cried for her i figured if i cried enough shed hear me and come back when i got older i thought well she just didnt care enough about me so i wont care either i stopped crying but it still hurt all the same i keep thinking shell send some stupid postcard from disney world or somewhere then i could just be mad at her instead of so goddamn worried lexy tried to imagine that let herself see it perfect ginny on some colorful foolish ride howling with laughter itd be just like her to do that i guess it would he stared down at their joined hands watching their fingers interlace i just tore a strip off brian over it stupid dont you worry about that brians hides thick enough to take it how about yours he eased back absently pushing a loosened bobby pin back into her messy topknot all us hathaways are tougher than we look im sorry anyway he lifted their joined hands and kissed her knuckles do we have to be mad at each other later i guess not she kissed him lightly then smiled the birds were singing in the trees above her and the flowers smelled so nice and sweet on the air since ive been missing you just a little bit her breath caught as he pulled her close pressed his face hard against her throat i need you lexy i need you when she released her breath it was unsteady shuddering from lungs to throat to lips she put her hands on his shoulders her fingers pressing once into those hard muscles then she pulled back rose struggling to grip her own emotions as firmly shed turned her back on him gaff rubbed his hands over his face then dropped them helplessly what did i say now what is it i do that always makes you take that step back from me im not she had to press her fingers to her lips to stop them from trembling before she faced him again when she did her heart was swimming in her eyes in my whole life my whole life giff no ones ever said that to me unless it was a man meaning sex he got to his feet fast thats not what i meant lexy i know she blinked impatiently at the tears she wanted to see him clearly i know its not what you meant and im not stepping back im just trying to get hold of myself before i act like a fool i love you lexy he said it quietly so she would believe him i always have and always will love you she closed her eyes tight she wanted it all engraved on her memory the momentevery sound every scent every feeling then she was launching herself into his arms wrapping herself around him her breath coming in tiny little hitches that made her dizzy hold me hold on to me giff tight no matter what i do no matter what i say dont ever let me go alexa swamped by her he pressed his lips into her hair ive always held on to you you just didnt know it i love you too gaff i cant remember when i didnt it always made me so mad thats all right honey he smiled snuggled her closer i dont mind you being mad as long as you dont stop in her bedroom jo carefully hung up the phone bobby banes had finally gotten in touch and had given her at least one answer he hadnt taken the print from her apartment butyou saw the print didnt you it was a nude mixed tn with all the shots of me it looked like me but it wasnt i was holding it i picked it up you must have seen it she could hear her own voice pitching into panic and the concern and hesitation in bobbys when he answered im sorry lo i didnt ec a print like that just those ones of you ab there wasnt any nude study at least i didnt notice it was there i dropped it fullfacedown on the other prints it was there bobby just think for a minute it must have been there i mean if you say you saw it his tone had been placating she thought now sympathetic but it hadnt been convinced sick and shaky she turned away from the phone told herself it was useless to wish he hadnt called hadnt told her it was better much better to have the truth all she had to do now was live with it from her bedroom window jo looked down on her sister and giff they made a pretty picture she decided two young healthy people locked in each others arms with flowers growing wild and ripe all around them a man and woman sparkling with love and sexual anticipation on a summer afternoon it looked so easy so natural why couldnt she let it be easy and natural for herself nathan wanted her he wasnt pushing he didnt appear to be angry that she kept that last bit of distance between them and why did she jo wondered watching as gaff tipped lexys face up to his why didnt she just let go he stirred her he brought her pleasure and set something to simmering inside her that hinted the pleasure would spread and deepen if she allowed it why was she afraid to allow it in disgust she turned away from the window because she questioned everything these days she watched her own moves analyzed them clinically oh she felt better physically the nightmares and slickskinned panic attacks were fewer and farther between but there was always that doubt the fear that she wasnt really stable why else could she still see in her mind that photograph the photograph of the dead woman one minute her mother the next herself the eyes staring the skin white as wax she could still see the texture of the skin smooth and pale the shades and sweep of the hair that artfully spread wave of it the way the hand had been draped elbow bent arm crossed between the breasts and the head turned angled down as in shy slumber how could she see it so clearly when it had never existed and because she could she had to believe she was still far from well she had no business even considering a relationship with nathanwith anyoneuntil she was solidly on her feet again and that she admitted was just an excuse she was afraid of himthat was the bottom line she was afraid he would come to mean more to her than she could handle and that he would expect more of her than she could give he was already drawing feelings out of her that no one else ever had so she was protecting herself with cowardice that wore a mask of logic she was tired of being logical and afraid would it be so wrong to take a page out of her sisters book for once to act on impulse to take whatever she could get god she needed someone to talk to someone to be with someone who could even for a little while crowd out all these selfdoubts and worries why shouldnt it be nathan she rushed out of her room before she could change her mind and for once didnt even bother to grab her camera she paused impatiently when kate called out her name im just heading out jo stopped at the door to the office kate was behind a desk covered with papers and brochures trying to get ahead of the fall reservations kate pulled a pencil out from behind her ear weve got a request to have a wedding here at the inn in october weve never done that kind of thing before they want brian to do the catering have the ceremony and reception right here it would be just wonderful if we could figure out how to do it that would be nice kate im really on my way out sorry she stuck the pencil back behind her ear and smiled distractedly lost my train again ive been doing that all morning ive got your mail here i was going to drop it off in your room then the phone rang and i havent budged from this spot in two hours as if to punctuate the statement the phone tingled again and behind her the second line beeped signaling an incoming fax if its not one thing its two i swear there you go honey you got a package there she picked up the phone sanctuary inn may i help you jo heard nothing but the beehive buzz in her own ears she stepped forward slowly could feel the air around her thickening like water the manila envelope felt stiff in her hand when she reached for it her name had been printed on it in block letters in thick black marker jo ellen hathaway sanctuary lost desire island georgia the warning in the corner stated clearly photos do not bend dont open it she told herself throw it in the trash dont look inside but her fingers were already tearing at the seal ripping open the flap she didnt hear kates exclamation of surprise as she upended the envelope shaking the photographs out onto the floor with a lit the keening sound jo dropped to her knees shoving through them pushing one after another aside in a desperate search for one the one without hesitation kate hung up on the reservation she was taking and rushed around the desk jo what is it jo ellen whats wrong what is all this she demanded holding jo under one arm as she stared at dozens of pictures of her young cousin hes been here hes been here here jo scrambled through the photos again there she was walking on the beach asleep in the hammock on the edge of the dune swale setting up her tripod at the salt marsh but where was the one where was the one its got to be here its got to alarmed kate hauled jo up to her knees and shook her stop it now i want you to stop it this minute because she recognized the signs she dragged jo over to a chair pushed her into it then shoved her head between her knees you just breathe thats all you do dont you go fainting on me you sit right there you hear me you sit right there and dont you move she rushed into the bathroom to run a glass of water and dampen a cloth when she dashed back in jo was just as shed left her relieved kate knelt down and laid the cold cloth on the back of jos neck there now just take it easy im not going to faint jo said dully thats fine news to me ill tell you sit back now slowly drink a little water she brought the glass to jos lips herself held it there grateful when color gradually seeped back into them can you tell me what this is all about now the photos jo sat back closed her eyes i didnt get away i didnt get away after all from what honey from who i dont know i think im going crazy thats nonsense kate made her voice sharp and impatient i dont know that it is its already happened once what do you mean she kept her eyes closed it would be easier to say it that way i had a breakdown a few months ago oh jo ellen kate eased down onto the arm of the chair and began to stroke jos hair why didnt you tell me youd been sick honey i just couldnt thats all everything just got to be too much and i couldnt hold on anymore the pictures started to come pictures like these pictures of me just pictures of my eyes at first just my eyes or her eyes she thought with a shudder our eyes thats horrible it must have frightened you so it did then i told myself someone was just trying to get my attention so id help them break into photography thats probably just what it was but it was a terrible way to do it you should have gone to the police and tell them that someone was sending me a photographer pictures jo opened her eyes again i thought i could handle it just ignore it just deal with it then an envelope like that one came in the mail full of pictures of me and one one i thought was of someone else but it wasnt jo said fiercely she was going to accept that if nothing else she was going to accept that one thing i imagined it it wasnt there at all just those pictures of me dozens of them and i fell apart then you came back here i had to get away i thought i could get away but i cant these are from here right here on the island hes been right here watching me and these are going to the police simmering with fiery kate rose to snatch up the envelope postmarks savannah three days ago what good will it do kate we wont know that till we do it he could still be in savannah or anywhere else he could be back on the island she ran her hands through her hair then let them drop into her lap are we going to ask the police to question everyone with a camera if necessary what kind of camera kate demanded where and how were they developed when were they taken there ought to be a way of figuring some of that out its better than sitting here being scared isnt it snap your backbone in place jo ellen i just want it to go away then make it go away kate said fiercely im ashamed youd let someone do this to you and not put up a fight kate snatched up a photo held it out when was this taken look at it figure it out jos stomach churned as she stared at it her palms were damp as she reached out and took the photo the shot was slightly out of focus she noted the angle of light was poor casting a bad shadow across her body he was capable of much better work she thought then let out a long breath it helped to think practically even to critique i think he rushed this one the marsh at this spot is fairly open obviously he didnt want me to know he was taking pictures so he hurried through it good good girl now when were you down there last just a couple of days ago but i didnt take the tripod her brow furrowed as she concentrated this had to be at least two weeks back no three three weeks ago i went out at low tide to do some studies of the tidal pools let me see another print i know its difficult for you but i like this one she tried a bolstering smile as she offered jo a photo of herself cradled in sams lap shade dappled over the in in patterns making the study almost dreamy the campground jo murmured the day i was locked in the showers and daddy let me out it wasnt kids the bastard it wasnt kids it was him he locked me in there then he waited around and he took this that was the day ginny went missing wasnt it nearly two weeks now jo knelt on the floor again but she wasnt panicking now her hands were steady her mind focused she went through photo by photo coolly i cant be sure of each and every one but those i can pinpoint were all taken at least that long ago so ill assume they all were nothing in the last two weeks hes held on to them hes waited why he needed time to print them to select them to decide which ones to send he must have other obligations a job something no i think hes very flexible there he had pictures of me on assignment at hatteras and others of me in charlotte daytoday stuff he isnt worried about obligations all right get your purse were going to get the boat and go over to the mainland were taking this all of this to the police youre right thats better than sitting here being afraid very carefully she slipped photo after photo back into the envelope im sorry kate for what for not telling you for not trusting you enough to tell you about what happened and you should be she reached out a hand to help jo to her feet but thats done now and behind us from now on you and every one else in this house are going to remember were a family i dont know why you put up with us sweetie pie kate smiled and patted jos cheek there are times when i wonder the selfsame thing where yall going lexy spotted kate and jo as they stepped out the side door her eyes were bright her e brilliant she was nearly dane smiling jo and i have to run over to the mainland on some business kate began well be back by im going with you lexy raced through the door zipping by before kate could grab her arm lexy this isnt a pleasure trip five minutes lexy called back its only going to take me five minutes to get ready that girl kate heaved a sigh shes always wanting to be someplace shes not ill go tell her she has to stay behind no jo tightened her grip on the pair of envelopes she held under the circumstances it might be better if she knows whats going on i think until we find out something more she needs to be careful kates heart skipped a beat but she nodded i suppose youre right ill tell brian were going dont you worry sweetie late flicked a hand over jos hair were going to take care of this because she was afraid of being left behind lexy was true to her word she knew kate would have balked at the little shorts shed had on so she changed in record time to thin cotton pants she brushed her hair out tied it back in a mintgreen scarf in anticipation of the boat trip on the drive to sanctuarys private dock north of the ferry she freshened her makeup and chattered jos ears were ringing by the time they boarded the reliable old cabin cruiser once there had been a glossy white boat with bright red trim the island belle had been her fathers pride and joy jo remembered how many times had the family piled into it to sail around the island to streak out over the waves to take an impromptu run to the mainland for ice cream or a movie she remembered steering it standing on her fathers feet to give her a little more height with his hands laid lightly over hers on the wheel a little to starboard jo ellen thats the way youre a natural but sam had sold it the year after annabelle went away all the replacements since had gone unnamed the family no longer took dizzying rides together still jo knew the routine she checked the fuel while lexy and kate released the lines automatically she adjusted her stance to accommodate the slight sway at the dock her hands took the wheel easily and she smiled when the engine caught with a kick and a purr daddy still keeps her running smooth i see he overhauled the engine over the winter kate took a seat and her agitated fingers twisted the gold chain that draped over her crisp cotton blouse she would let jo pilot she thought it would help her stay calm ive been thinking the inn should invest in a new one something spitter to look at we could offer tours around the island stop off at wild horse cove egret inlet that sort of thing course that means wed have to hire on a pilot daddy knows the island and the water around it better than anyone jo pointed out i know kate shrugged her shoulders but whenever i bring that up he mutters under his breath and finds something else he has to do sam setinhisways hathaway is not an easy man to move you could tell him how hed be able to keep an eye on things better if he was in charge jo glanced at the compass set her heading and started across the sound he could make sure people didnt trample the vegetation or upset the ecosystem put someone else on it theyre not going to care as much be as vigilant its a good angle you buy a new boat hell have a hard time resisting it lexy readjusted the knot in her scarf then you mention how you need to find the right pilotnot only one whos experienced and competent but somebody who understands the fragility of the environment and how it needs to be explained to the tourists so they understand why desire has stayed pure all these years both jo and kate turned to stare at lexy in astonishment lexy spread her hands you just have to know how to work people is all you talk about educating the tourists on respecting the island and leaving it as they found it and that sort of thing hell not only come around hell end up thinking it was his idea to start with youre a sly child alexa late told her ive always admired that about you the islands what matters to daddy lexy leaned over the rail to let the wind slap her face using that to turn him around isnt sly its just basic cant you go any faster jo i could swim to savannah at this rate jo started to suggest that lexy do just that then shrugged why not why not go fast and free for just a little while she glanced back at the shoreline of desire the white house on the hill then she gunned the throttle hold on then at the burst of speed lexy let out a whoop then threw back her head and laughed oh god but she loved going places going anywhere faster jo you always handled these buckets better than any of us and she hasnt manned a boat in two years kate began then shrieked as jo whipped the wheel around shooting the boat into a fast wide circle heart thumping she grabbed the rail while lexy shouted out for more look there its jed pendletons fishing boat lets buzz them jo give them a taste of our wake and rock them good jo ellen youll do no such thing kate conquered the laugh that sprang to her throat you behave yourself jo shared a rare grin with lexy before she rolled her eyes yes maam she murmured tongue in cheek and cut her speed she sent out a short hail to the fishing boat i was just testing her engines and response well now you have kate said primly and i expect itll be a smooth ride from here on i just want to get there lexy turned around and leaned back on the rail im dying to see people walking around and ive just got to do some shopping why dont we all buy something new and pretty party dresses then well have us a party get all dressed up have music and champagne i havent had a new dress in months thats because your closets already bursting at the seams jo said oh those are ancient dont you ever have to have something newjust have to something wonderful well i have been wanting a new dedicated flash jo told her dryly thats because youre more interested in dressing your camera than yourself lexy tilted her head something bold and blue for you for a change silk with silk undies too that way if you ever let nathan get down to them hell have a nice surprise bet you would too alexa kate held up a hand and counted slowly to ten your sisters private life is just thatprivate what private life why the mans been dying to get inside those baggy jeans she wears since he laid eyes on her how do you know he hasnt jo shot back because lexy said with a slow feline smile once he has youre going to be a whole lot more relaxed if all it takes to relax a woman is a quick roll youd be comatose by now lexy only laughed and turned her head back into the wind well im sure feeling serene these days honey pie which is more than i can say for you lexy thats enough kate spoke quietly then rose and were not going to the mainland to shop were going because your sisters got troubles she wanted you to come along so she could tell you about it so those troubles wont touch on you what are you talking about lexy straightened whats wrong sit down kate ordered and picked up the envelopes jo had stowed and well tell you ten minutes later lexy was going through the photos her stomach was tight but her hands were steady and her mind was working hes stalking you i dont know if id call it that jo kept her eyes on the water on the faint haze that was the mainland its exactly that and thats how youre going to put it to the police there are laws against it i knew a woman up in new york her exboyfriend wouldnt leave her be kept popping up calling her following her around she lived scared for six months before they did something about it its not right you should have to live scared she knew who he was jo pointed out well you have to figure out who this is because the pictures spooked her lexy set them aside did you break up with anybody close to the time this started no i havent been seeing anyone in particular you dont have to think it was in particular lexy reminded her he has to think it who were you datingeven one date nobody jo you had dinner with someone went to a show had a quick lunch not dates dont be so literal problem with you is everythings just black and white in your head just like your pictures even those have shades of gray dont they not entirely sure if she was insulted or impressed by her sisters analogy jo frowned i just dont see exactly lexy nodded you think up a list then you think of another for men you turned down when they asked you out maybe somebody asked you a couple three times and you figured he gave up ive been busy this past year theres hardly anyone thats good itll make the odds better on finding the right one lexy crossed her legs put herself into forming the plotline maybe theres someone in your building in charlotte who tried to draw you out make conversation when you bumped into each other in the hallway open your mind now lexy said impatiently a woman knows when a mans got an interest in her even if shes got none in him i havent paid much attention well pay attention now and think youre the one who has to stay in control here youre not going to let him know hes got you scared youre not going to give him the satisfaction of thinking he can put you in a hospital again she reached over gave jos shoulder a hard shake so you think youve always been the smartest one of us use your head now jo gently kate pried jos tensed hands away you sit down take a breath she can breathe later right now shes going to think lexy ease off no jo shook her head no shes right youre right she said to lexy taking a good long look at the sister shed allowed herself to think of as fluff this time what she saw was substance and youre asking the right questionsones i never thought to ask myself when i go to the police theyre going to ask the same ones i expect they are okay jo let out an unsteady breath help me out thats what im doing lets sit down she took jos arm sat with her now first think about the men there arent many i dont draw them like bees to honey you would if you wanted to but thats another problem lexy waved it away with a flick of her hand something to be solved later maybe theres one you come into contact with regularly you dont pay much attention but you see him he sees you the only man i see regularly is my intern bobby was the one who took me to the hospital he was there when the last package came in the mail well isnt that handy jos eyes widened bobby thats ridiculous why you said he was your intern that means hes a photographer too hed know how to use a camera develop film i bet he knew where youd be and what your schedule was whenever you were on assignment of course but sometimes he went with you didnt he as part of his training sure and maybe he has a thing for you thats just silly he had a little crush at first really lexy lifted a brow did you accommodate him hes twenty years old so lexy shrugged it off okay you didnt sleep with him he was a regular part of your life he was attracted to you he knew where youd be he knew your routine and he knew how to use a camera goes to the top of the short list id say it was appalling even more appalling than the faceless nameless bilities he took care of me he got me to the hospital possibly he said he hadnt seen the print jo remembered as her stomach muscles fisted painfully it had been only the two of them there and he said he hadnt seen it does he know you came back to sanctuary yes i jo cut herself off closed her eyes yes he knows where i am oh god he knows where i am i just talked to him this morning he just called me why did he call you lexy demanded what did he say to you id left a message for him to get in touch with me something i i needed to ask him something he got back to me today where was he calling from kate flicked a quick glance over her shoulder i didnt askhe didnt say with a supreme effort jo reined in the thudding fear it doesnt make any sense for bobby to have sent the prints ive been working with him for months thats just the kind of relationship the police are going to be interested in lexy insisted who else knows where you arethat youre sure of my publisher jo lifted a hand to rub her temple the post office the super at my apartment building the doctor who treated me at the hospital that means anybody who wanted to know could find out but bobby stays top of the list that makes me feel sick sick and disloyal and its logical pausing she squeezed the bridge of her nose between her thumb and fingers hes good enough to have taken the shotsif he worked at it took his time hes got a lot of potential he still makes mistakes thoughrushes or doesnt make the right choices in the darkroom that could explain why some of the photos arent as highquality as others whats wrong with them curious lexy slipped some of the prints out again some of them have hard shadows or the framings off see here she pointed to the shadow falling over her shoulder in one or this one its not crisp the tones arent well defined some are molded in a way id say means he used fast film then overenlarged or some are thinunderexposed negatives she explained and others just lack creativity seems pretty picky to me you look good in most all of them they arent as carefully composed certainly not as artfully composed as the others as the ones taken in charlotte or on hatteras in fact she began to frown as she went through them again shot by shotif im remembering right it looks to me as though the later the photo was taken the less professional the less creative it is as if hes getting boredor careless see here a firstyear student with some talent and decent equipment could have taken this shot of me in the hammock the subject is relaxed unaware the lights good because its filtering through the trees its an easy shot its already laid out but this one the beach shot he should have used a yellow filter to cut the glare soften the shadows define the clouds thats basic but he didnt bother you lose texture drama its a careless mistake he never made them before quickly she pulled photos out of the other envelope heres another beach shot from hatteras this time similar angle but he used a filter he took his time the texture of the sand the lift of my hair in the wind the position of the gull just heading out over the waves good cloud definition its a lovely shot really a solid addition for a show or gallery whereas the one from home is washed out was bobby on assignment with you there on hatteras no i worked alone but theres a lot of people on hatteras compared to desire you might not have noticed him especially if he wore a disguise a disguise oh lexy dont you think id have clued in if i saw some guy walking around in groucho glasses and a funny nose with the right makeup a wig different body language i could walk right up to you on the street and you wouldnt recognize me its not that hard to be someone else she smiled i do it all the time it could have been this intern of yours or half a dozen people you know dye the hair wear a hat sunglasses put facial hair on or take it off all we know for sure is that he was there and he was here jo nodded slowly and he could be back ye ah lexy put a hand over jos but now were all going to be watching out for him jo looked at the hand covering hers it shouldnt have surprised her she realized to find it there to find it firm and warm i should have told both of you before i should have told all of you before i wanted to handle it myself now theres news lexy said lightly cousin kate jo says she wanted to handle something herself can you imagine that the original get out of my way ill do it myself girl wanted to handle something on her own very clever jo muttered i didnt give you enough credit cit heir for being willing to be there more news kate lexy kept her eyes on jos why the bulletins just keep pouring in jo didnt give me enough credit for being an intelligent human being with a little compassion not that she or anyone else ever has but thats the latest flash coming off the wire id forgotten how good you are at sarcasmand since i probably deserved both those remarks i wont ruin it by proving im better at sarcasm than you can ever hope to be before lexy could speak jo turned her hand over and linked her fingers with lexys i was ashamed almost as much as i was scared i was ashamed that id had a breakdown the last people i wanted to know about that were my family sympathy flooded lexy still she kept a smirk on her face and in her voice why thats just foolish jo ellen were southerners we admire little else more than we admire our family lunatics hiding crazy relations in the attics a yankee trait isnt that so cousin kate amused and bursting with pride in her youngest chick kate glanced back over her shoulder it is indeed lexy a good southern family props up its crazies and puts them on display in the front parlor along with the best china her own quick laugh made jo ellen blink in surprise im not a lunatic not yet lexy gave her hand a friendly squeeze but if you keep going you could be right on up there with greatgranny lida shes the one as i recollect wore the spangled evening dress day and night and claimed fred astaire was coming by to take her dancing put a little effort into it you could aspire to that jo laughed again and this time it was long and rich maybe well go shopping after all and ill see if i can find a spangled evening dress just in case blues your color and because she knew it was easier for her than for jo lexy wrapped her arms around her sister and hugged hard i forgot to tell you something jo ellen whats that welcome home i it was after six before they got back to sanctuary theyd gone shopping after all and were loaded down with the bags and boxes to prove it kate was still asking herself how shed let lexy talk her into that frantic ninetyminute shopping spree but she already knew the answer after the hour spent in the police station theyd all needed to do something foolish when they came in through the kitchen she was already prepared for brians tirade he took one look at them the cyidcnce of their betrayal heaped in their arms and snarled well thats just dandy isnt it thats just fine ive got six tables already filled in the dining room im up to my elbows in cooking and the three of you go off shopping i had to drag sissy brodie in here to wait tables and she hasnt got any more than a spoonful of sense daddys mixing drinkswhich were giving them the hell away to make up for the poor serviceand i just burned two orders of chicken because i had to go in there and mop up after that peabrained sissy dumped a plate of shrimp fettuccine alfredo on becky fitzsimmonss lap becky fitzsimmons is in there and you got sissy waiting on her tickled down to her toes lexy set her bags aside dont you know brian hathaway sissy and becky are desperate enemies since they tagled over jesse pendleton who was sleeping with then both nearly at the same time for six months then sissy found out and she marched right up to becky outside church after easter services and called her a nogood toadfaced whore took three strong men to pull them apart reliving the scene with gusto lexy pulled the scarf loose and shook her hair free why a plate of shrimp fettuccines nothing youre lucky sissy didnt take up one of your carving knives there and go after becky good and proper brian drew a breath for patience im counting my blessings right now get your pad and get your butt in there youre already an hour late for your shift its my fault brian jo began and braced herself for the attack when he whirled on her i needed lexy and i suppose we lost track of time i dont have the luxury of losing track of anything and i dont need you standing in my kitchen taking up for her when shes too irresponsible to do what shes supposed to he rattled the lid off the chicken breast he was sauteing and flipped the meat and i dont want you trying to smooth it all over he said to kate i dont have time to listen to excuses i wouldnt dream of offering any kate said stiffly in fact i wouldnt dream of wasting my breath on someone who speaks to me in that manner she jerked her chin up and sailed into the dining room to help sam with bartending duties it was my fault brian jo said again kate and lexy dont bother lexy waved a hand breezily to mask her simmering temper he isnt about to listenhe knows all there is to know anyway she snatched up a pad and stomped through the door flighty irresponsible bubblehead brian muttered dont talk about her that way shes none of those things what is this suddenly the two of you have bonded over the discount rack at the department store women buy shoes together and all at once theyre soul mates you dont think much of the species do you well it was women i needed and women who were there for me if we were a little later getting back than suits you suits me he flipped the chicken onto a plate clenching his teeth as he concentrated on adding side dishes and garnishes damned if hed have women destroying his presentation this isnt about what suits me its about running a business holding on to the reputation weve been building up here for twentyfive years its about being left in the lurch with close to twenty people wanting a good meal served in a pleasant and efficient manner its about keeping your word all right youve every right to be angry but be angry with me im the one who dragged them off today dont worry he filled a basket with fresh steaming hush puppies im plenty angry with you she looked at the pots steaming on the stove the vegetables already chopped on the cutting board dishes were piling up in the sink and brian was working awkwardly hampered by his injured hand left in the lurch was exactly right she decided and it had been poorly done by all of them what can i do to help i could get these dishes you can stay out of my way he said without looking at her thats what youre best at isnt it she absorbed the hit accepted the guilt yes i suppose it is she slipped quietly out the back door sanctuary wasnt barred to her she thought not as it had been in her dreams but the road to and away from it was forever rocky and full of potholes and brian was right shed always been expert at staying away at leaving the pleasures and the problems that brewed in that house to others she wasnt even sure she wanted it to be otherwise she cut through the forest if someone was watching her let him watch let him snap his goddamn pictures until his fingers went numb she wasnt going to live her life afraid she hoped he was there she hoped he was close that he would show himself now this minute she stopped turned in a slow circle her face grim as she scanned the deep green shadows a confrontation would suit her mood perfectly there was nothing she would enjoy better than a good sweaty physical fight im stronger than you think she said aloud and listened to the furious tone of her own voice echo back why dont you come out face to face and find out you bastard she grabbed a stick thudded it against her palm you son of a bitch you think you can scare me with a bunch of secondrate photographs she whipped the stick against a tree pleased by the way the shock wave sang up her arm a woodpecker sprang from the trunk above her and bulleted away your composition sucked your lighting was awful what you know about capturing mood and texture wouldnt fill a thimble ive seen better work from a tenyearold with a disposable kodak her jaw set she waited eager to see someone anyone step out onto the path she wanted him to charge she wanted to make him pay but there was nothing but the whisper of wind through the leaves the clicking of palmetto fronds the light shifted dimming degree by degree now im talking to myself she murmured ill be as loony as greatgranny lida before im thirty at this rate she tossed the stick watched it fly end over end arcing up then landing with a quiet thump in the thick brush she didnt see the worn sneaker inches from where it landed or the frayed cuffs of faded jeans when she walked deeper into the forest she didnt hear the strained sound of breathing struggling to even out or the harsh whisper that shook with raw emotion not yet jo ellen not yet not until im ready but now im going to have to hurt you now im going to have to make you sorry he straightened slowly considered himself in frill control he didnt even notice the blood that welled in his palms as he clenched his fists he thought he knew where she was going and familiar with the forest he cut through the trees to beat her there o didnt realize shed made up her mind to go to nathans until she was nearly there even as she stopped considered changing direction she heard the pad of footsteps adrenaline surged her fists clenched her muscles tensed she whirled more than ready to attack dusk settled around her dimming the light thickening the air overhead a slice of twilight moon hung in a sky caught between light and dark water lapped slyly at the high grass along the banks of the river with a rush of wind a heron rose soaring away from her and its post and nathan stepped out of the shadows he broke stride when he saw her then stopped a foot away his shoes and the frayed hem of his jeans were damp from the water grasses his hair tousled from the quickening breeze noting her ballsofthe feet fighting stance he raised an eyebrow looking for a fight she ordered her fingers to uncurl one by one i might be he stepped forward then tapped his fist lightly on her chin i say i could take you in two rounds want to go for it maybe some other time the blood that was singing in her ears began to quiet he had broad shoulders she mused a nice place to lay your headif you were the leaning sort brian kicked me out she said and tucked her hands in her pockets i was just out walking me too im done walking for a while the hand hed fisted uncurled and the fingers of it brushed over her hair how about you i havent decided why dont you come inside he took her hand toyed with her fingers think about it her gaze shifted from their hands to his eyes held steady there you dont want me to come inside and think nathan come in anyway had any dinner no ive still got those steaks he gripped her hand more firmly and led her toward the house why did brian kick you out kjtchen crisis my fault well i guess i wont ask you to help grill the steaks he stepped inside switched on the lights to cut the gloom about all i have to with them are some frozen fries and a white bordeaux sounds perfect to me can i use your phone i should call let them know i wont be back for a little bit help yourself nathan walked to the fridge got the steaks out of the freezer she was jumpy as a spring he thought taking the meat to the microwave to defrost it angry on top unhappy underneath he wondered why he had such a relentless need to find the reason for all three he listened to the murmur of her voice as he puzzled over the buttons on the microwave he was about to make an executive decision and hope for the best when she hung up the phone and came over this part i know she said and punched a series of buttons im an expert nuker i do better when the package comes with directions ill start the grill ive got some cds over there if you want music she wandered over to the stack of cds beside the clever little compact stereo on the end table beside the sofa it seemed he preferred straight nofrills rock with a mix of those early rebels mozart and beethoven she couldnt make up her mind couldnt seem to concentrate on the simple act of choosing between moonlight sonata and sympathy for the devil romance or heat she asked herself impatiently what do you want make up your damn mind what it is you want and just take it the fire shouldnt take long nathan began as he stepped back in wiping his hands on his jeans if you i had a breakdown she blurted out he lowered his hands slowly okay i figure you should know before this goes any farther than it already has i was in the hospital back in charlotte i had a collapse a mental collapse before i came back here i may be crazy her eyes were eloquent her lips pressed tight together nathan decided he had about five seconds to choose how to handle it how crazy like runningdownthestreetnakedandwarningpeopletorepent crazy or iwasabductedbyaliens crazy because im not entirely convinced all those abdijctedbyaliens types are actually crazy her mouth didnt exactly relax but it did fall open did you hear what i said yeah i heard you im just asking for clarification do you want a drink she closed her eyes maybe lunatics were attracted to lunatics i havent run naked in the streets yet thats good id have to think twice about this if you had because she started to pace he decided touching her wasnt the best next move he went back to the refrigerator to take out the wine and uncork it so were you abducted by aliens and if so do they really look like ross perot i dont understand you she muttered i dont understand you at all i spent two weeks under psychiatric evaluation i wasnt functioning he poured two glasses you seem to be functioning all right now he said mildly and handed her the wing a lot you know she gestured with the glass before drinking i came within an inch of having another breakdown today are you bragging or complaining then i went shopping she whirled away stalking around the room its not a sign of stability to teeter on the brink of an emotion crisis then go out and buy underwear what kind of underwear eyes narrowed she glared at him im trying to explain to you im listening he took a chance raising his hand to ski fingers over her cheek jo did you really think id react to this by backing off and telling you to go away maybe she let out the air clogging her lungs yes he pressed his lips to her brow and made her eyes sting then you are crazy sit down and tell me what happened i cant sit okay he leaned back against the kitchen table well stand what happened to you i it was a lot of things workrelated stress but that doesnt really bother me you can use stress it keeps you motivated focused pressures and deadlines ive always used them i like having my time designated my routine set out and followed i want to know when im getting up in the morning what im doing first and second and last well say spontaneity isnt your strong suit then one spontaneous act and everything else shifts how can you get a handle on it one spontaneous act he commented and lifes a surprise more complicated but often more interesting that may be true but i havent been looking for an interesting life she turned away i just wanted a normal one my world exploded once and ive never been able to pick up the pieces so i built another world i had to he tensed straightened and the wine that lingered on his tongue went sour is this because of your mother i dont know part of it must be the shrinks certainly thought so she was about my age when she left us the doctors found that very interesting she abandoned me was i repeating the cycle by abandoning myself she shook her head and turned back to him but it wasnt just that ive lived with that most of my life i coped damn it i made my choices and i went for it straight line no detours i liked what i was doing where i was going it satisfied me jo ellen what happened before what other people did no matter who they were to us cant destroy what we are what we have we cant let that happen what im telling myself every day i started having dreams ive always had very vivid dreams but these unnerved me i wasnt sleeping well or eating well i cant even remember if that started before or after the first pictures came mat pictures someone started sending me photographs of me just my eyes at first just my eyes she rubbed a hand over her arm to chase away the chill it was creepy i tried to ignore it but it didnt stop then there was a whole package dozens of photographs of me at home on assignment at the market everywhere i went hed been there watching me her hand rubbed slowly steadily over her speeding heart and i thought i saw more i hallucinated i panicked and i broke rage whipped through him one hard vicious lash some as hard was dogging you stalking you tormenting you and youre blaming yourself for crumbling his hands were steady now as he reached out for her pulled her against him i didnt face it stop it how much is anyone supposed to face the son of a bitch putting you through that he stared over her shoulder wishing viciously he had something to fight something to pummel whats the charlotte pd doing about it i didnt report it in charlotte her eyes went wide when he jerked her back widened still more when she saw the wild fury in his what the hell do you mean you didnt report it youre just going to let him get away with it just do nothing i had to get away i just wanted to get away from it i couldnt cope i could barely function when he became aware that his fingers were digging into her shoulders he let her go snatching up his glass he paced away from her and he remembered how shed looked when he first saw her on the island pale exhausted her eyes bruised and unhappy you needed sanctuary her breath came out in three jerks yes i suppose i did today i learned i hadnt found it hes been here resolutely she swallowed the fresh panic in her throat he mailed photos of me from savannah photos hed taken here on the island fresh fury clawed at him with hottipped fingers drawing on all of his control nathan turned slowly then well find him and well stop him i dont even know if hes still on the island if hell come back if i dont know why and thats the worst of it but im facing it now and im going to deal with it you dont have to deal with it along you matter to me jo ellen i wont let you deal with it alone youre going to have to face that too maybe thats why i came here maybe thats why i had to come here he set his wing down again so he could take her face in both hands i wont let anyone hurt you believe that she did a little too easily a little too strongly and tried to backpedal its good knowing youre on my side but i have to be able to handle this no he lowered his mouth gently to hers you dont her heart began to flutter in a different kind of panic the police said you went to the police today i she lost her train of thought for a moment as his mouth brushed hers again they said theyd look into it but they dont have a lot to look into i havent been threatened you feel threatened he ran his hands down to her shoulders over them thats more than enough were going to make that stop he skimmed his lips over her cheek along her temple into her hair im going to take care of you he murmured the words revolved in her spinning mind refused to settle what he doubted either one of them was ready to face what hed suddenly realized he needed to take care of her to soothe away those troubles to ease her heart and he needed to be sure that whatever he did wouldnt snap the thin threads of the relationship they were just beginning to weave put it aside for a little while take an evening to relax he ran his fingers up and down her spine once before drawing back to study her ive never seen anyone more in need of a rare steak and a glass of wine he was giving her time she realized that was good that was best she managed to smile it does sound pretty good it would be nice not to even think about all of this for an hour then ill put the steaks on you can dig out the fries and ill bore you to tears talking about this new project i have in mind you can try but i dont cry easily she turned to the freezer opened it then closed it again i dont like sex he stopped one step away from the microwave it was necessary to clear his throat before he could face her again excuse me obviously thats part of the package were putting together here jo linked her hands together it was best to be upfront about it she thought practical especially since the words were out and couldnt be taken back he really had to stop putting his wine down nathan decided and picking it up again he took one long slow sip you dont like sex i dont hate it she said pulling her fingers apart to wave a hand not like coconut coconut i really hate coconuteven the smell puts me off sex is more like i dont know tan sex is like tan im ambivalent about it uhhuh meaning take it or leave it if its there fine but why go out of your way her shoulders relaxed thats about it i thought i should ten you so you wouldnt build up any big expectations if we go to bed he ran his tongue over his teeth maybe you havent had any really wellprepared tan in your experience she laughed its all pretty much the same i dont think so he finished off his wine set the empty glass down her eyes went from amused to wary as he walked toward her and im compelled to debate the subject right now nathan that wasnt a challenge it was just a the words slid down her throat when he swept her off her feet wait a minute i was on the debate team in college it was a lie but he thought it too good a line to miss i havent said i was going to sleep with you what do you care he started down the short hallway youre ambivalent remember he laid her on the bed slid his body over hers and a little tan never hurt anybody i dont want ye s you do he lowered his mouth keeping only a breath between them so do i and i have right along youre in an honest mood tonight arent you jo tell me you dont wonder that you dont want his body was warm and solid his eyes clear and direct wonder thats good enough he crushed his mouth to hers the taste of it the sudden sharp demand of it pushed the worries out of her head grateful knowing he would expect no more than what she had she lifted her arms to wrap around him your mouth he scraped his teeth over that wonderfully overfull top lip christ ive wanted that mouth it drives me crazy she would have laughed nearly dd then his tongue was tangling hotly with hers and the unexpected burn streaked down to throb between her thighs it ook only her moan to have him diving deeper staggered she clenched her fists in his hair he hadnt kissed her like this before she hadnt known that the pressure of mouth to mouth could cause a thousand wild aches in a thousand places his hands stayed cupped around her face as though everything he wanted centered only there she moved under him a tremble then an arch of hips he had to tear his mouth from hers and press it to her throat to keep himself from rushing both of them the scent of her skin that zing of some early spring fragrance was another welcome shock to his system he lingered there tormenting them both until the pulse under his tongue was racing he was undoing her knot by knot moment by moment her body loosened the shifts and quakes inside her spreading building there was excitement in not being quite able to catch her breath not being quite sure where his mouth would travel next enchanted she ran her hands over his shoulders down his back pleased with the bunch and flow of male muscle under her fingers when his mouth came greedily back to hers she met it gratefully delighting in the edgy jolts that snapped through her system she arched again mildly frustrated with the barriers that prevented her from taking him inside her the need for physical release was greater than she had imagined he caught the lobe of her ear between his teeth and bit were not settling for ambivalent this time he eased back straddling her the last rays of the sun streaked through the west window and set the air on fire her hair haloed around her face the deep smoky red of autumn leaves her eyes were highsummer blucher skin the delicate rose of spring he lifted her hand kissing the fingers one by one what are you doing savoring you your hands trembling and your eyes are full of nerves i like that he scraped his teeth over her knuckle its exciting im not afraid no youre confused he lowered her hand unfastened the first button of her blouse thats even better you dont know what im going to make you feel next when her blouse was undone he parted it then slowly let his gaze slip down underneath she wore a bra of electric blue the sheen of satin dipping low over the milkpale swell of her breasts well well though his stomach tightened with the need to deyour her he lifted his gaze back to hers who would have thought it its not mine she cursed herself when he smiled i mean i only bought it and wore it out of the store to stop lexy from hounding me god bless lexy gently watching her face he skimmed his thumbs just above the edge of the satin her lashes fluttered lowered youre holding back on me he skimmed his thumbs a fraction lower i wont let you i want to hear you sigh jo ellen i want to hear you moan then i want to hear you scream she opened her eyes but her breath caught when he scraped his thumb over her nipple oh god you hide too much and not just this remarkable body you hide too much of jo ellen im going to see it all and im going to have it all before were finished he flicked the front hook of the bra watched her breasts spill free then lowering his head devoured them she did moan then the sounds she made were quick wild whimpers the ache was unbearable unreasonable she moved restlessly beneath him to soothe it and only deepened the throb she dragged at his shirt yanking it over his head and tossing it violently aside so she could feel hot flesh the storm crashed inside her tossing her closer and closer to that high sharp peak then dragging her back just inches back before she could ride it his mouth his hands streaked over her now daring her to keep pace making it impossible for her to do anything but stumble blindly she writhed tried to roll free anywhere there was air was an anchor to hold her but he held her trapped imprisoned in that terrifying picture and gave her no choice but to endure the violent war of sensation battling sensation he pulled her slacks over her hips revealing the blue swatch of satin his mouth was on her belly riding low his labored breathing thickening the air with hers she didnt hear herself begging but he did he had only to slide a finger under that satin had only to touch her to have her explode her body convulsed under his rocked by wave after molten wave of pleasure he pressed his face to her belly as it quivered as his own body shuddered in response thank god thank god was all she could think when the tension flooded out of her her muscles went lax and she took one grateful gulp of air only to expel it again on a muffled scream as those clever unmerciful fingers drove her up again did she think that was all the blood throbbed painfully in his head his heart his loins as he tore away the thin barrier did she think he would let either of them settle for less than madness now he yanked her hips high and used his tongue to destroy her and she did scream her arms flew back her fingers bouncing off the glossy painted iron posts of the headboard then gripping desperately as if to keep her body from being swept away behind her closed lids lights pulsed violent red beneath her skin her blood swam dangerously fast she shattered again a thousand pieces of her flying free then his hands gripped hers over the bedposts he plunged into her filled her took her ruthlessly to peak again with long slow deliberate strokes even as her vision wavered she could see his eyes the sharp intensity of them the pure gray edging toward black helpless she matched his pace her breath hitching and tearing when he quickened the tempo her hips pumping when he began to thrust inside her hard and fast when his mouth came down on hers she could do nothing but surrender to it when her body spun finally and completely out of control she could do nothing but let herself go and he could do nothing but let himself follow i she didnt know if shed slept she almost wondered if shed simply slid into a coma but it was full dark when she opened her eyes that jo thought hazily or shed been struck blind he lay over her his head resting between her breasts she could feel the rapid beat of his heart hear the quiet sigh of the wind fluttering through the window screens he felt her shift just slightly ill stop crushing you in just a second its all right i can almost breathe his lips curved as he brushed them over the side of her breast but he rolled over before she could move hed wrapped an arm around her and pulled her against him flan my ass she opened her mouth certain that some pithy comment would come but there was only laughter maybe ive just been off desserts for a while then youll just have to have seconds she snuggled up against him without thinking if we try for seconds well kill each other no we wont well get to those steaks first and ill get you a little drunk which was my original plan by the way then well have seconds you planned to get me drunk that was one of my ideas then there was the one about climbing up the trellis to your balcony sort of the swashbuckle scenario youd have broken your neck nah brian and i used to monkey up and down that thing all the time sure when you were ten she rose onto her elbow shook her hair back youre about a hundred pounds heavier now and i doubt youre as agile this is no time to call my agility into question she smiled lowered her brow to his youre absolutely right maybe youll surprise me one night maybe i will but now he gave her hair a tug before he sat up im going to cook you dinner nathan she smoothed a hand over the wrinkled spread while he searched for his jeans why are you going to so much trouble for me he didnt speak for a moment he couldnt be sure of his moves or his words after tugging on his cans he studied her silhouette in the dark it only took seeing you again jo ellen thats all it took it knocked the wind out of me and i still dont have my breath back im a mess nathan she swallowed hard and was grateful for the dark so he couldnt see her face the longing that had geysered inside of her had to show i dont know what i think or feel about anything anyone youd be better off shaking loose ive taken the easy way a few times it usually ends up being dull so far youve been anything but dull nathan youre really wasting your time arguing with me while youre sitting naked on my bed she dragged a hand through her hair good point well argue later fine ill just go dump more charcoal on the grill and since he planned to have her naked and on his bed again before the evening was over he didnt think theyd have much time to argue nathan wrapped his arms around jos waist nuzzled the back of her neck her hair was still damp from the shower theyd shared smelling his soap on lier skin aroused him yet again ill fix you breakfast in the morning she hooked her arm around is cek it amazed her how easy it was to be this close you dont have anything to fix bread i have bread he spun her around so he could feast on that wonderful curve of neck and shoulder im terrific at toast im famous for my toast as incredibly appetizing as that sounds nathan with a sound caught between a laugh and a moan she tried to wiggle away from his roving hands we really will kill each other and i have to get back its barely midnight its after one well then its practically morning you might as well stay she wanted to as his mouth found hers persuasively she badly wanted to i have things to straighten out at home and i have to make it up to brian for caving him in such a mess tonight she put her hands to his face liking the way it felt under her fingers cheekbones jaw the scrape of beard had she ever explored a mans face this way or wanted to and i have to think firmly she drew away im a thinker nathan a planner this is new territory for me he rubbed a thumb over the tine that formed between her brows youll just compel me to keep changing directions on you fresh nerves skidded over her skin then ill have to stay a step ahead but now i have to go home he could see her mind was made up and so he forced himself to readjust the pleasant image of waking beside her in the morning ill drive you you dont have to jo he put his hands on her shoulders and his voice was quiet and final youre not going out alone in the dark im not afraid im not going to be afraid anymore good for you im still driving you or we can argue about it i can maneuver you back into the bedroom and drive you home in the morning does your father have a gun she laughed pushed at her bangs its very unlikely hed shoot you for sleeping with me if he does im counting on you to nurse me back to health he took his keys from the counter im a southern woman she said as they started out the door ill even find a petticoat to tear into bandages it would almost be worth getting shot for that as she climbed into his jeep she asked ever been shot no he slid in beside her and started the engine but i had my tonsils out how much worse could it be considerably id imagine she stretched out her legs leaned back and shut her eyes she was tired but deliciously so her muscles were loose her mind pleasantly fogged the air felt silky on her skin the nights are best on the island she murmured when the quiet just rings in your ears and no one else is awake you can smell the trees and the water the seas a whisper in the background like a pulse beating you can be alone and not be lonely mmm amien i was a little girl i used to imagine what it would be like if i were all along had the island all to myself just for a few days it would all be mine everywhere i walked everywhere i looked i thought i would like that but then i dreamed it and i was afraid in the dream i kept running and running through the house out into the forest over the beach i wanted to find someone anyone to be there with me but i was all alone and i woke up crying for daddy now you take pictures of being alone i suppose i do she let out a sigh and opened her eyes and there through the dark she saw the glimmer of light kate left a light on for me it was comforting that flicker of home she watched it dance through the trees outdo the shadows once shed run away from that light and once shed run toward it she hoped the time would come when she could walk either way without fear as they neared the end of the drive she saw the figure rise from the porch swing her stomach did an ungainly roll before nathan covered her hand with his stay here lock the doors no i with a trembling breath its brian she said feeling foolish at the wave of relief that swamped her nathan nodded also recognizing the figure as brian stepped into the ight okay lets go no she gave the hand that covered hers a quick squeeze lets not complicate it if he needs to yell at me some more i deserve it and i dont want the two of you eyeing each other and trying to figure out how to handle the fact that youre friends and youre sleeping with his sister he doesnt appear to be armed it made her laugh as intended go home she shifted finding it simple to just lean over and touch her lips to his let brian and me deal with our family baggage were too polite to do a good job of it in front of you i want to see you tomorrow she opened the door come for breakfastunless youre set on having your worldfamous toast ill be here she started toward the porch waiting until she heard his jeep reverse before she mounted the stairs evening she said coolly to brian nice night for porch sitting he stared at her a moment then moved so quickly she nearly shrieked his arms strapped tight around her im sorry im so sorry stunned speechless she started to pat his back then yelped as he jerked her away and shook her its your own goddamn fault so typical so goddamn jo ellen what insult slapped on top of surprise and had her shoving him what the hell are you talking about stop manhandling me manhandling i ought to kick your butt up to your ears why the hell didnt you tell somebody what was going on why didnt you let me know you were in trouble if you dont let go of me right now no you just go on the way you always have pushing people out of the way so you can he broke off with a grunt as her fist plowed into his stomach the blow was quick and forceful enouhid to catch him off guard dropping his hands he eyed her narrowly that hasnt changed either you always packed a decent punch youre lucky i didnt aim for that pretty face of yours sniffing she rubbed her hands over her arms where his fingers had gripped damned if she wouldnt have bruises she thought obviously youre in no state to have a reasonable civilized conversation so im going up to bed you take one step toward that door and ill haul you over my knee she raised herself up on tiptoe and stuck her face in his dont you threaten me brian hathaway dont you test me jo ellen ive been sitting here for better than two hours worried sick so im in the mood to take you on i was with nathan which you knew very well and theres no cause for you to worry about my sex life he gritted his teeth i dont want to hear about it i dont want to think about it im not talking about you and nathan being im not talking about that jo bit the inside of her cheek to keep from grinning had she known it was so easy to flummox her brother she would have used that angle years ago well then pleased with the point scored she strolled to the porch swing and sat she cocked her head as she took out a cigarette just what is it you want to hear about think about and talk about brian you cant pull off the grand southern belle number jo it just doesnt suit you she flicked her lighter on its late and im tired if you have something to say say it so i can go to bed you shouldnt have been alone his voice had gong quiet and drew her gaze you shouldnt have gone through that alone been in that hospital alone and i want you to know that the choice of doing that was yours she took a slow drag yes it was my choice it was my problem thats right jo he took a step forward hooking his thumbs in his front pockets to keep his hands from curling into fists your problems your triumphs your life youve never seen fit to share any of those things why should this be different her stomach jittered what could you have done i could have been there i would have been there yeah that shocks the hell out of you doesnt it he said before she lowered her eyes i dont care how tuckedup this family is you wouldnt have gone through that by yourself and youre not going to go through the rest of it by yourself ive been to the police im not just talking about the cops though any pea brain would have gone to them in charlotte when this started she flicked an ash took another drag youre going to have to make up your mind whether you want to shame me or insult me i can do both annoyed she flipped the cigarette away watched the red tip fly through the dark then disappear into t i came home didnt i that at least was half sensible you came home looking like something that had been dragged down five miles of bad road then you dont tell anybody whats wrong except yirby you told yirby didnt you after i dragged you over there his eyes flashed ill deal with her later you leave her alone i told her about the breakdown and that was all thats medical and shes not obliged to tell her lover about her patients medical histories you told nathan i told him tonight i told him all of it tonight because i thought it was only right and fair weary now she rubbed her forehead an owl was hooting monotonously somewhere in the cool dark she wished she could find its tree climb the branches and just huddle there in peace do you want me to go over it all again now brian do you want chapter and verse and all the little details no he let out a sigh and sat beside her no you dont have to go over it again i guess youd have told me before if the lot of us werent so screwed up ive been thinking about that while ive been sitting out here working myself up to pound on you couldnt have taken much you were already mad at me kicked me out of the house he let out a quick rough laugh your own fault you let me its your house too its your house brian it always has been more yours than anyones it was said gently with quiet acceptance youre the one who cares most and tends most docs that bother you no well maybe some but mostly its a relief to me i dont have to worry if the roofs going to leak because you do she tipped her head back looking up at the glossy white paint of the veranda then out over the moonlightsprinkled gardens the wind chimes were tinkling the fountain quiet for the night and the scent of musk roses floated poignantly on the breeze i dont want to live here for a long time i thought i didnt ever want to be here but i was wrong i do everything here means more to me than i let myself believe i want to know i can come back now and then i can sit here on a warm clear night like this and smell the sweet peas and the jasmine and mamas roses lexy and me we just cant stay here the way you do but i guess we both need to know that sanctuary stands on the hill like always and nobodys going to lock the door on us no one would i dreamed the doors were locked and i couldnt get inside no one came when i called and all the windows were dark and empty she closed her eyes wanting it to play back in her mind wanting to know she could stand against it now i lost myself in the forest i was alone and scared and couldnt find my way then i saw myself standing on the other side of the river only it wasnt me at all it was mama youve always had strange dreams maybe ive always been crazy she smiled a little then looked out into the night i look like her brian sometimes when i see my face in the mirror it gives me such a jolt in the end thats what pushed me over the edge when those pictures came all those pictures of me i thought one of them was mama only she was dead she was naked and her eyes were open and staring and lifeless as a dolls i looked just like her but the picture wasnt there she said quickly it wasnt even there i imagined it ive always hated seeing pictures of myself because i see her in them you may look like her jo but youre not like her you finish what you start you stick i ran away from here you got away from here he corrected you went out to make your own life thats different from leaving a life youd already started and all the people who needed you youre not annabelle he draped an arm over her shoulder and let the swing slide into motion and youre only about as crazy as the rest of us around here she laughed well thats comforting isnt it it was late when susan peters marched out of the rented cottage and stalked toward the cove shed had a nasty fight with her husband and had had to do it in undertones so as not to disturb their friends whod taken the cottage with them for the week the man was an idiot she decided she couldnt even think why shed married him much less why shed stayed married to him for three yearsnot to mention the two theyd lived together before making it legal every time every single time she so much as mentioned buying a house he got that closedin look on his face and he started going on about down payments and taxes and maintenance and money money money what the hell were both of them working their butts off for was she supposed to live in an apartment in atlanta forever the hell with the conveniences she thought and tossed back her curly mop of brown hair she wanted a yard a little garden a kitchen where she could practice cooking the gourmet dishes shed taken classes for but all she got out of tom was one day one day well when was one day going to get here disgusted she plopped down n on the beach slipping off her shoes so she could dig her toes in the sand while she stared out at the quiet water that lapped and lapped against the hull of the little outboard theyd rented he didnt have any problems spending money on a silly boat so he could go fishing every stupid day they were on desire they had enough for a down payment she propped her elbow on her knee and watched sulkily as the moon floated overhead shed done all the research on financing and balloon payments and interest rates she wanted that sweet little house on peach blossom lane sure it would be tight for the first couple of years but they could manage shed been so positive that when she talked to him about building equity and breaking out of the endless cycle of renting month after month he would come around and oh it was just about killing her that mary alice and jim were about to settle on that pretty place in the development a magnolia tree in the front yard and a little patio off the kitchen she sighed and wished shed waited until theyd gotten back home to start working on tom again that would have been smarter she knew how important timing was when dealing with her husband but shed gotten so damned upset she hadnt been able to stop herself when they got back to atlanta tom was going to look at that house on peach blossom if she had to drag him by the ear she heard the footsteps behind her and stared straight ahead no point in coming down here to try to make up tom peters im not nearly finished being mad at you yet i may never be furious that he didnt attempt to talk her out of it she wrapped her arms around her knees you just go on back up and balance your checkbook since money is all you want i dont have another thing to say to you as the silence dragged on she gritted her teeth and turned her head listen here tomoh embarrassment heated her cheeks as she looked up into a strangers face im sorry i thought you were someone else he smiled charmingly and with a gleam of laughter in his eyes thats all right im going to think of you as someone else too even as the first streak of alarm sent a scream toward her throat he struck it wasnt going to be perfect he decided studying her as she lay crumpled at his feet he hadnt planned on this impromptu practice session but he hadnt been able to sleep his mind was so full of jo and the sexual need was unexpectedly sharp tonight he was very very annoyed with her and that only made him want her more then the pretty brunette had just been there like a gift sitting all alone by the water under the shifting light of the moon a wise man didnt look a gift horse in the mouth so to speak he thought with a chuckle as he hauled her up into his arms they would just move off a bit he decided in case old tomwhoever he might bewandered down to the cove she was a light load and he didnt mind the exercise he whistled tunelessly as he carried her over the sand and up through a narrow break in the dunes he would need the moonlight so he settled on the verges of the swale it was picturesque with the moonsilvered bushes he thought as he laid her down and it was deserted he used his belt to tie her hands and one of the silk scarves he always carried to gag her he stripped her first pleased to find that her body was trim and athletic she moaned a little as he pulled off his jeans dont worry darling you look very pretty very sexy and the moonlight flatters you he took out his camerathe pentax singlelens reflex he liked for portraitspleased that hed loaded it with slow film he wanted fine detail now knifeedged sharpness likely hed have to do some burning in and dodging in the darkroom to get the contrasts and textures just so he would look forward to that to perfecting the prints whistling under his breath he fixed his flash and ran off three shots before her eyelids fluttered thats right thats right i want you to come around now slow a few nice closeups of that pretty face the eyes are the best they always are he grew hard as they opened dulled with pain and confusion beautiful just beautiful look here look right here now thats the way baby focus delighted he captured understanding and fear he set the camera down as she began to stir her movement would blur the shot and he didnt have any backup film of faster speed still smiling he picked up the gun hed laid on his neatly folded jeans and showed it to her now i dont want you to move i want you to stay still really still and do everything i tell you the last thing i want to do is use this now you understand that dont you tears began to swim in her eyes then leak out but she nodded terror bubbled in her brain and though she tried to remain motionless shudders racked her im just going to take your picture were having a photo shoot youre not afraid of having your picture taken a pretty woman like you he exchanged gun for camera and smiled winningly now heres what i want you to do bend your knees come on now thats the way and move them over to your left side youve got a lovely body why dont we show it off to its best advantage she did what he asked her eyes wheeling over to stare at the gun the chrome glinted and shone he just wanted pictures she told herself as her breath hitched and shuddered he would leave her alone then hed go away he wouldnt hurt her terror bulged in her eyes turned her skin milky white and had him throbbing viciously his hands began to tremble signaling him that he could no longer wait for the next stage his heart thudded in his head as he carefully set his camera down on his shirt very gently he put a hand on her throat and looked deeply into her eyes youre beautiful he murmured and youre helpless you know that dont you theres nothing you can do im in control i have all the power dont i she jerked her head down in a nod small sobs muffling against the silk when his hand closed over her breast and squeezed she moaned out pleas and tossed her head wildly her heels dug into the sand as she tried to escape he straddled her it wont do you any good he shuddered as she bucked and twisted under him the more fight you put up the better i like it try to scream he squeezed her breasts again then bent down to bite at them scream goddamn it scream a harsh keening sound ripped out of her burned her throat desperate she fought against the gag struggled to use her teeth her tongue her lips to drag it aside he pried her thighs apart deliberately bruising the flesh and thought of jo as he raped her thought of jo ellens long legs jo ellens sexy mouth jo ellens heavylidded blue eyes while he pounded himself with sweaty violence into her substitute the orgasm was towering brought tears of surprise and triumph to his eyes so much better than the last one he realized and absently closed a hand over her throat pressing down only until she stopped fighting hed chosen well this time he thought as the climax eased off into sweetness hed found his practice angel the breeze cooled his damp skin when he rose for the camera he remembered how the process had been outlined in his journal and reminded himself not merely to duplicate but to improve i may rape you again i may not he smiled attractive creases forming around his mouth and eyes i may hurt you i may not it all depends on how you behave now you just lie there angel and think about that satisfied that she was quiescent for a while he changed lenses her pupils were enormous black moons with only a sliver of pale brown encircling them her breathing was short and shallow he whistled contentedly as he loaded fresh film he shot the entire roll before he raped her a second time and hed decided to hurt her after all the choice the mood the control were all completely in his hands she stopped fighting him in all but a physical sense shed stopped being there her body was numb belonged to someone else in her mind she was safe with tom sitting together on the patio of their pretty new house on peach blossom lane she barely felt him remove the gag she managed a quiet sob made a pitiful effort to draw in breath enough to scream you know its too late for that he said it gently almost lovingly as he wound the scarf around her throat youll be my angel now he tightened the scarf slowly wanting to draw out the moment he watched her mouth open struggle to suck in air her heels drummed on the sand her body jerked his breath became labored the power flooding him screaming in his head racing through his blood he lost track of the times he stopped let her claw back to consciousness before he took her to the brink again he wouldnt aim the camera again not just one decisive moment he thought but many the fear of death the acceptance the flicker of hope as life pumped back the surrender when it blinked out again oh he regretted the lack of a tripod and remote finally his system roared past control and he finished it gasping he murmured endearments kissed her gratefully she had shown him a new level this unexpected angel that fate had tossed at his feet it had been meant to be of course he understood that now hed had more to learn before he met his destiny with jo so much more to learn he removed the scarf folded it and laid it reverently over the gun he took time to pose her adjusting her hands after hed freed them the welts on the wrists troubled him a little until he slid her hands under her head like a pillow he thought he would title this one gift of an angel he dressed then bundled her clothes the marsh was too far he decided whatever the gators and other predators had left of ginny was buried deep there he didnt have time for the hike or energy for the labor there were conveniently deep spots in the river however and that would do well enough he would take her to her final resting place weigh her body down so that it would rest on the slippery bottom and then he decided with a wide yawn hed call it a night when gaff slipped out of lexys room and down the back steps the sky was pearled with dawn hed meant to be out of the house and on his way before sunup but then he thought with a lazy smile lexy had a way of persuading a man to tarry shed tiecded him first to work off her mad at brian then to tell him about her sisters troubles they could talk about things like that and all manner of other things tucked in her room their voices hushed with secrets that ease of talking giff mused was just one of the advantages of being in love with someone youd known since childhood then there was the electric jolt the unexpected sizzle of surprise as you got to know that very familiar person on other more intimate levels gaff puffed out a breath as he reached for the door it sure wasnt any hardship to study lexy hathaway on those other levels the way shed looked in that little silk nightie shed bought in savannah had been enough to make a strong man sink to his knees and praise god for coming up with the brilliant notion of creating eve getting her out of that sheer little concoction hadnt been a worrisome task either in fact he decided that when he took her to savannah on saturday hed buy her another one just so he could the erotic image of lexy in buttermilk silk fled as he found him self faced with her father it was a tossup as to which one of them was more disconcerted lexys lover with his hair still tumbled from sex and sleep or lexys father with a bowl of cornflakes in his hand both cleared their throats mr hathaway giff i ah was that plumbing need seeing to again upstairs it was an out offered as desperately as it was nearly taken but giff straightened his shoulders told himself not to take the cowards way and met sams eyes directly no sir miserably uneasy sam set his bowl down and dumped milk onto the cereal well then was all he could think to say mr hathaway i dont want you to think im sneaking out of your house which of course gaff admitted was exactly what he was doing youve been running tame in sanctuary since you could walk leave it along boy sam prayed leave it lie and move along youre welcome to co andgoas you picas c just like you ever were ive been walking a lot of years now mr hathaway and for most of them ive been i figure you know how i feel about lexy how i always have damn cereal was going to get soggy sam thought with regret i guess you didnt grow out of it like most thought you would no sir id say its more i grew into it i love her mr hathaway my feelings for her are longstanding and steady youve known me and my family all my life im not feckjcss or foolish ive got some savings put by i can make a good living with my hands and my back i dont doubt it but sam frowned maybe hed barely sipped through his first cup of coffee but his mind was clear enough to catch the drift giff if youre asking me for permission to call on my daughter seems to me youve already opened that particular door walked in and made yourself to home gaff flushed and hoped his swallow wasnt audible ye s sir i cant deny the truth of that but its not that particular door im speaking of mr hathaway oh sam opened a drawer for a spoon hoping giff would take the hint and mosey on before things got any stickier then he put the spoon down with a clatter and stared sweet jesus boy youre not talking about marrying her giffs jaw set his eyes glinted im going to marry her mr hathaway id like to have your blessing over it but either way im having her sam shook his head rubbed his eyes life just flat refused to be simple he reflected a man went along minding his own business wanting nothing more than for other people to mind theirs in return but life just kept throwing tacks under your bare feet boy you want to take her on im not going to stand in your way couldnt anyhow even if i planted my boots in concrete the two of you are of age and ought to have the sense to know your own minds he dropped his hands but ive got to say giff as ive always been fond of you i think youre taking on a sack of trouble there youll be lucky to get one moments peace from the time you say i do till you take your last breath peace isnt a priority of mine shell run through every penny youve put by and wont have a clue where she spent it shes not near as foolish as you think and i can always make more money im not going to waste my breath talking you out of something youve got your mind set on im good for her no question about it fact is you might be the making of her resigned to it sam offered a hand ill wish you luck sam watched gaff go off with a spring in his step he didnt doubt the boy was in love and if he let himself he could remember what it was like to feel that light in the head that edgy in the gut that hot in the blood sam settled in the breakfast nook with his second cup of coffee and his soggy cereal and watched the sky lighten to a bold summer blue hed been just as dazed and dazzled by annabelle as gaff was now with lexy it had only taken one look for his heart to jolt straight out of his chest and fall at her feet christ theyd been young he was barely eighteen that summer coming to the island to work on his uncles shrimp boat casting nets sweating under a merciless sun until his hands were raw and his back a misery he enjoyed every second of it he fell in love with the island first glance the hazy greens the pockets of solitude the surprises around every bend of the river or road then he saw belle pendleton walking along the beach gathering shells at sunset long golden legs willowy body the generous fall of waving red hair eyes as clear as water and blue as summer the sight of her hazed his vision and closed his throat he smelled of shrimp and sweat and engine grease he wanted a quick swim through the waves to loosen the muscles the days work had aching but she smiled at him and holding a pinklined conch shell began to talk to him he was tonguetied and terrified hed always been intimidated by females but this vision had already captured his heart with one smile left him grunting out responses like an illmannered ape he never knew how hed managed to stutter out an invitation to take a walk the next evening years later when he asked her why shed said yes she just laughed you were so handsome sam so serious and stern and sweet and you were the first boyand the last manto make my heart skip a beat shed meant it then sam thought after he had worked enough saved enough money to satisfy him hed gone to her father to ask permission for her hand a great deal more formal that had been sam mused sipping his coffee than the meeting just now with gaff thered been no sneaking out of annabelles bedroom at dawn either though there had been stolen afternoons in the forest even when a mans blood had been cool for years he remembered what it was like to have it run hot for the first few years that anabelle was gone his blood had heated from time to time hed taken care of that in savannah it hadnt shamed him to pay for sex a professional woman didnt require conversation or wooing she simply transacted business it had been some time since hed required that particular service though and since aids and other potential horrors of impersonal sex scared him sam was relieved to have weaned himself away from it everything he needed was on the island hed found the peace that young gaff claimed not to want sam sat back to enjoy the rest of his coffee in the quiet he had to struggle with a hard twinge of irritation when the door opened and jo walked in the fact that she hesitated when she saw him and a slight flicker of annoyance moved over her face both shamed and amused him peas in a pod he decided who dont much care to share the pod good morning damn it all shed wanted was a quick slug of coffee before she went out to work not just wander or brood but work shed awakened for the first time in weeks refreshed and focused and she didnt want to waste it clear morning sam said thunderstorms and strong winds by evening though i suppose she opened a cupboard silence stretched between them long and complete the trickle of coffee as jo poured it from pot to cup was loud as a waterfall sam shifted his khakis hissing against the polished wood of the bench kate told me she told me i imagined she would urn youre feeling some better now im feeling a great deal better and the police theyre doing what they can do yes what they can i was thinking about it it seems to me you should stay here for the next little while until its settled and done you shouldnt plan on going back to charlotte and traveling like you do id planned to stay work here for the next few weeks anyway you should stay here jo ellen until its settled and done surprised at the firm tone as close to an order as she could remember receiving from him since childhood she turned lifted her brows i dont live here i live in charlotte you dont live in charlotte sam said slowly until this is settled and done her back went up an automatic response im not having some wacko dictate my life when im ready to go back ill go back you wont leave sanctuary until i say you can leave this time her mouth dropped open i beg your pardon you heard me right enough jo ellen your cars have always been sharp and your understanding keen youll stay here until youre well enough and its safe enough for you to leave and go about your business if i want to go tomorrow you wont sam interrupted ive got my mind set on it youve got your mind set stunned she strode over to the table and scowled down at him you think you can just set your mind on something that has to do with me after all this time and ill just fall in leno i reckon youll have to be planted in line and held there like always thats all i have to say he wanted to escape he wanted the quiet but when he started to slide down the bench to get up jo slapped a hand onto the table to block him its not all i have to say apparently youve lost track of some time here im twentyseven years old youll be twentyeight come november he said mildly i know the ages of my children and that makes you a sterling example of fatherhood no his eyes stayed level with hers but theres no changing the fact that im yours just the same youve done well enough for yourself by yourself up to now but things have taken a turn so youll stay here where there are those who can look out for you for the next little while really her eyes narrowed to slits well let me tell you just what im going to continue to do for myself by myself good morning kate breezed in all smiles shed had lier ear to the door for the last two minutes and calculated it was time to make an entrance it pleased her to enter a room in that house and not find apathy or bitterness temper at least was clean that coffee smells wonderful im just dying for some in a calculated move she brought a cup and the pot to the table sliding in beside sam before he could wriggle away just let me top this off for you sam jo bring your cup on over here i swear i dont know the last time we sat down for a quiet cup of coffee in the morning lord knows after that chaos in the dining room last night we need it i was on my way out jo said stiffly well honey sit down and finish your coffee first brianll be coming in soon enough to tell us all to seat you look like you got a good nights sleep kate smiled brilliantly your daddy and i were worried youd be restless theres no need to worry grudgingly jo got her coffee and brought it to the table everything that can be dones being done in fact im feeling so much calmer about it all im thinking about going back to charlotte she shot a challenging look at sam soon thats fine jo if you want to send the lot of us to an early grave with worry kate spoke mildly as she spooned sugar into her coffee i dont see of course you see kate interrupted youre just angry and you have a right to be but you dont have the right to take that anger out on those who love you its natural to do just that kate added with a smile but its not right thats not what im doing good kate patted her hand as if the matter were settled youre planning to take some pictures today i see she glanced over at the camera bag jo had set on the counter i got out that book that nathans father did on the island put it in the public parlor after id looked through it again my there are some pretty photographs in there he did good work jo muttered struggling not to sulk he sure did i found one in there of nathan brian and i suppose nathans younger brother such handsome little boys they were holding up a couple of whopping trout and had grins on their faces that stretched a mile wide you ought to take a look at it i will jo found herself smiling thinking of nathan at ten with a trout on the line and you could think about doing a photo book on the island yourself kate went on it would be just wonderful for business sam you take jo over to the marsh that spot where the sea lavenders fu in bloom oh and if the two of you go through the forest along the southwest edge the path theres just covered with trumpet vine petals that would make such a nice picture jo ellen that narrow quiet little path just dusted with fallen blossoms she went on and on chattering out suggestions without giving father or daughter a chance to interrupt when brian trooped in the back door and stared baffled at the cozy family group kate beamed him a smile well be out of your way in just a shake sweetie jo and sam were just deciding which route they were going to take around the island today for jos pictures yall better get started icate got up quickly gathering jos camera bag i know how fussy you are about the light and such you just tell your daddy when it strikes you as right i cant wait to see what kind of pictures you get hurry along now before brian starts to fuss at us sam you get a chance you take jo down to where those baby terns hatched a while back goodness look at the time you two scoot she all but dragged sam to his feet kept nudging and talking until shed shoved them both out the door just what the hell was that kate brian asked her that with any luck at all was the beginning of something theyll go their own ways when theyre five feet from the house no they wont kate disagreed as she started toward the ringing phone on the wall because neither one of them will want to be the first to take that step away while theyre each waiting for the other one to back off first theyll be heading in the same direction for a change good morning she said into the receiver the inn at sanctuary her smile faded im sorry what yes yes of course automatically she grabbed a pencil and began scribbling on the pad by the phone ill certainly make some calls right away dont worry now its a very small island well help in every way we can mr peters ill come on down there to the cottage myself right now no thats just fine ill be right along mosquitoes getting in through the screen again brian asked but he knew it was more than that much more the peterses took wild horse cove cottage with some friends for the week mr peters cant seem to find his wife this morning brian felt a quick stab of fear at the base of his spine he couldnt ignore it but told himself it was foolish overreaction kate its not quite seven am she probably got up early and took a walk hes been out looking for almost an hour he found her shoes down by the water distracted she ran a hand through her hair well its probably just as you say but hes terribly worried ill run down there and calm him down help him look around until she comes wandering home she managed a thin smile im sorry sweetie but this means im going to have to wake lexy up so she can take the breakfast shift in my place this morning shes liable to be snappish about it im not worried about lexy kate he added as she headed for the door give me a call will you when mrs peters gets home sure i will honey like as not shell be there before i make it down to them but she wasnt by noon tom peters wasnt the only one on desire who was worried other cottagers and natives joined in the search nathan among them hed seen tom and susan peters once or twice during their stay and had a vague recollection of a pretty brunette of medium height and build he left the others to comb the beach and the cove while he concentrated on the swath of land between his cottage and wild horse cove there was barely an eighth of a mile between them the verge of his end forested then giving way to dune and swale he covered the ground slowly and saw when he reached the stretch of sand the crisscrossing footprints of others who had come that way to look though he knew it was useless he climbed over the dunes the cove below was secluded but anyone there would have been spotted half a dozen times by now by others who were searching there was only one figure there now a man who paced back and forth nathan he turned and seeing jo mounting the incline between the dunes held out a hand to help her up i went by your cottage she began i see youve heard that must be the husband down there ive seen him a couple of times before tom peters ive been all over the island i was out working this morning from about seven one of the pendleton kids tracked us down an hour or so ago and told us he said her shoes were down there by the water thats what i heard people are thinking she might have gone in to swim and the currents fairly gentle here but if she cramped or just swam out too far it was a grim scenano one that had already occurred to him shouldnt the tide have brought her in by now if thats what happened it may yet if the current carried her along for a while they could find her down the island at the next tide change barry fitzsimmons drowned like that we were about sixteen he was a strong swimmer but he went out by himself one night during a beach party hed been drinking they found him the next morning at low tide half a mile down nathan shifted his gaze to the south where the waves were less serene he thought of kyle sinking under blue mediterranean waves where are her clothes then what it seems to me if shed decided to go swimming shed have stripped down i suppose youre right but she might have come down in her bathing suit without a towel it didnt quite fit he decided i wonder if anyones asked him if he knows what she was wearing when she left the house im going down to talk to him i dont think we should intrude hes alone and hes worried nathan kept her hand in his as he started down or he had a fight with his wife killed her and disposed of her body thats horrid and ridiculous hes a perfectly decent normal man sometimes perfectly decent normal men do the unthinkable nathan studied tom peters as they approached late twenties he decided about five ten he looked fit in wrinkled camp shorts and a plain white tshirt probably worked out at the gym three or four mornings a week nathan thought he had a good start on his vacation tan and though the stubble on his chin gave him an unkempt appearance his dark blond hair had been cut recently and cut well when he raised his head and nathan saw his eyes he saw only sick fear mr peters tom i dont know where else to look i dont know what to do saying the words out loud brought tears swimming into his eyes he blinked them back breathing rapidly my friends they went to the other side of the island to look i had to come back here to come back here just in case you need to sit down gently jo took his arm why dont we go back up to your cottage and you can sit down for a while ill make you some coffee no i cant leave here she came down here she came down last night we had a fight we had a fight oh god its so stupid why did we have a fight he covered his face with his hands pressing his fingers against his burning eyes she wants to buy a house we cant afford it yet i tried to explain to her tried to show her how impractical it is but she wouldnt listen when she stormed out i was relieved i was actually relieved and thought well now at least i can get some sleep while she goes out and sulks maybe she took a swim to cool off nathan prompted susan tom let out a short laugh swim alone at night not hardly shed never go in water past her knees anyway she doesnt like to swim in the ocean she always says she hears cello music the minute it hits her knees you know he said with a faint smile cyaws then he turned back staring out at the water i know people are thinking she might have gone swimming she might have drowned its just not possible she loves to sit and look at the ocean she loves to listen to it to smell it but she wont go in where the hell is she goddamn it susan this is a hell of a way to scare me into buying a house ive got to go somewhere look somewhere i cant just stand here he raced back toward the dunes and sent sand avalanching down as he rushed up and over them do you think thats what shes doing nathan putting a scare into him because shes angry we can hope so come on he slipped an arm around her waist well take the long way back to the cottage keep our eyes peeled then well take a break from this i could use a break from just about everything the wind was rising as they headed through the through between the surfside dune hummocks and the higher inland dunes where beach elders and bayberry stabilized the sand tracks scored the ground the scratches from scudding ghost crabs the threetoed prints from parading wild turkeys the spots where deer had meandered to feed on seeds and berries human tracks had churned up the sand as well and the wind would take them all despite the grazing thousands of white star rush and fragile marsh pinks spread their color would she have walked this way jo wondered alone at ilight it had been a clear cycning and a lonely beach drew troubled hearts as well as contented ones the wind would have been stiff and fresh and even after the tide receded leaving the sand wet the wind would have chased it along in streamers that scratched at the ankles shed wanted to walk she was angry upset wanted to be alone it was a warm night she might have headed down the shoreline just following the water thats more likely than anything else she turned looking out over the low hillocks to the sea the wind lifted sand and salt spray sending the sea oats waving sifting a fresh coat over the pennywort and railroad vines that tangled maybe theyve found her by now nathan laid a hand on her shoulder well call and check when we get to the cottage where else would she have gone jo shifted to stare inland where the dunes crept slowly relentlessly toward the trees in smooth curves it would have been foolish to wander into the forest shed have lost the moonlightand shed have wanted her shoes would she be angry enough with her husband to stay away to worry him like this because of a house i dont know people do unaccountable things to each other when theyre married things that seem cruel or indifferent or foolish to outsiders did you she turned her head to study his face did you do cruel indifferent and foolish things when you were married probably he tucked the hair blowing across her face behind her ear im sure my exwife has a litany of them marriage is most often a mistake you depend on someone you inevitably lean too hard or take them for granted or find them irritating because theyre always there thats remarkably cynical for someone whos never been married ive observed marriage servings what i do because its less risky than participating she turned away again because its what i do if shes out some where walking avoiding coming back letting her husband suffer like this how could he ever forgive her suddenly she was angry deeply bitterly angry but he will wont he she demanded whirling back to him hell forgive her hell fall at her feet sobbing in relief and hell buy her the tucking house she wants all she had to do to get her way was put him through hell for a few hours nathan studied her glinting eyes the high color that temper had slapped into her cheeks you may be right he spoke mildly fascinated that she could shift from concern to condemnation in the blink of an eye but youre heaping a lot of blame and calculation on a woman you dont even know ive known others like her my mother ginny people who do exactly what they choose without giving a damn for the consequences or what they do to others im sick to death of people their selfish agendas their unrelenting selfconcern there was such pain in her voice the echo of it rolled through him leaving his stomach raw and edgy he had to tell her he thought he couldnt keep blocking it out couldnt continue to shove it aside no matter how hard hed worked to convince himself it was best for both of them maybe susan peterss disappearance was a sign an omen if he believed in such things whatever he believed and whatever it was he wanted eventually he would have to tell her what he knew was she strong enough to stand up to it or would it break her jo ellen lets go inside yeah she folded her arms as clouds rolled over the sun and the wind kicked into a warning howl why the hell are we out here worrying ourselves over a stranger who has the bitchiness to put her husband and friends through this because shes lost jo one way or another who isnt she murmured it would wait another day he told himself it would wait until susan peters had been found if he was daring the gods by taking another day stealing another few hours before he shattered both their lives then hed pay the price how much heavier could it be than the one hed already paid when he was sure she was strong when he was sure she could bear it he would tell her the hideous secret that only he knew annabelle had never left desire she had been murdered in the forest just west of sanctuary on a night in high summer under a white moon david delaney the father he had grown up loving admiring respecting had been her killer jo saw lightning flash and the shimmering curtain of rain form far out to sea storms coming she said i know the first drops hit the ground with fat plops and kirby quickened her pace the search group shed joined had parted ways at the fork of the path shed chosen the route to the sanctuary and now she shivered a bit as tl e rain fell through the overhanging limbs and vines to soak her shirt by the time she reached the verge it was coming down hard windwhipped and surprisingly cold she saw brian hatless shoulders hunched trooping up the road to her right she met him on the edge of the east terrace saying nothing he took her hand and pulled her onto the screened porch for a moment they simply stood dripping as lightning stabbed the sky in pitchforks and thunder boomed in answer no word kirby shifted her medical bag from hand to hand nothing i just came over from the west side gaff has a group that took the north weary brian rubbed his hands over his face this is getting to be a habit its been more than twelve hours since she was seen kirby looked out into the driving rain thats too long theyll have to call off the search until the storm passes god brian were going to find her washed up after this its about the only explanation left her poor husband theres nothing to do now but wait it out you need a dry shirt and some coffee yeah she dragged her wet hair away from her face i do ill take a look at your hand while im here and redress it for you its fine ill decide that she said following him in after i take a look suit yourself go on up and get something out of jos closet the house seemed so quiet isolated in the violent rain is she here as far as i know shes out too he went to the freezer took out some black bean soup hed made weeks before shell take shelter like everybody else when kirby came back fifteen minutes later the kitchen smelled of coffee and simmering soup the warmth eased away the last of the tension in her shoulders leaning against the doorway a moment she indulged herself by watching him work despite his bandaged hand he was neatly slicing thick slabs from a loaf of brown bread hed undoubtedly baked himself his wet shirt clung to him displaying an attractive outline of muscle and rib when he looked over at her his eyes were a cool misty blue that made her stomach flutter pleasantly it smells wonderful figured you hadnt eaten no i haventnot since a stale danish this morning she held out the shirt shed taken from his closet here put this on you shouldnt stand around in wet clothes thanks he noted that shed changed into some of jos dull ray sweats they bagged on her and made her seem all the more delicate you look lost in those well jos a good six inches taller than i am she lifted a brow as he tugged the wet shirt off over his head his skin was damp and brown and smooth god youre attractive brian she laughed when his brows drew together in what was obviously confused embarrassment i get to appreciate your wonderful build on two levels as a doctor and as a woman better put that shirt on or i might lose control on both counts that could be interesting letting the shirt dangle from his fingers he stepped toward her which would come first i never let personal leanings interfere with professional obligations she trailed a finger up his arm then down to his wrist which is why im going to examine that wound first thing and second thing before she could answer he cupped his hands under her elbows and lifted her when their mouths were level he leaned forward to toy with her lips excellent upper body strength her voice was just a little breathless as she wrapped her legs around his waist your pulse is a little elevated she murmured checking the one at his throat with her mouth just a little fast ive got a case on you doc kirby brian turned his face into her hair it smelled of rain and lemons it doesnt seem to be passing fact is im starting to think its terminal when she went very still he shifted her until he could see her eyes what do you want from me yirby i thought i knew her fingers tingled when she skimmed them over his face im not sure anymore maybe whatever case youve got is contagious do you have this ache around your heart just like its being squeezed and this lifting and sinking sensation in your stomach all the time lately so whats wrong with us doc im not sure but she broke off as the screen door slammed voices rose and invaded the kitchen sighing yirby laid her brow against brians until he shifted her hips and set her down sounds like lexy and giff are back he kept his eyes on kirby some of the others are likely with them and theyll the looking for a hot meal then ill help you dish up some soup id appreciate it he lifted the lid on the pot letting steam and scent escape were going to have to finish this conversation sometime or other yes we are she opened a cupboard to get bowls sometime or other from nathans porch jo watched the rain and smoked restlessly hed tried the television when they came in hoping for a weather report the cable was already out so they settled for the radio static hissed out along with the announcers listings of smallcraft advisories and flashflood warnings theyd lose power if it kept up much longer she thought and the ponds and rivers would certainly flood already she could see puddles forming and deepening no word yet nathan joined her on the porch some of the search partys taken shelter at sanctuary to wait this out he laid a towel over her shoulders youre shivering why dont you come inside i like to watch lightning stabbed the sky and sent an answering jolt into her stomach quick squalls like this are hell to be out in but theyre exciting from the right vantage point she took a deep breath when the sky went hot and white the sting of ozone lingered on the air wheres your camera i took ming back home in the bedroom ill get it for you impatient she stabbed out her cigarette in a broken shell too much energy she thought it was pumping through her pounding at her she all but snatched the camera from nathan when he brought it out what kind of film do you have in here four hundred he said quietly watching as she quickly examined good thats fast i want fast she lifted aimed at the rainlashed trees the swinging moss come on come on she muttered then snapped with the next burst of lightning another i want another thunder rattled the air as she changed angles her finger as itchy as if it were on the trigger of a gun i need to get down shoot up at that tree no nathan bent to pick up the towel that had fallen from her shoulders the overhang offered little protection the two of them were rapidly getting soaked youre not going out there you dont know where or when we could have a lightning strike thats half of it isnt it the not knowing the not caring she tossed back her head recklessness streaked through her glowed dangerously in her eyes i dont know what im doing with you or when i might get hit next i dont seem to care how much are you going to hurt me nathan and how long will it take me to get over it and how long before one of us does something cruel indifferent or foolish before he could speak she grabbed a handful of his hair and dragged his mouth to hers i dont care she dug her teeth into his lip you need to care enraged with fate he caught her face in his hands pulled her back his eyes were as dark and violent as the storm whipping the air i want you to understand that when i do hurt you i wont have a choice i dont care she repeated pulling his mouth back to hers i only want now right now i want you i dont want to think i dont want either of us to think i just want to feel his maid was already hazed as they stumbled through the door she bobbled the camera laughing and moaning as he tore at her shirt fast she managed i still want fast he tumbled with her to the floor and the camera thudded lightly on the carpet as they ripped off clothes and shoes her hands were tangled in her shirt when he thrust inside her she grappled to free them the momentary thrill of being helpless and bound adding another layer of excitement then she was free and her fingers dug into his hips to urge him to drive deeper and harder he couldnt stop himself and let the speed the heat the fury of mating rule them both if her need was frantic his was desperate to take her to have her to keep her one more day one more hour a dozen lifetimes if his punishment for his fathers sin was to fall in love so terribly in love and lose he would take every moment he could steal before payment came due she cried out in grateful relief when the orgasm stabbed through her his body plunged violently in hers then stilled his breath was ragged as he pushed himself back to stare down at her is that what you wanted yes fast and heartless yes his hand closed in a fist it was exactly what hed given her do you think its going to stop at that she closed her eyes briefly then willed herself to open them no good he relaxed his hand brushed it over her cheek another moment stolen he thought when her eyes opened and met his id hate to have to argue with you when im still wanting you give me more jo ellen his mouth lowered to tease her dont make me take it this time her arms lifted wrapped around him im so afraid of you i know give me more anyway take a chance his mouth stayed gentle waiting for hers to answer then to demand he wanted more much more than that rough and edgy release theyd offered each other more than the animal lunge of hot blood when she sighed out his name he knew he had the beginnings of it her mouth grew more hungry her hands began to roam fresh need built in her quickly as though it had never been met she craved the taste of his skin and took her mouth on a journey over his face and throat with a murmur of approval she rolled with him until she stretched across his body with the freedom to do as she pleased the wind kicked rattling the screen door on its hinges the house shuddered beneath them in contrast they moved slowly almost y languidly touch and taste sigh and murmur she lost herself in the easy sway of it the shift and glide of bodies rhythms set and matched she thought she could float over him inch by inch and wonder as she set each separate muscle to quivering he cased her back sitting up to slide her into his lap it was tenderness he needed for both of them now to soothe the pain already suffered and the pain yet to come their eyes held as he lowered his mouth to hers took the kiss deep gradually deep so that the warmth from it flushed over her the intimacy of it shimmered through her she might have resisted she lifted a hand to his chest as if to do so but her limbs went limp and she was lost and she gave him more it was surrender he wanted for both of them his and hers a yielding soft liquid kisses filled them both nudged them lazily toward excitement when he cupped her her moan was quiet and ended on a little gasp of pleasure he took her up slowly so that the orgasm was long and sleek they each trembled and when she reached for him thrilling to find him hard and ready her lips curved against his again she murmured just like that again the pleasure rolled through her layer by layer to whirl in her head like wine still shimmering from it she shifted until her body was over his and the thick beat of his heart was under her mouth i love what you can do to me she slid down spreading light openmouthed kisses down to his belly i want to know i can do it to you his skin quivered when she closed that hot generous mouth over him dark pleasure blurred his vision and the roar in his head drowned out the rain she drove him to the brink where he clung to pleasure and control and sanity only by slippery fingertips she rose up over him her body glimmering in the murky light she lowered to him took him in arched back took him deeper her arms lifted up folded behind her head as if in triumph her eyes met his stared intently into that smoky gray as she began to move slowly torturously and her body shivered when his hands closed hard and possessive over her breasts smoothly silkily his breath caught and strangled as she braced her own hands on his chest her head fell back her body going arrowtaut and her muscles clamping hard around him as she rode herself to peak yet even as her heart tripped her brain staggered her system revved greedily for more she couldnt bear it couldnt stop it her body drove forward back racing for new pleasure sweat dewed her skin when he levered himself up to surround her nipple with his mouth he tasted salt and heat she came again crying out in shock and near panic holding tight to her he let go of the edge and took them both flying her lungs were burning her throat dry as dust she tried to swallow then gave up and dropped her head on his shoulder when her ears stopped ringing she heard the silence its stopped raining mmmhmm with a laugh she nearly managed to take a full breath were going to have a hell of a time explaining these rug burns enjoying the sensation she ran her hands over his damp back i need about a gallon of water ill get it okay ill wait right here though it pains me to admit it i think im a little too weak as yet to cart you over to the sink lie shifted her weight and grinned as she rolled limply onto the rug he got up to fill a glass then stopped and looked at her her skin iy flushed all over her har a tangled red halo around her face was rosily her mouth was soft still swollen and slightly curved in contentment on impulse he set the glass down and lifted his camera her eyes flew open when she heard the click of the shutter she yelped instinctively crossing her arms over her breasts what the hell are you doing stealing moments he thought he was going to need them christ you look good he crouched clicked off another shot as her eyes widened stop that are you crazy im naked you look incredible all rumpled and flushed and freshly ticked dont cover yourself youve got beautiful breasts nathan she only folded her arms more protectively put that camera down why he lowered it but continued to grin you can develop them yourself whos to see theres nothing much more artistic and visually stunning than a nude study fine keeping one arm strategically bent she held out a hand let me take you sure he offered the camera amused to see her frown of surprise you arent the least bit embarrassed no she angled her head toward the camera he still held i want that roll of film well i wasnt planning on taking it in to fotomat darling he glanced down checked the number of shots left just one more in here let me take it just your face just my face she agreed and relaxed enough to smile at him there now i want that film okay he moved quickly when she lowered her arm and got off the last shot damn it you said it was out i lied roaring with laughter he rose and set the camera on the table but its out now ill want to see the contacts so i can pick out the prints i want if you think im going to develop that film youre mistaken she got up and grabbed the camera the pictures you took of the storm are in there he said it with a smile on his face that widened as he saw her struggle between the urge to rip out the roll and ruin it and the need to preserve her own shots that was very sneaky nathan i thought so dont put that back on he said when she bent down to retrieve her shirt its still damp ill get you a dry one thanks she watched him walk to the bedroom pursing her lips as she studied his tight muscular buns next time she decided as she tugged on her slacks shed make sure she had her own camera handy and with that thought in mind she unloaded the film and tucked it into her back pocket he tossed her a tshirt when he came back out then fastened the dry jeans hed pulled on ill walk back to sanctuary with you well check on the status of things mi right the search parties will probably be heading out again she combed her fingers through her hair to untangle it its going to be a mess out there from the storm id put some boots on if i were you he glanced down at her olivegreen sneakers youre not wearing any i would if i had them handy so well both get sloppy he took her hand and watched surprise flicker into her eyes when he lifted it to kiss her knuckles then tonight ill take you out to dinner out to dinner well in to dinner well sit in the dining room look at menus order wine im told people do that all the time its silly i live there i dont i want to have dinner with you the kind of evening where you sit across from each other at a table with chandles between have conversation where other people pretend theyre not watching us and thinking what an attractive couple we make he picked up a ball cap from the coerce table and snugged it over her hair and i can look at you all through the meal and think about making love to you again its called romance im not any good at romance you said that about sex you were wrong he took her hand and walked to the door lets see how this works out maybe brian will whip up some tan she had to laugh people are going to think its pretty strange for me to take a table at the inn itll give them something to talk about their feet squelched into the soggy ground when they reached the bottom of the stairs the heat was rolling back sending the steam rising turning the air thick the forest looked ripe fertile and darkly green water dripped and plopped from leaves sending fresh showers over their heads as they turned toward the river churned everything up jo commented waters running high and fast it may crest over the banks but i doubt itll cause any damage here she detoured for a closer look philosophically accepting ruined shoes as she sank past her ankles in muck daddyll want to take a look i imagine but theres not much to be done itll be more worrisome over at the campground the beach should be fine though the winds werent high enough to take down the dunes well have a nice crop of shells washed up from it you sound like your fathers daughter distracted she looked over her shoulder no i rarely give a thought to what goes on here during hurricane season i might pay more attention to the weather reports for this area but we havent been hit hard that way in years jo ellen you love this place it shouldnt worry you to admit that its not the center of my life no but it matters to you he stepped closer a lot of things a lot of people can matter to yoliwithot taking over your life you matter to me alarm jingled in her heart and she took a hasty step back nathan she nearly fell as the ground sucked at her feet youre going to end up back in the river he took her arms in a firm grip then youll accuse me of pushing you in again thats not what im doing im not pushing you jo ellen but im not going to be sorry if you slip i like keeping my feet under me and knowing where the ground gives before i step on it sometimes youve got to try new territory this is unexplored ground for me too thats not true youve been married you she wasnt you he said quietly and jo went still in his arms i never felt about her the way im feeling about you right now she never looked at me the way youre looking at me and i never wanted her as much as i want you that was what was wrong with it all along i didnt know it didnt understand how much of it was my fault until i saw you again youre moving too fast for me then keep up and goddamn it jo ellen he said with an impatient sigh as he tipped her head back give in a little she tasted the impatience when his mouth met hers and the need that went deeper than shed allowed herself to see the quick flare of panic inside her fought with a shiver of delight and the warm stream that shimmered in her blood felt like hope maybe youre not pushing she didnt resist when he gathered her closer but i feel like im sinking she rested her head on his shoulder willed her brain to clear part of me just wants to let it happen and another part keeps fighting to kick back to the surface i dont know which is best for me or for you he needed that glimmer of hope the whisper in his heart that promised if she loved him enough if they loved each other enough they could survive what had happened and what was to come why dont you think about which makes you happier instead of which may be best it sounded so simple that she started to smile she watched the river flow wondered if it was time for her just to dive in and see where it took her she could almost see herself riding that current see herself rushing along it trapped under the surface staring up dragged down away from air and light the scream ripped from her throat had her sinking to her knees before he could catch her jo for gods sake in the water in the water she clamped a hand over her mouth to hold back the bubbling hysteria is it mama is it mama in the water stop it he knelt beside her dragged her around by the shoulders until her face was close to his look at me i want you to stop it im not letting you fall apart im not letting it happen so you just look at me and pull back i saw she had to gulp for air in the water i sawim losing my mind nathan i cant hold on to it yes you can desperately he pulled her close you can hold on to me just hold on to me as she shuddered against him he looked down grimly at the surface of the river and saw the pale ghost staring up at him jesus god his arms tightened convulsively on jo then he shoved her back and slid heedlessly into the rising river shes in here he shouted grabbing on to a downed limb to keep himself from heng swept clear give me a hand with her what youre not losing your mind panting with the effort nathan reached out with his free hand and gripped hair theres someone in here help me get her out oh my god without hesitation now jo bellied up to the edge fighting to anchor her toes in the slippery bank give me your hand nathan try to hold on to her and ill help pull you up is she alive is she breathing hed gotten a closer look now a clearer look and his stomach lurched with horror and pity the river hadnt been kind no he spoke flatly shifting his grip on the limb his gaze lifted to jos no shes not alive ill hold on here keep her from going downriver you get to sanctuary for help she was calm now cold and calm well get her out together she said and stretched out her hand it was a hideous grisly task twice nathan lost his grip as he tried to free susan peterss hair from the spearing branches that had trapped her body he went under fiercely blanking out his mind when her arms knocked into his belly he could hear jo calling him concentrated on the desperate calm in her voice as together they struggled to free what was left of susan from the river ignoring her lurching stomach jo slid farther over the bank with the water lapping and rushing over her chin when she hooked her arms under the body her breath came short and shallow as for one gutwrenching moment she was face to face with death she knew the shutter in her mind had clicked capturing the image preserving it making it part of her forever then she hauled grunting digging knees and feet into the soggy ground she let the body roll couldnt bear even to watch she thrust her hands out felt nathans grip them slip clutch again when he was chesthigh out of the water squirming his way free from the river she rolled away and retched go back to the cottage he coughed violently spat to clear the taste of river and death from his mouth ill be all right she rocked back on her heels felt the first hot tears flow down her icy cheeks i just need a minute ill be all right she had no more color than what they had pulled from the river did and she was shaking so hard he was surprised he couldnt hear her bones clattering go back to the cottage you need dry clothes he closed a hand over hers you have to call sanctuary for help we cant leave her like this jo no no youre right steeling herself she turned her head the body was paste gray and bloated the hair dark and matted and slick with debris but she had once been a woman ill get something to cover her ill get her a blanket can you make it on your own she nodded and though her body felt hollowed out and frighteningly brittle she pushed herself to her feet she looked down at him his face was pale and filthy his eyes reddened from the water she thought of the way hed gone into the angry river without hesitation without a thought for anything but what needed to be done nathan he used the heel of his hand to wipe the mud off his chin and the gesture was sharp what nothing she murmured later he waited until he heard her footsteps recede waited until he heard nothing but the roar of the river and the thud of his own laboring heart then he pulled himself over to the body forced himself to turn it to look shed been pretty oncehe knew that she would never be pretty again gritting his teeth he touched her easing her head to the side until he could see until he could be sure there scoring her neck were livid red bruises he snatched his hand away drew up his knees and pressed his face into the filthy denim of his jeans sweet jesus sweet jesus what was happening here fear was worse than grief sharper than guilt and when one rolled into the other it left the soul sickened slill he had himself under control when jo came back she hadnt changed her clothes but he said nothing just helped her spread the thin yellow blanket over the body theyre coming she scrubbed her fingers over her month brian and kirby i got bri on the phone told him told him he said hed bring her a doctor but wasnt going to tell anyone else until she trailed off looked helplessly into the trees why would she have come up here nathan why in gods name would she have gone into the river maybe she fell in the dark hit her head its horrible i was prepared that wed find her drowned washed up on the beach somehow this is worse only yards from his door was all he could think only yards from where hed just made love to jo where he had dared the gods he thought with a hard shudder had the body come downriver or had it been put in here so close he could almost have seen it from his kitchen window on a clear afternoon she slipped her hand into his concerned that it was still icy and as lifeless as the body that lay on the bank youre soaked through and frozen go get into dry clothes ill wait for them im not leaving im not leaving you or her thinking of warmth and comfort she put her arms around him that was the kindest and bravest thing ive ever seen anyone do she pressed her lips to his throat wanting to feel him give respond you went in for her you could have left her but you went in getting her out wouldnt have mattered to some it mattered to you youre a good man nathan ill never forget what you did he closed his eyes tight then drew away without touching her theyre coming he said flatly even as he turned brian and kirby came hurrying down the path kirby took a quick look at both of them go inside get in a hot shower ill take a look at you shortly she moved past them and knelt by the blanket jo stood her ground it has to be mrs peters she was caught up on that branch she must have fallen in sometime last night and the storm brought her downriver jo steadied herself reached for nathans hand again as brian knelt beside yirby brian nodded grimly when kirby folded the blanket down thats her they came in for meals a couple of times goddanm it he sat back on his heels scrubbed his hands over his face ill go find her husband we need to take her somewheresomewhere better than this no she cant be moved yirby fought her words out over the thick beat of her heart you need to call the police and tell them to get out here quickly i dont believe she drowned gently she lifted the chin exposed the raw bruising it looks as though she was strangled she was murdered how could this be how could this happen lexy curled up tight in the corner of the couch in the family parlor she gripped her hands together to keep herself from biting her nails people dont get murdered on desire people just dont kirby has to be wrong well find out soon enough late switched the ceiling fan up to high to try to stir the heavy air the police will tell us either way that poor womans dead and her husband jo ellen stop prowling so and sit drink that brandy youre bound to catch a terrible chill i cant sit jo continued to pace from window to window though she couldnt have said what she was looking for i wish you would sit lexy spoke plaintively youre about to drive me to distraction i wish gaff was here i dont see why he has to be down there with the others instead of here with me oh stop whining for five minutes jo snapped hold your own hand for a change dont dont the two of you start kate threw up her hands i cant stand it just now and i cant stand this waiting im going back out jo walked to the door ive got to see whats happening ive got to do some thing jo dont go out alone kate pressed a hand to her head im already worried sick please dont go out there alone seeing her cousin look suddenly old and shaky jo changed her mind youre right none of us should go out were just in the way you sit down kate come on now she took kates arm and led her toward the sofa beside lexy you sit down and have a brandy youre worn out ill get the brandy lexy said just give her mine jo told lexy as she rose i dont want it if fussing over me will keep the two of you from snapping at each other then fuss away she took the brandy lexy offered her and smiled weakly we should have fresh coffee for when they come in i dont know when brian last made any ill take care of it lexy leaned down to kiss kates cheek dont you worry but when she straightened she saw gaff in the doorway theyre coming in they want to talk to jo all right jo closed a hand gratefully over the one lexy touched to her arm im ready how much longer will they peck at her brian stood on the front porch listening to the jungle sounds of cicadas and peepers filling the air it cant be much longer kirby said quietly theyve had her in there nearly an hour they didnt keep nathan more than an hour she shouldnt have to go through this its bad enough she found the body helped drag it out of the water without having to go over and over it again im sure theyll make it as easy on her as they can she only sighed when he whirled and scalded her with a look brian theres nothing else to be done no other choices to be made a womans been murdered questions have to be asked jo sure as hell didnt kill her he threw himself down on the porch swing its easier for you bigcity doctor seen it all done it all maybe thats true she spoke coolly to mask the hurt but easier or harder doesnt change the facts someone decided not to let susan peters live any longer they used their hands and they choked the life out of her now questions have to be asked brian brooded into the dark theyll look toward the hush now i dont know they will its the logical step something happens to wife look to the husband odds are hes the one who did it th looked to my father when my mother left until they were satisfied shed just left theyll take that poor bastard into some liti room and questions will have to be asked who knows maybe hid the one who decided not to let susan peters live he shifted his gaze to kirby she stood very straight very composed under the yellow glow of the porch light she still wor baggy sweats but hed seen her with the police watched her reformation rolling clinical terms off her tongue before huddlint the body with the team from the coroners office there was nothing delicate about her you should go home yirby theres nothing else for you to do here now she wanted to weep she wanted to scream she wanted to pound her fists against the clear thin wall hed suddenly erected berwcen them why are you shutting me out brian because i dont know what to do about you and i never meant to let you in in the first place but you did did i kirby or did you just jimmy the door jos shadow fell between them before she stepped out theyre finished here the police are you all right yirby moved over to her you must be exhausted i want you to go upstairs and lie down now i can give you something to help you sleep no im fine really she gave kirbys hand a quick squeeze better in fact for having gone through it step by step i just feel sad and sorry and grateful to be whole did nathan go back kate talked him into going upstairs brian rose walked closer to study her for himself she looked steadier than hed expected i dont think it would take much to persuade him to stay here tonight cops may be tromping around the river for hours yet then well persuade him you should stay too she said to yirby no ill be better at home she looked at brian theres no need for me here im sure one of the detectives will drive me back ill just get my bag youre welcome to stay brian told her but she flicked a cool composed glance over her shoulder ill be better at home she repeated and let the screen door slam shut behind her why are you letting her go jo asked quietly maybe i need to see if i can might be for the best jo thought of what nathan had said just before the world had gone mad again maybe we all should start thinking about what makes us happy instead of what might be best i know im going to try because you start running out of chances after a while ive got something to say to you that ive passed up plenty of chances to say before he shrugged his shoulders tucked his hands in his pockets in what jo thought of as his gloomy hathaway stance spill it then i love you brian the warmth of saying it was nearly eclipsed by the sheer delight of watching the astonishment on his face he decided it was a trick a feint to distract the eye before she delivered the jab and and i wish id said it sooner and more often she rose on her toes to press a brief firm kiss on his suspicious mouth of course if i had i wouldnt have the satisfaction of seeing you goggle like a trout on the line right now im going up and make kate go to bed so she can pretend not to know nathans going to sleep in my room tonight jo ellen brian found his voice by the time she reached the door then lost it again when she looked back at him go ahead she smiled broadly just say it its so much easier than you think i love you too i know youve got the best heart of all of us bri thats what worries you she closed the door quietly then went upstairs to the rest of her family i she dreamed of walking through the gardens of sancti summer smells the high summer air overhead the me and clear as a childs cutout white on black stars we sea of light monkshood and canterbury bells nodded gently in the breez their blossoms glowing white oh how she loved the purewhit blooms the way they shone in the dark fairy flowers she thought that danced while mortals slept she felt immortal herselfso strong so vivid raising her arms high she wondered she didnt simply lift off the ground and soar the night was her time as well her alone time she could drift along the garden paths like a ghost and the ring of the wind chimes was music to dance by then a shadow stepped out of the trees and the shadow became a man immortal only curious she walked toward him now running running through the forest in the blinding dark w th ran ashing viciously at her face the night was different now she was different noxy afraid pursued hunted the wind was a thousand howling wolves with fangs bared and bloody the raindrops tiny brightedged spears aimed to tear the flesh limbs whipped at her mercilessly trees sprang up to block her path she was pathetically mortal now terrifyingly mortal her breath caught on a little sob as she heard her hunter call her name but the name was annabelle jo ripped away the sheets that tangled around her legs and bolted upright even as the vision cleared away nathan laid a hand on her shoulder he wasnt lying beside her but standing and his face was masked in the dark youre all right just a dream a bad one not trusting her voice she nodded the hand on her shoulder rubbed it once absently then dropped away the gesture was a distant comfort do you want something no the fear was already fading its nothing im used to it itd be a wonder if you didnt have nightmares after today he moved away from her walked to the window turned his back she could see hed pulled on his jeans and when she ran her head over the sheets beside her she found they were cool he hadnt been sleeping beside her hadnt wanted to jo realized hed only stayed over at sanctuary because kate had made it impossible to refuse and he was only sharing the bed here because it would have been awkward otherwise but he hadnt touched her hadnt turned to her you havent slept have you no he wasnt sure he would ever close his eyes peacefully again jo glanced at the clock shed experienced her share of restless three ams maybe you should take a sleeping pill no i know this was hell for you nathan theres nothing anyone can say or do to make it better nothings ever going to make it better for tom peters he might have killed her nathan hoped it was truewith all his heart he hoped it and felt filthy for it they argued jo said stubbornly she walked out on him he could have followed her down to the cove they kept arguing and he snapped it would only take a minute a minute of rage then he panicked and carried her away hed have wanted the distance so he put her in the river people dont always kill in rage or panic he said softly bitterness rose into his throat threatening to choke him i have no business being in this house being with you what was i thinking op going back to fix what what the hell did i think i could do what are you talking about she hated the quaver in her voice but the sound of his so hard and cold chilled her he turned back to stare at her she sat in the big feminine bed her knees drawn up defensively her face a pale shadow hed made mistakes all along he realized selfish and stupid mistakes but the biggest had been to fall in love with her and to nudge her into love with hi she would hate him before it was done she would have to not now weve both had enough for now walking toward hid he thought was as hard as it would be to walk away he sat on the si of the bed ran his hands down her arms you need to sleep so do you nathan were alive she took his hand pressed to her heart getting through and going onthats important its a lesson i learned the hard way leaning forward she touched her ivs to his right now lets just help each other get through the night her eyes were dark and stayed on his as she tilted her head to warm the kiss make love with me i need to hold you he let her draw him down let himself sink she would hate him before it was done but for now love would be enough i in the morning he was gong from her bed from sanctuary and from desire i he left on the morning ferry jo stared at brian wondering how he could fry eggs when the world had just turned upside down again i passed him at dawn heading back to his cottage brian checked his order sheet and spooned up grits crises came and went he thought but people always managed to eat he said lie had some business to take care of on the mainland hed be a couple of days a couple of days i see no goodbye no see you around no anything he looked pretty ragged around the edges and so do you it hasnt been an easy twentyfour hours for anyone no but ive still got an inn to run if you want to be useful you could sweep off the terraces and patios see that the cushions are put back out life goes on right theres nothing we can do about that he scooped the eggs up neatly the glimmering yolks trembling you just do what has to be done next he watched her drag the broom out of the closet and head outside and he wondered just what in the hell he was supposed to do next im surprised people can eat the way their mouths are running lexy breezed in exchanged an empty coffeepot for a till one then slapped down new orders one more person asks me about that poor woman im going to scream theres bound to be talk theres bound to be questions you dont have to listen to them she gave herself a break resting a hip against the counter i dont think i got more than ten minutes sleep all night i dont guess any of us did is jo up yet shes out clearing off the terraces good keep her busy best thing for her she huffed out a breath when brian sent her a speculative look im not brainless bri this has to be harder on her than the rest of us harder yet after what shes already been through anything that keeps her mind off it for a fiveminute stretch is a blessing i never thought you were brainless lex no matter how hard you pretend to be im not going to worry about your insults this morning brian but i am worried about jo she turned to peek out the window and was satisfied to see her sister sweeping violently good manual labor should help and thank god for nathan hes just exactly what she needs right now hes not here she spun back around so fast that the coffee sloshed to the rim of the pot what do you mean hes not here he went over to the mainland for a few days well what in blue hell for he should be right here with jo ellen he had some business to see to business lexy rolled her eyes and grabbed the tray of new orders why isnt that just like a man just exactly like one all of you useless as a threetitted bull every last one of you she stormed out hips twitching and for some reason brian found himself in a much lighter mood women he thought cant with them cant dump them off a cliff i an hour later lexy marched outside she found jo opening the of the patio table umbrellas everythings nice and tidy here i fine and dandy go on up and get a bathing suit were going to beach what for because its there go on and change ive got sunscreen and towels here already i dont want to sit on the beach i dont think i asked what you wanted to do you need some sun and if you dont come along with me for an hour brian or kate will find something else for you to sweep up or scrub jo looked at the broom with distaste there is that all right why not its hot i could use a swim get a move on then before somebody catches us and puts us to work jo cut through the breakers took the roll then began to swim with the current shed forgotten how much she loved being in the ocean fighting against it drifting with it she could hear a girlish squeal in the distance as a couple laughed and wrestled n the surf farther out a young boy brown as a berry struggled to catch a wave and ride his inflatable raft back to shore when her arms tired she flipped onto her back the sun burned down through hazy skies and stung her eyes it was easy to close them to float when her mind drifted to nathan she cut it off he had a life of his own and so did she maybe shed started to lean just a little too much it was good that hed jerked that shoulder away so abruptly forced her to regain her own balance when he came backif he came backshed be steadier with a moan of disgust she flipped again letting her face sink into the water goddamn it she was in love with him and if that wasnt the stupidest thing shed ever done she didnt know what topped it there was no future there and why would she even think of futures she turned her head gulped in air and began to swim again they had come together by accident through circumstance and had simply taken advantage of it if theyd gotten closer than they intended that was a matter of circumstance too and circumstances changed shed changed if coming back to sanctuary had brought some pain and some misery it had also brought back to her a strength and clearsightedness that shed been missing for far too long she planted her feet let the sand shift under her as she walked through the waves to shore lexy was posed on a blanket stretched out to show off her generous cur yes she rested lazily on an elbow turning the pages of a thick paperback novel on the cover was a barechested man with amazing and improbable pecs black hair that swirled over his gleaming shoulders and an arrogant smile on his fulllipped mouth lexy gave a low murmuring sigh and flipped a page her own hair rippled in the breeze the curves of her generous breasts rose in smooth peachtoned swells over the minuscule bikini top on which neon shades of green and pink warred her long legs were slicked with lotion and her toenails were a glitter of coral she looked jo decided like an ad for some sexy resort dropping down beside her jo picked up a towel and rubbed it over her hair do you do that on purpose or is it just instinct whats that lexy tipped down her roselensed sunglasses and peered over the top arrange yourself so that every male in a hundred yards strains his neck to get a look at you oh that lips curving lexy nudged her glasses back in place thats just instinct sugar and good luck you could do the same but youd have to put your mind to it some youve gotten your figure back since youve been home and that black tank suits not a bad choice looks athletic and sleek some men go for that she tipped her glasses down again nathan seems to nathan hasnt seen me in this suit then hes in for a treat if he comes back course hell come back youre smart youll make him pay just a little for going off jo scooped up a handful of sand let it drift through her finger im in love with him of course you are why wouldnt you be in love with him lexy jo frowned at the glittering grains sand that clung to her hand oh lexy sat up crossed her pretty legs and grinned that nice you sure took your time falling but you picked a winner i hate it jo grabbed more sand and squeezed it into her fist i hate feeling this way being this way it ties my stomach up in knots its supposed to ive had mine tied up dozens of times it was always real easy to loosen it up again her mouth went into a pout as she looked out to sea until now im having a harder time of that with gaff he loves you he always has its different for you its different for everybody were all built different inside thats what makes it so interesting jo tilted her head you know lex sometimes youre absolutely sensible i never expect it then there it is i guess i need to tell you what i told brian last night whats that i love you lexy she bent over and touched her lips to her sisters cheek i really do i know that jo youre ornery about it but you always loved us she let out a breath as she decided to make her own confession i guess thats why i got so mad at you when you went away and i was jealous you of me because you werent afraid to go yes i was jo rested her chin on her knee and watched the waves batter the shore i was terrified sometimes im still scared of being out there of not being able to do what i need to do or doing it but failing at it well i failed and i can tell you it sucks you didnt fail lexy you just didnt finish she turned her head will you go back i dont know i was sure i would her eyes clouded misted between gray and green trouble is it gets easy to stay here let time go by then ill just get old and wrinkled and fat oh what are we talking about this for annoyed with herself lexy shook her head picked out a cold can of pepsi from the little cooler beside her we should be talking about something interesting like i was wondering she popped the top took a long cooling sip then ran her tongue lazily over her top lip just how is sex with nathan jo snorted out a laugh no she said definitely and rolled over to lie on her stomach on a scale of one to ten lexy poked jos shoulder or if you had to pick one adjective to describe it no jo said again just one little bitty adjective i mean would it be incredible she asked leaning down close to jos car or would it be fabulous maybe memorable jo let out a small sigh stupendous she said without opening her eyes its stupendous oh stupendous lexy waved a hand in front of her face oh i like that stupendous does he keep his eyes open or closed when he kisses you depends he does both that gives me the shivers youd never know which i just love that so how about when he lexy though a giggle escaped jo kept her eyes tightly closed im not going to describe nathans lovemaking technique for you im going to take a nap wake me up in a bit and to her surprise she dropped like a stone into sleep nathan paced the aging turkish car pet in the soaring two level library of dr jonah kauffmans brownstone outside and two dozen stories down new york was sweltering under a massive heat wave here in the diglfied penthouse all was cool and polished and worlds away from the bump and grind of the streets it never felt like new york side lauffmans realm whenever nathan walked into the grand foyer with its golden woods and quiet colors he thought of english squires and country houses one of nathans earliest commissions had been to design the library to shift walls and ceilings to accommodate kauffmans enormous collection of books in the understated and traditional style that suited one of the top neurologists in the country the warm chestnut wood the wide intricately carved moldings the tall sweep of triple windows set back to form a cozy alcove had been nathans choices kauffman had left it all up to him chuckling whenever nathan would ask for an opinion roure tle doctor on this ease nathan dont ask me to collaborate on the choice of structural beams and i wont ask you to assist in brain surgery now nathan struggled to compose himself as he waited this time around kauffman was the doctor and nathans present his fil ture every choice large or small that he would ever make were in kauffmans skilled hands it had been six days since hed left desire six desperately long days kauffman strode in slid the thick pocket doors shut behind him sorry to make you wait nathan you should have helped yourself to a brandy but brandys not your drink is it well ill have one and you can pretend to join me i appreciate your seeing me here doctor and your doing all this yourself come now youre part of the family kauffman lifted a baccarat decanter from a sideboard to pour two snifters he was tall nearly six five an imposing man both straight and trim after seventy years of living his hair remained thick and he allowed himself the vanity of wearing it brushed back like a flowing white mane he sported a neat beard and mustache that surrounded his somewhat thin mouth he preferred the nononsense lines of british suits the elegance of italian shoes and he never failed to appear perfectly and elegantly turned out but it was his eyes that drew the onlookers attention first and most often held it they were dark and keen under heavy lids and sweeping black brows those eyes warmed as he offered nathan a snifter sit down nathan and relax it wont be necessary to drill into your brain anytime in the foreseeable future nathans stomach did a long slow turn the tests all of them and you requestedrather you insisted onquite an extensive battery of tests are negative ive gone over the results myself as you asked you have no tumors no shadows no abnormalities whatsoever what you have nathan is a very healthy brain and neurosystem now sit down i will his legs gave way easily enough and he sank into the butterysoft leather of a wingback mansize chair thank you for all the time and trouble but i wonder if i shouldnt get a second opinion kauffman raised those dramatic black brows as he sat down across from nathan he automatically lifted the pleats of his trousers so they would fall correctly i consulted with one of my associates on your tests his opinion corroborates with mine youre welcome of course to go elsewhere no though he didnt care for brandy nathan took a quick swallow and let it slide through his system im sure you covered all the bases more than the ct and the mri scans were both perfectly normal the physical you underwent the blood work and so forth only served to prove that youre a thirtyyearold man in excellent health and physical condition kauffman swirled his snifter brought it to his lips now its time you told me why you felt the need to put yourself through such intensive testing i wanted to be sure there wasnt anything physically wrong i thought i might be having blackouts have you lost time no well how would i know theres a possibility that ive been blanking out doing something duringwhat would you call ita fugue state kauffman pursed his lips hed known nathan too long to consider him an alarmist have you any evidence of that finding yourself in places without remembering how you got there no no i havent nathan allowed the relief to trickle through slowly im all right then physically youre in excellent even enviable physical condition your emotional condition is another matter youve had a hideous year nathan the loss of your family is bound to have taken its toll on you a divorce not long before that so much loss so much change i miss david and beth so much myself they were very dear to me i know nathan stared into those dark compelling eyes did you know he wondered did you suspect but all he saw on kauffmans face was sympathy and regret i know they were and kyle kauffman sighed deeply so young his death so unnecessary ive had time to cope to start to accept that my parents are gone even to thank god for it nathan thought as for kyle we hadnt been close in a long time their deaths didnt change that and you feel guilty that you dont grieve for him as you do for them maybe nathan set the snifter aside rubbed his hands over his face im not sure where the guilts rooted anymore doctor kauffman you were friends with my father for thirty years you knew him before i was born and your mother kauffman smiled as a man who has three exwives i admired their dedication to each other and their marriage to their sons you were a lovely family i hope you can find comfort in the memory of that and that nathan thought with a sinking heart was the crux of it there could be no comfort in the memories now and never would be again what would make a man a seemingly normal man living a perfectly normal life plan and commit an obscene act an unspeakable act the pressure on his chest forced nathans heart to beat too hard too thickly he picked up the snifter again but without any desire to drink would he be insane would he be ill would there be some physical cause i couldnt say nathan on such general speculation do you believe your father committed an unspeakable act i know he did before kauffman could speak nathan shook his head and rose to pace again i cantim not free to explain it to you there are others i have to talk to first nathan david delaney was a loyal friend a loving husband and a devoted father you can rest your mind on that i havent been able to rest my mind on that since the month after he was killed emotions swirled in his eyes turning them to smoke i buried him doctor kauffman him and my mother and im very tempted to bury the rest if i could be sure he said softly that its not happening again kauffman leaned forward hed been treating the human condition for half a century and knew there was no healing of the body or the brain without healing of the heart whatever it is you believe he did you cant bear the weight of it who else can who else will im the only one left nathan kauffman let out a little sigh you were a bright interesting child and you have become a talented and intelligent young man too often when you were growing up i saw you shoulder the responsibilities of others you took on your brothers far too often for you own good or for kyles dont make that mistake now over something you can neither change nor repair ive been telling myself that for the last couple of months leave it alone live your own life id decided not to dig into the past to try to concentrate on the present and forge a future theres a woman ah kauffman relaxed eased back im in love with her im delighted to hear it and would love to meet her has she been vacationing on that island you took yourself off to not exactly her family lives there shes spending some time shes had difficulties of her own actually i met her when we were children when i saw her again well to simplify one thing led to another i could have prevented it he moved to the window to the view of central park which was thick and green with summer perhaps i should have why would you deny yourself happiness theres something i know that affects her if i tell her shell despise me more i dont know what it will do to her emotionally because the park made him think of the forest on desire he turned away from it would it be better for her to go on believing something that hurts her but isnt true or to know the truth and have to live with pain she might not be able to bear ill lose her if i tell her and i dont know if i can live with myself if i dont is she in love with you shes beginning to be if i let things go on as they are she will be a ghost of a smile flitted around his mouth shed hate hearing me say that as if it were inevitable as if she had no control over it kauffman heard the warmth come back into nathans voice the boy had always been his favorite he admitted privately even among his own grandchildren ah an independent woman always more interestingand more difficult shes fascinating and she certainly isnt easy shes strong even when shes wounded and shes been wounded enough shes built a shell around herself and since ive seen her again ive watched it crack watched her open up maybe ive even helped that happen and inside shes soft giving you havent once said what she looks like kauffman found that to be the telling mark physical attraction had led him into three hot marriages followed by three chilly divorces more was needed for the long often sweaty haul shes beautiful nathan said simply shed prefer to be ordinary but its impossible jo doesnt trust beauty she trusts competency and honesty nathan finished staring down into the brandy hed barely touched i dont know what to do truth is admirable but it isnt always the answer i cant tell you what choice to make but ive always believed that love when genuine holds perhaps you should ask yourself which would be more loving giving her the truth or remaining silent if i remain silent the foundation we build on will already have a crack still im the only one alive who can tell her doctor kauffman nathan lifted his gaze and his eyes stormed with emotion im the only one left nathan didnt return to the island the next day or the day after by the third day jo had convinced herself it didnt matter she was hardly sitting around waiting for him to sail across the sound and scoop her up like a pirate claiming his booty on the fourth day she was weepy despising herself for wandering down to the ferry twice a day hoping to catch sight of him by the end of a week she was furious and spent a great deal of her time snapping at anyone who risked speaking to her in the interest of restoring peace kate bearded the lion in jos room where she had gone to sulk after a hissing match with lexy what in the world are you doing holed up indoors on such a pretty morning moving briskly kate whisked back the curtains jo had pulled over the windows sunlight beamed in enjoying my privacy if youve come in here to try to convince me to apologize to lexy youre wasting your time you and lexy can fight your own battles just like always as im concerned kate put her hands on her hips but youll your tone when you speak to me young lady i beg your pardon jo said coolly but this is my room i dont care if youre sitting on top of your own mountain wont bare your claws on me now ive been as patient as i know hid to be these last few days but youve mooned around and snarled around here long enough then maybe its time i should think about going home thats your decision to make oh shake yourself loose jo ellen kate ordered with a snap in her own voice the mans only been gone a week and hell certainly be back jo firmed her jaw i dont know what or whom youre referring to before she could stop herself kate snorted dont think you can out ladeda me ive been at it more years kate sat down on the bed where jo was sprawled under the pretense of selecting the final prints for her book a blind man on a galloping horse could see that nathan delaneys got you in a dither and its likely the best thing to happen to you in years i am not in any way any shape any form in a dither youre more than halfivay in love with him and it wouldnt surprise me in the least if hed gone off like this to nudge you over the rest of the way since that hadnt occurred to her jo felt her blood heat to a boil then hes made a very large miscalculation going off without a word is hardly the way to win my affections then do you want him to know youve been moping around here the whole time hes been gone kate lifted a brow as she saw the flush of anger heat jos cheeks there are plenty whod be happy to tell him so if you keep this up id hate for you to give him that satisfaction i dont intend to give him so much as the time of day should he decide to come back kate patted jos knee i couldnt agree more wary of a trap jo narrowed her eyes i thought you liked him i do i like him very much but that doesnt mean i dont think he deserves a good swift kick in the rear end for making you unhappy and id be mighty disappointed in you if you gave him the opportunity to crow over it so get up she ordered rising herself go on about your business take your camera and go along and when he comes back all hell see is that your life went on without him youre right youre absolutely right im going to call my publisher and give them the final goahead on the last prints then im going to go out take some new shots ive got an idea for another book kate smiled as jo scrambled up and began to pull her shoes on thats wonderful youll have pictures of the island in it then all of them people this time too faces no ones going to accuse me of being lonely of hiding behind the lens ive got more than one facet to me of course you do sweetie pie ill get out of your way so you can get to work all but vibrating with the pleasure of success kate strolled out maybe now she thought theyd have some peace the adrenaline carried jo through that day and into the next it fueled her this new ambition for the first time in her carcer she hunted up faces with enthusiasm began to study and dissect them she thrilled at the way gaffs eyes twinkled under the brim of his cap the way his hand gripped a hammer she hounded brian in the kitchen using charm when she could threats when she couldnt to draw the right expression to produce the right body language lexy was easy she would pose endlessly but jos favorite shot was one of lexy and giff the foolishly happy expressions on their faces as gaff swept lexy up to spin her in circles just on the edge of the garden she even trooped after her father using silence to lull him into relaxing then capturing the quiet thoughtfulness in his face as he looked out over the salt marsh its time you put that thing away sams brows drew together in irritated embarrassment as she aimed the camera at him again ri along and play with that somewhere else it stopped being play when they started paying me turn just little to the right and look out toward the water he didnt move a muscle i dont recollect you ever being such a pest before ill have you know im a very famous photographer thousands cheer when i aim my lens she clicked quickly when a faint smile tugged at his mouth youre so handsome daddy and you look so masterful out here youre so damned famous you shouldnt have to flatter people to get their picture she laughed and lowered the camera true enough but you are handsome i was taking some shots over at elsie pendletons the widow pendleton jo added wiggling her eyebrows she made a point to ask after you several times elsie pendletons been looking for a man to replace the one she buried since she tossed the first handful of dirt on his coffin it aint by any means going to be me for which good sense your family thanks you he found his lips trembling again shook his head as much over the reaction as the cause youre awfully chipper today a nice change dont you think i got tired of myself she crouched down to change lenses and it occurred to me that a corner riceded to be turned maybe coming here was the start of it she paused for a moment just to look out over the shimmering marsh i facing some things myself included and realizing that maybe if i didnt feel loved it was because i hadnt let anyone love me she glanced up saw that he was watching her searching her face dont look for her in me daddy jo closed her eyes as the pain stabbed through her dont look for her in me anymore it hurts me when you dojo ellen all my life ive tried to stop looking like her in college when the other girls were fussing and primping i held back if i fussed id have to look in the mirror and id see her just the way you do when you look at me her eyes swam as she straightened what do i have to do daddy to make you see who i am i do see i cant help but see her too but i do see you jo ellen dont go spilling over on me here im useless with that female stuff he stuffed his hands in his pockets and turned away you get hold of yourself now its lexy who leaks at the drop of a hat not you damn girlil leak if you look crosseyed and if she isnt leaking shes floune ing she dont marry that gaff soon and get on with things ill lose my mind jo gave a watery chuckle why daddy i didnt know you loved her enough to let her drive you crazy course i love her shes mine isnt she he spoke gruffly and made himself turn back to face jo so are you yes she smiled and let the ache pass away so am i i when the light no longer pleased her jo locked herself in her dark room there was excitement there as well from film to negatives from negatives to contacts these she pored over scrutinizing details flaws shadows through her loupe out of a dozen she might select one that satisfied her strict requirements still her drying line filled rapidly with prints she felt were worthy when she came to an unmarked roll of film she clicked her tongue in annoyance careless of her she thought she set the timer flicked off the lights and began the developing process the dark soothed her she could move competently even mechanically by feel alone anticipation hummed what would she see here what would she find what frozen moment would be preserved forever simply because she had chosen it she turned on the red bulb washed the room in that eerie work mans lighting and gave a choked cry that was part shock part laughter as she stared at the negative of herself nude sprawled on nathans carpet jesus thatll teach me not to mark film she held up the roll studying the other negatives the ones shed taken of the storm looked promising and her mouth pursed as she examined the earlier shots ones nathan must have taken along the way there was one of dunes across the meadow where the flowers were blooming and the sea beyond rolled in a high frothy crest decent composition she mused for an amateur of course if she bothered to take it to contact stage shed undoubtedly find several major flaws her eyes were drawn back to the end of the roll her own face her own body even as her hand reached for the scissors to destroy the negatives she paused was she going to be that prudish that stubborn and not satisfy her own curiosity she was the only one who had to see them after all on impulse she set back to work it couldnt hurt to make a set of contacts from the roll she could destroy the ones of herself later after shed taken a good look at them she didnt hum along with the radio as she worked now slic felt too uneasy and too excited to hear the music that tinkled out the sheet was barely dry when she slapped it onto her light table and applied the loupe she caught her breath as the images enlarged and focused she looked so wanton she supposed would be the word her eyes half closed her lips just curved in obvious sexual satisfaction her body looked almost ripe apparently she had gotten her figure back without even noticing she certainly had curves in the next her eyes were fully open and round with shock her hands were halfway up to her breasts movement frozen by the fast film there was no denying that she lookedhow had he put it rumpled and sexy oh god she had never allowed herself to be that exposed to anyone before shed let that happen and now for just a moment she could admit she wanted to let it happen again she wanted to let him touch her to make her feel desired and reckless there was a yearning deep in the pit of her stomach to be that woman again the woman hed seen and captured on film to let him take control of her and to know that she had the power to take control of him hed given that to her and by preserving that moment had made her look straight at it and see what she could have with him and what she could lose without him you bastard nathan i hate you for this she got up quickly stuffed the sheet deep into a drawer no she wouldnt destroy it she would keep it as a reminder whenever she felt herself tempted to trust a man again to give that much to a man she would take it back out study it and remind herself how easily they walked away jo ellen lexys voice came through the door as her knock sounded sharp and loud im working in here well i know that but you might want to finish up quick fast and in a hurry guess who came in on the late ferry brad pitt dont i wish but you might like this better nathan delaney just walked in the kitchen big as life and twice as handsome and hes looking for you jo lifted a fist to her heart and firmly shoved it back in place tell him im busy i already gave him the cold shoulder for you sugar told him i didnt see why you should drop what you were doing and come running just because he blew back onto desire like an ill wind jo found her lips curving in appreciation she could easily visualize the scene with lexy playing the chilly southern belle to the hilt i appreciate it but i have to tell youoh open this door jo im tired of talking through it because lexy had just climbed to the top of jos most favored list she obliged snicking open the lock and opening the door enough that she could lean on the jamb id appreciate it if youd tell him im not interested in adjusting my schedule to suit his whims i will thats nicely put but jo he tooks so windblown and sexy and on the edge of something lexy rolled her eyes in pure female appreciation it gave my heart a nice flutter just to look at him well you can just stop fluttering whose side are you on yours honey lamb absolutely one hundred percent she kissed jos cheek to prove it he has to be punished no doubt about it if you need some advice on how to go about it im more than willing to give you some ideas ive got plenty of my own thanks but she rolled her shoulders to ease the tension tell him i have no desire to see or speak to him and that i expect to be busy with a great many more important matters than him for quite some time i wish youd tell him that yourself just that way i believe youve got a real knack for this lexys grin spread wide as she wound a lock of hair around her finger ill go down and tell him then ill come back up here and tell you what he has to say to that this isnt high school no its more interesting and more fun oh i know youre scalded good and proper jo she patted her sisters cheek id be as spitting mad as a stoinpedon cat myself but just think how satisfying its going to be when he crawls dont you take him back until he does and he comes up with at least two bouquets of flowers and a nice expensive present it should be cwclry jos humor made a rapid return lexy youre a manipulative and materialistic woman and proud of it honey you listen to your baby sister and youll end up owning that man now i figure hes been down there waiting and sweating long enough for the next slap she rubbed her hands together ill make it count for you dont you worry jo stayed leaning against the doorjamb as lexy flounced away i bet you will she murmured and ill owe you big for it satisfied jo turned back into the darkroom she tidied her workbench rearranged her bottles of chemicals then put them back in their original positions she examined her nails and wondered if she should let lexy give her a manicure after all when she heard the footsteps she turned toward the door prepared to hear lexys report when nathan filled the doorway his temper shot straight into hers i need you to come with me his voice was clipped and anything but apologetic i believe you were informed im busy and you havent been invited into this room save it scarlett he grabbed her hand and pulled when her free one reared back whipped forward and cracked hard across his face he narrowed his eyes and nodded fine we do it the hard way the room turned upside down so rapidly she didnt even get out the curse burning on her tongue he was halfway out of the room with her slung over his shoulder before she got past the shock enough to fight get your goddamn bellycrawling yankee bastard hands off me she punched at his back furious that she couldnt manage a full swing you think you can send your sister to brush me off in a pigs eye he shoved open the door with his shoulder and started down the narrow stairway ive been traveling the whole fucking day to get here and youll have the courtesy to listen to what i need to say courtesy courtesy what does a snake oil new york hotshot know about courtesy in the confines of the stairway her struggles only resulted in her rapping her head against the wall i hate you her ears rang fromboth the blow and the humiliation ive prepared myself for that grim and determined he hauled her into the kitchen both lexy and brian froze and gaped excuse me he said shortly and carried her outside while she left a trail of threats and curses behind them oh lexy sighed long and deep holding a hand to her heart wasnt that the most romantic thing youve ever seen in all your life shit brian set down the pie hed just taken out of the oven shell rip his face off first chance she gets a lot you know about romance lexy leaned against the counter twenty dollars says hes got her in bed fully willing within an hour brian heard jo scream out something about castrating a certain yankee son of a bitch and nodded youre on darling sat in simmering silence as nathan drove the jeep across hissing shell road she wouldnt give him the satisfaction of leaping out of a moving vehicle or of running away once he stopped it she would simply tear his skin into bloody shreds when they acre no longer in danger of running off the road this isnt the way i wanted to go about this nathan muttered i need to talk to you its important a hell of a time you pick to pull some lame female coldshoulder routine ignoring her low purring sound of warning he dug a deeper hole for himself i dont mind a fight under any reasonable circumstances i dont mind a good kickass fight clears the air but these arent reasonable circumstances and you having your nose out of joint is only complicating an already painful situation so its my fault she sucked in her breath as he jerked the jeep to a halt at the cottage this is my fault its not a matter of fault jo thats the whole he broke off abruptly too busy defending himself to bother with more words she didnt go at him with teeth and nails and heated accusations she waded in with balledup fists and the first several blew right past his guard jesus jesus christ he wished he could laugh at them he wished to god he could just drag her close pin those surprisingly well toned arms with his and just howl at the pair of them he tasted blood in his mouth wasnt entirely sure his jaw wouldnt turn out to be broken and finally managed to hold her down on the seat while both of them panted for breath would you stop it would you pull out some modicum of control and stop trying to beat my brainswhich im assured are in perfect working orderto a bloody pulp he tightened his grip shifting fast as she tried to bring her knee up and render him helpless i dont want to hurt you well thats too bad because i want to hurt you i want to send you off limping for treating me this way im sorry he lowered his brow to hers and tried to catch his breath im sorry jo she refused to soften refused to acknowledge the little trip her heart experienced at the utter despair in his voice you dont even know what youre sorry for for more than you know he eased back met her eyes please come inside i have things to tell you things i wish i didnt have to tell you after i do you can beat me black and blue and i wont lift a hand to stop you i swear it something was wrong horribly wrong the anger dropped away into fear she kept her voice cool before her imagination ran wild thats quite an arrangement ill come in and you can say what you have to say then were finished nathan she shoved him away and pushed open her car door because nobody walks away from me she said in a low vibrant voice nobody ever again his heart sank but he led the way inside switched on the lights id like you to sit down i dont need to sit down and what youd like doesnt interest me how could you go that way even as she rounded on him she wrapped her arms around herself in defense how could you leave my bed and just go without a word and stay away when you had to know how it would make me feel if you were tired of me you still could have been kind tired of you sweet jesus jo there hasnt been a minute of this past eight days that i havent thought of you wanted you do you think im stupid enough or needy enough to believe that kind of lie if youd thought of me wanted me you couldnt have turned your back on me as if none of it mattered had ever mattered if it hadnt mattered didnt matter more than anything else in my life i could have stayed and we wouldnt be having this conversation you hurt me you humiliated me you i love you she jerked back as if to avoid a blow you expect my knees to go weak now you think you can say that and make me run into your arms no i wouldnt love you if you couldnt stand there and spit at me after id said it he walked to her gave in to the need to touch her just a brush of his fingertips over her shoulders and i do love you jo ellen maybe i always did maybe that sevenyearold girl ruined me for anyone else i dont know but i need you to believe me iced to say it and i aced you to believe it before i start the rest she stared into is eyes and now her knees did start to tremble you do mean it enough to put my past preset and future in your hands he took hers in his for a moment studied them memorized them then let them go i went back to new york theres a friend of the family a doctor a neurologist i wanted him to run some tests on me tests baffled she pushed at her hair what kind of oh my god it struck her like a fist hard in the heart youre sick a neurologist what is it a tumor her blood shivered to ice in her veins but you can have treatment you can im not sick jo theres no tumor theres nothing wrong with me but i had to be sure theres nothing wrong slic folded lier arms again hugged them to her body i dont understand you went back to new york to have tests run on your brain when theres nothing wrong with you i said i needed to be sure because i thought i might have had blackouts or been sleepwalking or had fugues and have maybe killed susan peters she lowered herself gingerly bracing a hand on the back of the chair as she sat on the arm she never took her eyes off his why would you think such a crazy thing because she was strangled here on the island because her body was hidden because her husband her family her friends might have gone the rest of their lives not knowing what had happened stop it she couldnt get her breath had to fight back the urge to clap her hands over her ears her heart was beating too fast making her head spin her skin damp she knew the signs the panic waiting slyly to spring i dont want to hear any more of this i dont want to tell you any more but neither one of us has a choice he braced himself not only to face it but to face her my father killed your mother thats insane nathan she willed herself to get up and run but she couldnt move and its cruel its both and its also the truth twenty years ago my father took your mothers life no your fathermr davidwas kind he was a friend this is crazy talk my mother left her voice shuddered and broke then rose she just left she never left desire he he put her body in the marsh buried her in the salt marsh why are you saying this why are you doing this because its the truth and ive avoided it too long already nathan forced himself to say the rest to finish it while she shut her eyes and shook her head fiercely he planned it from the minute he saw her when we arrived that summer no no stop this i cant stop whats already happened he kept a journal and evidence in a safedeposit box i found it all after he and my mother died you found it tears leaked through her lashes as she wrapped her arms tight around her body and rocked you came back here i came back here to face it to try to remember what that summer had been like what he had been like then and to try to decide whether to leave it all buried or to tell your family what my family had done the familiar flood of sick panic rushed through her roared in her head raced through her blood you knew you knew all along and you came back here you took me to bed knowing nausea made her dizzy as she surged to her feet you were inside me rage sliced through her an instant before her hand cracked across his cheek i let you inside me she slapped him again viciously he neither defended himself nor evaded the blows do you know how that makes me feel hed known she would look at him just like this with hate and disgust even fear he had no choice but to accept it i didnt face it my father he was my father he killed her he took her away from us and all these years jo i didnt know until after hed died ive been trying to come to grips with it for months i know what youre going through now you cant know she flung the words out she wanted to hurt him to scar him to make him suffer i cant stay here i cant look at you dont she jerked back hands fisted when he reached out dont put your hands on me i could kill you for ever putting them on me you bastard you stay away from me and my family when she ran nathan didnt try to stop her he couldnt but he followed her erratic dash keeping her in sight if he could do nothing else he would make certain she arrived safe at sanctuary but it wasnt to sanctuary that she fled she couldnt go home couldnt bear it she couldnt get her breath couldnt clear her vision part of her wanted to simply fall to the ground curl up and scream until her mind and body were empty of grief but she was terrified that shed never find the strength to get up again so she ran without thought of destination through the trees through the dark with images flipping hideously through her head the photograph of her mother coming to life the eyes opening confusion fear pain the mouth stretching wide for a scream pain stabbed into jos side like a knife she gripped it whimpering and kept running on the sand now th the ocean crashing her breath heaved out of her lungs she fell once hitting hard on her hands and knees only to scramble up and stumble back into a run she only knew she had to get away to run away from the pain and this horribly tearing sorrow she heard someone call her name and the sound of feet pounding the sand behind her she nearly tripped again righted herself then turned to fight jo honey what is it clad in only a robe her hair streaming wet from the shower yirby hurried toward her i was out on the deck and saw you dont touch me all right instinctively yirby lowered her voice gentled it why dont you come up to the house youve hurt yourself your hands are bleeding confused jo looked down saw the scrapes and the slow trickle of blood on the heels of her hands i fell i know i saw you come on up ill clean them for you i dont needtheyre all right she couldnt even feel her hands then her legs began to tremble her head began to spin he killed my mother kirby he murdered my mother shes dead cautiously yirby moved closer until she could slide a supporting hand around jos waist come with me come home with me now when jo sagged she led her across the sand glancing back she saw nathan standing a few yards away in the moonlight their eyes met briefly then he turned and walked away into the dark i feel sick jo murmured sensation was creeping back tiny needle pricks all over her skin and with it the greasy churning in her stomach its all right you need to lie down lean on me and well get you inside he killed her nathan knew he told me it felt as if she were ket over her she was beginning to tremble with shock now breaths kirby ordered concentrate on breathing im just the other room for a moment im going to get something to he i dont need anything fresh panic snaked through her gripped kirbys hand hard no sedatives i can get through i have to floating now up the steps in the door of the cottage my m dead saying nothing kirby helped jo onto the bed put a lighs can of course you can kirby eased onto the bed and took jos wrist to check her pulse are you ready to tell me about it i have to tell someone i cant tell my family yet i cant face that yet i dont know what to do i dont even know what to feel the pulse rate was slowing and jos pupils were returning to normal what did nathan say to you jo jo stared at the ceiling focused on it centered herself on it he told me that his father had murdered my mother dear god horrified kirby lifted jos hand to her cheek how did it happen i dont know i dont know i couldnt listen i didnt want to listen he said his father killed her that he kept a journal nathan found it and he came back here i slept with him tears trickled out of her eyes slid away i slept with the son of my mothers murderer calm was needed now yirby knew and cool logic the wrong word the wrong tone and she was afraid jo would break in her hands jo you slept with nathan you cared for nathan and he for you he knew he came back here knowing what his father had done and that must have been terribly hard for him how can you say that furious jo pushed herself onto her elbows hard for him and courageous kirby said sorry jo how old would he have been when your mother died what difference does it make nine or ten i imagine just a little boy are you going to blame the little boy no no but hes not a little boy now and his father nathans father not nathan a sob choked out then another he took her away from me i know im so sorry kirby gathered jo close im so terribly sorry as jo wept in her arms yirby knew this storm was only the beginning it took an hour before she could think again she sipped the hot sweet tea kirby made her the sick panic had flowed away in a wash of grief now for a moment the grief was almost as soothing as the tea i knew she was dead part of me always knew from the time it happened i would dream of her as i got older i pushed the dreams away but they would always come back and they only got stronger you loved her now as horrible as things are you know she didnt leave you i cant find comfort in that yet i wanted to hurt nathan physically emotionally in every possible way to cause him pain and i did do you think thats an abnormal reaction jo give yourself a break im trying to i nearly cracked again i would have if you hadnt been there but i was yirby squeezed jos hand and youre stronger than you think strong enough to get through this i have to be she drank more tea then set the cup down i have to go back to nathans you dont have to do anything tonight but get some rest no i never asked why or how or she shut her eyes i have to have the answers i dont think i can live with this until i have the answers when i go to my family i have to know it all you could go to them now ill go with you you could ask the questions together i have to do it alone im at the center of this yyirby jos head throbbed nastily when she opened her eyes they were brutally dark in a colorless face im in love with the man whose father murdered my mother i when yirby dropped her off at nathans cottage jo could see his silhouette through the screen door she wondered if either of them would ever do a harder thing in their lives than facing the past and each other he said nothing as she climbed the steps but opened the door stepped back to let her in hed thought he would never see her again and he wasnt sure whether that would have been harder to live with or if seeing her like thispale and strickenwas worse i need to ask you i need to know ill tell you what i can she rubbed her hands together so that the small pain of her scratched palms would keep her centered did the were they involved no he wanted to turn away but forced himself to face the pain in her eyes there was nothing like that between them even in the journal he wrote that she was devoted to her family to her children her husband jo but he wanted there to be he wanted her she opened her hands they fought there was an accident her breath shuddered and the words were a plea it was an accident no god it was worse he thought by every second that passed it grew worse he knew her habits he studied them she used to walk at night around the gardens she she loved the flowers at night the dream shed had the night theyd found susan peters spun back into her mind she loved the white ones especially she loved the smells and the quiet she called it her alone time he chose the night nathan continued he put a sleeping pin into my mothers wine so she so she wouldnt know hed been gone everything he did he documented step by step in his journal he wrote that he waited for annabelle at the edge of the forest to the west of the house it was killing him by degrees to say it to look into jos face and say it he knocked her unconscious and took her into the forest he had everything set up hed already set up his lights his tripod it wasnt an accident it was planned it was premeditated it was deliberate but why she had to sit on legs stiff and brittle as twigs she stumbled to a chair i remember him he was kind to me and patient daddy took him fishing and mama would make him pecan pie now and then because he was fond of it she made a helpless sound then pressed her fingers to her lips to hold it back oh god you want me to believe he murdered her for no reason he had a purpose he did turn away now and strode into the kitchen to drag a bottle of scotch from a cupboard you could never call it a reason he splashed the liquor into a glass tossed it back quickly and hissed through the sting with his palms braced on the counter he waited for his blood to settle i loved him jo he taught me how to ride a bike how to field a grounder he paid attention whenever he traveled hed call home not just to talk to my mother but to all three of us and he listenednot just the pretense of listening some adults think a child cant see through he cared he turned back to her his eyes eloquent he would bring my mother flowers for no reason id lie in bed at night and listen to them laughing together we were happy and he was the center of it now i have to face that there was no center that he was capable of something monstrous feel carved out she managed her head seemed to be floating somewhere above her shoulders scraped out raw all these years she squeezed her eyes tight a moment your lives just went on he was the only one who knew and he was very careful our lives just went on until his ended and i went through his personal papers and found the journal and photographs photographs the floating sensation ended with a jerk photographs of my mother after she was dead he had to say it all no matter how even the thought ripped through his brain the decisive moment he called it oh my god lectures heard lectures given whirled in her head capturing the decisive moment anticipating when the dynamics of a situation will reach peak knowing when to click the shutter to preserve that most powerful image it was a study an assignment it was his purpose to manipulate to cause to control and to capture death nausea churned violently he downed more scotch pitting the liquor against the nausea it wasnt all it cant be there was something warped inside him something we never saw something no one ever saw or suspected he had friends a successful career he liked to listen to ball games on tv and read mystery novels he liked to barbecue he wanted grandchildren it was tearing him apart every word every memory there is no defense he said no absolution she stepped forward every emotion inside her coalesced and focused on one point he took photographs of her of her face her eyes of her body nudes he posed her carefully her head tilted down toward her left shoulder her right arm draped across her midriff how do you i did see she closed her eyes and spun away relief was cold painfully cold an icy layer over hot grief im not crazy i was never crazy i didnt hallucinate it was real all of it what are you talking about impatient she dug her cigarettes out of her back pocket but when she struck the match she only stared down at the flame my hands steady she muttered its perfectly steady im not going to break now i can get through it im never going to break again worried that he had pushed her over some line he moved toward her jo ellen im not crazy her head snapped up calmly she touched the flame to the tip of her cigarette im not going to shatter and fall ever again the worst is just the next thing you have to find room for and live with she blew out smoke watched it haze then vanish someone sent me a photograph of my mother one of your fathers photographs his blood chilled thats impossible i saw it i had it in my hands its what snapped me what i couldnt find room for then you told me someone was sending you pictures of yourself they were it was with them in the last package i got in charlotte and afterward when i was able to function a little i couldnt find it whoever sent it got into my apartment and took it back i thought i was hallucinating but it was real it existed it happened im the only one who could have sent it to you i didnt where are the pictures the negatives theyre gone gone how kyle wanted to destroy them them and the journal i refused i wanted time to decide what to do we argued about it his stand was that it had been twenty years what good would it do to bring it all out it could ruin both of us he was fiarious that i would even consider going to the police or to your family the next morning he was gone hed taken the photographs and the journal with him i didnt know where to find him the next i heard hed drowned i have to assume he couldnt live with it that he destroyed everything then himself the photographs werent destroyed her mind was very clear and cold they exist just like the ones of me exist i look like my mother its not a large leap to shift an obsession with her to one with me do you think i havent thought of that that it hasnt terrified me when we found susan peters and i realized how shed died i thought im the only one left jo i buried my father but did you bury your brother he stared shook his head slowly kyles dead how do you know because the reports say he got drunk and fell off a boat and what if he didnt nathan he had the photographs the negatives the journal but he did drown he was drunk stumbling drunk depressed moody according to the people who were with him on the yacht they didnt realize he was missing until well into the next morning all of his clothes his gear were still on the boat when she said nothing he spun around her and began to pace i have to accept what my father did what he was now you want me to believe my brothers alive that hes capable of all this of stalking you pushing you until you collapse of following you here and as the rest slammed into him he turned back of killing susan peters my mother was strangled wasnt she nathan yes christ she had to stay cold jo warned herself and go to the next step susan peters was raped understanding the question she was asking nathan closed his eyes yes if it wasnt her husband the police havent found any evidence to hold the husband i checked before i came back jo ellen it scraped his heart to tell her theyre going to be looking more closely into ginnys disappearance now ginny with understanding came horror the cold that had shielded her melted away in it oh no ginny he couldnt touch her could offer her nothing he left her alone stepped out onto the porch he put his hands on the rail and leaned out desperate for air when the screen door squeaked he made himself straighten what was your fathers purpose nathan what were the photographs to accomplish if he would never be able to show them to anyone perfection control not simply to observe and preserve but to be a part of the image to create it the perfect woman the perfect crime the perfect image he thought she was beautiful intelligent gracious she was worthy he watched fireflies light up the dark in quick flirtatious winks i should have told you all of you as soon as i came here i told myself i wantedneededtime to try to understand it i justified keeping it to myself because you had all accepted a lie and the truth was worse then i kept it to myself because i wanted you it got easier to rationalize it youd been hurt you were wounded it could wait until you trusted me it could wait until you were in love with me his fingers flexed and released on the railing as she stood silent behind him rationalizations are usually selfserving ming were after susan peters i couldnt ignore the truth anymore or your right to know it theres nothing i can do to change it to atone for what he did nothing i can say can heal the damage he did to you and your family no theres nothing you can do nothing you can say he took my mother and left us all to think she had abandoned us that single selfish act damaged all of our lives left a rift in our family weve never been able to heal he must have hurt her jos voice quavered so she bit down hard on her lip until she could steady it she must have been so frightened so confused shed done nothing to deserve it nothing but be who she was she drew a long breath tasted the sea and released it i wanted to blame you for it nathan because youre here because you had your mother all your life because you touched me and made me feel what id never felt before i needed to blame you for it so i did i expected you to you never had to tell me you could have buried it forgotten it i never would have known id have known and every day id have had with you would have been a betrayal he turned to her i wish i could have lived with that spared you this and saved myself but i couldnt and what now lifting her face to the sky she searched her heart am i to make you pay what cant be paid punish you for something that was done to both of us when we were children why shouldnt you bitterness clogged his throat as he looked out into the trees where the river flowed in secret silence how could you look at me and not see him and what he did and hate me for it it was exactly what she had done jo thought she had looked at him seen his father and hated he had taken it the verbal and physical blows without a word in his own defense courageous kirby had called him and shed been right how badly hed been damaged she realized she wondered why it had taken her even this long to realize that however much harm had been done to her an equal share had been done to him you dont give me much credit for intelligence or compassion obviously you have a very low opinion of me he hadnt known he had the strength left to be surprised he stared at her in disbelief i dont understand you no you certainly dont if you think that after id had time to accept it to grieve i would blame you or hold you accountable he was my father and if he was alive id kill him myself for what he did to her all of us to you ill hate him for the rest of my life there will not be forgiveness in me for him can you make room to live with it nathan or are you just going to walk away ill tell you what im going to do she rushed on before he could speak her words fast and im not going to let myself be cheated im not going to let the eh of real happiness be stolen from me but if you walk away ill hate you i can do it if i have to and no one will ever hate you more than i will she stormed back into the house slamming the door behind he stood where he was for a moment struggling to absorb shock the gratitude but it wasnt possible he stepped back into house and spoke quietly jo ellen do you want me to stay isnt that what i just said she dragged out another cigarette then furious hurled it away why should i have to lose again why should i have to be alone again how could you come here and make me fall in love with you then cut yourself out of my life because you think its best for me because you think its the honorable thing to do well the hell with your honor nathan the hell with it if it cheats me out of having what i need ive been cheated before lost what i needed desperately before and was helpless to stop it im not helpless anymore she was vibrating with fury her eyes fired with it her color high and glowing hed never seen anything or anyone more magnificent of all the things i imagined youd say to me tonight this wasnt it id prepared myself to lose you i hadnt prepared myself to keep you im not a damn cuff link nathan the laugh came as a surprise felt rusty in his throat i cant decide what i should say to you all i can think of is that i love you that might be enough if you were holding on to me when you said it his eyes stayed on hers as he walked toward her his arms were tentative at first then tightened tightened until he buried his face in her hair i love you emotions swamped him as he drew in the scent of her the taste of her skin against his lips i love you jo ellen every part of you her voice was low and fierce we wont i he lay very still hoping she slept source of which was too abhorrent to him to name he would protect her with his life if necessary he would kill to keep her safe whatever the cost and he would hope that what they had together survived it there was no avoiding it they had stolen a moment taken some thing for themselves but what haunted them from twenty years before and now would have to be faced his hand i need to find the right time and the right way i want you to leave that to me you have to let me be there jo it should be done your way but to not aiong all right but there are other things that need to be handled need to be done you need protection dont try to go white knight on me nathan i find it irritating the lazy comment ended on a gasp when he hauled her up to her knees nothing happens to you his eyes gleamed dangerously in the dark whatever it takes im going to see to that youd better start by calming yourself down she said evenly im of a mind that nothing happens to either of us so we have to start thinking and we have to start doing there are going to be rules jo the first is that you dont go anywhere alone you dont step off your own porch by yourself until this is over im not my mother im not ginny im not susan peters im not defenseless or stupid or naive i will not be hunted for someones sport because a show of temper would only wound her pride and mi her angry he latched on to calm if necessary ill haul you off the land just the way i hauled you here tonight ill take you some safe and ill lock you in all itll take to avoid that unhappy e your promise not to go anywhere alone you have an inflated image of your own capabilities not in this case i dont he caught her chin in his hand at me jo look at me youre everything ill take anything els face anything else but i wont face losing you not again she trembled once not from anger or fear but from the swift flood of emotion no ones ever loved me this much i cant get to it practiceand promise i wont go anywhere by myself she let out a sigh this nonship business is nothing but a maze of concessions and compromises thats probably why ive managed to avoid it all this time she sat back on her heels were not going to stand around and just let things happen im not the only woman on the island she trembled again im not anabcllcs only daughter no were not going to stand around and wait im going to make some calls gather any information on kyles accident that i might have missed before i wasnt thorough it wasnt an easy time and i might have let something slip by what about his friends his finances i dont know a lot about either we werent as close the last few years as we used to be nathan rose to open the windows and let in the air we drifted into different places became different people what kind of a person did he become he was i guess youd call him a presentfocused sort he was interested n nowseize the moment and wring it dry dont worry about later about consequences or payment he never hurt anyone but himself it was vitally important that she understand that just as important nathan realized that he understand it himself kyle just preferred the easy way and if the easy way had a shortcut all the better he had a lot of charm and he had talent dad was always saying if kyle would put as much effort into his work as he did his play hed be one of the top photographers in the world kyle said dad was too critical of his work never satisfied jealous because he had his whole life and career ahead of him he paused listened to the words replay in his head and suffered their implication was it competition a twisted need for the son to outdo the father his head began to pound again hard beats at the temples ill make the calls nathan said flatly if we can eliminate that possibility we can concentrate on others kyle might have gotten ddrunk showed the photos to a friend an associate maybe it wasnt an area jo wanted to push just then whoever is responsible has a solid knowledge of photography and quite a bit of skill its inconsistent occasionally lazy but its skill nathan only nodded shed just described his brother perfectly he would have to be doing his own developing she continued relieved to be able to concentrate on practical steps which dmeans access to a darkroom he must have had one in charlotte and then when he came down here hed have needed to arrange for another the package i got here was mailed from savannah you can rent darkroom time yeah and that might be what he did or he rented an apartment a house brought in his own equipment or bought new he would have more control wouldnt he if it was his own place his own equipment her eyes met nathans thats what drives this the control he could go back and forth between the mainland and the island hed be in control to control the moment to manipulate the mood the subject the outcome that is the true power of art his fathers words he remembered neatly written on the page yes its about control so we check photo supply outlets find out if someone ordered equipment to outfit a darkroom and had it shipped to savannah it wont be easy and it wont be quick no but its a start it was good to think to have a tangible task hed likely be alone he needs the freedom to come and go as he pleases he took pictures of me all over the island so hes wandering around freely we can keep our eye out for a man alone with a came though were just as likely to jump some harmless birdwatcher if it was kyle id know him id recognize him would you nathan if he didnt want you to hed know you here and hed know that ive been with you annabelle hathaw daughter with david delaneys son there are some who might see it as coming full circle and if thats so i dont believe youre any s than i am o slept into midday and woke alone she couldnt remember the last time shed slept until ten or when she had enjoyed such a deep and dream less sleep she wondered if she should have been rest less edgy or weepy perhaps shed been all of those things long enough and there was no need to go on with them now that she knew the truth she could grieve for her mother and for a woman the same age as jo was now who had faced the worst kind of horror but more she could grieve for the years lost in the condemnation of a mother a wife a woman who had done nothing more sinfill than catch the eye of a madman now there could be healing he loves me mama she whispered maybe thats fates way of paying us all back for being cruel and heartless twenty years ago im happy no matter how crazy the world is right now im happy with him she swung her legs over the side of the bed starting today she promised herself they were going to stand together and fight back in the living room nathan finished up yet another call this one to the american consulate in nice he hadnt slept his eyes were gritty his soul scorched he felt as if he were running in circles pulling together information searching for any hint any whisper that hed mis months before and all the while he dealt with the dark guilt that his deepest hid was to confirm that his own brother was dead he looked up as he heard footsteps mounting his stairs wo up a smile when he saw gaff behind the screen he waved him in completed the call didnt mean to interrupt you giff said no problem im finished for now i was heading out to do a little work on live oak cottage thought id drop off these plans you said how you wouldnt minding a look at the design ive been working up for the solarium at santuary id love to see it grateful for the diversion nathan walked over to take the plans and unroll them on the kitchen table i had some ideas on that myself then i got distracted well gaff tucked his tongue in his cheek as jo walked out from the bedroom understandable enough morning jo ellen she could only hope she didnt flush like a beet and compound the embarrassment as both men stared at her shed pulled on one of nathans tshirts and nothing else though the bottom of it skimmed her thighs she imagined it was obvious that she wore nothing under it this would teach her she supposed to follow the scent of coffee like a rat to the tune of the pipe morning giff i was just dropping something off here oh well i was just going to get some coffee she decided to brazen it out and walked to the counter to pour a mug ill just take it with me giff couldnt help himself it was such a situation and since he was dead sure lexy would want all the details he tried for more you might want to take a look yourself icates got that bee in her bonnet about this sunroom addon you always had a good eye for things manners or dignity it was an impossible decision for a woman raised on southern traditions jo did her best to combine both and stepped over to study the drawing she puzzled over what appeared to be a side view of a long graduated curve with a lot of neatly printed numbers and odd lines nathan ordered himself to shift his attention from jos legs back to the drawing its a good concept you do the survey yeah me and bill he does survey work over to the mainland had the equipment you know if you came out at an anglehe used his finger to draw the linerather than straight you could avoid excavating over here and youd gain the benefit of using the gardens as part of the structure if you did that wouldnt you cut off this corner here wouldnt it make it tight and awkward coming out from the main house miss kated go into conniptions if i started talking about moving doorways or windows you dont have to move any of the existing structure nathan slid the side view over to reveal giffs full view nice work he murmured really nice jo get me a sheet of that drawing paper over there nathan gestured absently ive got men in my firm who dont have the skill to do freehand work like this no shit gaff forgot jo completely and goggled at the back of nathans head you ever decide to go back for that degree and want to apprentice you let me know he picked up a pencil and began to sketch on the paper jo had put in front of him see if you hitch it over this way not so much of an angle as a flow its a female house you dont want sharp points you keep it all in the same tone as the curve of the roof then instead of lining out into the gardens it pours through them yeah i see it he realized that his working drawing seemed stiff and amateurish beside the artists i couldnt think of something like that draw like that in a million years sure you could youd already done the hard part its a hell of a lot easier for somebody to look at good detailed work and shift a couple of things around to enhance it than it is to come up with the concept in the first place nathan straightened contemplated his quick sketch through narrowed eyes he could see it complete and perfect your way mi suit the client better its more costeffective and more traditional your ways more artistic it isnt always artistic that the client wants nathan put his pencil down anyway you think about it or show the works to kate let her think about it whichever choice we can do some refining fore you break ground youll work with me on it sure without thinking nathan picked up jos coffee mug and drank id like to rewed giff gathered up the drawings i think ill just swing b and drop these off for miss kate now give her some time to mull over im really obliged nathan he tugged on the brim of his cap see you jo jo leaned against the counter and watched as nathan got another sheet of drawing paper finishing off her coffee he started another sketch you dont even know what you just did she murmured hmm how far is that perennial bed with the tall blue flowers the spiky ones how far is that from the corner here nope she got herself another mug you dont have a clue what youve done about what oh he looked down at the mug sorry i drank your coffee besides thatwhich i found both annoying and endearing she slid her arms around his waist youre a good man nathan a really good man thanks normality he promised himself just for an hour they would take normality is that because i didnt give you a little swat on the bottom when you strolled out here in my shirteven though i wanted to no that just makes you a smart man but youre a good one you didnt see his face she lifted her hands to his cheeks you didnt even notice at sea he shook his head apparently i didnt are you talking about giff i dont know anyone who doesnt like giff and i dont know many who think of him as anything more than an affable and reliable handyman nathan she touched her lips to his you just told him he was more and could be more yet and you did it so casually so matteroffacdy he cant help but believe you she rose up on her toes to press her cheek to his i really like you right now nathan i really like who you are i like you too he closed his arms around her and swayed and im really starting to like who we are i kirby had a firm grip on her pride as she walked into sanctuary if jo was there she would find a way to speak to her privately her strict code of ethics wouldnt permit her to tell any of the hathaways what shed learned the night before if jo had come home after speaking with nathan again yirby imagined the house would be in an uproar if nothing eisc she could stand as family doctor but that wasnt why shed been summoned she had planned her visit to avoid brian using that window of time between breakfast and the midday meal and shed used the visitors front door rather than the friends entrance through the kitchen since they had managed to avoid each other for a week she thought they could do so for another day she wouldnt have come at all if kate hadnt hailed her with an sos after one of the guests slipped on the stairs even as she turned toward them kate came hurrying down yirby i cant tell you how much i appreciate this its a turned ankle no more than that i swear but the woman is setting up such a todo youd think shed broken every bone in her body in six places at once one glance at kates distracted face and iyirby knew that jo had yet to speak of annabelle its all right kate i know its your afternoon off and i hated to drag you over here but she wont budge out of bed its no problem really yirby followed her up the stairs its better to have a look if i think its more than a strain well xray and ship her off to the mainland one way to get her out of my hair kate muttered she briskly on a door mrs tores the doctors here to see you billy inn kate added to iyirby in an undertone and add whatever you for a nuisance fee thirty minutes later and more than a little frazzled kirby clos the bedroom door behind her her head was aching from the litany complaints mrs tores had regaled her with as she paused to rub temples kate peeked around the corner safe i was tempted to sedate her but i resisted shes perfectly fi kate believe me i know i had to give her what amounts to a complete physical before she was satisfied her ankle is barely strained her heart is as strong as a team of oxen her lungs even stronger for your sake i hope shes planning on a very short stay she leaves day after tomorrow thank the lord come on down let me get you a nice glass of lemonade a piece of that cherry pie brian made yesterday i really need to get back ive got stacks of paperwork to wade through im not sending you back without a cold drink this heats enough to fell a horse i like the heat she began then came to a dead halt as brian walked in the front door his arms were full of flowers they should have made him look foolish she wanted him to look foolish instead he looked all the more male all the more attractive with his tanned wellmuscled arms loaded down with freshly cut blossoms oh brian im so glad you got to that kate hurried down with her mind racing at lightspeed i was going to cut for the fresh arrangements myself this morning but this crisis with mrs tores threw me off my stride she chattered on as she transferred flowers from his arms to hers ill just take it from here you dont have any sense at all about how to arrange them i swear yirby the man just stuffs them into a vase and thinks thats all there is to it brian you go fix yirby a lemonade make her eat a piece of pie shes come all the way out here just to do me a favor and i wont have her going off until shes been paid back run along now while i take this upstairs she headed up the steps willing the two of them not to behave like fools i dont need anything kirby said stiffly i was just on my way out i imagine you can spare five minutes to have a cold drink and avoid hurting kates feelings fine its a quicker trip home through the back anyway she turned and started down the hall at a brisk pace she wanted to be away from him when he found out about his mother she would do what she could for him but for now she had her own pain to cope with hows the patient she could dance a jig if she wanted to theres not a thing wrong with her she pushed through the door and stood stubbornly while he got out a pitcher of goldenyellow lemonade swimming with mint and pulp when her mouth watered she swallowed resolutely hows your hand its all right i dont really notice it i might as well look at it while im here she set her bag down on the breakfast table the sutures should have been removed a couple of days ago you were leaving itll save you a trip out to see me he stopped pouring her lemonade and looked at her the sun was streaming through the window at her back licking light over her hair her eyes were a dark stormy green that made his loins tighten all right he carried her glass to the table and sat down despite the heat her hands were cool despite her anger they were gentle she saw no swelling or puffiness no sign of infection the edges of the wound had fused neatly he would barely have a scar she decided and opened her bag for her suture scissors this wont take long just dont put any new holes in me she clipped the first suture tugged it free with tweezers since we both live on this island and its likely well be running into each other on a regular basis for the rest of our lives perhaps youd do the courtesy of clearing the air its clear enough yirby for you apparently but not for me she clipped tugged want to know why you turned away from me why you decided things between us the way you did because theyd gone farther than id intended them i one of us thought it would work i just decided to back off all oh i see you dumped me before i could dump you more or less he wished he couldnt smell her he wished shed had the decency not to rub that damned peachscented lotion all over her skin to torment him id see it more as just a matter simplifying and you like things simple dont you you like things your way in your time and at your pace her voice was mild and though he wasnt sure he could trust it particularly when she had a sharp implement in her hand he nodded thats true enough youre the same but your way your time and your pace are different from mine i cant argue with that you prefer a malleable woman a delicate woman one who sits patiently and waits for your move and your whim that certainly doesnt describe me no it doesnt and the fact is i wasnt looking for a woman or a relationship whatever you choose to call it you came after me and youre beautiful i got tired of pretending i didnt want you thats fair and the sex was good for both of us so there shouldnt be any complaints she removed the last suture all done she lifted her eyes to his all done brian the scar will fade before long you wont even remember you were hurt now that the airs all clear ill be on my way he remained where he was when she rose i appreciate it dont give it a thought she said with a voice like frosted roses i wont she left by the back quietly and deliberately closing the screen behind her she didnt start to run until she was into the shelter of the trees well that was tin brian picked up kirbys untouched lemonade and downed it in several long gulps it hit his tortured stomach like acid hed done the right thing hadnt he for himself and probably for her hed kept things from stringing out getting too deep and complicated all hed done was nick her pride and she had plenty of it to spare pride and class and brains and a tidy little body with the energy of a nuclear warhead christ she was a hell of a woman no hed done the right thing he assured himself and ran the cold glass over his forehead because he suddenly felt viciously hot inside and out she would have set him aside eventually and left him slackjawed and shot in the knees women like yirby fitzsimmons didnt stay not that he wanted any woman to stay but if a man was going to start fantasizing if he was going to start believing in marriage and family she was just the type to draw him in then leave him twisting in the wind she had too much fuel too much nerve to stay on desire the right offer from the right hospital or medical institute or whatever and shed be gone before the sand settled back in her footprints god hed never seen anything like the way shed handled susan peterss body the way shed turned from woman to rock clipping out orders in that cool steady voice her eyes flat her hands without the slightest tremor it had been an eyeopener for him all right this wasnt some fragile little flower who would be content to treat poison ivy and sunburn on a nowhere dot in the ocean for long hook herself up with an innkeeper who made the best part of his living whipping up soufflds and frying chicken not in this lifetime he told himself so it was done and over and his life would settle back quietly into the routine he preferred fucking rut he thought on a sudden surge of fury he nearly hurled the glass into the sink when he spotted her medical bag on the table shed left her bag he mused opening it and idly poking through the contents she could just come back and get it herself he decided he had things to do he couldnt be chasing after her just because shed be in a snit and left it behind of course she might need it you couldnt be sure medical emergency would come along it would be his fault if she didnt have her needles and prodding things sory up and die couldnt they he didnt want that on his conscience with a shrug he picked the bag up found it heavier than hed imagined he thought hed run it over to her drop it off and that would be that he decided to take the car rather than cut through the forest was too damn hot to walk and besides if shed dawdled at all he might beat her there he could just leave the bag inside her door and drive off before she even got home when he pulled up in her drive he thought he had accomplished just that and was disgusted with himself for being disappointed he didnt want to see her again that was the whole point but when he was half way up the steps he realized shed beaten him back after all he could hear her crying it stopped him in his tracks the sound of it hard passionate sobs raw gulps of air it shook him right to the bone left him drymouthed and loose at the knees he wondered if there was anything more fearful a man could face than a weeping woman he opened the door quietly eased it shut his nerves were shot as he started back to her bedroom shifting her bag from hand to hand she was curled up on the bed a tight ball of misery with her hair curtaining her face hed dealt with wild female tears before a man couldnt live with lexy half his life and avoid that but hed never expected such unrestrained weeping from kirby not the woman who had challenged him to resist her not the woman who had faced the result of murder without a quiver not the woman who had just walked out of his kitchen with her head high and her eyes cold as the north atlantic with lexy it was either get the hell out and bar the door or gather her up close and hold on until the storm passed he decided to hold on and sitting on the side of the bed he reached out to bundle her to him she shot up straight as an arrow slapping out sharply at the hands that reached for her patiently he persistedand found himself holding on to a hundred pounds of furious woman get out of here dont you touch me the humiliation on top of the hurt was more than she could stand she kicked shoved then scrambled off the far side of the bed standing there she glared at him through puffy eyes even as fresh sobs choked her how dare you come in here get the hell out you left your doctors bag because he felt foolish half sprawled over her bed he straightened up and faced her across it i heard you crying i didnt mean to make you cry i didnt know i could she pulled tissues out of the box on the bedside table and mopped at her face what makes you think im crying over you since i dont expect you ran into anyone else in the last five minutes who would set you off like this its a reasonable assumption and youre so reasonable arent you brian she yanked out more tissues littering the floor with them i was indulging myself im entitled to that now id like you to leave me aloe if i hurt you if you hurt me out of desperation she grabbed the box of tissues and threw it at him if you hurt me you son of a bitch what am i rubber that you can slap at me and it bounces off you say youre falling in love with me then you turn around and calmly tell me that its over i said i thought i was falling in love with you it was vital he thought with a little squirm of panic to make that distinction i stopped it you rage really did make you see red she realized her vision was lurid with it as she grabbed the closest thing at hand and heaved it jesus woman brian jerked as the small crystal vase whizzed by his head like a glittering bullet you break open my face youre just going to have to stitch it up again the hell i will she grabbed a favorite perfume atomizer from her dresser and let it fly you can bleed to death and i wont lift a finger to ticking death you bastard he ducked dodged and was just fast enough to tackle her before she cracked him over the head with a silverbacked mirror i can hold you down as long as it takes he panted out as he used his to press her into the mattress damned if im going to let you chunk out of me because i bruised your pride my pride she stopped struggling and her eyes went from overtoming you broke my heart she turned her head closed her eyes and let the tears slide free now i dont have any pride to bruise staggered he leaned back she simply turned on her side and curled up again she didnt sob now but lay silent with tears wet on her cheeks leave me alone brian i thought i could i thought youd want me to do just that sooner or later so why not sooner you wont stay he spoke quietly trailing a finger through her hair not here not with me and if i dont step back itll kill me when you leave she was too tired even to cry now she slipped a hand under her cheek for comfort and opened her eyes why wont i stay why would you you can go anywhere you want new york chicago los angeles youre young youre beautiful youre smart a doctor in any of those places is going to make plies of money go to the country club every week have a fancy office in some big shiny building if id wanted those things i would already have them if i wanted to be in new york or chicago or la id be there why arent you because i love it here i always have because im practicing the kind of medicine here that i want to practice and living my life the way i want to live it you come from a different place he insisted a different lifestyle your daddys rich and my mais goodlooking she sniffled and didnt see the quick involuntary quiver of his mouth what i mean is i know what you mean her head felt like an overblown balloon ready to burst idly she told herself shed take something for it in just a minute i dont care much for country clubs theyre usually stuffy and burdened with rules why would i want that when i can sit on my deck and see the ocean every day of my life i can walk in the forest and spot a deer watch the mists rise off the river she shifted just a little so she could see his face tell me brian why do you stay here you could go to any of those places you named run the kitchen in a fine hotel or own your own restaurant why dont you its not what i want i have what i want here so do l she turned her cheek back against the bedspread now go away and leave me alone he got up and stood looking down at her he felt big and awkward and out of his depth hooking his thumbs in his front pockets he paced away paced back turned to stare out the window to stare back at her she didnt move didnt speak he cursed under his breath hissed out a breath and started for the door turned back i wasnt truthful with you before i didnt stop it yirby i wanted to but i couldnt and it wasnt just thinking it was being id rather not be ill tell you that straight out id rather not be because its bound to be a mess somewhere along the line but there it is she brushed a hand over her cheek and sat up no he did not have the look of a happy man she decided there was resentment in his eyes stubbornness in his mouth and annoyance in his stance is this your charming way of telling me youre in love with me thats what i said it so happens im not feeling very charming at the moment you boot me out of your life you humiliate me by catching me at a weak moment you insult me by denying my feelings and my character then you tell me you love me she shook her head pushed her damp hair back from her face well this is certainly the romantic moment every woman dreams of im just telling you the way it is the way i feel she let loose a sigh if in a corner of her heart joy was blooming she decided to hold it in check just for a while since for some reason that i cant quite remember i seem to be in love with you too im going to make a suggestion im listening why dont we take a walk on the beach a nice long walk the air might clear your brain enough for you to find a few drops of eh then you can try to tell me again the way it is and the way you f he considered her discovered his head was already clearinj wouldnt mind a walk he said and held out a hand for hers something bad was in the air sam could sense it it was more than the thick heat more than the hard look to the sky he had some worries about hurricane carla which was currently kicking the stuffing out of the bahamas the forecasters claimed she was primed to dance her way out to sea but sam knew hurricanes were essentially female and females were essentially unpredictable odds were shed give desire a miss and take out her temper on florida but he didnt like the feel to the air it was too damn tight he thought like it was ready to squeeze over yoltr skin he was going to go in and check the little weather station kate had gotten him last christmas do a run on the shortwave there was a storm coming all right he wished he knew when it was coming as he crested the hill he saw the couple at the edge of the east garden the sun was slanting over them turning jos hair into glittering flame her body was angled forward balanced against the mans with a kind of yearning it was impossible not to recognize the delaney boy sam thought grown up to a man and the man had his hands on sams daughters butt sam blew out a breath wondered just how he was supposed to feel about that their eyes were frill of each other and with a fluid shift of bod ics their mouths tangled it was the kind of hotly intimate kiss that m it obvious theyd been spending time doing a lot more to each other and how was he supposed to feel about that time was young people wouldnt neck right out in the open that way he remembered when hed been courting annabelle the way theyd snuck off like thieves theyd done their groping in private why if belles daddy had ever come across them this way thered have been hell to pay he walked on making sure his footsteps were loud enough to wake the dead and the dreaming didnt even have the courtesy to jerk apart and look guilty sam thought they just eased apart linked hands and turned toward him theres guests inside the house jo ellen and they aint paying for a floor show surprised she blinked at him yes daddy you want to be free with your affections do it someplace that wont set tongues wagging from here to savannah wisely she swallowed the clilickle lowered her eyes before he could the gleam of lalighter in tlie and nodded ye s sir sam shifted his feet plated tlicm and looked at nathan seems to me yolire old enough to strap down your glands in a public place following jos icad and warned by the quick squeeze of her hand nathan kept his long sober and respectful yes sir satisfied if not completely fooled by their responses sam frowned up at the sky storm coming he muttered going to give us a knock o matter what the weatherman says he was making conversation jo realized and shoved her shock aside to fall in carlas category two and on dead aim for cuba theyre sure its likely shell head out to sea she doesnt care what they say shell do as she pleases he turned his gaze on nathan again dont get knocked by hurricanes up in in new york city i expect was that a challenge nathan wondered a subtle swing at his manhood no i was in cozumel when gilbert pummeled it though he nearly mentioned the tornado hed watched sweep like vengeance across oklahoma and the avalanche that had thundered down the mountain pass near his chalet when hed been working in switzerland well then you know sam said simply i hear that you and gaff got a mind to do that sunroom kates been pining for its gaffs project im just tossing in some ideas guess you got ideas enough why dont you show me then what yall have in mind to do to my house sure i can give you the general layout fine jo ellen i suspect your young man figures on finagling dinner go tell brian hes got another mouth to feed jo opened her mouth but her father was already walking away she could do no more than shrug at nathan and turn to the house when she stepped into the kitchen brian was busy at the counter deheading shrimp and singing she realized with a jolt under his breath and offkey but singing whats come over this place she demanded daddys holding full conversations and asking to see solarium plans youre singing in the kitchen i wasnt singing you were too singing it was a really lousy rendition of i love rock and roll but it could be loosely described as singing so what its my kitchen thats more like it she went to the fridge for a beer want one of these i guess i wouldnt turn it down im losing weight just standing here he swiped the back of his hand over his sweaty forehead and took the bottle shed opened for him he took a long swallow then tucked his tongue in his cheek so is nathan able to walk without a limp today yeah but i bloodied his lip she reached into the white ceramic cookie jar and dug out a chocolatechip a brother with any sense of decency would have bloodied it for me you always said you preferred fighting your own battles how in gods name can you chase cookies with beer its revolting im enjoying it you want any help in here it was his turn to experience shock define help assistance she snapped chopping something stirring so thing he took another pull on his beer as he considered her i could use some carrots peeled and grated how many twenty dollars worth thats what you cost me excuse me just a little wager with lexy a dozen he said and turned back to his shrimp she got the carrots out began to remove the peels in slow precise strips brian if there was something you believed all your life some thing youd learned to live with but that something wasnt true would you be better off going on the way youd always gone on or finding out it was something different something worse you can let a sleeping dog lie but its hard to rest easy you never know when its going to wake up and go for your throat he slid the shrimp into a boiling mixture of water beer and spices then again you let the dog lie long enough it gets old and feeble and its teeth fall out thats not a lot of help that wasnt much of a question youre getting peelings all over the floor so ill sweep them up she wanted to sweep the words up with them under the first handy rug but she would always know they were there do you think a man a perfectly normal man with a family a job a house in the suburbs a man who plays catch with his son on a sunday afternoon and brings his wife roses on a wednesday evening could have another side a cold dark side that no one sees a side thats capable of doing something unspeakable then folding back into itself so he can root at the little league game on saturday and take the family out for ice cream sodas afterward brian got the colander out for the shrimp and set it in the sink youre full of odd questions this evening jo ellen you writing a book or something cant you just tell me what you think cant you just have an opinion on a subject and say what it is all right baffled he tipped the lid to the pot to give the shrimp a quick stir if you want to be philosophical the jekyll and hyde theme has always fascinated people good and evil existing side by side in the same personality theres none of us without shadows im not talking about shadows about a man who gives in to temptation and cheats on his wife one afternoon at the local motel or who skims the till at work im talking about real evil the kind that doesnt carry a breath of guilt or conscience with it yet it doesnt show not even to the people closest to it seems to me the easiest evil to hide is one with no conscience tagged to it if you dont feel remorse or responsibility theres no mirror reflecting back no mirror reflecting back she repeated it would be like black glass wouldnt it opaque do you have any other cheerful remarks or suppositions to discuss hows this can the apple fall far from the tree with a half laugh brian hefted the pot and poured shrimp and steaming water into the colander id say that depended entirely on the apple a firm healthy one might take a few good bounces and roll you had one going rotten itd just plop straight down at the trunk he turned mopping his brow again and reaching for his beer when he caught her eye what he demanded as she stared at him her eyes dark and wide her face pale thats exactly right she said quietly thats so exactly right im hell on parables im going to hold you to that one brian she turned back to her grating after dinner we need to talk all of us ill tell the others well use the family parlor all of us in one place who do you want to punish its important brian its important to all of us i dont see why i have to twiddle my thumbs around here w ive got a date looking at her image in the mirror behind the lexy fussed with her hair its nearly eleven oclock already gaff able to just give up waiting and go to bed jo said it was important kate reminded her she fought make her knitting needles click rhythmically rather than bash to shed been working on the same afghan for ten years and was a nd determined to conquer it before another decade passed then where is she lexy demanded whirling around see anybody here but you and me brians probably snuck off to i daddys holed up with his shortwave tracking that damned caneand it isnt even coming around here theyll be along why dont you fix us all a nice glass of wine honey it was one of kates little dreams having her family all gathered together cooling off after a hot day sharing the events of it seems like im always waiting on somebody i swear the last thing ill do to keep the wolf away from the door when i go back to new york is wait tables sam ducked his head and stepped in he glanced at kate with amusement that blanket never seemed to grow by much he thought but somehow or other it got uglier every time she dragged it out you know what the girls got on her mind no i dont kate said placidly but sit down lexys getting us some wine sooner have a beer if its all the same well place your orders lexy said testily i live to serve i can fetch my own oh sit down she waved a hand at him ill get it feeling chastised he lowered himself to the couch beside kate drummed his fingers on his knee he looked up when lexy held out a brimming pilsner guess you want a tip now when she arched a brow he nodded soberly recycle the world is your backyard kates needles clicked lexy stared as color crept up his throat sam stared into his beer me to mark this down on my yearataglance calendar sarcastic womans the reason i keep my mouth shut in the first place he muttered and kates laugh tinkled out them thats what jo saw when she came in her father her cousin and her sister sharing a moment together while kates laughter rang out her heart sank it was an image shed never expected to see one she hadnt known could be so precious to her now she and the man who stood behind her could destroy it nathan her idea of what jo had wanted the family to hear took on the hint of orange blossoms and bridal lace fluttering she set her knitting aside we were just having some wine maybe we should make it champagne instead just for fun no wines fing her nerves scramble jo hurried in dont get up kate ill get it i hope this wont take long jo ive got plans im sorry lexy jo clinked glasses together in her hurry to have it done sit down kate hissed rolling her eyes wiggling her brows to try to give lexy a hint make yourself comfortable nathan im sure brian will be right along oh here he is now brian turn up the fan a little will you this heats just wilting must be cooler at your place by the river nathan some he sat knowing he had to let jo set the pace but he looked at sam theyd spend twenty minutes together that evening outlining plans discussing structure and form and all the while nathan had tasted the bitter tang of deceit it was time to open it up spread it out and accept the consequences im sorry he said realizing abruptly that kate was speaking to him i was just asking if youre finding it as easy to work here as you do in new york its a nice change his eyes met jos as she brought him a of wine get it done he asked her silently get it finished would you sit down brian she murmured hmm shed interrupted his daydream about wandering to kirbys shortly and waking her up in a very specific and interesting manner sure he settled into a chair and decided hed never been more relaxed or content in his life he even gave lexy a quick wink when she sat on the arm beside him i dont know how to begin how to tell you jo took a bracing breath i wish i could take the chance and let sleeping dogs lie she caught brians eye saw the flicker of confusion in his but i cant whether its the best thing or not i have to believe its the right thing daddy she walked over sat on the coffee table so that her eyes were on a level with sams its about mama she saw his mouth harden and though he didnt move felt him pull back from her theres no point in stirring up old waters jo ellen your mothers been gong long enough for you to deal with her going shes dead daddy shes been dead for twenty years as if to anchor them both she closed a hand over his she didnt leave you or us she didnt walk away from sanctuary she was murdered how can you say such a thing lexy surged to her feet how can you say that jo alexa sam kept his eyes on jos hush he had to give himself a moment to stand up to the blow shed delivered he wanted to dismiss it slide over or around it but there was no evading that steady and sorrowful look in her eyes youve got a reason for saying that for believing it yes she told him calmly clearly about the photograph that had been sent to her the shock of recognition the undeniable certainty that it was annabelle i worked it out a hundred different ways in my head she continued that it had been taken years later that it was just a trick of the camera just a horrible joke that id imagined it altogether but none of those were true daddy it was mama and it was taken right here on the island on the night we thought she left wheres the picture he demanded where is it its gone whoever sent it came back and took it while i was in the hospital but it was there i swear it it was mama how do you know how can you be sure of that she opened her mouth but nathan stepped forward because ive seen the photograph because my father took it after he killed her with a storm raging in his head sam got slowly to his feet youre going to stand there and tell me your father killed belle killed a woman whod done him no harm and then took pictures of it he took pictures of her when hed done with her and showed them to you nathan didnt know daddy jo clung to sams arm he was just a boy he didnt know im not looking at a boy now i found the photographs and a journal after my father died everything jo told is true my father killed your wife he wrote it all down locked the journal and the prints the negatives in a safedeposit box i found them after he and my mother died when the words trailed away there was no sound but the whisk of the blades from the ceiling fan lexys weeping and the harsh breaths sam pushed in and out of his lungs he could see her now shimmering at the front of his mind the wife hed loved the woman hed cursed all the lights and shadows of her shifted together to form rage to form grief twenty years he kept it to himself sam clenched his fists but there was nothing to strike you find out and you come back here and put your hands on my daughter and you let him he burned jo with a look you know and you let him i felt the same way when he told me just the same but when i had time to think it through to understand nathan wasnt responsible his blood was youre right nathan moved so that jo no longer stood between him and sam i came back here to try to find a way through around it or to just bury it and i fell in love where i had no right brian set lexy aside so that she could weep into her hands in of on his shoulder why his voice was as raw as his soul wh he do it theres no reason that can justify it nathan said wearily nothing shed done he selected her it was a project to him a study he didnt act out of anger or even out of passion i cant explain it to myself its best if you go now nathan kate spoke quietly as she rose leave us alone with this for a while i cant until its all said i dont want you in my house sams voice was dangerously low i dont want you on my land im not going until i know jos safe because whoever killed susan peters and ginny pendleton wants her ginny to steady herself icate gripped sams arm i dont have any proof of ginny but i know if youll listen to the rest of it hear me out ill leave let him finish it lexy sniffed back her tears and spoke in a voice that was surprisingly strong ginny didntjust run off ive known that in my heart all along it was just like mama wasnt it nathan and the peters woman too she folded her hands in her lap to compose herself and turned to jo you were sent photos here to the house pictures taken here on the island its all happening again youre handy with a camera nathan brians eyes were hot blue slits it stung coming from a man who had been friend in both the past and the present yolt dont have any reason to trust me but you have plenty of reason to listen let me try to explain it nathan jo picked up her wing to cool her throat she left nothing out picking her way from detail to detail question to question and icading into the steps she and nathan had agreed upon taking to find the answers so his dead fathers responsible for killing our mother brian cut in bitterly now his dead brothers responsible for the rest convenient we dont know whos responsible for the rest but if it is nathans brother it doesnt make nathan culpable jo stepped up to brian theres a parable about apples falling from the tree someone told me recently and how some are strong enough to roll clear and stay whole and others arent dont throw my own words back at me he said furiously his father killed our mother destroyed our lives now another womans dead maybe two and you expect us to pat him on the back and say alls forgiven well the hell with that the hell with all of you he strode out leaving the air vibrating in his wake ill go after him lexy paused in front of nathan studied him out of redrimmed eyes hes the oldest and maybe he loved her best the way boys do their mamas but hes wrong nathan theres nothing to forgive you for youre a victim just like the rest of us when she slipped out iate said in surprised admiration you never expect her to be the sensible one then she sighed we need some time here nathan some wounds need private tending im going with you jo began but nathan shook his head no you stay with your family we all need time he turned to face sam if you have more to say to me ill find you right enough with a nod nathan left them alone daddy i dont have anything to say to you now jo ellen youre a grown woman but youre living under my roof for the time being im asking you to go to your room for now and let me be all right i know what youre feeling and just how it hurts you need time to deal with it she kept her eyes level with his but after youve had that time if you still hold to this stand youll make me ashamed ashamed that you would blame the son for the fathers deed saying nothing he strode past her go ahead to your room jo kate laid a hand on jos knotted shoulder let me see what i can do do you blame him kate do you i cant get my mind clear on what i think or feel i know th boys suffering jo but so is sam my first loyalty is to him go on dont pester me for answers until i can sort things through kate found sam on the front porch standing at the rail st out into the night clouds had rolled in covering moon and stars left the porch light off and stepped quietly up beside him i have to grieve again he ran his hands back and forth over the railing it isnt right that i should have to grieve for her again no its not do i take comfort that she never meant to leave me and the chddren that she didnt run off and forget us and how do i take back all the hard thoughts of her i had over the years all the nights i cursed her for being selfish and careless and heartless you cant be faulted for the hard thoughts sam you believed what was set in front of you belleving a lie doesnt make you wrong its the lie thats wrong he tightened up if you came out here to defend that boy to me you can turn right around and go back inside thats not why i came out but the fact is that youre no more at fault for believing what you did about belle than nathan was for believing in his father now youve both found out you were wrong in that belief but hes the one who has to accept that his father was the selfish and heartless one i said you could go on back inside all right then you stubborn stiffnecked mule you just stand out here alone and wallow in your misery and think your black thoughts she spun around shocked when his hand shot out and took hers dont leave the words burned his throat like tears dont when have i ever she said with a sigh sam i dont know what to do for you for any of you i hate seeing the people i love hurt this way and not knowing how to give them ease i cant mourn for her the way i should kate twenty years is a long stretch im not the same as i was when i lost her you loved her her you remember how she was kate so bright always envied her the way she would light up everything and hands and missed the shock that bolted into her eyes you always kept that light steady he said carefully shed have been grateful for the way you mothered the children looked after things i should have told you before that im grateful i started out doing it for her and stayed for myself and sam i dont think belle would have wanted you to grieve all over again i never knew her to nurse a hurt or cling to a grudge she wouldnt have blamed a tenyear old boy for what his father was im cut in two on this kate im remembering that when belle went missing david delaney joined in the search for her he had to close his eyes as the rage rose up black again the son of a bitch walked this island with me and all the while hed done that to her his wife came and got the children took them back with her to mind all that day i was grateful to him god forgive me for that i was grateful to him he deceived you she said quietly he deceived his own family he never missed a step i cant go back to that day knowing what i know now and make him pay for it will you make the son pay instead i dont know sam what if theyre right what if someone wants to do to jo what was done to annabelle we need to protect what we have left to use whatever we have to protect what we have left if im any judge nathan delaney would step in front of a moving train to keep her safe i can see to my own this time im prepared this time i the edge of the woods on a moonless night was an excellent vantage point but he hadnt been able to resist creeping a little closer using the dark to conceal his movements it was so exciting to be this close to the house to hear the old mans words so clearly it was all out now and that was just anoth arousal they thought they knew it all understood it all they probably believed theyd be safe in that foreknowledge and they couldnt be more wrong he tapped the gun hed tucked combatstyle in his boot could use it now if he wanted take both of them out like shooting ducks in a barrel that would leave the two women alone in the house since brian had driven off in a stonespitting fit of temper he could have both of annabelles daughters one after the other both at once a delicious mdnagetrois still that would be a detour from the master plan and the plan was serving him so well sticking to it would prove his discipline his ability to conceive and execute and if he wanted to duplicate the annabelle experience he would have to be patient just a little longer but that didnt mean he couldnt stir things up a bit in the meantime scared rabbits he mused were so much easier to trap he melted back into the trees and spent a pleasant hour contemplating the light in jos window yirby jogged along the beach hugging her solitude the sky to the east was wildly red gloriously violently vivid with sunrise she supposed that if the old adage were true sailors better take warning but she could only think how beautiful the morning was with its furious sky and high wild winds maybe they were in for a backslap from carla after all she thought as her feet pounded the hardpacked sand it might be exciting and it would take brians mind off his troubles for a little while she wished she knew what to say to him how to help him all shed been able to do when hed roared into her cottage the night before was listen as she had listened to jo but when shed tried to comfort him as she had comforted jo it hadnt been the soft soothing words shed offered that he wanted so shed given him the heat in stead and had held on for dear life as he pounded out his misery in sex she hadnt been able to convince him to stay and sleep past dawn he was up and gone before the sun peeked over the horizon but at least he gathered her close at least he pulled her to him and she knew shed steadied him for the return to sanctuary now she wanted to clear her head if the man she loved was trouble if he was in distress then so was she she would gear hers up to stand by him to see him through this and she hoped to guide him toward some peace then she saw nathan standing near where the booming breakers hammered the shoreline loyalty warred against reason as she slowed her pace but in the end her need to help to heal overrode everything else she simply couldnt turn her back on pain some morning she had to lift her voice over the thunder of surf and wind puffing only a little she stopped beside him so is your vacation living up to your expectations he laughed he couldnt help it oh yeah its the trip of a lifetime you need coffee as a doctor im supposed to tell you that caffeing isnt good for you but i happen to know it often does the trick you offering am i appreciate it kirby but we both know im persona non grata brian wouldnt appreciate you sharing a morning cup with ing i cant blame him for it i do my own thinking form my own impressions thats why hes crazy about me she laid a hand on his arm no she couldnt turn her back on pain even the air around nathan was hurting come on up to the house think of me as your kindly island doctor bare your soul she smiled at him ill even bill you for an office visit if you want such a deal he took a long breath christ i could use a cup of coffee i could use the car too and ive got both come on she tucked her arm in his and walked away from the shore so the hathaways gave you a rough time oh i dont know they were fairly gracious all in all that southern hospitality my father raped and murdered your mother i tell them hell nobody even tried to lynch me nathan she paused at the base of her steps its a hell of a mess and a terrible tragedy all around but none of them will blame you once theyre able to think it through jo doesnt of all of them shes the most vulnerable because of it but she doesnt she loves you she may yet get over that lexy didnt he murmured she looked me straight in the eye her cheeks still wet from crying and told me none of it was my responsibility lexy uses pretenses and masks and foolishness and uses them expertly so she can see through them and cut to the bone faster than most she opened her door turned back to him and nathan none of it is or was your responsibility i know that intellectually and id almost convinced myself of it emotionallyi wanted to because i wanted jo but its not over yirby its not finished at least one other woman is dead now so its not over she nodded and held the door open for him well talk about that too carla teased the southeast coast of flonda giving key biscayne a quick and violent kiss before shimmying north in her capricious way she did a tango with fort lauderdale scattered trailers and tourists and took a few lives but she didnt seem inclined to stay her eye was cold and wide her breath fast and eager shed grown stronger wilder since her birth in the warm waters of the west indies like a vengeful whore she spun back out to sea stomping her sharp heels over the narrow barrier islands in her path lexy hurried into the guest room where jo was just smoothing the spread on the walnut sleigh bed the sun beamed hot and brilliant through the open balcony doors highlighting the shadows under jos eyes that spoke of a restless night carla just hit st simons lexy said a little breathless from her rush up two flights of stairs st simons i thought she was tracking west she changed her mind shes heading north jo the last report said if she keeps to course and velocity her leading edge will hit here before nightfall how bad is she shes clawed her way up to category three winds of over a hundred miles an hour well need to batten down were going to evacuate the tourists before the seas get too rough for ferry crossings kate wants you to help down at checkout im going out with gaff well start boarding up all right ill be down lets hope she heads out to sea and gives us a pass daddys on the radio getting updates brian went down to see that the boats fueled and supplied in case we have to leave daddy wont leave hell ride it out if he has to tie himself to a tree but you will lexy stepped closer i went by your room earlier saw your suitcases open and nearly packed theres more reason for me to go than to stay youre wrong jo theres more for staying at least until we find the way to settle this for everyone and we need to bury mama oh god lexy jo covered her face then stood there with her fingers pressed to her eyes not her body but we need to put a marker up in the cemetery and we need to say goodbye she loved us all my life i thought she didnt and that maybe it was because of me alexys voice broke jo dropped her hands why would you think something like that i was the youngest i thought she hadnt wanted another child hadnt wanted me so i spent most of my life trying so hard to make people love me people want me id be whatever i thought theyd like best id be stupid or id be smart id be helpless or id be clever and id always make sure i left first she walked over carefully shut the balcony doors ive done a lot of hateful things she continued and its likely ill do plenty more but knowing the truths changed something inside me i have to say goodbye to her we all do im ashamed i didnt think of it jo murmured if i go before it can all be arranged ill come back i promise she bent down to gather up the linens shed stripped from the bed despite everything im glad i came back this time im glad things have changed between us so am i lexy aimed a sidelong smile so now maybe youll fancy up some of the pictures you took that im in and take a few more i could use them for my portfolio casting directors ought to be pretty impressed with glossies taken by one of the top photographers in the country if we shake loose of carla you and i will have a photo shoot thatll knock every casting director in new york on his ass really great she scowled out at the sky goddamn hurricane somethings always coming along to postpone the good stuff maybe we can do it in savannah you know rent a real studio for a couple of days and lexy oh all right lexy waved her hands but thinking about thats a lot more fun than thinking about nailing up sheets of plywood of course maybe giffll think im plain useless at it and i can whisk back inside and check through my wardrobe for the right outfits i want sexy shots sexy and moody we could get us a little wind ma chime for lexy jo said again on an exasperated laugh im going im going ive got this terrific evening gown i got wholesale in the garment district she started toward the door now if i can just talk kate into letting me borrow grandma pendletons pearls jo laughed again as lexys voice carried down the hallway things shouldnt change too quickly she decided or too much bundling the linens more securely she carted them out to the laundry chute through an open door she could see the couple who had come in for the week from toronto packing and making quick work of it she imagined most of the other guests were doing the same checkout usually a breezy and relaxed process was going to frantic the minute she came downstairs she saw she hadnt exaggerated luggage was already piled by the front door in the parlor half a dozen guests were milling around or standing by the windows staring at the sky as if they expected it to crack open at any moment kate was at the desk surrounded by a sea of paperwork and urgent demands her hospitable smile was frayed around the edges when she looked up and spotted jo now dont you worry well get everyone safely to the ferry we have two running all day and one leaves for the mainland every hour at the flood of voices questions demands she lifted her hand im going to take the first group down right now my niece will take over checkout she sent joan apologetic slightly desperate look mr and mrs littleton if you and your family would go out to the shuttle mr and mrs parker miss houston ill be right there now if the rest of you will be patient my niece will be right with you having no choice she waded through the bodies and voices and gripped jos arm out here for a minute i swear youd think we were about to be under nuclear attack most of them probably havent dealt with a hurricane before which is why im glad to help them on their way for heavens sake this island and everything on it have stood up to hurricanes before and will again since privacy was needed kate took it where she could get it in the powder room off the foyer with a little grunt of satisfaction she flipped the lock there that ought to hold for two damn minutes im sorry to leave you surrounded this way its okay i can run the next group down in the jeep no ikate spoke sharply then blowing out a breath she turned to the sink to splash cold water on her face youre not to leave this house jo ellen unless one of us is with you i dont need another thing to worry about for heavens sake i can lock the doors to the jeep no and i wont stand here and argue about it i just dont have the luxury of time for it youll help most right here keeping these people calm i have to swing around and pick up some of the cottage people brian was going by the campground well have another flood of them in shortly all right kate whatever you want your father brought the radio down to the kitchen she took jo by the arms hes well within hailing distance you take no chances you understand me i dont intend to i need to call nathan ive already done that he didnt answer ill go by before i bring the next group id feel better if he was here too thanks dont thank me honey pie im about to leave youwith the worlds biggest headache kate sucked in a breath braced her shoulders and opened the door jo winced at the din of voices from the parlor hurry back she said and mustered a weak smile as she walked straight into the line of fire outside giff muscled a sheet of plywood over the first panel of the wide dining room bay lexy crouched at his feet hammered a nail quickly and with easy skill into the lower corner she was chattering away but gaff heard only about every third word the wind had died and the light was beginning to take on a brutish yellow hue it was coming he thought and faster than theyd anticipated his family had their home secure and would likely ride it out there hed delegated one of his cousins and two friends to begin boarding up the cottages starting on the southeast and moving north they needed more hands has anyone called nathan i dont know lexy plucked another nail from her pouch daddy wouldnt let him help anyway mr hathaways a sensible man lexy he wants whats his secured and hes had a night to think things through hes as stubborn as six constipated mules and him and brian together are worse than that why its like blaming that bastard shermans greatgrandchildren for burning atlanta some do i imagine gaff hefted another sheet those who havent a nickels worth of brains i imagine her teeth set lexy whacked the hammer onto a nailhead and its going to be mighty lowering for me if i have to admit my own daddy and brother got shortchanged in the brain department and that theyre half blind to boot why an eightyyearold granny without her cheaters could see how much that man loves jo ellen its sinful to make the two of them feel guilty over it she straightened blowing the hair out of her eyes then frowned at him why are you grinning at me that way is my face all sweaty and grimy already youre the most beautiful thing ive ever seen in my lifetime alexs hathaway and you always surprise me even knowing you inde out you surprise me well honey she tilted her head batted her lashes i mean to giff slid his hand into his pocket fingered the small box hed tucked there i had different plans for doing this but i dont think ive ever loved you more than i do right this second he tugged the box out of his pocket watching her eyes go huge and wide as he flipped open the lid with his thumb the little diamond centered on the thin gold band winked out points of fire in the sun marry me alexa her heart swelled and butted against her ribs her eyes misted so that the light shooting from the diamond refracted and blinded her her hand trembled as she pressed it to her mouth oh how could you how could you spoil it all this way spinning around she thumped the hammer against the edge of the wood like i said he murmured youre always a surprise to me you want me to put it away until we have candlelight and moonbeams no no no with a little sob she struck the wood with the hammer again put it away take it back you know i cant marry you he shifted his feet planted them i dont know any such thing why dont you explain it to me if you keep asking you know ill give in because i love you so much then ill have given up everything else ill stay on this damn island i wont go back to new york and i wont try to make it in the theater again then ill start to hate you as the years pass and i start to think if only if only ill just shrivel up here wondering if i could ever have been something what makes you think id expect you to give up on new york and the theater that id expect you to give up everything you want id hate to think youd marry a man who wants less for you than you want for yourself whatever you want for lexy i want twice that much she wiped a hand over her cheeks i dont understand you i plan on swinging a hammer on desire my whole life head then shoved it back on again things need to get built in new york dont they things need fixing there just like anywhere else could read them youre saying youd go to new york youd live in new york for me closed and shoved the box back into his pocket if i was to do that id just end up resenting you and wed be right back where we started im saying id go for both of us and that even with the money ive been putting by wed live pretty tight for a while id probably have to take some classes if i wanted nathan to give me a chance at a job in his firm a job with nathan you want to work in new york ive had a hankering to see it and to see you on stage in the spotlight i might not ever get there hell you wont his dimples winked down and his eyes went from sulky brown to golden ive never seen anybody who can play more roles youll get there lexy i believe in you tears gushed out even as she laughed and threw herself at him oh giff howd you get to be so perfect howd you get to be so right she leaned back catching his face in her hands so absolutely right for me ive been studying on it most of my life well have a time we will and ill wait damn tables until youre out of school or i get my break whatever it takes oh hurry up hurry up and put it on she jumped down held out her hand i cant hardly stand to wait ill buy you a bigger one someday no you wont she thrilled as he slipped the ring onto her finger as he lowered his head and kissed her you can buy me all the other bright shiny baubles you want when were rich because i want to be good and rich giff and im not ashamed to say so but this she held up her hand turning it so the little stone winked and danced with light this is just perfect after two hours jos head throbbed and her eyes were all but crossed kate had come and gone twice hauling guests to and from swinging by various cottages brian had dropped off a dozen campers then headed back to make another sweep in case there were any lingering her only news of nathan was that he was helping board up cottages along the beachfront except for the monotonous thwack of hammers the house was finally quiet she imagined kate would be back shortly with the last of the cottagers the windows on the south and east sides were boarded casting the house into gloom wlien she opened the front door the wind rushed in tjle cool slap of it was a shock after the thick heat of the closed house to the south the sky was bruised and dark she saw the flicker of lightning but heard no answering thunder still far enough away she decided she would check shortly and see what track they were predicting carla to take and as a precaution she would get all of her prints and negatives out of her darkroom and into the safe in kates office the main stairs checking rooms automatically to see that nothing had been left behind by a harried guest she flicked off lights moving briskly toward the family wing the sound of hammering was louder now and she found it comforting tucking us in she thought if carla lashed out at sanctuary it would hold as it had held before she caught the sound of voices as she went by kates office ply wood slipped over the window blanking it as she passed either brian was back or her father had gone out to help giff she decided she snapped on the lights in her darkroom then turned on the radio hurricane carla has been upgraded to category three and is expected to make landfall on the barrier island of little desire off the coast of georgia by seven pm tourists have been evacuated from this privately owned island in the sea islands chain and residents are being advised to leave as soon as possible winds of up to one hundred and twenty miles an hour are expected with the leading edge striking the narrow island near high tide her earlier confidence shaken jo dragged her hands through her hair it didnt get much worse than this she knew cottages would be lost by wind or water homes flattened the beach battered the forest ripped to pieces and their safety net was shrinking she thought with a glance at her watch she was going to get nathan and yirby and if she had to knock her father unconscious she was going to get him and her family off the island she yanked open a drawer she could leave the prints but damned if shed risk losing all her negatives but as she started to reach for them her hand froze on top of her neatly organized files was a stack of prints her head went light her skin clammy as she stared down into her mothers face shed seen this print before in another darkroom in what almost seemed like another life over the roaring in her head she could hear her own low moan as she reached out for it it was real she could feel the slick edge of the print between her fingers breathing shallowly she turned it over read the carefully written title death of an angel she bit back a whimper and forced herself to look at the next print grief swarmed over her stinging like wasps the pose was nearly identical as though the photographer had sought to reproduce one from the other but this was ginny her lively friendly face dull and lax her eyes empty im sorry jo whispered pressing the print to her heart im sorry im so sorry the third print was certainly susan peters jo shut her eyes willed the sickness away and gently set the third print aside and her knees went to water the last print was of herself her eyes were serenely closed her body pale and naked sounds strangled in her throat as she dropped the photo backed away from it she groped behind lier for the door the adrenaline pumping through her priming her to run she backed sharply into the table knocked the radio onto its side music jangled out making her want to scream no she fisted her hands digging her nails into her palms until the pain cut through the shock im not going to let it happen im not going to believe it i wont let it be true she rocked herself counting breaths until the faintness passed then grim and determined she picked up the photo again her face yes it was her face taken before lexy had cut her hair for the bonfire several weeks then the bonfire had been at the very start of summer she carried the photo closer to the light ordered herself to study it with an objective and trained eye it took her only seconds of clear vision to realize that while the face was hers the body wasnt the breasts were too full the hips too round she set the photo of annabelic beside it was it more horrifying she wondered dully to realize her face had been imposed on her mothers body making them one she thought thats what hed wanted all along brian steered the jeep down the maintenance road of the campground several of the sites had been left in disarray with the way the storm was rolling in he figured that wasnt going to matter much the wind was already ripping like razors through the trees a gust shook the jeep around him had him gripping the wheel tighter he calculated they had perhaps an hour to finish preparations he had to fight not to hurry this check run he wanted to get to fely yirby lock her sa inside sanctuary hed have preferred shipping her off to the mainland but knew better than to waste his breath or his energy arguing with her if one resident stayed put to ride it out she would stay put to treat any injuries sanctuary had stood for more than a hundred years brian thought it would stand through this there were dozens of other worries they would undoubtedly be cut off from the mainland the radio would help but there would be no phone no power and no transportation once they were hit hed fueled the generator to provide emergency power and he knew kate kept an ample supply of bottled water they had food they had shelter they had several strong backs and after carla did her worst strong backs were going to be a necessity he continued to tick off tasks and options in his mind growing calmer as he assured himself there were no stragglers in the camping areas he only hoped there werent any idiots hiding out in the trees or staking in near the beach thinking a hurricane was a vacation adventure he cursed and stomped on the brakes as a figure stepped out on the road in front of the jeep jesus christ you idiot disgusted brian slammed out of the vehicle i damn near ran you over havent you got the sense to stay out of the middle of the road much less the path of an oncoming hurricane i heard about that his grin spread wide amazing thing yeah amazing resenting every second wasted brian jerked a thumb at the jeep get in i might be able to get you down for the last ferry but there isnt much time oh i dont know about that still smiling he lifted the hand hed held behind his back and fired the gun brian jerked back as pain exploded in his chest he staggered fought to keep the world from revolving and as he fell he saw the eyes of a childhood friend laughing one down using his boot he nudged brians limp body over i appreciate the opportunity to fix the odds a bit old pal and the loan of the jeep as he hopped in he gave brian one last glance dont worry ill see it gets back to sanctuary eventually ral n began to lash at the windows as yirby gathered medical supplies she was dead calm as she tried to anticipate every possible need if she was forced into triage it would work best at sanctuary shed already faced the very real possibility that the cottage might not survive the night she understood that most of the islanders would be too stubborn to leave their homes by morning there could be broken bones concussions gashes the house trembled under a hard gust and she set her jaw she would be there to treat any and all injuries she was hefting a box heading out to load it in her car when her front door swung open it took her a moment to recognize the figure in the yellow slicker and hood as giff here she shoved the box into his arms take this out ill get the next one figured youd be putting this kind of thing together make it fast the bitch is coming in ive nearly got everything packed she pulled on her own slicker wheres brian he was checking the campground isnt back yet well he should have been she snapped worry dogged her heels as she ran in for the rest of her supplies the wind shoved her backward when she tried to step out on her porch it whistled past her ears as she bent low and fought her way forward you all secure here gaff shouted over the pounding of the surf as much as possible nathan helped me with it this morning is he back at the house no havent seen him either for gods sake she pushed back her already streaming hair what in hell could they be doing were going by the campground gaff we dont have a lot of time here yirby were going by brian could be in trouble this wind could have taken some trees down if he wasnt at sanctuary when you left and you didnt pass him along the way here he could still be over there im not going in until i make sure he yanked open the jeep door and bundled her inside youre the doctor he shouted i goddamn son of a bitch nathan beat the heel of his hand against the steering wheel hed loaded the most precious of his work and equipment into the jeep and now it wouldnt start it didnt even have the decency to cough and sputter furious he climbed out hissing as the rising wind slapped hard pricks of rain into his face he hauled up the hood cursed again he didnt have time for the pretense of fixing whatever was wrong he needed to get to jo and he needed to get to her now hed done everything else he could he slammed the hood down and abandoning his equipment began to trudge toward the river hed have to go a quarter of a mile upstream before he could cross and the hike over to sanctuary through the woods promised to be miserable he heard the ominous creak of trees being shoved and tortured by the wind felt the hard hands of it playfully pushing him back as he lurched forward lightning snapped overhead turning the sky to an eene orange the wind stung his eyes blurred his vision he didnt see the figure step out from behind a tree until he was almost upon it christ what the hell are you doing out here it took him nearly ten baffled seconds to see past the changes and recognize the face kyle horror tripped over shock my god what have you done hello bro as if they were meeting on a sunny street kyle offered a hand and as nathan shifted his gaze for a blink to stare at it kyle smashed the butt of the gun into his temple two down this time he threw back his head and roared the storm empowered him the violence of it aroused him i didnt feel quite right about shooting my own brother irritating bastard though he is in what some would call cold blood he crouched down whispering as if nathan could hear the rivers going to rise you know trees are going to go down whatever happens bro well just figure its fate he straightened and leaving his brother lying on ground soaked with rain and blood started off to claim the woman hed decided belonged to him am gushed over the windshield of the jeep overpowering the wipersthe road was turning to mush under the wheels so giff had to fight for every yard of progress were heading in he told kirby brians got more sense than to be out in this and so do i just take the west route back she prayed it was the storm making her heart thump and freezing her bones thats the way hed have gone then well be sure south roads quicker please abandoning his better judgment gaff muscled the jeep to the left if we get back in one piece hes going to skin me for keeping you out here five minutes longer than necessary thats all itll be five extra minutes she leaned forward struggling to see through the waterfall streaming down the windshield what is that something on the side of the road up ahead probably some gear that fell out of somebodys camper people were scrambling to get the hell off before stop shouting she grabbed the wheel herself and sent them into a skid jesus christ you aiming to send us into a ditch hey though he reached out to stop her he only caught the tip of her slicker as she bolted out into the torrent of rain goddamn women he shoved open the door kirby get back in here this winds liable to blow you clean to savannah help me for gods sake giff its brian her frigid hands were already tearing open the bloody shirt hes been shot i where could they be while the wind pounded the walls lexy paced the main parlor where could they be gaffs been gone nearly an hour and brian twice that long maybe they took shelter kate huddled in a chair and vowed not to panic they might have decided not to try to get back and took shelter gaff said hed be back he promised then he will be kate folded her hands to keep from wringing them theyll be here in a minute and theyll be tired and wet and id lexy lets go n and get coffee into thermoses before we lose co power how can you think about coffee when she cut herself off squeezed her eyes shut all right its better than just standing here windows all boarded you cant even look out for them well get hot food hot coffee dry clothes kate reeled off the practicalities picking up a flashlight as a precaution as she took lexy with her when they were gong jo rose her father stood across the room his back to her staring at the boardedup window as if he could will himself to see through the plywood daddy hes been in the house what hes been in the house she kept her voice calm as he turned i didnt want to say anything to lexy and kate yet theyre both frightened enough id hoped theyd get on the last ferry but with brian still out sams stomach began to burn youre sure of this yes he lefthes been in my darkroom sometime in the last two days i cant be sure when nathan delaneys been in this house its not nathan sam kept his gaze hard and steady im not willing to take a chance on that you go in the kitchen with kate and lexy and you stay with them ill go through the house im going with you youre going to do what i tell you and go in the kitchen not one of you takes a step without the other two its me he wants if theyre with me theyre only in more danger no ones going to touch anyone of mine in this house he took her arm prepared to drag her into the kitchen if necessary the front door burst open letting in wild wind and flooding rain upstairs giff get him upstairs breathing fast kirby side stepped to keep the pressure firm on brians chest as giff staggered under his weight i need my supplies out of the jeep now she ordered as sam and jo raced forward i need sheets towels i need light hurry hes lost so much blood kate dashed down the hall god sweet god what happened hes been shot yirby kept deliberate pace with giff never taking her eyes off brians face radio the mainland find out how long itll take to get a helicopter in we need to get him to a hospital and we need the police hurry with the supplies ive already lost too much time without bothering with rain gear sam ran out into the storm he was blind before hed reached the jeep deaf but for the roar of blood in his head and the scream of the wind he dragged the first box free then found jo shoving past him for the next they shouldered the weight and fought their way back into the house together shes putting him in the garden suite its the closest bed lexy put her back into it and managed to shut the door behind them she wont say how bad it is she wont say anything kates on the radio jo gripped the box until her knuckles were white as they hurried up the steps kirby had stripped off her bloodsmeared slicker tossed it aside she didnt hear the rain pound or the wind scream she had only one goal now to keep brian alive i need more pillows we need to keep his trunk and legs higher than his head keep the site of the bleeding elevated hes in shock he needs more blankets it went through i found the exit wound she pressed padding high on the back of his right shoulder her ungloved hand was covered with blood i cant tell what the internal damage might be but the blood loss is the first concern his bp is very low pulse is thready whats his blood type its a negative sam told her same as mine then well take some of yours for him i need someone to draw it ill talk you through but i dont have enough hands ill do it kate hurried in they cant tell us on the helicopter nothing can get on or off the island until carlas done with us everythings grounded oh god she wasnt a surgeon for the first time in her life yirby cursed herself for not heeding her fathers wishes the entrance wound was small easily dealt with but the exit wound had ripped a hole in brians back nearly as big as her fist she felt the panic scraping at her nerves and shut her eyes okay all right we need to get him stabilized giff for now keep pressure here right here and keep it firm if it bleeds through dont remove the padding add more use your other hand to hold this arterial pressure point keep your fingers flat and firm kate get my bag youll see the rubber tube youre going to make a tourniquet as she readied a syringe her voice went cool shed chosen to heal and by god she would heal she took one long look at brians waxy face im keeping you with me you hear as she slid the needle under his skin the house went black i nathan struggled toward the surface of a red mist slid back it seemed vital that he break through it though the pain whenever he got close to the thin shimmery skin was monstrous he was chilled to the bone felt as though he was being pulled down into a vat of icy water he clung to the edge again felt those mists close in and thicken and with a vicious leap cut through he found himself in a nightmare dark and violent the mind screamed like a thousand demons set loose and water gushed over him choking him when he tried to gulp in air with his head reeling he rolled over got on his hands and knees the water from the rising river beside him was up over his wrists he tried to gain his feet slid toward erunconsciousness the cold slap of water as his face hit the ground jerked alhim back kyle it had been kyle back from the dead this kyle had streaming blond hair rather than brown an almost brutal tan rather than citypale skin and lively madness in his eyes jo ellen he choked it out as he began to crawl away from the sucking water of the river murmured it like a prayer as he dug his fingers into the streaming bark of a tree to fight his way to his feet and as he began a stumbling windwhipped run to sanctuary he screamed it i im not going to lose him yirby spoke matteroffactly as she worked by the light of a lantern her mind wasnt calm forcing her out the screaming fears and doubts stay with me brian youll need more light giff stroked a hand over lexys hair if you can spare me here ill go down and get the generator started whoever did this lexy gripped his hand they could be anywhere you stay right here he lifted her hand to kiss it yirby may need some help he moved to the bed bending low as if to study brian and spoke sorry to sam you got a gun in the house sam continued to stare at the tubing that was transferring his blood to his son my room top of the closet theres a metal box got a thirtyeight and ammo his gaze shifted briefly measured the man ill trust you to use it if you have to gaff nodded turned to give lexy a quick smile ill be back is there another lantern more candles yirby lifted brians eye lid his pupils were dilated with shock if i dont close this exit wound hes going to lose more blood than i can get into him kate rushed over with a flashlight beamed it onto the ripped flesh dont let him go she fought to blink back the tears dont let my boy go were keeping him here we wont lose him kate sam reached out took the hand she had balled up at her side gaff may have trouble with the generator jo spoke quietly laying a hand on lexys shoulder im going to go down and get more emergency lights ill go with you no stay here kirby may need another pair of hands daddy cant help and kates not going to hold up much longer ill be quick she gave lexys shoulder a squeeze she took a flashlight and slipped out quietly she had to do something anything to help hold back the fear for brian for nathan for all of them what i if nathan was shot too lying out there bleeding dying there was nothing she could do to stop it and how could she live if she only stood by hes taken shelter she promised herself as she hurried down the stairs hed taken shelter and when the worst of the storm had passed shed find him theyd get brian to the mainland to a hospital she jolted at the loud crack the crashing of glass her mind froze envisioning another bullet more flesh ripped by steel then she saw the splintered plywood in the parlor window the flood of rain that poured in where the tree limb had snapped through it she grabbed a lantern lighting it and holding it high she would have to find giff as soon as she took the light to yirby they would have to get more wood block the damage before it was irreparable when she whirled back he was there this is nice kyle stepped forward into the light i was just coming up to get you no dont scream he lifted the gun so she could see it clearly ill kill whoever comes down to see m hat was wrong he smiled widely so hows your brother doing hes holding on she lowered the lantern so the shadows deepened beside her the storm blasted through the splintered wood and spit rain into her face its been a long time kyle not all that long in the grand scheme of things and ive been in close touch so to speak for months how did you like my work its competent bitch the word was quick and vicious then he shrugged come on be honest that last print you have to admit the creativity of the image the blending of old and new its one of my best studies clichdd at best wheres nathan kyle oh i imagine hes just where i left him he darted a hand out quick as a snake and gripped her by the hair for once im not going to worry about taking my big brothers leftovers the way i look at it he was just tenderizing you im much better than he is at everything always have been where is he maybe ill show you were going for a ride out in this she feigned resistance as he pulled her to the door she wanted him out away from sanctuary whatever it took you have to be crazy to go out in a category three what i am darling darling jo is strong he skimmed his lips over her temple powerful dont worry i wont let anything happen to you until everything is perfect ive planned it out open the door the lights flashed on using the split second of diversion she swung back with the flashlight aiming for the groin but bouncing hard off his thigh still he grunted in pained surprise and loosened his grip ripping away jo tore open the front door and rushed out into the teeth of the storm you want me you son of a bitch you come get me the minute he barreled through the door she was pitting her will against the gale and fighting to lead him away from sanctuary the rainlashed darkness swallowed them it was less than a minute later when giff climbed the steps from the basement he felt the mild gust of wind the instant he turned into the hall the front door was open wide to the driving rain with his blood cold he palled out the gun hed tucked in the waistband of his jeans flicked off the safety and moved forward his finger wrapped around the trigger trembled a breath away from frill pressure when nathan fell through the door jo ellen where is she what happened to you hating himself but unwilling to risk gaff kept the gun aimed as he walked forward i was coming my brother he swayed to his feet brushed a hand over the raw wound on his temple as his vision doubled it was my brother i thought you said he was dead hes not shaking his head clear nathan focused on the gun hes not he repeated wheres jo shes fine and safe and going to stay that way brian was shot god oh god is he dead yirbys working on him step away from the door nathan close it behind you keep your hands where i can see them goddamn it he bit off the words as he heard the scream the blood that had risen to his head to throb blindingly drained thats jo shes out there you move ill have to shoot you hes going to kill her im not going to let that happen to her im not letting it happen again for gods sake giff help me find her before he does it was a choice between instinct and caution giff prayed the choice was the right one and held the gun butt out well find her hes your brother you do what you have to do jo bit back another scream as a limb as thick as a mans torso crashed inches from her feet it was all swirling dark roaring sound and wild tearing wind tattered hunks of moss bulleted past her face saw palmettos rattled like sabers stumbling she fought for another inch another foot while the wind raked at her finally she dropped to her knees wrapped her arms around the base of a tree afraid she would simply be ripped apart shed led him away she prayed shed led him away but now she was lost the forest was shuddering with greedy violence pain came at her like knives stabbing her flesh she couldnt hear her own breathing now though she knew it must be harsh and fast because her lungs were on fire his search if he got back before she did he would kill them all as hed surely killed nathan sobbing she began to crawl digging her hands into the mud to pull her body along inch by straining inch inside yirby clamped off the tube that was transferring sams blood to brian she couldnt risk taking any more until sam had rested sam needs fluids and some protein this has sapped his strength juice she began wearily stretching her back before she lowered her hand to take brians pulse when his fingers bumped hers her eyes flew to his face she caught the faint flutter of his lashes hes coming around brian open your eyes brian come back now concentrate on opening your eyes is he all right is he going to be all right lexy crowded closer isher shoulder bumping kirbys his pulse is a little stronger get me the bp cuff brian open your eyes now thats the way her throat burned as she watched his eyes open struggle to focus take it easy take it slow i dont want you to move just try to bring my face into focus can you see me ye ah the pain was outrageous an inferno in his chest dimly ehe thought he heard someone weeping but kirbys eyes were dry and clear good her hand trembled a little but she steadied it to shine a light in his eyes just lie still let me check you over what happened you were hurt baby weeping helplessly kate took his hand and lowered her cheek to it kirbys fixing you up fuzzy he managed turning his head restlessly he saw his fathers face pale and exhausted then the tube that connected them hurts like a bitch he said then watched in amazement as sam covered his face with his hands and shook with sobs what the hells going on what he sank back weak as a baby under yirbys firm hands i said lie still im not having you undo all my work here ill give you something for the pain in just a minute blood pressures coming back up hes stabilizing can i get some water or something i feel like ive been he trailed off as it snapped back to his mind the figure on the road the dull glint of a gun the explosion in his chest shot he shot me kirby and giff found you lexy told him struggling to reach around and take his other hand they brought you home she saved your life it was kyle kyle delaney the pain was coming in waves now making his breath short i recognized him his eyes he had sunglasses on before he was the day i cut my hand it was kyle in there with you he was with you the artist kirby lowered the hypo shed prepared the beach bum it was kyle delaney hes been here all along hold still hold him still lexy damn it brian frightened by his struggles to get up kirby plunged the needle into him with more haste than finesse youll start the bleeding up again damn it help me here kate hell hurt himself before the drug can take effect kate pressed her hand on brians shoulder and looked with frightened eyes around the room wheres jo where is jo ellen lost lost in the dark and the cold she wondered if the wind was dying down or if she was just so used to its nasty buffeting that she no longer felt it trying to kill her she tried to imagine herself springing to her feet and running she wanted to will herself to try it but was too weak too tired to do more than belly along the ground shed lost all sense of direction and was afraid she would end up crawling blindly into the river to drown but she wouldnt stop couldnt stop as long as there was a chance of reaching home and if she was lost he might be lost as well another tree crashed somewhere behind her falling with a force that shook the ground she thought she heard someone call her name but the wind ripped the sound away he would call her she thought as her teeth began to chatter he would call her hoping shed give herself away so that he could kill her as he had the others as his father had killed her mother she was nearly tired enough to let him but she wanted him dead more for her mother she thought pulling herself along another foot for ginny for susan peters she gritted her teeth and dragged herself and for nathan she saw the light just the narrow beam of it and curled herself into a ball behind a tree but the light held steady didnt waver as a flashlight or a lantern held in the hand of a man would sanctuary she realized pressing her muddy hands to her mouth to hold back a sob that narrow beam of light from the parlor breaking through the broken window gathering her strength she forced herself to her feet she had to brace a hand on the tree until her head stopped spinning but she concentrated on the light and put one foot in front of the other when she reached the edge of the trees she began to run i knew youd come back kyle stepped into her path pressed the barrel of the gun against her throat ive been studying you long enough to know how you think she couldnt stop the tears this time why are you doing this isnt what your father did enough he never thought i was good enough you know not as good as him certainly not as good as golden boy all i needed was the right inspiration he smiled as rain streamed down his face and his hair blew madly were going to have to clean you up quite a bit no problem ive got plenty of supplies back at the campground mens showers remember yes i remember i love practical jokes ive been playing them on nathan all our lives he never knew oh did mister yittycat run away no indeed mr kitty took a little dip in the river inside a plastic bag why nathan how could you be so careless as to cover all the holes in the lightning bug jar with your classic boys novel with a laugh kyle shook his head i used to drive him crazy doing stuff like thatmaking him wonder how the hell it had happened he gestured with the gun jeeps at the base of the road whats left of the road well have to walk that far you hated him oh definitely he gave her a playful nudge to get her going my father always favored him but then my father wasnt the man we always thought he was that was a real eyeopener david delaneys little secret he was good but im better and youre my masterpiece jo ellen the way annabelle was his theyll blame nathan for it too thats so wonderfully satisfying if he survives theyll lock him away she stumbled righted herself hes alive its possible hell start screaming about his dead brother then sooner or later theyll look in his cottage i took the time to drop some photographs off there all the angles too bad i wont be able to slip one of yours in with them he could be alive she thought and she was going to fight to stay alive turning she pushed her sopping hair back shed been right she realized the sharpest edge of the storm was dulling she could stand up to it and to him the trouble is kyle your father was a firstrate photographer his style was perhaps a bit conservative and in some cases pedestrian but youre thirdrate at best your composition is poor your discipline spotty you have no knack for lighting whatsoever when his hand swung out she was ready she ducked under it and leading with her head rammed his body his feet slid out from under him sent him skidding down on his knees she grabbed is wrist inching her hand up toward the gun but he swept an arm under her legs and took her down you bitch do you think im going to take your insults do you think im going to let you spoil this after all the trouble ive gong to he grabbed for her hair but his hand closed on nothing but rain as she twisted her body around and used her feet to knock him back shells bit into her hands as she crabwalked back fought for purchase she saw him lift the gun kyle kyles attention bolted to the right and so did his aim nathan his grin spread the lip jo ellen had split icaked blood onto his chin well this is interesting you wont use that he nodded at the gun nathan had leveled at him you dont have the spine for killing you never did put the gun down its over wrong again our father started it but ill finish it he got slowly to his feet ill finish it nathan in ways even he couldnt have imagined my decisive moment my triumph he only planted the seeds im reaping them reaping them nathan im making them my own think of how proud hed be of what ive accomplished not just following in his footsteps enlarging them yeah despite the cold on his skin a hot sickness churned in what we call a mexican standoff do you shoot me or do i shoot you he gave a quick brittle laugh that raked along nathans brain since i know youre gutless i already know the answer to that how about if i change the game shift the rules like i used to do when we were kids and shoot her first as he swung the gun toward jonathan squeezed the trigger kyle jerked back his mouth dropping open as he pressed a hand to his chest and it came away wet with blood you killed me you killed me for a woman nathan lowered the gun as kyle crumpled you were already dead he murmured he walked toward jo watching as she got to her feet then his arms were around her he was already dead were all right she pressed her face to his shoulder hanging on were all right now gaff came skidding down the pitted road his eyes hardened when he saw the figure crumpled on the ground he lifted his gaze to nathan get her inside you need to get her inside nathan shifted jo to his side and walked through the weakening storm toward sanctuary helicopters are on their way ones dnnging the police theyll medevac you to the mainland i dont want to go to the hospital kirby walked to the bed lifted brians wrist to check is pulse yet again too bad youre not in any position to argue with your doctor what are they going to do there that you havent already done a great deal more than my emergency patch job she checked his bandages pleased that there was no fresh bleeding youll have a couple of pretty nurses some dandy drugs and in a few days youll be on your feet and back home he considered how pretty are the nurses im sure theyre her voice broke and though she turned away quickly he saw the tears spring to her eyes hey i was only kidding he fumbled for her hand i wont even look at them im sorry i thought i had it under control she turned back sliding to her knees to drop her head on the side of the bed i was so scared so scared you were bleeding so badly your pulse was just slipping away under my hands but you didnt let it he stroked her hair you brought me back stayed with me and look at you he nudged until she lifted her face you havent had any sleep ill sleep later she pressed her lips to his hand over and over ill sleep for days you could pull some strings share my hospital room maybe then you could come back here share my room while im recuperating i suppose i could then when im recovered you could just share the rest of my life she knuckled a tear away if thats a proposal youre supposed to be the one on your knees but youre such an aggressive woman youre right she turned her cheek into his hand and since i feel at least somewhat responsible that you have a rest of your life it seems only right that i share it with you the gardens are ruined jo looked down at the sodden beaten blooms drowning in mud itll take weeks to clean them out save what can be saved and start again is that what you want to do nathan asked her save what can be saved and start again she glanced over the bandage yirby had applied to his temple was shockingly white against his skin his eyes were deeply shadowed still exhausted she wrapped her arms around herself turned in a slow circle the sun was radiant the air stunningly fresh she could see the wreck through toppled trees the broken pottery that had been the little fountain the now roofless smokehouse branches and leaves and glass littered the patio above them gaff and lexy worked on prying off the protective plywood and opening the windows to the light she saw her father and kate at the edge of the trees then with wonder and amazed joy saw him drape an arm around kates shoulders yes id like that id like to stay a while longer help them put things back it wont be exactly as it was but it might be better
