the flowerwomen clark ashton smith athlй said maal dweb i suffer from the frightful curse of omnipotence in all xiccarph and in the five outer planets of the triple suns there is no one there is nothing to dispute my domination therefore ny ennui has become intolerable the girlish eyes of athlй regarded the enchanter with a gaze of undying astonishment which however was not due to his strange avowal she was the last of the fiftyone women that maal dweb had turned into statues in order to preserve their frail corruptible beauty from the wormlike gnawing of time since through a laudable desire to avoid monotony he had resolved never to repeat again this particular sorcery the magician had cherished athlй with the affection which an artist feels for the final masterpiece of a series he had placed her on a little dais beside the ivory chair in his chamber of meditation often he addressed to her his queries or monologues and the fact that she did not reply or even hear was to him a signal and unfailing recommendation there is but one remedy for this boredom of mine he went on the abnegation at least for a while of that all too certain power from which it springs therefore i maal dweb the ruler of six worlds and all their moons shall go forth alone unheralded and without other equipment than that which any fledgling sorcerer might possess in this way perhaps i shall recover the lost charm of incertitude the foregone enchantment of peril adventures that i have not foreseen will be mine and the future will wear the alluring veil of the mysterious it remains however to select the field of my adventurings maal dweb arose from his curiously carven chair and waved back the four automatons of iron having the likeness of armed men that sprang to attend him he passed along the halls of his palace where painted hangings told in vermilion and purple the dread legends of his power through ebon valves that opened noiselessly at the uttering of a highpitched word he entered the chamber in which was his planetarium the room was walled floored and vaulted with a dark crystal full of tiny numberless fires that gave the illusion of unbounded space with all its stars in midair without chains or other palpable support there hung an array of various globes that represented the three suns the six planets and thirteen moons of the system ruled by maal dweb the miniature suns amber emerald and carmine bathed their intricately circling worlds with an illumination that reproduced at all times the diurnal conditions of the system itself and the pigmy satellites maintained always their corresponding orbits and relative positions the sorcerer went forward walking as if on some unfathomable gulf of night with stars and galaxies beneath him the poising worlds were level with his shoulders as he passed among them disregarding the globes that corresponded to mornoth xiccarph ulassa nouph and rhul he came to voltap the outermost which was then in aphelion on the farther side of the room votalp a large and moonless world revolved imperceptibly as he studied it for one hemisphere he saw the yellow sun was at that time in total eclipse behind the sun of carmine but in spite of this and its greater distance from the solar triad votalp was lit with sufficient clearness it was mottled with strange hues like a great cloudy opal and the mottlings were microscopic oceans isles mountains jungles and deserts fantastic sceneries leapt into momentary salience taking on the definitude and perspective of actual landscapes and then faded back amid the iridescent blur glimpses of teeming multifarious life incredible tableaux monstrous happenings were beheld by maal dweb as he looked down like some celestial spy it seemed however that he found little to divert or inveigle him in these outrй doings and exotic wonders vision after vision rose before him summoned and dismissed at will as if he were turning the pages of a familiar volume the wars of gigantic wyverns the matings of halfvegetable monsters the queer algae that had filled a certain ocean with their living and moving labyrinths the remarkable spawn of certain polar glaciers all these elicited no gleam or sparkle in his dulled eyes of blackish emerald at length on that portion of the planet which was turning into the double dawn from its moonless night he perceived an occurrence that drew and held his attention for the first time he began to calculate the precise latitude and longitude of the surrounding milieu there he said to himself is a situation not without interest in fact the whole affair is quaint and curious enough to warrant my intervention i shall visit votalp he withdrew from the planetarium and made a few preparations for his meditated journey having changed his robe of magisterial sable and scarlet for a hodden mantle and having removed from his person every charm and talisman with the exception of two phylacteries acquired during his novitiate he went forth into the garden of his mountainbuilded palace he left no instructions with the many retainers who served with him for these retainers were automatons of iron and brass who would fulfill their various duties without injunction till he returned traversing thecurious labyrinth which he alone could solve he came to the verge of the sheer mesa where pythonlike lianas drooped into space and metallic palms deployed their armaments of foliage against the farflung horizons of the world xiccarph empires and cities lying supine beneath his magical dominion were unrolled before him but giving them hardly a glance he walked along the estrade of black marble at the very brink till he reached a narrow promontory around which there hung at all times a deep and hueless cloud obscuring the prospect of the lands below and beyond the secret of this cloud affording access to multiple dimensions and deeply folded realms of space conterminous with far worlds was known only to maal dweb he had built a silver drawbridge on the promontory and by lowering its airy span into the cloud he could pass at will to the farther zones of xiccarph or could cross the very void between the planets now after making certain highly recondite calculations he manipulated the machinery of the light drawbridge so that its other end would fall upon the particular terrain he desired to visit in votalp then assuring himself that his calculations and adjustments were flawless he followed the silver span into the dim bewildering chaos of the cloud here as he groped in a gray blindness it seemed that his body and members were drawn out over infinite gulfs and were bent through impossible angles a single misstep would have plunged him into spatial regions from which all his cunning sorcery could have contrived no manner of return or release but he had often trod these hidden ways and he did not lose his equilibrium the transit appeared to involve whole centuries of time but finally he emerged from the cloud and came to the farther end of the drawbridge before him was the scene that had lured his interest in votalp it was a semitropic valley level and open in the foreground and rising steeply at the other extreme with all its multiform fantasies of vegetation toward the cliffs and chasms of sable mountains horned with bloodred stone the time was still early dawn but the amber sun freeing itself slowly from the occultation of the sun of carmine had begun to lighten the hues and shadows of the valley with strange copper and orange the emerald sun was still below the horizon the terminus of the bridge had fallen on a mossy knoll which the hueless cloud had gathered even as about the promontory in xiccarph maal dweb descended the knoll feeling no concern whatever for the bridge it would remain as he had left it till the time of his return and if in the interim any creatures from votalp should cross the gulf and invade his mountain citadel they would meet a fearful doom in the snares and windings of the labyrinth or failing this would be exterminated by his iron servitors as he went down the knoll into the valley the enchanter heard an eery plaintive singing like that of sirens who bewail some irremediable misfortune the singing came from a sisterhood of unusual creatures half woman and half flower that grew on the valley bottom beside a sleepy stream of purple water there were several scores of these lovely and charming monsters whose feminine bodies of pink and pearl reclined amid the vermilion velvet couches of billowing petals to which they were attached these petals were borne on mattresslike leaves and heavy short wellrooted stems the flowers were disposed in irregular circles clustering thickly toward the center and with open intervals in the outer rows maal dweb approached the flowerwomen with a certain caution for he knew that they were vampires their arms ended in long tendrils pale as ivory swifter and more supple than the coils of darting serpents with which they were wont to secure the unwary victims drawn by their singing of course knowing in his wisdom the inexorable laws of nature he felt no disapproval of such vampirism but on the other hand he did not care to be its object he circled about the strange family at a little distance his movements hidden from their observation by their boulders overgrown with tall luxuriant lichens of red and yellow soon he neared the straggling outer plants that were upstream from the knoll on which he had landed and in confirmation of the vision beheld in the mimic world in his planetarium he found that the turf was upheaved and broken where five of the blossoms growing apart from their companions had been disrooted and removed bodily he had seen in his vision the rape of the fifth flower and he knew that the others were now lamenting her suddenly as if they had forgotten their sorrow the wailing of the flowerwomen turned to a wild and sweet and voluptuous singing like that of the lorelei by this token tbe enchanter knew that his presence had been detected inured though he was to such bewitchments he found himself far from insensible to the perilous luring of the voices contrary to his intention forgetful of the danger he emerged from the lee of the lichencrested rocks by insidious degrees the melody fired his blood with a strange intoxication it sang in his brain like some bewildering wine step by step with a temporary loss of prudence for which later he was quite unable to account he approached the blossoms now pausing at an interval that he deemed safe in his bemusement he beheld plainly the halfhuman features of the vampires leaning toward him with fantastic invitation their weirdly slanted eyes like oblong opals of dew and venom the snaky coiling of their bronzegreen hair the bright baneful scarlet of their lips that thirsted subtly even as they sang awoke within him the knowledge of his peril too late he sought to defy the captiously woven spell unwinding with a movement swift as light the long pale tendrils of one of the creatures wrapped him round and he was drawn resisting vainly toward her couch at the moment of his capture the whole sisterhood had ceased their singing they began to utter little cries of triumph shrill and sibilant murmurs of expectation like the purrings of hungry flame arose from the nearest who hoped to share in the good fortune of the sorcerers captress maal dweb however was now able to utilize his faculties without alarm or fear he contemplated the lovely monster who had drawn him to the verge of her velvet bed and was fawning upon him with sinisterly parted lips using a somewhat primary power of divination he apprised himself of certain matters concerning the vampire having learnt the true occult name which this creature shared with all others of her kind he then spoke the name aloud in a firm but gentle tone and winning thus by an elemental law of magic the power of mastery over his captress and her sisters he felt the instant relaxation of the tendrils the flowerwoman with fear and wonder in her strange eyes drew back like a startled lamia but maal dweb employing the halfarticulate sounds of her own language began to soothe and reassure her in a little while he was on friendly terms with the whole sisterhood these simple and naive beings forgot their vampire intentions their surprise and wonderment and seemed to accept the magician very much as they accepted the three suns and the meteoric conditions of the planet votalp conversing with them he soon verified the information obtained through the mimic globe as a rule their emotions and memories were shortlived their nature being closer to that of plants or animals than of humankind but the loss of five sisters occurring on seccessive mornings had filled them with grief and terror that they could not forget the missing flowers had been carried away bodily the depredators were certain reptilian beings colossal in size and winged like pterodactyls who came down from their new built citadel among the mountains at the valleys upper extreme these beings known as the ispazars seven in number had become formidable sorcerers and had developed an intellection beyond that of their kind together with many esoteric faculties preserving the cold and evilly cryptic nature of reptiles they had made themselves the masters of an abhuman science but until the present maal dweb had ignored them and had not thought it worth while to interfere with their evolution now through an errant whim in his search for adventure he had decided to pit himself against the ispazars employing no other weapons of sorcery than his own wit and will his remembered learning his clairvoyance and the two simple amulets that he wore on his person be comforted he said to the flowerwomen for verily i shall deal with these miscreants in a fitting manner at this they broke into a shrill babble repeating tales the birdpeople of the valley had told them regarding the fortress of the ispazars whose walls rose sheerly from a hidden peak unscaled by man and were void of portal or window save in the highmost ramparts where the flying reptiles went in and out and they told him other tales concerning the ferocity and cruelty of the ispazars smiling as if at the chatter of children he diverted their thoughts to other matters and told them many stories of odd and curious marvels and queer happenings in alien worlds in the meanwhile he perfected his plan for obtaining entrance to the citadel of the reptilian wizards the day went by in such divertissements and one by one the three suns of the system fell beyond the valleys rim the flowerwomen grew inattentive they began to nod and drowse in the richly darkening twilight and maal dweb proceeded with certain preparations that formed an essential part of his scheme through his power of secondsight he had determined the identity of the victim whom the reptiles would carry away in their next raid on the morrow this creature as it happened was the one who had sought to ensnare him like the others she was now preparing to fold herself for the night in her voluminous couch of petals confiding part of his plan to her maal dweb manipulated in a singular fashion one of the amulets which he wore and by virtue of this manipulation reduced himself to the proportions of a pigmy in this state with the assistance of the drowsy siren he was able to conceal himself in a hollow space among the petals and thus embowered like a bee in a rose he slept securely through the short moonless night of votalp the dawn awakened him glowing as if through lucent curtains of ruby and purple he heard the flowerwomen murmuring sleepily to one another as they opened their blossoms to the early suns their murmurs however soon changed into shrill cries of agitation and fear and above the cries there came a vibrant drumming as of great dragonwings he peered from his hidingplace and saw in the double dawn the descent of the ispazars from whose webbed vans a darkness fell on the valley nearer they drew and he saw their cold and scarlet eyes beneath scaly brows their long undulant bodies their lizard limbs and prehensile claws and he heard the deep articulate hissing of their voices then the petals closed about him blindly shuddering and constrictive as the flowerwomen recoiled from the swooping monsters all was confusion terror tumult but he knew from his observation of the previous rape that two of the ispazars had encircled the flowers stem with their pythonlike tails and were pulling it from the ground as a human sorcerer might pull a mandrake plant he felt the convulsive agony of the disrooted blossom he heard the lamentable shrieking of her sisters then there came a heavier beating of the drumloud wings and the feeling of giddy ascension and flight through all this maal dweb maintained the utmost presence of mind and he did not betray himself to the ispazars after many minutes there was a slackening of the headlong flight and he knew that the reptiles were nearing their citadel a moment more and the ruddy gloom of the shut petals darkened and purpled about him as if they had peered from the sunlight into a place of deep shadow the thrumming of wings ceased abruptly the living flower was dropped from a height on some hard surface and maal dweb was nearly hurled from his hiding place by the violence of her fall moaning faintly twitching a little she lay where her captors had flung her the enchanter heard the hissing voices of the reptile wizards the rough sharp slithering of their tails on a stone floor as they withdrew whispering words of comfort to the dying blossom he felt the petals relax about him he crept forth very cautiously and found himself in an immense gloomily vaulted hall whose windows were like the mouths of a deep cavern the place was a sort of alchemy a den of alien sorceries and abhorrent pharmaceutics everywhere in the gloom there were vats cupels furnaces alembics and matrasses of unhuman form bulking and towering colossally to the pigmy eyes of maal dweb close at hand a monstrous cauldron fumed like a crater of black metal its curving sides ascending far above the magicians head none of the ispazars was in sight but knowing that they might resume at any moment he hastened to make ready against them feeling for the first time in many years the thrill of peril and expectation manipulating the second amulet he regained his normal proportions the room though still spacious was no longer a hall of giants and the cauldron beside him sank and lessened till its rim rose only to his shoulder he saw now that the cauldron was filled with an unholy mixture of ingredients among which were finely shredded portions of the missing flowerwomen together with the gall of chimeras and the ambergris of leviathans heated by unseen fires it boiled tumultuously foaming with black pitchy bubbles and putting forth a nauseous vapor with the shrewd eye of a past master of all chemic lore maal dweb proceeded to estimate the cauldrons various contents and was then able to divine the purpose for which the brewage was intended the conclusion to which he was driven appalled him slightly and served to heighten his respect for the power and science of the reptile sorcerers he saw indeed that it would be highly advisable to arrest their evolution after brief reflection it occurred to him that in accordance with chemical laws the adding of certain simple components to the brewage would bring about an eventuation neither desired nor anticipated by the ispazars on high tables about the walls of the alchemy there were jars flasks and vials containing subtle drugs and powerful elements some of which were drawn from the more arcanic kingdoms of nature disregarding the moonpowder the coals of starfire the jellies made from the brains of gorgons the ichor of salamanders the dust of lethal fungi the marrow of sphinxes and other equally quaint and pernicious matters the magician soon found the essences that he required it was the work of an instant to pour them into the seething cauldron and having done this he awaited with composure the return of the reptiles the flowerwoman in the meanwhile had ceased to moan and twitch maal dweb knew that she was dead since beings of this genus were unable to survive when uprooted with such violence from their natal soil she had folded herself to the face in her straitened petals as if in a red and blackening shroud he regarded her briefly not without commiseration and at that moment he heard the voices of the seven ispazars who had now reentered the alchemy they came toward him among the crowded vessels walking erect in the fashion of men on their short lizard legs their ribbed and sabled wings retracted behind them and their eyes glaring redly in the gloom two of them were armed with long sinuousbladed knives and others were equipped with enormous adamantine pestles to be employed no doubt in bruising the flesh of the floral vampire when they saw the enchanter they were both startled and angered their necks and torsos began to swell like the hoods of cobras and a great hissing rose among them like the noise of jetted steam their aspect would have struck terror to the heart of any common man but maal dweb confronted them calmly repeating aloud in low even tones a word of sovereign protective power the ispazars hurled themselves toward him some running along the floor with an undulant slithering motion and others rising on rapidbeating vans to attack him from above all however dashed themselves vainly on the sphere of unseen force he had drawn about him through the utterance of the word of power it was a strange thing to see them clawing vengefully at the void air or striking futile blows with their weapons which rang as if on a brazen wall now perceiving that the man before them was a sorcerer the reptile magicians began to make use of their own abhuman sorcery they called from the air great bolts of livid flame pythonshapen which leaped and writhed incessantly warring with the syhere of protective power driving it back as a shield is driven by press of numbers in battle but never breaking it down entirely also they chanted evil siblant runes that were designed to charm away the magicians memory and cause him to forget his magic sore was the travail of maal dweb as he fought the serpent fires and runes and blood mingled with the sweat of his brow from that endeavor but still as the bolts struck nearer and the singing loudened he kept uttering the unforgotten word and the word still protected him now above the snaky chanting he heard the deep hiss of the cauldron boiling more turbulently than before because of those matters which he had added to its contents and he saw between the everwrithing bolts that a more voluminous vapor dark as the steam of a primal fen was mounting from the cauldron and spreading throughout the alchemy soon the ispazars were immersed in the fumes as in a cloud of darkness and dimly they began to coil and twist convulsed with a strange agony the python flames died out on the air and the hissings of the ispazars became inarticulate as those of common serpents then falling to the floor while the black mist gathered and thickened above them they crawled to and fro on their bellies in the fashion of true reptiles and emerging at times from the vapor they shrank and dwindled as if hellfire had consumed them all this was even as maal dweb had planned he knew that the ispazars had forgotten their sorcery and science and a swift devolution flinging them back to the lowest state of serpenthood had come upon them through the action of the vapor but before the completion of the change he admitted one of the seven ispazars to the sphere that now served to protect him from the fumes the creature fawned at his feet like a tame dragon acknowledging him for its master then presently the cloud of vapor began to lift and he saw the other ispazars who were now little larger than fensnakes their wings had withered into use less frills and they crept and hissed on the floor amid the alembics and crucibles and athanors of their lost science maal dweb regarded them for a little not without pride in his own sorcery the struggle had been difficult even dangerous and he reflected that his boredom had been thoroughly overcome at least for the nonce from a practical standpoint he had done well for in ridding the flowerwomen of their persecutors he had also eradicated a possible future menace to his own dominion over the worlds of the three suns turning to that ispazar which he had spared for a necessary purpose he seated himself firmly astride its back behind the thick jointing of the vans he spoke a magic word that was understood by the monster bearing him between its wings it rose and flew obediently through one of the windows and leaving behind it for ever the citadel that was not to be scaled by man nor by any wingless creature it carried the magician over the red horns of the sable mountains across the valley where dwelt the sisterhood of floral vampires and descended on the mossy knoll at the end of that silver drawbridge whereby he had entered votalp there maal dweb dismounted and followed by the crawling ispazar he began his return journey to xiccarph through the hueless cloud above the multidimensional deeps midway in that pecular transit he heard a sharp sudden clapping of wings it ceased with remarkable abruptness and was not repeated looking back he found that the ispazar had fallen from the bridge and was vanishing brokenly amid irreconcilable angles in the gulf from which there was no return
