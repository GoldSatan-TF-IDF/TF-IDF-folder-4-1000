one tim archer got into the utility and drove it from the banbury feed and general supply pty ltd down the main street of the town the car was a chevrolet somewhat battered by four years of station use a sturdy practical vehicle with a coupe front seat and an open truck body behind in this rear portion he was carrying a fortyfourgallondrum of diesel oil four reels of barbed wire a can of kerosene a sack of potatoes a coil of new sisal rope a carton of groceries and a miscellaneous assortment of spades and jacks and chains that seldom left the truck he drove down the long treeshaded main street broad as whitehall and lined with wooden stores and bungalows widely spaced and stopped at the post office he was a lad of twentytwo with a broad guileless face with yellow hair and blue eyes and a fair bronzed skin he thought and moved rather slowly if you disliked the victorian countryside you would have said that he looked rather like a sheep one of the sheep he spent his life in tending his father had escaped from country life to melbourne at an early age and had become a solicitor tim archer had been sent to melbourne grammar school in turn he had escaped from city life when he was seventeen and he had gone to learn the business of sheep upon a station at wodonga in the north part of the state now he was working for jack dorman on a property called leonora twelve miles out from banbury and near a place called merrijig leonora was hardly to be classed as a sheep station being only eighteen hundred acres and merrijig was hardly to be classed as a place being only a school and a little wooden pub and a bridge over the river he had been at leonora for three years largely because he was in love in a slow patient manner with the youngest daughter of the house angela dorman he did not see much of her because she was away at melbourne university taking social studies he wrote to her from time to time simple rather laboured letters about lambing and floods and bush fires and horses she answered about one in three of these letters because the country bored her stiff he got out of the utility a big young man dressed in a check shirt open at the neck a pair of soiled blue canvas working trousers stained and dirty from the saddle and heavy country boots he went into the post office and said to the girl at the counter ill take the letters for leonora the mail delivery would not reach the station till late afternoon the girl said morning tim she handed him a bundle from the stacked table behind her going to the dance on saturday i dunno he said i havent got a partner go on she chaffed him you dont need a partner therell be more girls there than men where have all the girls sprung up from i dont know she said idly there seem to be a lot of girls about the town just now mostly new australians theyve got two new girls at the hospital wardmaids lithuanians they are i think i dont speak lithuanian the young man said aussies good enough for me aussie or english like cartridges for a twentytwo the continental stuffs no good he shuffled through the letters looking for the one that was not there that all there are nothing for me not unless its there she said with a touch of sympathy thats all there were for leonora okay he stood in silence for a moment while his mind changed topic ill have to see about the dance he said i dont know that ill be able to get in come if you can she said theres one or two aussie girlsll be there in among the new australians he smiled slowly theyre having favours paper caps balloons and all that ill have to see what jack says he may be using the utility he turned to go bye he went out and got into the utility and drove out of the town upon the road to merrijig that led on to the lumber camps up at lamirra in the forests of mount buller it was october and the spring sun was warm as he drove but the grass was still bright green and the upland pastures were fresh and beautiful there were wattle trees in flower still great splashes of yellow colour on the darker background of the gum tree forests and the gum trees themselves were touched with the reddish brown of the young shoots making them look a little like an english wood in autumn tim archer did not fully realize the beauty of the scene the wide sunny pastures and the woods that merged into the blue mountains to the south and east because this was where he lived and worked and scenery like that was normal to his life he only knew that this was where he liked to be far better than the town he was depressed as he drove out of town because he hadnt had a letter from angela as he had so often been depressed before he was sufficiently intelligent to know that his chance of getting angela was slender because she liked town life and hated the country while he was exactly the reverse he comforted himself with the opinion that all girls were like that when they were young they talked big about getting a job in melbourne and doing interior decoration and going on a business trip to england but in the end most of them came home and married and settled down in the district hed have to sit tight and let angie get it out of her system but it was going to be a long job and the thought depressed him the property he worked on leonora borders the road for about half a mile at merrijig from there the boundary of leonora runs for a mile up the delatite river then up to the wooded foothills of mount buller and then in a great sweep eastwards to the road again it is a good wellwatered property of eighteen hundred acres carrying two sheep to the acre with some beef cattle the homestead lies half a mile from the road a small bungalow built of weatherboard with an iron roof and with verandas on three sides there is a stockyard near the homestead and a few outbuildings it is reached from the road by a rough potholed track across the paddocks with three gates to open jack dorman had occupied the property for eighteen years first as manager and later as the owner by the courtesy of the bank of new south wales he was sitting on his horse that morning by the road gate waiting for tim archer to come out of town in the utility the horse was a rough pony an unkempt longhaired bay that lived out in the paddock and was never under cover and never groomed and seldom fed his property was about three miles long and a mile wide and though it was possible to drive over most of it in the utility jack dorman preferred to ride over it on horseback every morning as tim came over the crest of a small hill he saw his boss sitting waiting for him at the road gate and he wondered a little the rider moved the pony up to the road gate and hooked it open for the car to enter tim stopped the car just inside the gate and dorman reined up alongside get the letters he inquired i got them here mr dorman the lad said and handed up the bundle from the seat beside him dorman took them and sat on his horse looking through the envelopes he was fiftyeight years old but he had never strained his eyes with a great deal of reading and he could still read small print without glasses he took one letter from the bundle and put it in the breast pocket of his khaki shirt on that warm day he wore no coat he gave the rest of the letters back to tim archer who wondered what the one letter was about take them into the house his boss said get all the rest of the stuff not the engine oil they hadnt got any drums not till next weeks delivery they said i could have quart cans but it costs more that way i went along to the garage and had the sump checked but she only took a pint shes in good nick dont ever go buying oil less than five gallons a time the rider said daylight robbery theres another thing you want to watch theyll try to kid you that you want an oil change every thousand miles and thats a quid or so two thousand miles is what it says in the book my word you want to watch those jokers i never let them change the oil unless you say thats right go down and give mario a hand out with the crutching im going up to the top end the lad drove on and jack dorman walked his pony uphill across his pastures heading for the highest part where the uncleared virgin bush bordered his land on the slope of the mountain there were no sheep in the paddocks that he crossed because most of them were in the paddocks nearer to the homestead where mario kitti his italian man was skilfully heaving each sheep up on to a waisthigh board upon its back holding it with shoulders and elbow while he sheared the soiled wool from its tail gave it a dab of disinfectant and put it on the ground again it was heavy work but he could do them at the rate of about one a minute or more quickly with tim archer helping him but even so it would take a fortnight to work the crutching through dorman rode across the top paddock to where a rocky outcrop and a few gum trees made a place to sit in the shade a place from which you could look out over the whole valley of the delatite he could see most of his property from there and the winding river with the road bridge over it and the hunt club hotel and the track from the road to the homestead through his paddocks and the homestead itself small redroofed and insignificant in the great panorama he sat upon his horse contented looking out over all this for a minute then he dismounted and tethered the pony to the fence by the reins he crossed to the rocky outcrop and sat down in the shade and opened his letter it was a note of account from his agent in melbourne a long typescript sheet covered with figures which itemized the lot numbers of the wool sold for him at auction and the price paid for each lot a cheque was enclosed in settlement for twentytwo thousand one hundred and seventyeight pounds eight shillings and twopence he had known beforehand approximately what the sum would be from watching the sales in the newspaper last years wool cheque had been over ten thousand pounds and the year before that about seven thousand figures which had seemed amazing to him in their day those cheques however had meant little to him in terms of spending money they had gone straight into the bank in reduction of the loans upon his property and stock they had purchased his security but nothing tangible this time however it was different this twentytwo thousand pounds was his own money to spend or save exactly as he wished after the tax was paid jack dorman had come to leonora as manager in when times were bad and wool was less than two shillings a pound before that he had been manager of stations in gippsland and in the benalla district and before that again for six years after the first war he had been a traveller in agricultural machinery and fertilizers in his wifes father had died at his english country home at sutton bassett near wantage and with her legacy the dormans had managed to buy leonora with the very maximum assistance from the bank since then they had been deep in debt head over ears in it for the first four years it had been touch and go whether they would not go bankrupt whether the bank would not have to foreclose on an unprofitable business and sell the land to liquidate the increasing overdraft the demand for wool for uniforms had saved them as rearmament got under way and wool prices began to rise and for the last twelve years jack dorman had been paying off the debt on paper he had been gradually becoming a wealthy man but this was hidden deep in the accountancy the land and the stock on it had been gradually becoming his and not the banks but he still rose at dawn each day and got his two hired hands to work at the same time and still jane dorman worked from dawn to dusk in the oldfashioned kitchen of the homestead rearing her four children and cooking all the meals for the three men and eating with them at the long kitchen table in all those years she had had no help in the house and she had only been away from leonora three times for a weeks holiday they had had no electricity till two years previously when dorman had put in a little diesel plant now she was tired and old and grey at fiftythree and the children were all out in the world except angela and they were rich jack dorman sat turning the wool cheque over in his hands twentytwo thousand one hundred and seventyeight pounds eight shillings and twopence last years cheque had virtually cleared the overdraft his balance fluctuated a good deal but broadly speaking if he had died last year the whole of the money from the sale of land and stock would have gone to his heirs a matter of eighty or ninety thousand pounds at the inflated prices of the time it was an academic figure to him because neither he nor jane would have wanted to leave leonora they had grown into the place and it had become a part of them the eighty thousand pounds was quite unreal to them if it was there at all it only concerned the children and they might not touch a quarter of it if the bad times came again all that concerned jack dorman and his wife was that last years cheque had made them safe however much wool slumped they could never be turned out of leonora they could sleep without bad dreams of wandering bankrupt with no home nightmares that had plagued them through their thirtytwo years of married life jack dorman folded the wool cheque and put it in his shirt pocket again this one was his own he sat on in the shade for a few minutes looking out over his property a greyhaired heavy man of fiftyeight humming a little tune he had little musical appreciation but he liked the lighter programmes on the radio he was normally five years behind the times with the tunes that pleased him and stayed in his memory if jane had heard him she would have known that her stout ageing husband was very happy i dont want her you can have her shes too fat for me shes too fat for me oh shes too fat for me twentytwo thousand pounds and a bit and the fat lambs and the bullocks say twentysix thousand pounds in all expenses and income tax he drew a stub of pencil from his pocket and began figuring on the back of the wool cheque envelope hed whoop up his expenses this year my word he would hed have to see his accountant to find out what he could get away with he ought to have a new utility a mercury or an armstrong siddeley even a station like this needed a landrover hed keep the chev for the boys to use buildings mario ought to have a house and get his girl out from italy hed be more settled then could a weatherboard shack go on the one year or would they make him do it on depreciation if it went on the one year the tax would pay threequarters of the cost i go dizzy i go dumbo when im dancing with my jum jum jumbo say twenty thousand for tax he figured with his pencil hed have about seven thousand left after paying tax seven thousand pounds of his own money to spend or save that year and the price of wool still holding nicely he was in the money for the first time in his life there must be something that the station needed besides a landrover and a new utility and a house for mario presently he got on to his horse again and rode down to the homestead humming his little tune in the yard he unsaddled and hung saddle and bridle on a rail of the haybarn gave the pony a slap behind and turned it into the house paddock then he went into the kitchen and sat down at the long table jane was roasting a saddle of mutton for dinner as she had cooked mutton most days of her married life they ate a sheep in about ten days want a cup of tea she asked i dont mind he said and she poured him one out from the teapot on the table and then he told her got the wool cheque how much she asked idly little over twentytwo thousand he told her she was only mildly interested thats a bit more than last year isnt it aye she said like to peel these potatoes for me if youre doing nothing we dont have to do anything he told her not with a wool cheque like that but he got up and began to peel them at the sink you ought to have a girl to help you make her do things like this where do you think id get the girl from and then she asked how much would we have of that to spend after paying tax and expenses about seven thousand near as i can figure it he scraped away at the potatoes its all ours this time what do you want out of it she stared around the kitchen i want a memory tickler like bertha harrisons got one of those things you hang upon the wall with a long list of things to get in town and tabs to turn over to remind you she got hers in melbourne at mcewens thats only about five bobs worth he complained i know but i want it could we have a new stove jack this ones about worn out and the top plates cracked wed better have an aga or an esse youve got to have coke for those she said a wood stoves best out here and only about a tenth the money another one like this would be all right he said aw look jane weve got money to spend now the anxious years had bitten deep into her no need to chuck it away though she said we wouldnt be chucking it away itld be cooler in the kitchen with a stove like that its time we spent a bit of money anyway my word we havent had a holiday for years what do you say if we go down to melbourne for a week and do a bit of shopping stay at the windsor and see some theatres ive got a lot of things id like to do down there ive not got any clothes for staying in a place like that she said well get some he replied after all weve got seven thousand pounds to spend we wont have long if you go on like this we dont want to have it long it we hang on to the money itll only go to the kids after our time and theyll have enough to spoil them anyhow i dont hold with leaving kids a lot of money we never had any and we got through she poured herself a cup of tea and he left the sink and came and sat at the table with her id like to go to melbourne for a week she said thoughtfully if weve really got the money when was it we went down there last two years ago he said when we took angie to the university is it as long as that well i suppose it would be i wouldnt want to go before the show the banbury show was in the middle of december she always competed in the flower section and in the homemade cakes and usually won a prize in both and then theres christmas she said everybodys on holiday till the middle of january he nodded suppose we booked a room for a week about the middle of january she smiled id like that jack give me time to get some clothes made up i couldnt go to the windsor with what ive got now he pulled a packet of cigarettes out of his pocket and passed it across to her she took one and he lit it for her and for a while they sat smoking in silence we could do a lot of things he said we could make that trip home in their hard early married life a trip home to england had been her great desire always to be frustrated by their circumstances she was english the daughter of an admiral brought up in all the comfort and security of a small country house before the first war and sent to a good school in she had joined the waacs with a commission as was proper for the daughter of a senior naval officer and in she had shocked her parents by falling in love with an australian a lieutenant in the first aif her family never understood jack dorman and did everything they could to dissuade her from marrying him and succeeded in preventing her from doing so till she was twentyone in she married him on her birthday he was a ranker officer for one thing which in those days damned him from the start he had been an nco in gallipoli and in france for nearly three years and he had only recently been commissioned he was an unpleasantly tough young man addicted to a strange unenglish slang and he never pulled up men for not saluting him because he didnt believe in saluting and said so he used to have meals with private soldiers in cafes and in restaurants and even drink with them he had no idea of discipline at all all he could do with others like him was to win battles thirtytwo years had passed since those bad months of but jane could still remember the unpleasantness as she had rebelled against her family she was too young too immature to be able to stand up and state her conviction that there was solid stuff in this young man the substance for a happy and enduring marriage she felt that very strongly but she could never get it out in words she could remember as if it were yesterday her fathers frigid politeness to this uncouth young officer that she had brought into the house and his blistering contempt for him in their private talks and her mothers futile assurances that daddy knows best she had married jack dorman in february in paddington a week before sailing with him to australia and her parents had come to the wedding but only just nobody else came except one old school friend and aunt ethel aunt ethel was her fathers sister mrs trehearn married to geoffrey trehearn a commissioner in the indian police at that time stationed in moulmein aunt ethel had come home with her two children in to put them to school in england and she was still in england waiting for a passage back to burma aunt ethel alone of all janes relations had stood up for her and had told the family that she was making a wise choice and she had cut little ice with her brother tom indeed in some ways she had made matters worse admiral sir thomas foxley had little regard for the sagacity of women and to mention the womans vote to him in those faroff days was as a red rag to a bull all these things passed through jane dormans mind as she sat sipping her tea in the kitchen of her homestead thirtythree years later seven thousand pounds to spend after paying tax all earned in one year and earned honestly more money than her father had ever dreamed of earning or any of her family extraordinary to think of and extraordinary that after their hard life the money should mean so little to them jack didnt quite know what to do with it so much was evident and certainly she didnt i dont know about going home she said at last i dont believe id know anybody there now except aunt ethel and i dont suppose id recognize her now there was a letter from her in the post today by the way id like to see the old thing again before she dies but shes about the only one she must be getting on for eighty now wouldnt you like to go and see your old home he suggested he knew how much her mind had turned to that small country house when first she had come to australia she shook her head not now that its a school itld be all different id rather remember it as it used to be her father had kept two gardeners and a groom and three servants in the house she knew that nothing would now resemble the gracious easy routine of the home that she had lived in as a child he did not press her if she didnt want to go to england that was all right with him he had only memories of a cold unfriendly place himself where he had been ill at ease and that he secretly disliked he would have liked very much to go back to gallipoli again and to france and italy it would be interesting to see those his mind turned to his italian hired man theres another thing he said about mario hes got that girl of his in this town that he comes from i dont know how much hes got saved up now but it might bc a good thing if we could help him with her fare it wouldnt be so much and we might be able to charge it up against the tax after all its all connected with the station mario ritti was a laughing man of about twentyeight tall and well built with dark curly hair a swarthy complexion and a flashing eye a peril to all the young girls in the neighbourhood he had been taken prisoner by the eighth army at bardia in and he had spent two years in england as a prisoner of war working on a farm in cumberland where he had learned about sheep after the war he had got back to his own place chieti a hill town in the abruzzi mountains near the adriatic coast where his parents scratched a bare living from a tiny patch of rather barren land in italy there were far more people than the land could support and mario had put his name down almost at once for a free immigrant passage to australia he had worked as a labourer and as a waiter in a hotel in pescara and as a housepainter till his turn came round upon the quota three years later and he could leave for an emptier country by the terms of his free passage he had to work for two years as directed by the department of immigration in australia after which he would be free to choose his work like any other man jack dorman had got him from the department and was very pleased with him and he was anxious not to lose him at the end of the two years i was thinking that we might build on to the shearers place he said extend that on a bit towards the windmill and make a little place of three rooms there then if we got his girl out for him hed be settled and the girl could help you in the house jane laughed shortly fat lot of help shed be a girl who couldnt speak a word of english having babies every year id be helping her not her helping me still if she could cook the dinner now and then i wouldnt say no she sat for a moment in thought how much is her passage going to cost and how much has he got saved up he sends money back to italy to his parents jack said he was sending home five pounds a week at one time so he cant have very much i suppose the passage would be about fifty quid wed better pay that and let him spend what hes got saved on furniture find out how much hes got his wife said he ought to put in everything hes got if were going to do all that for him thats right he pushed his chair back from the table like to drive into town this afternoon and put this cheque into the bank she smiled he was still very young at times dont you trust the postman no he said not with twentytwo thousand pounds a thing like that ought to be registered he paused we could take a drive around he said look in on george and ann for tea at buttercup giving up work she asked thats right he said just for today whos going to get tea here for the boys if we go gallivanting off to buttercup they can have cold tonight he said all right she reached behind her for an envelope upon the table want to read aum ethels letter anything new in it not really she said slowly youd better read it though she tossed it across to him he unfolded it and began to read jane got up and glanced at the clock and put the saucepan of potatoes on to boil and put a couple more logs into the stove then she sat down again and picked up the pages of the letter as jack laid them down and read them through again herself it was addressed from maymyo ladysmith avenue ealing a suburb to the west of london that jane had never seen till recently her old aunt had always written by air mail but lately the letters had been coming by sea mail perhaps because there was now little urgency in any of them her handwriting was very bent and crabbed at one time she had written legibly but in the last year or two the writing had got worse and worse the letter ran my dear child another of your lovely parcels came today all candied peel and currants and sultanas and glacй cherries such lovely things that we do so enjoy getting just like prewar when you could buy everything like that in the shops without any of these stupid little bits of paper and coupons and things i get so impatient sometimes when i go to buy the rations which means i must be getting old seventynine next month my dear but i dont feel like it it was rather a blow when aggie died but i have quite got over that now and settled down again and last friday i went out to bridge with mrs morrison because its three months now and i always say three months mourning is enough for anyone im afraid this is going to be a very long winter i do envy you your winter in our summer because it is quite cold already and now mr attlee says there isnt any coal because hes sold it all to america or jugoslavia or somewhere so there wont be any for us and now the miners and the railwaymen all want more money if only dear winston was back at no but everybody says he will be soon jane turned the pages glancing over her old aunts ramblings that she had already deciphered once and that were clearly giving jack some difficulty aggie was mrs agatha harding who had shared the house at ealing with her aunt she was the widow of an army officer now she was dead jane supposed that her old aunt must be living alone although she did not say so the letter rambled on jennifer came down to spend the day with me one sunday in august and she is coming again soon she has grown into such a pretty girl reddish hair and our family nose twentyfour this year she ought to have been presented at court long ago but everything seems to be so different now and she works in an office at blackheath the ministry of pensions i think i asked her if there was a young man and she said no but i expect there is one all the same my dear i hope hes as nice a one as jack i often think of that time when you were so naughty and ran off and married him and tom was so angry and how right you were only i wish you didnt have to live so far away jane wished she didnt live so far away as she read that it might be worth while to make the long journey back to england just to see this kind old lady again who still thought of her as a child it seems so funny to think of you over fifty and with all your children out in the world and so prosperous with wool my dear i am glad for you our government are so stupid about wool and everything i went the other day to sayers to buy a warm vest for the winter but my dear the price was shocking even utility grade and the girl said it was all due to bulk buying of wool and the socialist government so i told her to tell mr attlee he could keep it and id go on with what ive got my dear i do hope things are cheaper with you than they are here but i suppose you can always spin your own wool on the station and weave it cant you my grandmother always did that better than this horrible bulk buying that makes everything so dear my dear thank you again for all your lovely parcels and your letters write again soon and all my love your affectionate aunt ethel keeps it up doesnt she said jack dorman yes said jane she keeps it up i dont like the thought of her living alone though at her age thats since this aggie died jane nodded it looks as if shes living by herself now quite alone i wish we were nearer he turned the pages of the letter back whos this jennifer she speaks about thats jennifer merton her granddaughter her daughter lucy married edward merton the one thats a doctor in leicester oh he did not know where leicester was nor did he greatly care this girl jennifer works in london does she jane nodded just outside london i think blackheath well cant she go and live with the old girl i dont know said jane i dont suppose theres much that we can do about it anyway jack dorman went out to the yard and jane began to lay the kitchen table for the midday dinner she was vaguely unhappy and uneasy there was a menace in all the news from england now both in the letters from her old aunt and in the newspapers the most extraordinary things seemed to be going on there and for no reason at all in all her life and it had been a hard life at times she had never been short of all the meat that she could eat or practically any other sort of food or fruit that she desired as a child she could remember the great joints upon her fathers table at sutton bassett the kidneys and bacon for breakfast with the cold ham on the sideboard the thick cream on the table the unlimited butter these things were as normal to her as the sun or the wind even in the most anxious times of their early married life in gippsland they had had those things as a matter of course and never thought about them if she didnt use them now so much it was because she was older and felt better on a sparing diet but it was almost inconceivable to her that they should not be there for those who wanted them it was the same with coal in all her life she had never had to think about economizing with fuel from the blazing fireplaces and kitchen range of sutton bassett she had gone to the australian countryside milder in climate where everybody cooked and warmed themselves with wood fires even in their hardest times there had never been any question of unlimited wood for fuel indeed at merrijig with the hot sun and the high rainfall the difficulty was to keep the forest from encroaching on the paddocks if you left a corner ungrazed tor three years the bush would be five feet high all over it in ten it would have merged back into forest even in the city you ordered a ton of wood as naturally as a pound of butter or a sirloin of beef whatever sort of way could aunt ethel be living in when she could not afford a warm vest for the winter why a warm vest why not three or four she must do something about the washing was clothing rationed still she seemed to remember that clothes rationing had been removed in england she stopped laying the table and unfolded the letter and read the passage over again a little frown of perplexity upon her forehead there wasnt anything about rationing she hadnt got the vest because it was expensive how foolish of her old people had to have warm clothes especially in england in the winter it was true that the price of woollen garments was going up even in australia by leaps and bounds but aunt ethel couldnt possibly be as hard up as that the foxleys had always had plenty of money perhaps she was going a bit senile she went and rang the dinner bell outside the flyscreen door rather depressed the men came back to the homestead for dinner she heard tim and mario washing at the basin under the tankstand in the yard and she began to dish up they came in presently with jack and sat down at the table she carved half a pound of meat for each of them and heaped the plates high with vegetables she gave jack rather less and herself much less a suet jam roll followed the meat and cups of tea relaxed and smoking at the end of the meal tim archer said would you be using the utility saturday evening mr dorman theres the red cross dance i dunno he turned to jane want to go to the dance on saturday it was a suggestion that had not been made to her for seven or eight years and it came strangely from jack now but everything was strange on this day of the wool cheque she laughed shortly i dont want to go to any dance she said my dancing days are done but let the boys go if they want to you going mario the dark curlyhaired young man looked up with laughing eyes si mr dorman go on his boss grumbled talk english like a christian you can if you want to the young man grinned more broadly yes he said i like to go ver much i like dance much i bet you do he turned to tim if you go youve got to look after him he said dont let him get in any trouble or get girls in any trouble either there was some prejudice against the new australians in the district well founded in part and there had been a row over mario once before at the first dance that he attended and before he was accustomed to the social climate of australia til keep an eye on him mr dorman all right you can take the chev he paused did you get the tickets not yet thought id better wait and see about the ute ill be going down to banbury after dinner in about an hour ill get them if you give me the money thanks mr dorman tim hesitated would you be going by the post office i could would you look in and tell elsie peters ill be coming to the dance with mario jack nodded ill tell her presently they got up from the table tim to unload the utility jack dorman to go into his office and mario to help jane to clear the table and wash up a quarter of an hour later jack dorman going out on the veranda saw mario and tim rolling the drum of diesel oil down from the truck on timbers to the ground he waited till the drum was on the ground and then said hey mario come over here a minute they crossed to the paddock rail and stood together there in the warm sunlight say mario he said ive been thinking about that girl youve got back in italy you still want to get her out here to australia yes mr dorman i wanta ver much i love lucia we marry when she come here thats her name is it lucia yes lucia tereno she is called lucia tereno she lives in this town that you come from chieti she is from orvieto close to chieti signore are you saving up to get her out here si signore how much does the ticket cost fiftyeight pounds how much have you got saved towards it twentyseven pounds i send send money to mio padre send money to your father do you yes mr dorman e vecchio whats that he old man madre old also the grazier stood in silence for a minute thinking this over at last he said look mario i was thinking of building a bit of a house for you and lucia n paying for her ticket you could spend your twentyseven quid on furniture for it n make the rest in the evenings if i do that will you stay with me two years after your times up n not go off to someone else for better money only about half of that got through they discussed it for a little the italian gradually breaking into rapture as the proposal became clear i pay her

see about the draft for fiftyeight pounds payable to lucia tereno at chieti italy at the conclusion of that business he produced his wool cheque for the credit of his account the manager took it and

shining ive got a passage booked on the orontes fifth of may its terribly exciting i just cant wait dad did well out of the wool this year fine he said what part of england are you going to mas people all live in a place called nottingham she said thats in the middle somewhere i think im going to stay with them at first but after that i want to get a job in london londons all right he said i was in england with the first aif and i dont suppose its altered very much from what i hear they dont get much to eat these days well have to send you food parcels she laughed thats what ma says but i think its all right people whove been there say theres a lot of nonsense talked about food being short its not as bad as they make out i never heard of anyone send back a food parcel all the same he observed i dont think theyve got as much as all that she said thoughtfully i mean they do like to get parcels still im going to take a lot of tins with me she paused its going to be a beaut trip she said thoughtfully i just cant wait till may jack dorman went out of the post office and got into the car and went to see the builder he stayed with him some time talking about the threeroomed house for mario and arranged for him to come and measure up for the timber and weatherboarding required this all took a little time and by the time he got back to the dressmaker to pick up jane she was ready for him they did a little more shopping together put the parcels on the ledge behind the driving seat and drove out on the road to buttercup george and ann pearson lived on rather a smaller property of about fifteen hundred acres they had no river and they got the water for their stock from dams bulldozed or scooped out to form catchment pools at strategic points upon the land they were younger than the dormans and they still had a young family the youngest child was judith only eight years old but old enough to catch and saddle her own pony every morning and ride six miles to school with her satchel on her back because this was the normal way of going to school the schoolhouse was provided with a paddock the children rode in and unsaddled hung their saddles and bridles on the fence and went in to their lessons after school they caught their ponies the schoolmistress helping them if there were any difficulty saddled up and rode six miles home again george pearson had rigged up a divingboard and a pair of steps to turn his largest dam into a swimmingpool and the children were bathing in it as the dormans drove by they had evidently brought friends on their way back from school because three ponies grazed beside the dam with saddles on their backs weeping willows seventy feet high grew round the pool and half a dozen little bodies flashed and splashed with shrill cries from the divingboard in the bright sun id have thought it was too cold for bathing still jane observed its only october its warm in the sun jack said it was up to eighty dinnertime its cold in the water though she replied george told me that its twelve feet deep that dam itll be cold just down below the surface they dont mind he said he took his eyes from the track and looked again at the dam i often wish wed had a dam he said those kids they get a lot of fun out of that they drove on to the homestead and parked in the grassy yard ann pearson came out to meet them she was australian born and spoke with a marked australian accent in contrast to her husband who had come out as a farmers son in and still retained a trace of somerset in his speech didnt you see george she asked after the first greetings he went down to the dam with the children we didnt stop said jane hes probably down there just dropped in to see if george had got his wool cheque jack dorman said grinning ann said oh my word there seemed no need for any further comment jack turned to jane and said its all right theyve got enough money to give us tea give tea to everybody in the shire said ann how longs it going on for jack i tell you we get sort of frightened sometimes it cant go on like this can it itll be down next year jack dorman said not real low but down to something reasonable id say it can blow a blizzard after that for all i care they got out of the car and went with her to the wide veranda and sat down in deckchairs thats what george thinks too id be quite glad if it went down a bit it doesnt seem right somehow its not good for the children either to see money come so easy she told them that they were sailing for england in april on the p and o strathmore the children were going to stay with their grandmother at nagambie george booked the cabin six months ago she said but i never really thought itld come off still now were going definitely his dad and mum theyre still alive at this place shepton mallet where he was brought up i never thought id meet them but now it looks as if i shall she turned to jane with a question that had been worrying her a good deal when you go on those p and o boats travelling firstclass she said what do you wear at night is it a low evening dress every night or is that just for dances george pearson came back presently with six hungry children and they all sat down to tea at the long table in the kitchen eleven of them counting the hired man a pole from slonim who spoke little english they ate the best part of two joints of cold roast mutton with a great dish of potatoes and thought nothing of it topping up with bread and jam and two plum cakes and many cups of tea then the men went out into the yard and put the three visiting children on their ponies and saw them off so that they would be home by nightfall which comes early in australia the two graziers talked quietly for a time on the veranda while their wives washed up indoors going home in april so ann told us dorman said aye george smoked for a few minutes in silence see the old folks once more anyway i dont know what its going to be like there now i asked jane if shed like to go back home but she didnt want to she said itld all be different aye i want to see my brother see if he wont come out theres still land going if you look around a bit ninety pounds an acre they both smiled fortyfive or fifty if you look around said george hed get that for the land hes got at home all right while the wool keeps up i want to see what things are like at home george pearson said they may not be so bad as what you read they dont have to be said dorman i see where it says in the paper that you cant have a new car if youve had one since the war and now theyre selling squirrels in the butchers shops whats a squirrel like to look at is it like a possum smaller than that said george more the size of a rat its a clean feeder though i suppose you could eat squirrel gypsies used to eat them where i come from there was a slow bewildered silence id not know what the world was coming to if id to eat a thing like that everything foreign in the newspapers was puzzling to them these days the murders and the pictures of the bathing girls were solid homely matters that they could understand but the implacable hostility of the russians was an enigma fortunately they were seven or eight thousand miles away and so it didnt matter very much korea and the chinese provided another puzzle australian boys were fighting there for no very clear reason except that a meeting of the united nations nine thousand miles from buttercup had said they should mr menzies made a speech sometimes and told them that all this was terribly important to australians and failed to convince them the only thing from all these distant places that really touched the graziers was the food shortage in england they did not understand why that should be but they sent food parcels copiously to their relations at home and puzzled over their predicament they could not understand why english people would not come to this good country that had treated them so well the two wives came out and joined their men on the veranda jane said anns been telling me about peter loring falling off his horse jack did you hear about that her husband shook his head that one of the loring boys from balaclava she nodded the little one eleven or twelve years old you tell him ann ann pearson said it was a funny thing jack i had to go into town early on friday about nine oclock well i got just up to the main road i was all alone in the utility and there was a pony with a saddle on and bridle grazing by the side of the road and there was peter loring with blood all over him from scratches sitting on the grass so of course i stopped and got out and asked him what was the matter and he said he fell off the pony he was on his way to school so i asked him if he was hurt and he said it hurt him to talk and he felt funny she paused well there i was all alone and i didnt know what to do whether to take him home or what and just then a truck came by with a couple of those chaps from the lumber camp in it jack dorman said the camp up at lamirra thats right well this truck stopped and the men got down and one of them came and asked what was the matter new australian he was german or something he spoke very foreign so i told him and he began feeling the boy all over and then the other man told me he was a doctor in his own country but not here in australia he was a tall thin fellow with rather a dark skin and black hair so i asked him is it concussion doctor i said because i was going to say wed bring him back here because this was closer she paused well he didnt answer at once he seemed a bit puzzled for the moment and then he made little peter open his mouth and took a look down his throat and then he found some stuff coming out of his ear and then he said it is not concussion and the bleeding that is nothing he said he has ear disease and he has a temperature he should go at once to hospital in banbury my dear of all the things to have and that man finding it out so quick well i felt his forehead myself and it was awful hot and so i asked the truck driver to go on to balaclava and tell his mother and i drove this doctor and peter into town to the hospital and dr jennings was there and he said it was a sort of mastoidotitis something he said pretty good that said jack dorman george pearson said dr jennings knew all about this chap hes a czech not a german he works up at the camp there doing his two years whats his name he did tell me but i forgot one of these foreign names it was cylinder or something not that but something like it ann drove him back to lamirra his wife said he was quite a quiet wellbehaved one for a new australian i do think it was quick of him to find out what was wrong lucky he came along just then said jack my word said ann with feeling if he hadnt come i think id probably have put peter into the utility and brought him straight back here because its so much closer here than balaclava i wouldnt have known what to do with mastoid the dormans left soon after that and drove back to leonora life went on as usual at the station and on saturday evening tim archer drove into banbury with mario ritti for the red cross dance he hit it off all right with mario in spite of their very different backgrounds but there was always a little difficulty with mario at a dance there was a barrier of language and experience between the italian and the local australian girls he was inclined to be too bold with them and they would not willingly have been seen with him except at a dance where social barriers were somewhat broken down there had been an italian girl at one of the hotels till recently and mario had done most of his dancing with her but now she had left to go to melbourne to earn eight pounds a week in a cafe and tim was a little anxious about mario in consequence there were about eighty thousand pounds worth of new motorcars parked outside the shire hall that night for wool had been good for a couple of years they parked the old chevrolet and went into the hall neat in their blue suits with oiled hair carefully brushed for a time they stood with a little crowd of young men round the door while the girls sat on chairs in long lines on each side of the floor waiting to be asked to dance only two or three couples were yet dancing and the place was still stone cold tim studied the girls elsie peters was there talking to joan mcfarlane if he had been alone he would have gone and asked one or other of them to dance but that meant leaving mario high and dry he felt ail obligation to the italian to get him started with at least one partner before going off to his own friends and he did not think that either elsie or joan would appreciate it if he landed her with an eyetie who spoke poor english and was full of rather obvious sex appeal he glanced down the row of girls beside the floor and saw two blackhaired girls sitting together they were both rather broad in the face and both wore woollen dresses of a sombre hue and rather an unfashionable cut they were obviously a pair and strangers to banbury tim had never seen them before they were clearly new australians he nudged mario what about that couple over there he asked theyd be italian wouldnt they i do not think said mario i think austrian perhaps or polish i have not seen these girls before nor have i lets go and ask them once mario was launched with these two he would be able to go off and dance with his own sort they crossed the floor to the girls and tim taking the nearest one said may i have this dance my names tim archer mario bowed from the waist before the other looking as if he was going to kiss her hand at any moment and said mario ritti both girls smiled and got to their feet tims girl was about twentyfive years old and pleasantlooking in a broad way in later life she would certainly be stout she danced a quickstep reasonably well and as they moved off she said with a strange accent teem archer thats right he said tim she tried again tim thats right he said again short for timothy ah i understand timothy whats your name she smiled i am tamara perediak how much tamara perediak tamara i never heard that name before it is a name of my country she said where i was born many girls are called tamara are you polish he asked she shook her head i was born in the ukraine he did not know where that was but didnt like to say so now i am come from mulheim in the american zone to australia she called it owstrahlia i am to work here at the hospital have you just arrived he asked in the camp i have been three weeks but here only three days three days then youre brandnew they laughed together how do you like australia i like it very much what i have seen are you a nurse she shook her head i think you call it wardmaid i am to do scrubbing and the carrying trays and the washing dishes and the washing clothes do you know anybody in australia she said i have good friends that i met on the ship but they have gone to mildura but i have here natasha who came with me who is dancing with your friend she comes also from the ukraine and we were together at mulheim working at the same canteen natasha she laughed that is another name of the ukraine natasha byelev are our names very difficult my word tell me she said presently your friend is he australian also no he replied hes italian his names mario ritti ah an italian i did not think he was australian thats right tim said he works at leonora where i work hes on top of the world tonight because hes got a girl in italy and the boss is going to pay her passage out here so that mario can get married he had to repeat parts of that once or twice before its full import sunk in he will pay for her to come from italy to australia she said in wonder he must be a very rich man hes doing all right with the wool tim said hes not a rich man really your friend is very lucky to work for such a man is his loved one to come soon soon as the boss can get her on a ship hes scared that mario will leave when his two years are up he wants to get him settled on the station in a house of his own with a wife and family she stared at him he is to make him a house also thats right just a shack you know she thought about this for a minute as they danced i also must work for two years she said i am to work here in the hospital with natasha do you like it she shrugged her shoulders i have been working so since five years in the works canteen at mulheim once i was to be schoolteacher but with the war that was not possible where were you in the war he asked in dresden she said when i was little girl my father and my mother left odessa because they were not members of the party and the life there was not good and so they went to live in dresden there my father was schoolteacher to teach the boys russian all before the war and in the war we lived in dresden then the english bombed dresden and my father and my mother were killed both together our house was all destroyed i was not there because i worked that night in the factory outside the city and that was not bombed but i went to go home in the morning our house and the whole street was all destroyed and my mother and my father were dead both of them so then the war came to dresden very soon after and i went first to leipzig and then to kassel because the russians were coming and there i met natasha and we went to mulheim in the end to work in the canteen tim archer said youve seen a mighty lot of foreign places i should think youd find it a bit slow in banbury i think it will be better to be in a slow place and live slowly for a time tamara said so much has happened since i was a little girl presently the dance ended and he took her back to her seat mario immediately asked her to dance again and tim escaped and went to dance with joan mcfarlane at the same time at leonora jane sat with jack before the kitchen stove in wooden armchairs with cushions they generally sat there in the evening rather than in the parlour a prim formal room where nothing was to hand jack dorman was reading the leader a weekly farming paper which was about all he ever read jane sat with the open letter from aunt ethel in her hand worrying about it i wrote to myers with a cheque she said they sent a statement for the parcels seven pounds eighteen and six i told them to keep sending them one every month he grunted without looking up what are you sending now i told them to keep sending the dried fruits she said its what she seems to like she turned the letter over in her hand its so difficult because she never asks for anything or says what she wants she does seem to like the dried fruit though id have thought that a meat parcel might be better he said they havent got much meat from all i hear an old lady like her doesnt eat a lot of meat she replied she can make cakes with the dried fruit for when she has people in to tea she turned the letter over reading it again for the tenth time i cant make out about this vest she said troubled it almost reads as if shes short of money doesnt it could be he observed he laid the leader down and glanced across at his wife he could still see in her the girl he had brought out from england stubborn in her love for him to the point of quarrelling with her parents supported only by this aunt to whom they now sent parcels like to send her some he asked she looked up quickly and met his eyes send her money she might take it as an insult she might buy herself a vest he said she sat in silence for a time we couldnt send her just a little money jack she said at last it would have to be nothing or else quite a lot as if it was a sort of legacy enough to be sure that she wouldnt take it badly enough to keep her for a couple of years if shes in real trouble well weve got a lot he said well do whatever you think right there was a pause i feel we kind of owe it to her she said presently to see her right if shes in any trouble we havent done so bad together you and i it might never have come to anything if she hadnt backed us up i know thats what i feel she stared down at the letter in her hands im not a bit happy about this jack she said at last i dont like the sound of it at all if weve got the money id like to send her five hundred pounds two jennifer morton went home for the following weekend she was the daughter of a doctor in leicester his only child now for her two brothers had been killed in the war one in the north atlantic and one over hamburg she was twentyfour years old and she had worked away from home for some years she had a clerical job with the ministry of pensions at their office at blackheath a suburb of london most of her life was spent in blackheath where she had a bedsittingroom in a boardinghouse but once a month she went home to leicester to see her parents travelling up from london early on the saturday morning and returning late on sunday night these were duty visits she was fond enough of her father and her mother but she had now no interests and few acquaintances in her own home town the war and marriage had scattered her school friends she had no particular fondness for the ministry of pensions or for her job in blackheath she would have stayed at home and worked in leicester if there had been any useful purpose to be served by doing so in fact her mother and her father were remarkably selfsufficient her mother never wanted to do anything else but to stay at home and run the house and cook her fathers dinner her father an overworked general practitioner never wanted to go out at night unless in the winter to a meeting of the british medical association or in the summer to a meeting of the bowls club this was a good thing for the night air made her mother cough and she seldom went out of the house after midday in the winter as the years went on her father and her mother settled firmly into a routine of life moulded by overwork and by poor health a groove that left little room for the wider interests of a daughter jennifer went to leicester for her weekend once a month but there was never very much for her to do there she could not help her mother very much without breaking through routines that she was not familiar with unless the water jug was on a certain spot upon the kitchen shelf unless the saucepans were arrayed in a certain order her mother became fussed and unable to find things and very soon made the suggestion that jennifer should go and sit with her father who was usually deep in the british medical journal if he wasnt out upon a case she came to realize that in her case the barrier of the generations was higher than usual in families because her father and her mother were so complementary she accepted the situation philosophically and found the interests of her life away from home those interests were not very startling she had been mildly in love when she was twenty soon after the war but he had gone to a job in montreal and gradually the correspondence languished when finally she heard that he was married it was just one of those things she was friendly with a good many men for she was an attractive girl with auburn hair that had been bright red as a child and the grey eyes that go with it but she had been inoculated and never fell seriously in love she knew a good deal about the london theatres and she saw most of the films worth seeing including the continental ones she could speak a little french and she had spent two summer holidays in france with a couple of girls from her office now she was planning a trip to italy for her next holiday but that was nine months ahead for it was october she had bought three little books by a gentleman called hugo and she was teaching herself italian out of them that weekend was like all the others only more so though it was only october her mother was coughing as if it were january she had not been out of doors for a week but she had her household organized so that she could order from the shops by telephone and what could not be done that way the daily woman did her father was more overworked than ever he seemed to spend most of his time writing certificates for patients of the nationalized health service who stood in queues each morning and afternoon at the surgery door there was nothing jennifer could do to help them and no place for her she left them late on sunday afternoon and travelled back to london and so by the electric train from charing cross down to her own place at blackheath she got back to her room at about ten oclock made herself a cup of cocoa washed a pair of stockings did an exercise of hugo and went to bed she worked all next day as usual at her office she left at five in the evening and walked through the suburban streets in the october dusk to her boardinghouse very soon now it would be dark when she came out from work for two months in the winter she would not walk home in daylight she was beginning to dread those two months in midwinter she got a sense of suffocation a feeling that she would never see the sun and the fresh air again it was raining a little that evening and she walked back with her blue raincoat buttoned tightly round her neck she had intended to go out to the pictures with a friend from the boardinghouse after tea but now she thought that she would stay at home and read a magazine and do her hugo there wasnt much joy in going to the pictures and then walking home in the rain she went up the steps of the shabby old brick house that was her home spacious with its eight bedrooms its four receptionrooms and its range of basement kitchens and she let herself in at the front door with her latchkey as she took off her wet coat her landlady climbed up the stairs from the kitchen there was a telephone call for you about an hour ago she said a personal call i told them youd be back about fivethirty jennifer looked up in surprise do you know who it was from the woman shook her head they didnt say jennifer went to the telephone booth and told the exchange that she could take the call and learned that it was a call from leicester she hung up and stood uncertain for a moment hoping there was nothing wrong at home presently she went up to her room on the first floor and changed out of her wet shoes and then she stood looking out of the window at the glistening lamplight in the wet suburban street waiting and listening for the call in the yellow lamplight the plane trees in the street waved a few stray leaves that still held to the twigs the call came through at last and she hurried downstairs to take it it was her mother speaking from their home is that jenny how are you dear im all right mother jenny dear listen to this we had a telephone call from the district nurse at ealing she said that grannys ill she had a fall in the street apparently and they took her to the hospital but they hadnt got a bed so they took her home and put hei to bed there the nurse said somebody would have to go there to look after her jenny could you go to ealing and see whats the matter and then telephone us jennifer thought quickly ealing was on the other side of london an hour up to charing cross if she were lucky with the trains and then an hour down to ealing broadway and a ten minutes walk she could get something to eat on the way perhaps i can do that mummy she said ive got nothing fixed up for tonight i could be there by about halfpast eight oh my dear i am so sorry i think youll have to go she oughtnt to be living alone of course but she wont leave the house well have to fix up something better for her after this youll be able to get back to blackheath tonight will you the girl hesitated i think so mummy if i leave by about halfpast nine i should be able to get back here it sounds as if somebody ought to stay the night with her though doesnt it there was a worried silence i dont know what to say her mother said at last youve got to be at work tomorrow oh dear has daddy heard about this yet hes out still on his rounds i couldnt get hold of him dont worry mummy said the girl ill go over there and give you a ring when ive seen the nurse well fix up something between us what time will you be telephoning dear it may be very late if ive got to hurry to catch trains the girl said her grandmother was not on the telephone it may be after midnight when i get back here thatll be all right jenny i always hear the bell all right mummy ill go over right away and ring you back tonight probably very late she did not wait for supper but started for the station straight away she travelled across london to the other side and came to ealing broadway station about two hours later it was raining here in earnest great driving gusts of rain blown by a high wind down the deserted shimmering black streets her stockings and her shoes were soaked before she had been walking for three minutes her grandmother lived in a fourbedroomed house called maymyo built in the somewhat spacious style of fifty years ago a house with a large garden and no garage her husband had bought it when they had retired from burma in he had bought it prudently because he had an idea even then that he would not survive his wife and so he had avoided an extravagant establishment in fact he had died in comfortable in the knowledge that her widows pension her small private income and the house in perpetuity would render her secure until she came to join him there she had lived surrounded by the treasures they had gathered up together in a life spent in the east a gilded buddha sat at the hall door a pair of elephant tusks formed a hanger for a great brass dinner gong glass cases housed indian dolls and models of sampans and junks and imitation mangoes out of which a wood and plaster cobra would jump to bite your finger very terrifying there were embossed silver and brass burmese trays and bowls all over the place on the walls were watercolour paintings of strange landscapes with misty forests of a bluish tinge unknown to jennifer with strange coloured buildings called pagodas and strange people in strange clothes ethel trehearn lived on surrounded by these reminders of a more colourful world more real to her than the world outside her door nothing was very interesting to her that had happened since she got on to the ship at rangoon strand twentysix years before jennifer came to the house in the wet windy night it was in total darkness which seemed most unusual she pushed open the gate and went up the path through the little front garden and now she saw a faint glimmer of light through the coloured glass panels let into the front door in a gothic style she stood in the porch in her wet shoes and raincoat and pressed the bell she heard nothing but the tinkling of water running from a stackpipe near her feet she waited for a minute and then pressed the bell again apparently it wasnt working she rapped with the knocker and waited for a couple of minutes for something to happen then she tried the handle of the door it was open and she went into the hall a candle burned on the hall table held in a brass candlestick from benares jennifer went forward and pressed the electric switch for the hall light but no light came she thought of a power cut unusual at night and stood in wonder for a moment in any case there was no electricity and it was no good worrying about the cause she stood in the hall listening to the house it was dead silent but for the tinkling of the rain she raised her head and called granny its me jennifer are you upstairs there was no answer she did not like the empty sound of the house it was full of menace for her she did not like the lack of light or the long moving shadows that the candle cast she was a levelheaded young woman however and she took off her coat and laid it on a chair and picked up the candle and went into the drawingroom there was nothing unusual about that room it was clean and tidy though stonecold she would have expected on a night like that to see a fire burning in the grate but the fire was not laid apparently her grandmother had not used the room that day jennifer went quickly through the diningroom and kitchen everything was quite in order there a tin of bengers food and a half empty bottle of milk stood on the kitchen table she turned and went upstairs to the bedrooms the door of her grandmothers room was shut she stood outside with the flickering candle in her hand and knocked she said again granny its me jennifer can i come in there was no answer so she turned the handle and went into the room ethel trehearn lay on her back in the bed and at the first glance jennifer thought that she was dead and her heart leaped up into her throat because she had never seen a dead person she forced herself to look more closely and then she saw that the old lady was breathing evenly very deeply asleep with the relief jennifer staggered a little and her eyes lost focus for an instant and she felt a little sick then she recovered herself and looked around the room everything there seemed to be in order though her grandmothers day clothes were thrown rather haphazard into a chair the old lady was evidently quite all right in bed and asleep if she had had a fall a sleep would do her good it looked as if somebody had been in the house looking after her possibly the district nurse who had telephoned to jennifers mother it seemed unwise to wake the old lady up and presently jennifer tiptoed from the room leaving the door ajar in order that she might hear any movement the time was then about nine oclock and she had eaten nothing since lunch except a cup of tea and a biscuit at the office she had a young and healthy appetite and she had the sense to realize that her momentary faintness in the bedroom had a good deal to do with the fact that she was very very hungry she went down to the kitchen candle in hand to get herself a meal in a few minutes she had made the extraordinary discovery that there was no food in the house at all the half bottle of milk and the tin of bengers food upon the kitchen table seemed to be the only edibles except for a few condiments in a cupboard the larder her grandmother had no refrigerator was empty but for a small hard rind of cheese upon a plate and three cartons of dried fruits candied peel and sultanas and glace cherries open and evidently in use there was a flourbin but it was empty a breadbin that held only crumbs there were no tinned foods at all and no vegetables jennifer stood in the middle of the kitchen deeply puzzled wondering what her grandmother had been eating recently and where she had been eating it had she been having her meals out or was there something blacker waiting here to be uncovered she had been down to visit the old lady one sunday about a month before and her grandmother had given her a very good lunch and tea a roast duck with apple sauce with roast potatoes and cauliflower and a mince pie to follow for tea there had been buttered scones and jam and a big homemade cake with plenty of fruit in it she thought of this as she stood there in the kitchen in the flickering candlelight and her mouth watered she could have done with a bit of that roast duck one thing at least was evident that she would have to spend the night in the house she could not possibly go back to blackheath and leave things as they were whoever had lit the candle and left the door open had done it in the expectation that some relation would arrive and the unknown person would probably come back that night because her grandmother was clearly incapable of looking after herself if jennifer was to spend the night there though she felt she must have something to eat ealing broadway was only a few hundred yards away and there would probably be a cafe or a coffeestall open there she could leave a note upon the hall table and go out and have a quick meal she went upstairs again and looked in on the old lady but she was still deeply asleep thinking to find a place in which to sleep herself she opened the door of the guest bedroom but it was empty pictures still hung upon the wall but there was no furniture in the room at all and no carpet on the bare boards of the floor unfaded patches on the wallpaper showed where bed and chest of drawers and washhand stand had stood this was amazing because jennifer had slept in that room less than a year before it had been prim and neat and oldfashioned and very comfortable what on earth had the old lady done with all the furniture the girl went quickly to the other two bedrooms and found them in a similar condition empty but for the pictures on the wall there was no bed in the house except the one that her grandmother occupied if jennifer were to sleep there that night she would have to sleep on the sofa in the drawingroom there did not seem to be any bedding either the linen cupboard held only a pair of clean sheets a couple of towels a tablecloth or two and a few tablenapkins the shadows began to close in upon jennifer as she stood in the empty bedrooms with the flickering candle in her hand it seemed incredible but the old lady must have sold her furniture and there was no food in the house the darkness crept around her could it be that granny had no money but she had a pension jennifer knew that and she had always been well off more likely that she was going a bit mental with old age and that she had deluded herself into the belief that she was poor she went downstairs and found a piece of writing paper in her grandmothers desk and wrote a note to leave on the hall table with the candle then she put on her raincoat and went out to get a meal she found a cafe open in the main street and had a sort of vegetable pie it was dull and insipid with no meat but she had two helpings of it and followed it up with stewed plums and coffee then she bought a couple of rolls filled with a thin smear of potted meat for her breakfast and went back to the house in ladysmith avenue in the house everything was as she had left it her note lay beneath the candle unread she took the candle and wem up to her grandmothers room but the old lady was still sleeping deeply she had not moved at all the girl came out of the bedroom and as she did so she heard movement in the hall and saw the light from an electric torch she came downstairs with the candle and in its light she saw a middleaged woman standing there in a wet raincoat torch in hand the woman said are you one of mrs trehearns relations jennifer said im her granddaughter oh well im the district nurse you know she had an accident i dont know very much except that my mother got a telephone call asking somebody to come here she rang me the nurse nodded i rang your mother at leicester as soon as i could get the number out of the old dear id better tell you what its all about and then you can take over jennifer moved towards the door wed better go in here in case she wakes up she wont wake up tonight not after what the doctor gave her however they went into the drawingroom and stood together in the light of the one candle she had a fall in the street this morning just the other side of the bridge between here and the broadway she didnt seem able to get up so the police got an ambulance and took her to the hospital well they hadnt got a bed and anyway there didnt seem to be much wrong with her except debility you know so as she was conscious and not injured by her fall they rang me up and sent her home here in the ambulance i put her to bed and got in dr thompson he saw her about five oclock what did he say the nurse glanced at her when did you see her last about a month ago how was she then very much as usual she doesnt do much but shes seventynine i think was she eating normally she gave me a very good meal roast duck and mince pie she ate that did she of course why she doesnt look as if shes eaten anything since the nurse said shortly shes very emaciated and theres not a scrap of food here in the house except some dried fruits she vomited at the hospital and what came up was raisins and sultanas she couldnt be expected to digest those at her age jennifer said i simply cant understand it shes got plenty of money the nurse glanced at her youre sure of that well i think so i rang up the electricity the nurse said and told them that the power had failed and they must send a man to put it right because id got a patient in the house they said theyd disconnected the supply because the bill hadnt been paid youd better see about that in the morning if youre going to keep her here ill go round there first thing i had to go and get a candle of my own the nurse said i brought another one round with me now she took it from her pocket i looked for coal to light a fire but theres not a scrap i got a tin of bengers food and some milk and i got the people next door to let me boil up some hot milk for her and fill the hotwaterbottles ill take them round there and fill them again before i go she glanced at jennifer youre staying here tonight i wasnt going to but id better will you be here the nurse laughed shortly me ive got a baby case tonight but shes got an hour or two to go so i slipped round here to see if anyone had come ill have to get some sleep after that ill look round here about midday to see how youre getting on i said id give the doctor a ring after that jennifer nodded ill see you then is she in any danger do you think i dont think shell go tonight the nurse said whether shell pull round or not depends a lot on her digestion i couldnt say when she wakes give her another cup of the bengers she can have as much of that as shell take ill show you how to jnake it but dont let her have anything else till the doctors seen her and keep the bottles nice and warm not hot enough to scorch you know just nice and warm practical hardheaded and efficient she whisked through her duties showing jennifer what to do and was out of the house in a quarter of an hour the girl was left alone with all the indian and burmese relics with one candle and no fire and nowhere much to sleep she gave up the idea of going out in the rain at ten oclock at night to find a public telephone to ring up her mother that would have to wait till morning she went up to her grandmothers bedroom and took off her wet shoes and stockings and rubbed her feet with a towel then she found a pair of her grandmothers woollen stockings and put them on and her grandmothers bedroom slippers and her grandmothers overcoat she found a travelling rug and wrapped it around her and settled down to spend the night in an armchair by her grandmothers bedside chilled and uncomfortable dozing off now and then and waking again with the cold in the middle of the night she ate her breakfast rolls in the grey dawn she woke from one of these uneasy dozes stiff and chilled to the bone she looked at the bed and saw that her grandmother was awake she was lying in exactly the same position but her eyes were open jennifer got up and went to the bedside the old lady turned her head upon the pillow and said in a thin voice jenny my dear whatever are you doing here the girl said ive come to look after you granny they telephoned and told us that you werent so well i know my dear i fell down in the street such a stupid thing to do is the nurse here still shell be back later on this morning granny is there anything you want she told her and jennifer entered on the duties of a sickroom for the first time in her life presently she took the hotwaterbottles and the remains of the milk and went to the house next door where a harassed mother was getting breakfast for a husband and three little children as she warmed the milk and filled the waterbottles the woman asked her how is the old lady this morning shes staying in bed of course said jennifer but shes not too bad i think shes going to be all right i am so sorry the woman said i wish wed been able to do more for her but everythings so difficult these days id no idea that she was ill shes been going out as usual every morning it was a terrible surprise when she came back in an ambulance yesterday jennifer was interested she goes out every morning does she thats right every morning about ten oclock she goes down to the public library in the park to read the times she told me that one day jennifer thanked her for her help and went back with the hot milk to make a cup of bengers and took it up to the bedroom with the hotwaterbottles she propped her grandmother up in bed with the pillows and helped her while she drank but she could not get her to take more than half the cup i dont want any more my dear she said i think im better without anything the hot drink had stimulated her a little jenny she said ive been thinking havent you got to go to work the girl said thats all right granny im going out presently to ring up mummy to tell her how you are and ill ring up the office then ill stay with you for a few days until youre better oh my dear that isnt necessary at all id like to granny itll be a bit of a holiday for me but jenny dear you cant stay here there isnt anywhere for you to sleep where did you sleep last night ill be all right here granny the girl said ill fix up something in the course of the day but there isnt any electricity you cant stay here a facile senile tear escaped and trickled down the old lined cheek oh things are so troublesome thats all right granny the girl said ill go and see about the electricity this morning and get them to turn it on but its seventeen pounds jenny they came and turned it off such a nice man but he had to do his job ive been getting on quite well without it well youre not going to get along without it any longer granny jennifer said firmly you cant when youre in bed she thought quickly she had about thirty pounds in her bank but her chequebook was at blackheath on the other side of london ill get them to turn it on again she said dont worry about it oh my dear i dont know what to do the girl wiped the old cheeks gently with her handkerchief cheer up granny she said itll be all right tell me isnt there any money the old lady said none at all you see ive lived too long dont you believe it jennifer said youve got a good many more years yet but what about the pension that goes on until you die doesnt it thats what geoffrey thought and so did i but it was an indian pension dear and when the socialists scuttled out of india there werent any civil servants left in india to pay into the fund only us widows were left drawing out of it and now the money is all gone but wasnt it a government pension not for widows dear geoffreys pension was a government pension but that stopped when he died this was a private fund that we civil servants in india all paid in to they had to halve the pensions a few years ago and then last year they stopped it altogether and wound up the fund the girl said oh granny and you gave me such a lovely dinner when i came here last of course my dear a young girl like you must have proper meals although its all so difficult with all this rationing jenny have you had your breakfast yet not yet im going out in a few minutes and ill get some then im afraid theres nothing in the house jenny i am so sorry dont think about it granny ill get a tew things when im out and bring them in yes do that dear she paused will you bring me the little red morocco case thats on the dressingtable this one yes thats it bring it to me here the girl brought the jewel case over to the bed and gave it to her grandmother who opened it with fingers that trembled so that they could barely serve their function inside there was a jumble of souvenirs the relics of a long life a gold locket on a gold chain broken with a wisp of a babys hair in it a painted miniature portrait of a young boy in the clothes of a faded photograph of a bride and bridegroom dated a small gold sovereign purse to hang upon a watchchain three small gold and alabaster seals a string of black jet beads she rummaged among these things and many others with fingers that were almost useless and finally produced a gold ring set with five diamonds in a row unfashionable in these days she gave this to jennifer i want you to do a little job for me when you are out jenny she said in the new broadway two doors on the other side of pauls patisserie shop youll find a jewellers shop called evans go in and ask to see mr evans himself and give him this and tell him that you come from me hes a very nice man and hell understand hell give you money for it whatever its worth im afraid it may not be enough to pay the electricity but you can get a joint of beef and some vegetables and well cook a nice dinner for you take my ration book with you its on the corner of the bureau in the drawingroom and get some flour and dripping and sugar and then well make a cake theres plenty of dried fruit downstairs that dear jane sends me from australia so kind of her after all these years and if theres enough money get a little bottle of claret a young girl like you ought not to look so pale you mustnt sell your ring the girl said gently look ive got plenty of money to carry on with ive got over thirty pounds in the bank ill use some of that and ill be telephoning mummy this morning and shell send us down some more i expect daddy will come down to see you tomorrow when he hears that youre in bed her grandmother shook her head your mother hasnt got any money to spare she said she might have had once but now with this horrible health service and doctors getting less money than dentists sell the ring my dear i cant get it on my finger now im so rheumatic and i shant want it any more what is it granny the girl asked turning it over in her fingers who gave it to you geoffrey the old lady said geoffrey gave it to me when we became engaged we went to the goldsmiths and silversmiths in regent street together to buy it such a fine sunny day and then we went and had lunch at gattis it felt so funny on the fork because i wasnt used to wearing rings and then we took a hansom for the afternoon and drove down to roehampton to see the polo because geoffreys friend captain oliver was playing but i didnt see much of the polo because i was looking at my new ring and at geoffrey so silly the old voice faded off into silence i cant sell that the girl said gently im not going to sell your engagement ring my dear theres nothing else yes there is the girl said ive got thirty pounds im going to spend that first if you dont like it you can leave me that ring in your will ive done that already jenny with a lot of other things that arent there now because i had to sell them im so very very sorry there was a little emerald and ruby brooch that geoffrey got at mandalay and a pair of pearl earrings that came from mergui so pretty i did want you to have those but everything has been so troublesome the girl put the ring back into the jewel box leave it there for now she said i promise you ill come and tell you if we have to sell it but we shant have to weve got plenty af money between us she made her grandmother comfortable and promised her that she would be back in an hour and a half then she went out with a shopping basket she got a good breakfast at lyons of porridge and fish and as she breakfasted she made her plans she had only twelve and threepence in her purse and her breakfast cost her three shillings of that before she could lay her hands on any more money she must go to blackheath to get her chequebook and cash a cheque and the fare there would be about four and three that left her about five shillings she had to telephone her mother but perhaps she could reverse the charges for the call to leicester she must keep a margin of about two shillings for contingencies if she could reverse the charges for the call she would have about three shillings to spend on food for her grandmother the sense of crisis and the breakfast stimulated her she could beat this thing she went out and stood in a callbox and rang up her parents she was early and the hundredmile call came through at once she told her father what had happened shes got no money at all daddy she said she just hasnt been eating i think thats really all thats the matter with her shes very weak and shes in bed of course she told him what the district nurse had said about her grandmothers chances she told him about the pension they extended the call can you let me have some money daddy ive only got a few shillings im going back to blackheath about midday and ill get my chequebook then but im not sure if ill be in time to cash a cheque i may be too late ill be back here in ealing this afternoon anyway before dark he said ill send you a telegraph money order at once for ten pounds you should get that this afternoon either your mother or i will come down tomorrow and be with you some time tomorrow afternoon and well see whats to be done then its a bit of a shock this dont let mummy worry over it too much the girl said i think shes probably going to be all right im going now to see if i can talk them into turning on the electricity again itll make a lot of difference if we can get a radiator going in her room in a quarter of an hour she was talking to the manager in the office of the electricity commission having got past his girl with some difficulty he said im sorry miss merton but we have to work to rules laid down by our head office two years ago i might have been able to use my own discretion in a case like this but well things arent the same as they were then nationalization was bound to make some differences you know im afraid the account will have to be paid before the supply can be reconnected she said im going over to blackheath to get my chequebook today i can let you have the cheque first thing tomorrow morning fine he said with forced geniality then we shall be able to reconnect the supply cant you do it today im afraid the account will have to be settled first jennifer said desperately shes really terribly ill and we cant even warm up hot milk in the house or get hot water for her waterbottles we must have electricity tonight he got to his feet this was too unpleasant and he had no power to act im sorry miss morion he said it sounds as though she would be better in the hospital have you considered that perhaps the relieving officer would be the man for you to see hes at the town hall the redhaired girl flared into sudden anger god blast you and the relieving officer she said i only hope this happens to you one day that youre old and dying of starvation and you cant get anyone to help you and it will too she turned and left the office white with anger she shopped carefully with her three shillings and bought two pints of milk a few water biscuits and a little sugar that finished her money she thought deeply she could get some more food for her grandmother and for herself on her way back from blackheath it was urgent to get over there at once before the bank shut so that she could get her money she turned and made for ladysmith avenue on the way she stopped and spent fourpence on a copy of the times thinking that it would give the old lady an interest while she was absent and give something for her morale to hang on to during the afternoon when she got into the house she took the times up to her grandmothers room the old lady lay in bed exactly as jennifer had left her her eyes were shut and though she was breathing steadily it seemed to the girl that the respiration was now fainter than it had been when she had been lying in the same way on the previous night jennifer spoke to her but she did not answer however when she reached into the bed to get the hotwaterbottles the old lady opened her eyes just getting your hotwaterbottles granny the girl said ill make you another cup of bengers too i brought you the times so sweet of you her grandmother said i had to give up the times but i always go down every morning to look at the births deaths and marriages its so easy to miss things and then you write to somebody and find theyre dead the girl said im just going to get these waterbottles filled and make you another hot drink ill be back in about five minutes when she got back the old lady was reading the front page of the times jennifer packed the hotwaterbottles around her and got her to take the best part of the cup of the milk drink and to eat about half of one biscuit while she was coaxing her to eat the rest there was a knock at the front door she went downstairs and it was the postman with a heavy parcel she took it from him and carried it up to show to her grandmother with an instinct that anything that would stimulate and arouse her interest was good look what the posts brought she said myers emporium what have you been buying the old lady said oh thats dear jane how sweet of her its a parcel from australia jenny she sends one every month its got an english postmark granny the girl said i know my dear she puts the order in australia and the food comes from england somehow or other so funny shall i open it please i must write and thank her the parcel contained six cartons of dried fruit and a tin of lard jennifer now knew where the cartons she had seen in the larder came from she asked granny who is aunt jane she isnt mothers sister is she no my dear your mother never had a sister shes my niece my brother toms daughter shes the one who quarrelled with the family because she married an australian yes dear tom and margaret were very much upset but its turned out very well i liked him but tom found him drinking white port with jeffiries the butler in the middle of the morning and he used to swear dreadfully and never saluted anybody so different to our army jennifer smiled what was aunt jane like such a sweet girl but very stubborn once she decided to do a thing there was no arguing with her she had to see it through i sometimes think that youre a little like her jenny time was slipping by if she were to get money that day she could not linger im going over to blackheath now she said ill get a few things for the night and ill get some money and some bits of things we need ill be back about teatime but ill leave a note explaining everything to the nurse will you be all right do you think ill be quite all right my dear dont hurry i shall get a little sleep i expect jennifer went downstairs and left a note on the hall table for the nurse and travelled across london to her rooms at blackheath she got there about midday packed a bag went to the bank and rang up her office to say that she would have to take the rest of the week off to look after her grandmother then she snatched a quick meal in a cafe and travelled back to ealing she was lucky in that when she reached the house the doctor and the nurse were both there with her grandmother she waited in the hall till they came down from the bedroom a few letters had arrived two that seemed to be bills and one airmailed from australia that would be jane dorman jennifer thought who had married the australian who drank port with the butler and never saluted anybody and who still sent parcels of dried fruit to her aunt after thirty years they must have been very close at one time for affection to have endured so long she looked round for the candle but she could not find it perhaps the doctor and the nurse had it upstairs with them she stood in the dusk of the hall waiting presently they came out of the room upstairs and the staircase was suddenly flooded with light as the nurse turned the switch jennifer went forward to meet them the electricitys come on she exclaimed of course didnt you go and see them they said they wouldnt turn it on until i paid the bill the man came and turned it on this afternoon they left that for the moment and the nurse said this is dr thompson he was a fairly young man not more than about thirty he looked tired and overworked he said youre miss morton lets go into one of these rooms they went into the drawingroom it was as cold as a tomb but anyway the light was on surrounded by the burmese relics the girl asked how is she doctor the young man glanced at her summing her up shes very ill he said very ill indeed you know whats the matter with her of course jennifer said shes got no money yes malnutrition starvation if you like he glanced around the drawingroom taking in the worn indian carpet of fine quality the oldfashioned comfortable furniture the sampler as a firescreen the multitude of ornaments and bricabrac she wouldnt sell any of this stuff i suppose shes very set in her ways the gkl said she likes to have her own things round her i know he glanced at her are you going to keep her here could we get her into a hospital he shook his head i dont think theres a chance i dont think any hospital would take her you see the beds are all needed for urgent cases she might be bedridden for years if she gets over the immediate trouble she must have paid a lot of money into hospitals in her time said jennifer she was always subscribing to things tm afraid that doesnt count for much in the health service things are different now you know my fathers coming down from leicester tomorrow the girl said hes a doctor i think hell have to decide what to do ill stay with her tonight in any case youll be alone here will you yes she hesitated and then she said do you think shell die i hope not would you be very frightened if she did die and you were alone with her ive never seen anybody die the girl said evenly i hope that id be able to do what was best for her youll be all right he bit his lip l dont think shell die tonight he said shes definitely weaker than when i saw her yesterday im afraid nurse here has to get some sleep tonight i tell you what ill do ill look in again myself about eleven just before i go to bed in the meantime this is what shes got to have he gave her her instructions and went off with the nurse jennifer went up to her grandmothers bedroom it was warm with an electric radiator burning the old lady lay in bed but turned her eyes to the girl i see youve got a radiator going granny she said thats much better it was that nice man she said weakly i heard somebody moving around downstairs and i thought it was you jenny and then somebody knocked at my door and it was him he said he hoped he wasnt intruding but he thought id like the radiator and he came in and turned it on and saw that it was burning properly and then he said he hoped id soon be better how nice of him the girl said she made her grandmother comfortable and went out quickly to get to the shops before they shut she bought the things that the doctor had told her to buy and a little food for her own supper on her way back to the house she passed the electricity department and saw a light still burning in the office window though the door was locked she stopped and rang the bell the manager himself came to the door of the shop he peered at her in the half light his eyes dazzled by the strong light at his desk its after hours he said the office is closed now youll have to come back in the morning its me jennifer merton she said i just looked in to thank you for turning on the electricity he recognized her then oh thats all right he said i rang up head office and they gave permission in fact he had sat for an hour staring blankly at the calendar unable to work and with the girls words searing in his mind then he had rung up his supervisor and had repeated to him what jennifer had said he had added a few words of his own saying that he had checked with the district nurse and he was going to reconnect the supply he had said quietly that they could take whatever action seemed best to them if the job required behaviour of that sort from him he didnt want the job he was now waiting for the storm to break uncertain of his own future unsettled and reluctant to go home and tell his wife ive got my chequebook here she said l can pay the bill now if you like it might soothe the supervisor if the cheque were dated on the same day as his own revolt he showed her into the office and she sat down and wrote out the cheque in turn he wrote out the receipt stamped it and gave it to her how is your grandmother tonight he asked not too good she replied shes got a better chance now that we can get some warmth into the house im sorry i said that to you this morning one gets a bit strung up oh thats all right he said cant you get her into the hospital the girl shook her head shes too old she said a little bitterly they dont want people in there who are just dying of old age shes lost her pension because weve left india and the funds run dry she cant get an old age pension under the new scheme because she hasnt contributed to it for fifteen years or something shes spent all her capital in trying to live and sold most of her furniture and the bank wont give her any more upon the house theres no place for old ladies in the brave new world he tightened his lips conscious of his own dark fears i know he said its getting worse each year sometimes one feels the only thing to do is to break out and get away while youre still young enough try it again in canada perhaps or in south africa she looked at him startled is that what youre thinking of if i was alone id go i think he said but its the children thats what makes it difficult theyve got to have a home she had no time to stay and talk to him she cut it short and hurried back to the house there was a telegram there now from her father saying that he was coming down next day without her mother who was not so well and enclosing a telegraphed money order for ten pounds she put that in her bag and glanced at the two bills one for groceries and one for milk each with a politelyworded note at the bottom that was a threat of action no good worrying her grand mother with those she took off her coat and hat and went upstairs with the letter from australia in her hand in the bedroom the old lady was still lying in much the same position she was awake and she knew jennifer but she was breathing now in an irregular manner with three or four deep breaths and then a pause there was nothing that jennifer could do about it the only thing was to carry on and do what the doctor had told her it was time tor another drink of warm milk this time with brandy in it she gave the airmail letter to her grandmother theres an airmail letter for you she said brightly like me to get your glasses please dear did you see where it was from its from australia the old lady took the spectacle case with trembling hands fumbled a little and put the glasses on and looked at the letter yes thats from dear jane so sweet of her to keep on writing and sending me such lovely parcels we must make a cake jenny such lovely things jennifer went downstairs and warmed the milk up in a saucepan on the stove and made herself a cup of tea at the same time she mixed the bengers food and added the brandy and carried both cups up to the bedroom she found her grandmother staring bewildered at a slip of paper in her hand the envelope and the letter lying on the counterpane that covered her jenny she said weakly jenny come here a minute what is this the girl took it from her it clearly had to do with banking it was like a cheque and yet it was not quite an ordinary cheque the words were clear enough however its a sort of cheque granny she said its made payable to you for five hundred pounds sterling im not quite sure what sterling means it seems to be signed by the commonwealth bank of australia its as if the bank was giving you five hundred pounds the old lady said its from jane she says so in the letter oh my dear well have to send it back such a sweet child but she cant possibly afford it she ought not to have done such a thing if shes sent it to you perhaps she can afford it the girl said oh my dear shes only a farmers wife living in quite a poor way im afraid and with all those children wherever would she get five hundred pounds jennifer said may i see her letter granny of course my dear it was written in the round schoolgirl hand that jane dorman had never lost the first four pages dealt with news of the older children news of angela at melbourne university news of jacks rheumatism and news of the spring weather it went on jack and i have been a little worried by the part of your letter where you said you hadnt bought a new vest and we have been wondering if rising prices are making things difficult for you out here everything is going up in price too but we station people are all making so much money that we hardly notice it jacks wool cheque this year was for twentytwo thousand pounds and though most of that will go in tax of course it means that we shall still have about seven thousand for ourselves after paying all the expenses of the property we dont know whats the right thing to do with so much money we cant expect it to go on of course wool will come down again next year and its quite right that it should it could fall to a quarter of the present price and not hurt us the bank was all paid off last year and weve never spent much on ourselves and were too old now to do much gadding about were going down to melbourne for a week or ten days after christmas to do some shopping and jack still talks of a trip home but i dont suppose well really get much further than the windsor hotel im sending with this letter a little bank draft for five hundred pounds with our dear love it doesnt mean anything to us now because we have more than we can ever spend if you dont need it will you give it to some charity in england for us but weve been really worried about you since reading that letter about your vest and jack and l owe so much to you for all you did to help us thirty years ago so if this will make things easier for you will you take it with our very dearest love your affectionate niece jane the girl laid the letter down its all right granny she said a little unsteadily shes got all the money in the world theyre making twentytwo thousand pounds a year at least l think thats what she means nonsense my dear the old lady said weakly shes only a farmers wife stations they call them in australia but its only a big farm and not very good land im told shes made some mistake the girl wrinkled her brows and glanced at the letter again i dont think its a mistake honestly its what she says and i was reading something about this in the paper the other day she laid the letter down look drink your milk before it gets cold she held the old lady upright with one arm and raised the cup to her lips she could not get her to drink much and the effort seemed to tire her because she lay back on the pillows with her eyes closed disinclined to talk jennifer removed the letter and the envelope to a table at the bedside and put the bankers draft upon the dressingtable carefully weighted with an embossed indian silver handmirror she went downstairs to get her own supper meat and eggs were out of the question of course but she had got herself a piece of cod and some potatoes and carrots she put the cod on to boil because she would not encroach upon her grandmothers fat ration or open the tin of lard and she peeled some of the potatoes and carrots to boil those this insipid meal was normal to her life and she thought nothing of it she had bought a pot of jam and some buns and a piece of cheese to liven it up a bit she started all this going on the stove and slipped upstairs to see how her grandmother was getting on the old lady had not moved and she seemed to be asleep her breathing if anything was worse to jennifer as she stood motionless in the door looking at her she seemed smaller and more shrunken further away the room seemed suddenly a great deal colder she shivered a little and went in softly and turned on the second element of the electric stove as she ate her supper at the kitchen table she wondered what could best be done for her grandmother in the new situation presented by this five hundred pounds her father was coming down next day and he would decide what was the best course she was rather ignorant about the practical points of illness and of nursing but she knew that this five hundred pounds would make a difference perhaps it would be possible to get the old lady into a nursing home or clinic she knew that her parents had no money to spare it was only with difficulty that they could keep up her fathers considerable life insurance and endowment premiums they had their own old age to think about it had probably been a real difficulty for her father to send her ten pounds at a moments notice as he had that day she went up once or twice to look into the bedroom but she did not speak better to let her grandmother rest quietly till it was time for her next cup of milk food and brandy she took that up after a lapse of two hours and spoke to the old lady ive made you some more bengers granny she said quietly are you awake the old eyes opened im awake jenny ive been thinking about so many things the girl sat down beside her and raised her in the bed with an arm round the old shoulders and held the cup for her to drink what have you been thinking about she asked her grandmother said about when i was a girl my dear and how different things were then jennifer asked how were they different granny drink it up she took a little sip it was all so much easier dear my father your greatgrandfather was in the foreign office but he retired early when i was about fifteen before that we lived in a big house on putney hill near where swinburne lived but when he retired in about we moved down into the country my father bought steep manor near petersfield with about thirty acres of land i dont think his pension and my mothers investments together amounted to more than a thousand pounds a year but they seemed to be able to do such a lot with it such a great great deal drink a little more the girl suggested what sort of things did you do everything that gentlefolk did do in those days dear my father kept three maidservants in the house everybody did then and there was a gardener and a gardeners boy who helped in the stables and a groom that was before the days of motorcars of course my mother had her carriage with a pair of matched greys such a pretty pair my father and tom and i all had our hacks or hunters as we liked to call them because we followed the hunt every week all through the winter she sat in silence for a time the girl held her motionless i had a chestnut mare called dolly she said such a sweet little horse i used to groom her myself and she always knew when i was coming because i always brought her a lump of sugar or an apple and she would put her head round and whinny tom rode her sometimes and she could jump beautifully but i never jumped her myself except over a haha or a ditch because i rode sidesaddle of course in a habit we thought it was very fast when girls began to ride astride in breeches just like men i think a habit looks much nicer the girl held the cup to the old lips again wasnt it dull just living in the country she asked oh my dear it wasnt dull there was always such a lot to do with the servants and the gardens and the greenhouses and the horses we kept pigs and we used to cure all our own hams and bacon and then we used to give a dance every year and all our friends did the same and the hunt ball and people coming to stay and then there were all the people in the village to look after everybody knew everybody else and everybody helped each other there was never a minute to spare and never a dull moment she took a sip of the milk that jennifer pressed on her we always had a week in london every year she said we used to stay at browns hotel in dover street generally in may or june it was theatres and dances every night i was presented at court in to the prince of wales and the old queen came in for a moment and we all curtsied to her all together the lights and all the men in their scarlet and blue dress uniforms and the women in court dress with trains i dont think i ever saw anything so splendid except perhaps at the durbar in nineteen hundred and eleven she paused you havent been presented have you jenny the girl said no granny i dont think it happens so much now oh my dear how much how very much you young girls have to miss we had so much much more than you when we were young jennifer tried to get her to drink a little more but the old lady refused it garden parties all through the summer she murmured with tea out on the lawn under the cedar tree there was tennis on the lawn for those who felt like it but archery was what everybody went in for we had a special strip of lawn by the herbaceous border that we kept for archery and the targets upon metal stands stuffed with straw with white and red and blue and gold circles such a pretty sport upon a sunny afternoon dear with the sun and the scent of mignonette between the cedar and the monkeypuzzle tree the old eyes closed it was no good trying to get her to take any more of the bengers food the girl withdrew the cup and put it on the side table and gently relaxed her arm to lay the old head down upon the pillow her grandmother seemed to sleep where she was put the girl stood for a moment looking down at her as she lay with eyes closed it didnt look so good but there was nothing more that she could do for the time being except to change the hotwaterbottles when she had done that she went downstairs again in spite of the bad night that she had had the night before she was not sleepy there was a sense of urgency upon her that banished fatigue she considered for a moment where she was to sleep and put it out of her mind the only possible place for sleep was the sofa in the drawingroom and that was much too far from the old ladys bedroom it was warm up in the bedroom and she could shade the light she would spend the night up there in the armchair again within reach of her grandmother the doctor came at about eleven oclock as he had promised jennifer was making another cup of the milk drink when he arrived and she came out of the kitchen to meet him in the hall good evening he said how is she now much the same the girl replied if anything i think shes a bit weaker has she taken anything she takes about half a cup each time i cant get her to take more than that ill just go up and see her youd better come up too she was with him in the bedroom while he made his examination the old lady knew him but said very little he made it short bade her goodnight cheerfully and went downstairs again with jennifer in the drawingroom he said im very sorry that there isnt a nurse with you she looked at him you mean shes going shes not making any progress he replied shes weaker every time i see her im afraid theres only one end to that miss morton do you think shell die tonight the girl asked i cant say she might quite easily or she might rally and go on for days or even weeks but her hearts getting very bad im afraid youll have to be prepared for it to happen any time he spoke to her about the practical side of death and he spoke to her about the continued effort to feed the old body and then he said i rang up the relieving officer about her today i think hell be coming round to see you tomorrow she said thats somebody who doles out money isnt it in a way he replied he has power to give monetary relief to cases of hardship that arent covered under any of the existing acts hes a municipal officer he paused i wish id known about this patient earlier i could have asked him to come round and see her months ago but i had no idea jennifer said i dont believe my grandmother would have seen him why not she shrugged her shoulders shed have looked on it as charity money all her life shes been more accustomed to giving to charities than taking from them hes very tactful i believe hed have to be she said my grandmothers a lady the oldfashioned sort there was a pause in any case she said that wont be necessary now granny got a cheque today for five hundred pounds from a relation in australia who was worried about her theres enough money now to pay for anything she ought to have five hundred pounds he said thats a lot of money pity it didnt come three months ago i know she said its just one of those things he thought for a moment would you like me to see if i can get a nurse for her tomorrow my father will be here tomorrow she said hes a doctor hell be here about midday could we talk it over with you then i should think a nurse would be a good thing he nodded ill see if i can get one for tomorrow night youll need some relief by then they went out into the hall and he put on his coat he paused then hat in hand shes got relations in australia has she do you know where they live they keep a sheep farm the girl said somewhere in victoria l think he nodded slowly i still cant quite understand it she said granny thought they were quite poor but then this money arrived for her today they must be very well off to send a sum like that the graziers are doing very well he said everybody in that country seems to be doing very well he hesitated im going to try it out there for a bit myself she looked at him surprised you are are you leaving england just for a bit he said i think it does one good to move around and theres not much future in the health service i think itll be better for the children too and its not like going abroad ive got a passage booked on the orion sailing on april the eighteenth its a bit of a gamble but ive had it here where are you going to she asked what part of australia brisbane he said i was there for a bit in when i was in the navy i liked it all right i believe you could have a lot of fun in queensland he hesitated for a moment and then said dont talk about this please miss morton its not generally known yet that im going i shant talk she said i dont know anyone in ealing he went away and she went back into the kitchen and stood thoughtful over the electric stove as she warmed up the milk again the house was dead silent but for the low noise of wind and a little trickling noise of water from some gutter she poured the milk into the cup and added the brandy and took it up to her grandmother how are you feeling now granny she asked the old lady did not answer but her eyes were open and she was awake jennifer sat down on the bedside and lifted her with an arm around her shoulders and held the cup to her lips she drank a little and the brandy may have strengthened her because presently she said in a thin voice jenny im going to die the girl said so am i granny but not just yet nor are you drink a bit more of this have you ever seen anybody die jenny the girl shook her head i wish there was somebody here with you the girl held the cup up to the lips it was stupid to feel frightened and she must not show it try a little more its good for you too weak to argue the old lady took a tiny sip or two then she said jenny there was a long pause while she gathered strength and then she said my chequebook in the small lefthand drawer of the bureau and my pen do you want to write a cheque granny the old eyes signified assent leave it till the morning drink a little more of this and then get some sleep the old lady pushed the cup aside no now the girl put the cup down and went downstairs she knew that the doctor had been right and that her grandmother would die that night she was not frightened now her duty was to ease the passing of the old lady and do what she wanted in the last few hours she was calm and competent and thoughtful as she brought the pen and chequebook and a blottingpad to the bedside are these what you want granny the old lady nodded slightly and the girl put them on the sheet before her and arranged the pillows and lifted the old body into a sitting position she gave her another drink of the hot milk and brandy presently the old lady said bring that thing the girl was puzzled what thing is it and then she got up and fetched the draft from the dressingtable and said this her grandmother nodded weakly and took it from her and looked round questing till jennifer divined what it was that she wanted and gave her her spectacles she put them on and then she said distinctly such a funny sort of cheque i never saw one like it and then she endorsed it on the back with a hand that trembled with a signature that was barely legible jennifer held the cup up to her lips and she drank a little more then with a sudden spurt of energy she took the chequebook and wrote quite a legible cheque for four hundred pounds payable to jennifer morton the girl looking on as she wrote said granny you mustnt do that i dont want it and youll need the money when you get well the old lady whispered i want you to do something for me jenny write letters now send this to my bank and this to yours then go and post them ill do that in the morning granny i cant leave you alone tonight the old lady gathered her ebbing strength and said go and write them now my dear and bring them up and show me and then go out and post them all right she could not disobey so positive and direct a command she thought as she wrote the letters at her grandmothers bureau in the drawingroom that she could sort the matter out with her father next day and pay the money back the thing now was to ease the old ladys passing and not disobey her she brought the letters and the envelopes up to the bedside and showed them the old lady did not speak but watched her as she put the letters and the cheques into the envelopes and sealed them down the girl said there they are granny all ready to post may i post them in the morning the head shook slightly and the old lips said now all right i expect ill be away about ten minutes granny ill have to go down to the broadway ill be back as quick as ever i can the old head nodded slightly and the girl went down and put her coat on and ran most of the way to the post office and most of the way back she came back into the bedroom flushed and breathing quickly but her grandmothers eyes were closed and she seemed to be asleep the girl went down to the kitchen and made herself a cup of tea and ate a little meal of toast and jam then she went back to the bedroom and settled down in the chair before the electric stove at about halfpast twelve the old lady opened her eyes and said jenny did you post the letters i posted them granny theres a dear girl the voice from the bed said weakly ive been so worried for you but youll be all right with jane the girl blinked in surprise but there were more important things to be done than to ask for explanations dont try and talk she said let me get some more hot water in these bottles her grandmother said no jenny jenny the girl paused in the act of taking the bottles from the bed what is it granny the old lady said something that the girl could not catch and then she said its not as if we were extravagant geoffrey and i its been a change that nobody could fight against this going down and down ive had such terrible thoughts for you jenny that it would go on going down and down and when you are as old as i am you would look back at your room at blackheath and your office work as i look back to my life at steep manor and youll think how very rich you were when you were young it did not make sense to the girl she said im just going to take these bottles down and fill them granny ill be back in a few minutes her grandmother said i always took a hotwaterbottle with me when we went out on shikar geoffreys bearer dear old moung bah used to boil up water over the wood fire and fill it for me while geoffrey cleaned his gun in front of the tent such lovely times we had out in the jungle dear such lovely places the old voice died away into silence the girl took the hotwaterbottles and went quickly downstairs to fill them when she came back with them and put them in the bed around the old lady her grandmother was lying with closed eyes she seemed fairly comfortable but the respiration was much worse she was breathing in short gasps three or four times in succession then would come a silence when for a long time she did not seem to breathe at all it was fairly obvious to the girl that the end was coming she wondered if she ought to go and fetch the doctor from his bed and then she thought that there was nothing he could do better for other and more vital patients that he should be allowed to rest she sat down by the bedside in the chair to wait holding her grandmothers hand filled with deep sadness at the close of life the old lady spoke suddenly from the bed jennifer missed the first words again she may have been half asleep she heard on twentytwo thousand a year better than we lived at steep give her my very dearest love when you see her jenny im so happy for you now it was so sweet of her to send those lovely fruits be sure and tell her how much we enjoyed them there was a long long pause and then she said so glad she sent the money for your fare ive had so much much more than you poor girls today jennifer was on her feet now there was something here that had to be cleared up she held her grandmothers hand between her own young warm ones what did you give me that money for granny what do you want me to do with the four hundred pounds try and tell me the old lips muttered dear jane such lovely fruits the girl stood by the bedside waiting if she had understood the old lady at all she was making an incredible proposal but after all the doctor was going she said try and tell me what you want me to do with the four hundred pounds granny there were a few faint jumbled words that jennifer missed and then she heard a little horse for you everything that i had at your age there was very little time left now the girl said granny did you give me the four hundred pounds because you want me to go to australia to visit aunt jane is that what youre trying to say is that what youd like me to do with the money there was a faint unmistakable nod then the old eyes closed again as if in sleep the girl laid the hand carefully beneath the bedclothes and sat down again to wait there was a terrific mess here that her father must help her to clear up at about two oclock her grandmother spoke again for the last time jennifer bending by the old lips heard her say the dear queens statue in moulmein white marble so sweet of the burmese about an hour later the old lady died jennifer standing by the bedside could not say within a quarter of an hour when death occurred three jennifer met her father at the front door of the house early the next afternoon she had gone out into the wet windy streets at about four in the morning to stand in a callbox in the broadway to ring him up in leicester the telephone was by his bed and she got through to him without delay and told him of the death then she had walked back to the house she had expected to be troubled and reluctant to go back there but in fact she found she was not worried in the least by the thought of her dead grandmother upstairs she was calm and serious she felt that she had done a good job and her grandmother was pleased with her if she had still been alive the old lady would have wanted her to have a little meal and get some sleep so she made herself a meal of tea and bread and jam in the kitchen of the silent house turned on the radiator in the livingroom curled herself up on the sofa with a rug over her and slept she did not wake until the middle of the morning when the district nurse came her father came down to ealing alone her mother had made arrangements to come with him but she was coughing a good deal and far from well and on the news of her mothers death jennifers father had persuaded his wife to stay at home and not risk making herself ill just for the funeral so he came down alone and met his daughter at the house at about two oclock im very sorry you had this alone jenny he said im very sorry indeed thats all right daddy she said its a good thing i was working in london he glanced around the drawingroom she was very fond of this house he said we tried once or twice to get her to come up to leicester and live near us but she insisted on staying here the girl nodded this was her own house and she wouldnt have wanted to be a burden upon anybody she was very independent her father said we never dreamed that there was anything wrong with her pension or her money generally i suppose i should have come to see her more often and gone into things a bit more she probably wouldnt have told you the girl said he asked her about the practical business of the doctor and the death certificate and the undertaker and went out to see about these things himself jennifer went out to find somewhere or her father and herself to stay that night and with some difficulty found a private hotel with a couple of bedrooms empty then she went back to the house to wait for her father when he came she made him tea and they sat in the drawingroom among the burmese relics before an electric radiator while she told him what had happened the night before she insisted on giving me the cheque she told her father and she made me go out and post it to my bank what ought i to do daddy ill have to pay it back to the executor shant i he shook his head keep it is that all right i think so he said unless shes changed her will im the executor and the whole of the residuary estate goes to your mother the four hundred pounds is probably yours legally but anyway it doesnt matter oughtnt it to go back to aunt jane she paused after all she sent it for granny not for me he pondered this did you say there was a letter from jane dorman she went and fetched it for him from her grandmothers room and he read it carefully i dont think you need give it back he said the intention is quite clear she says that if ethel didnt need it she was to give it to a charity well she doesnt need it and shes given it to you its yours to do what you like with jenny the girl stared at the hot elements of the fire im not so sure about that she said i think its mine to do what granny liked what do you mean she told him what had passed between them in the last hour of the old life she kept saying what a rotten time girls have in england now compared with when she was young she said i suppose all old people are like that that everything was better in their day and then it seemed quite definite she wanted me to go and see aunt jane with the money go to australia i mean it seemed as if she thought that id be getting back into the sort of life she knew when she was a girl if i went out there and stayed with aunt jane her father said thoughtfully i see do you want to go jenny the girl said honestly i dont know ive not had time to think about it id love to travel of course and see something of the world but grannys world thats gone for ever surely huntin and shootin and fishin and about fifteen servants all calling you madam if thats what happens in australia i dont want to go there i should be sorry to see you go to australia jenny youre the only one weve got she smiled at him dont worry daddy i cant see myself going there was one job that had to be done before they left for the hotel and that was to gather up all the papers in the house for examination edward morion decided to start on that that evening at the hotel but when they came to investigate the papers they found a formidable mass of stuff the drawers of the old ladys bureau and a sort of tallboy were crammed full of letters and papers the relics of a long life thrust into drawers and there forgotten insurance policies of were mixed up with leases of furnished houses rented on some leave in the dim past and personal letters and receipts and chequebook stubs were everywhere among the mass they found three suitcases in the house and filled them full of all this paper and at that there was enough left over to fill another two her father said ill go through these tonight jenny and chuck away what its not necessary to keep then perhaps ill be able to look through the rest of it tomorrow here jennifer hoped that the poplars private hotel would be complacent about a hundredweight of waste paper in the morning they got a taxi from the station and drove to the poplars and dined together meagrely jenny had had two virtually sleepless nights and she could hardly keep her eyes open during the meal as soon as it was over she said daddy do you mind if i go up now im practically asleep he kissed her and wished her goodnight then he went up to his own room and put a shilling in the slot of the gas meter and lit the stove and pulled a chair up to the little radiants and opened the first suitcase in the whitepainted rather bleak and functional bedroom the pageant of a long life gradually unrolled before him as the heap of torn papers on the floor beside him grew it was about twenty minutes after he had started that he came upon the cookery book it was a small manuscript book it began in a hand that was feminine and strange to him and about half the recipes in the book were written in that hand thereafter it had been written on by ethel trehearn first in an unformed almost childish hand later maturing into the writing that he knew on the flyleaf was the inscription for my dear daughter ethel on the happy occasion of her marriage to geoffrey trehearn from her mother june th it had been a pleasant and a practical thought of the mother to give the bride a personal cookery book as one of her wedding presents fiftyseven years later edward morton smiled a little sympathetically as he turned the leaves how unformed the writing of the bride was in the first entry aunt hesters cake take two pounds of jersey butter two pounds best castor sugar gill of caramel lb of flour eggs lb of currants lb of sultanas lb of mixed peel lb of blanched sweet almonds the grated rind of two lemons a small nutmeg i oz mixed spice and a pint of brandy he ran his eye down the recipe with the tolerant amusement of a doctor to the final cover with almond icing and coat with royal and transparent icing then pipe the cake with royal icing according to taste what a world to live in and how ill they must have been his eyes ran back to the ingredients two pounds of jersey butter eight weeks ration for one person the egg ration for one person for four months currants and sultanas in those quantities mixed peel that he had not seen for years half a pint of brandy so plentiful that you could put half a pint into a cake and think nothing of it he laid the book down on his knee and stared at the stove funny the way that things worked out sometimes this bride had died of starvation with nothing to eat but currants and sultanas and candied peel in the end he wondered had she thought in those days of aunt hesters cake things had changed and people no longer lived as they had done in he had eaten such cakes when he was a young man before the war of but now he could hardly remember what a cake like that would taste like jennifer had never eaten anything like that at all of course and so she couldnt miss it funny how the standards of living had changed at any rate in england he thumbed the book through idly glancing here and there at a page her mother had had little confidence in the memory or interest of her daughter before marriage for she had written out the simplest recipes in full for breakfast bacon and eggs for four people take eight eggs or more if the men will want them and about a pound of streaky bacon cut in rashers he could remember breakfasts like that when he was a boy how long it seemed since he had eaten like that he turned the pages idly steak and onions take three pounds of steak he had not eaten a grilled steak and onions for twelve years perhaps jennifer at twentyfour had never eaten it at all people seemed to keep healthy enough on the english rationed food he was approaching sixty years of age himself and he knew well perhaps too well that men of his years think everything was better organized when they were young it was an old mans fancy doubtless that the young men were more virile in england and the girls prettier in than they were today people kept healthy enough but they had not the zest for life that they had had when he was young jennifer with her auburn hair looked pale and sallow most of the time but at twentyfour she should be in her prime he laid the cookery book aside too precious to destroy though it might only be of academic interest in england now it was a pity to throw away a little book that had been prized for so many years he turned over and tore up masses of old letters only glancing at the signatures in case they were the autographs of famous people and he retained one or two then he shook out the contents of a cardboard box that once held envelopes and out fell dance programmes dozens and dozens of them it was years since he had seen the little cards heavily embossed with gilt and coloured lettering with little pencils attached by a thread of silk how thick and fine the paper was how generous dance programmes with little pencils attached seemed to have gone out in england perhaps because of fashion or perhaps because of paper rationing if they were used however cards like that would cost two or three shillings each with printing pencils purchase tax and everything things had been cheaper easier and more gracious when ethel had been young and how many of the cards there were how many dances she had been to there were thirtyfive or forty of them assuming she had kept the programme of every dance that she had ever been to which seemed unlikely even so it was a considerable number of formal dances for a young girl to attend she had been married at twentytwo younger than jennifer he was quite sure that jennifer had not been to thirtyfive or forty formal dances people didnt seem to give them so much now as they had in his young days perhaps it had grown too expensive there were photographs almost by the hundred he discarded the faded sepia snapshots hardly looking at them there could be nothing worth keeping in those he paused longer over the professional portraits one was a very grand affair handtinted by a photographer in dover street it showed a mother and daughter in court dress the long trains sweeping from behind each side of the standing pair he could see the ethel he had first met as a middleaged woman in the features of the girl but what a dress and what a train white silk with delicate lines of a pale rose pink showy and ornate by modern standards it might be but very lovely all the same and what jewellery for a young girl to wear that necklace carefully worked up by the tinter apparently of gold and rubies jennifer had never worn a dress or jewellery like that and yet she came of the same family he put the photograph aside thinking that jennifer might like to see her grandmother as a young woman there was a little bundle of letters tied with ribbon perhaps love letters he hesitated for a moment thinking to throw them away unread then he undid them and glanced at the signatures they were all signed jane he picked one for its embossed letterhead and glanced it through it was dated march th and it read ss mooltan in the mediterranean my darling aunt i would have written to post at gibraltar but ive been terribly seasick ever since we left england just like being in a funny story only i didnt think it funny at all jack was only sick one day but l was in my bunk for five days all through the bay in a cabin with five other girls all married to australians and going out like us all sick together except one i felt awfully silly and very glad in a way that jack and i couldnt have a cabin together because it would have been horrid for him with me being sick all the time however it seems to be over now and ive been sitting out on deck in the hot sun for two days and going into the saloon for every meal and eating like a horse i wanted to write to you before now to thank you tor all you have done for us pver the last year i believe you were the only one of the whole family who didnt faint at the idea of me marrying an australian soldier and who really tried to make jack feel at home and one of us im sorry in a way that im leaving england and going out to live so far away sorry that i shant see father and mother again for years and years or perhaps at all but these last few months havent been a very happy time as i suppose you know and though im sorry to be leaving everyone and everything i know im glad at the same time if you know what i mean im glad to be out of all the complications and unpleasantness and able to start fresh in a new place with jack were going to have a hard time for the first few years much harder than if id been a good girl and stayed at home and married one of fathers officers solid bone from the chin upwards i might have done that if it hadnt been for the war but two years in the waacs make one different jack has been promised a job with a firm called dalgety which means going round the cattle and sheep stations selling machinery and stuff like that to the farmers in a place called gippsland we shant have much money but hes got a house for us through his uncle in a little market town called korrumburra somewhere in the depths of the country ill write and give you the address as soon as ever i know it write to me sometimes because although im glad to be going i expect i shall be lonely sometimes and longing for letters i dont know how to thank you for being so sweet to jack it meant an awful lot to him to find one of my family who really liked him for himself besides me of course i dont suppose ill ever be able to do anything for you like youve done for us like the elephant and the mouse only id like to call one of our children ethel if there is a girl i think im in the family way already but im not quite sure so dont tell anybody yet our very very dearest love to you and uncle geoffrey your affectionate niece jane morton was tired now he had barely sorted one of the three suitcases but he was too tired to go on that night the white bed beckoned him in invitation he folded the letter carefully and put it with the others of the bundle and relied the ribbon better to keep that lot or send them back perhaps to jane dorman in australia he had never met jane dorman and he knew little of her but that she had made an unfortunate marriage with an australian soldier after the first war and had left the country with him and had never been home since that was all that he had known about her twelve hours ago in those hours she had come alive for him and now she was a real person she had formed her own life and battled through and now she had attained a point where she could send five hundred pounds to her old aunt to quell a fear for her that he had never felt jane dorman twelve thousand miles away in her enduring affection had sensed that ethel trehearn was ill and short of money her daughter who was his wife and he living no more than a hundred miles away from the old lady had had no idea that anything was wrong jane and jack dorman from her recent letter had become wealthy people now far better off than he himself he could hardly have found five shillings for the old lady without selling something it wasnt that he was extravagant or mary either in these days in england and in general practice the money just wasnt there and that was all about it he got into bed and turned off the light but sleep did not come easily how well ethel trehearn had lived when she was a young woman how incredible it all seemed now and yet thinking back over his own youth perhaps not quite so incredible the standard of living had slipped imperceptibly in england as year succeeded year as war succeeded war his own father had been a doctor before him but in york he could remember how he lived as a boy in the big house in clifton now used as part of the municipal offices of york and full of draughtsmen they had kept a coachman and a groom before the days of motorcars and a horse for his fathers dogcart and a horse for the brougham there had been a wholetime gardener and always two servants in the house and sometimes three it was unthinkable in his fathers household that there should be any shortage of any food for family or servants there always seemed to be plenty of money for anything they wanted to do nor did his father have to work particularly hard only the most urgent cases ever called him out on sunday and all through the winter one day in each week was sacred to the shooting it was a good life that that ethel trehearn had known as a young woman and his father it might some day come again in england but not in his own time he turned restlessly in his bed unable to sleep it was easy to say that good times would come again in england but was it true in each year of the peace food had got shorter and shorter more and more expensive and taxation had risen higher and higher he wa now living on a lower scale than in the wartime years the decline had gone on steadily if anything increasing in momentum and there seemed no end to it where would it all end and what lay ahead of the young people of today in england what lay ahead of jennifer he lay uneasily all night a worried and an anxious man he got up at dawn and went out for a short walk before breakfast as was his habit he met jennifer at the breakfast table and they talked of the work that lay before them the undertaker coming at ten oclock the search for a secondhand furniture dealer to make an offer for the furniture left in the house the estate agent to be found who would sell the house itself these were easy and straightforward matters that had to be attended to before merton went back to his practice in leicester more difficult was the personal matter that he must talk over with his daughter he broached it as they walked through the suburban streets ive been thinking about you going to australia jenny he said theres a lot to be said for and against i dont think we want to decide anything too hastily she glanced at him in surprise you dont think i ought to go daddy i dont know he said i dont know what to think theres this four hundred pounds dumped right into your lap so to speak and thats what she wanted you to do with it it might not be a bad idea to go out for a few months and see if you like it there should be plenty of money to pay your passage out and home i wouldnt want to stay out there daddy i couldnt leave you and mummy we wouldnt want to lose you jenny but i must say i get worried sometimes thinking of the way things are going here the girl was silent even in her own memory the stringencies in her parents home had increased her own wage packet bought a good deal less than it had bought two years before with the optimism of youth she said well get an election and a change of government before long then everything will get cheap again wont it he shook his head i wish i could think so i dont think its anything to do with socialism its been going on for thirty years this has this getting poorer and poorer too many people to feed here in england out of too few fields its the foodproducing countries thatll be the ones to live in in the future you can see it now look at jane dorman thats wool daddy they didnt make their money out of food they made it out of wool well weve got to have wool and we dont grow enough of our own im dressed in it almost entirely so are you jennifer thought of her winter clothes mostly in this weather she agreed they walked on for a time in silence if i went out to australia id have to get a job she said i couldnt just go out and live upon aunt jane he nodded you could do that all right i expect they want secretaries in victoria whats the capital of victoria daddy is it adelaide he shook his head i dont know i think thats over on the west coast somewhere id have to look at an atlas later in the day when they were having tea in the kitchen of her grandmothers house before going back to the hotel jennifer said of course id like to go out to australia for the trip the only thing is i wouldnt want to stay there youve never been out of england have you jenny ive been to france she said td love to go like that if one could look on it as just a holiday six months or so but id never want to go and live out there why not she struggled to express herself this is our place this is where we belong were english not australian he thought for a minute i suppose thats right but thats not the way the british empire was created you dont want me to stay out there for good do you daddy i want you to do whats best for you he said im worried jenny and i dont mind telling you if this decline goes on im worried over what may happen to you before you die thats what granny said the girl replied uncertainly she said that she was worried for me everybody seems to be worrying about me i can look after myself her father smiled all the same he said no harm in going on a six months trip out to australia if it gets dropped into your lap it seems such a waste of money its what she gave it to you for he said but its your money to do what you like with think it over the funeral was on saturday and after it was over jennifer went with her father to st pancras to see him off then she travelled down by train to blackheath through the drab suburbs of new cross and lewisham as she went the blazing australian deserts the wide cattle stations the blue seas and coral islands that she had read about in novels danced before her eyes it seemed incredible that these things could be within her grasp these places could be hers to go to if she wished only the inertia of giving up her job and going of getting out of her rut now stood between her and these places she had a duty to perform on the sunday the duty of writing to jane dorman at this queer address leonora merrijig victoria to tell her of the death of ethel trehearn and to tell her about the disposition of her five hundred pounds she sat down on sunday morning to write this letter when she had finished it was a straight factual account of what had happened with the unpleasant fact glossed over that the old ladys death had been virtually from starvation she could not bring herself to tell anyone in another country that such things could happen in england at the end she wrote as it stands now ive got four hundred of your five hundred pounds and im not too happy about it she gave it me because she wanted me to go out to australia and see if i would like to make my life out there and to visit you i should like to see you of course but as for living in australia i think its very unlikely that id like it i suppose im incurably english if i did come id have to get a job of course im a qualified shorthand typist with four years experience since i got my diploma do you think i could get a job in melbourne or would that be difficult do tell me if you would like to have the money back and ill send it at once because honestly i dont feel as though its mine at all yours sincerely jennifer morton she got this off by airmail at midday on sunday and relaxed that was a time of strain and gloom in england with the bad news of the war in korea superimposed upon the increasing shortages of food and fuel and the prospect of heavy increases in taxation to pay for rearmament in the week that followed jennifers return to work the meat ration was cut again and now reached a point when it was only sufficient for one meagre meal of meat a week when shortages are shared equally they are nothing like so painful as they would be in a free economy if the smiths can afford to buy meat and the jones not the strain may be intolerable but if nobody can have the meat the lack of meat soon ceases to annoy nevertheless the present cut produced some serious and heated discussion at the lunch table between the men which jennifer listened to with interest there were about three hundred clerical staff in that office of the ministry of pensions and they mostly lunched together in one large canteen forsyth head of department d in rehabilitation said the plain fact of it is that these argentines have got us where they want us theyve got the food and weve got to have it or go under morrison in the accounts branch said we cant pay the prices that theyre asking the economy wont stand it well have to do without something then free spectacles and false teeth weve got to eat something somebody said something about the minister of food that fool getting the argentines backs up sanders from the assessment branch said i dont agree at all its easy to sling mud at him but hes done a marvellous job in what way sanders said well the countrys never been so healthy as it is now everybody gets enough to eat the only thing that you can say against the food is that its a bit dull sometimes but everybody gets enough of it nobody dies of starvation in this country like they do in france thats the difference between a controlled economy and laissez faire jennifer thought of one old lady who had died of starvation but she said nothing her grandmother could have applied to the relieving officer of course she could not speak without showing indignation and it was better not to make a row before the men morrison said theres one big difference between this country and france he spoke with the deliberation of an accountant and with a slight north country accent whats that asked sanders you take a successful professional man said morrison slowly a leading surgeon maybe or a barrister with taxes and costs the way they are he really hasnt got a chance of saving for his old age not like he could before the war hell save something of course but a man like that he doesnt get into the big money much before hes fortyfive or fifty and in the few good years that hes got left he cant save enough to retire on in the way of life that hes accustomed to he just cant do it with the tax and surtax as it is youve only got to look at the figures to see that its impossible forsyth said thats right well if a man like a firstclass surgeon cant save properly for his old age nobody can said morrison that means that nobody in england can feel safe everybody in this country today is worried sick for what may happen to him and to his wife when they get old except the very lowest paid classes who can get by on the retirement pension well how do you make out that things are any better in france asked sanders this way said the accountant in france the man like the surgeon or the barrister is taxed much less than he is here and the working man pays proportionately more i dont say thats a good thing it may be or it may not be the fact is that its different in france the leading surgeon or the leading barrister can save for his old age and save enough to give him security in the way of life hes used to hes not worried sick for what may happen to him in france if youre successful enough youre all right that means that in france youve got some happy and contented people here youve got none yes but hell said sanders thats at the expense of the underdogs i dont say its not said the accountant equably tm just saying that the french system does produce some happy people and ours doesnt the argument drifted inconclusively along till it was time to get back to the offices a day or two later to jennifers interest the subject of emigration came up none of the older men seemed particularly interested in it my nephew he went out to canada one said hes an engineer got a job in a tractor factory in montreal he was out there in the war with the raf so he knows the country hes doing all right but he says the winters terrible its not right the way these young chaps go abroad said sanders if it goes on the government will have to put a stop to it jennifer spoke up with suppresed indignation why should they do that she asked why shouldnt people go abroad if they want to sanders was about to answer but the accountant intervened because the country cant afford it the girl said they pay their own passages dont they im not speaking about that miss morton said the accountant look suppose it was you who wanted to go to canada it was uncomfortably near home but the girl nodded how much do you think you cost me in money thats right said morrison i dont quite know what you mean she said ill tell you very roughly he said when did you start working i got my first job when i was eighteen she told him right for eighteen years somebody in this country fed you and clothed you and educated you before you made any money before you started earning say you cost an average two quid a week for that eighteen years youve cost england close on two thousand pounds to produce somebody said like a machine tool thats right the accountant said a human dictaphone and typewriter combined all electronic and maintains itself and does its own repairs thats cost two thousand quid suppose you go off to canada youre an asset worth two thousand quid that england gives to canada as a free gift if a hundred thousand like you were to go each year itld be like england giving canada a subsidy of two hundred million pounds a year its got to be thought about this emigration we cant afford to go chucking money away like that she said puzzled its not really like that is it it is and all said morrison thats what built up the united states half a million emigrants a year went from central europe to america for fifty years or so say they were worth a thousand quid apiece right that was a subsidy from central europe to america of five hundred million quid a year and it went on for fifty years or so human bulldozers he leaned forward on the table believe it or not he said central europe got very poor and the usa got very rich there was laughter at the table its a fact im telling you said the accountant central europe got very poor if all that manpower had stayed at home in poland and in czechoslovakia we might have had a good deal less trouble from hitler we want to watch the same thing doesnt happen here it could do easily if too many people start emigrating he paused it could be the ruin of this country i dont gee how you can keep people here if they want to go the girl said after all whats the commonwealth or empire or whatever they call it these days whats it for you can go to australia if you want to cant you sanders said you can at present but its got to be controlled people cant always do the things they want to im sick of the word control said jennifer we didnt have to have all these controls before the war no said sanders we had three million unemployed instead he leaned across the table ill give you a better reason than the money why people ought to stay here whats that asked forsyth to do a good job for the world said sanders ill tell you here in england weve got the most advanced form of government of any country in the world its experimental and i know thereve been mistakes some things that have been tried out arent so hot like ground nuts in tanganyika and theyve had to be written off but what this country has tried to do and what its doing is to plan a new form of government and put it into practice a new form of democracy where everyone will get a square deal when weve shown it can be done the world will copy it all right you see but it cant be worked out if people are allowed to run away to other countries its their job to stay here and get this one right jennifer said you mean one ought to stay here because theres an experiment in socialism going on and if we go away well spoil it thats right forsyth said too bad when the guineapig escapes from the laboratory before the research is finished it kind of spoils the experiment miss morton there was laughter and sanders flushed angrily its not like that at all its for the good of everyone to stay in england this is the most advanced country in the world forsyth said maybe id trade the brave new world for an oldfashioned capitalistic porterhouse steak jennifer said if theres one thing that would make me want to go and emigrate its what youve just said that ones got to stay here for the sake of an experiment morrison laughed shes got a bourgeois ideology he said shes nothing but a ruddy kulak sanders jennifer went back to her work that afternoon but the incident stayed in her mind and rankled she had no particular aversion to mr sanders indeed he was a healthy youngish man who had been an officer in the rnvr during the war and had commanded an lct in the invasion of normandy what irked her was the display of socialist enthusiasm that pervaded her office which seemed to her slightly phoney it was manifestly impossible for anyone who derided the socialistic ideal to progress very far in the public service if a young man aimed at promotion in her office he felt it necessary to declare a firm almost a religious belief in the principles of socialism jennifer felt instinctively that mr sanders was less concerned with the brave new world than the progress of mr sanders in the ministry of pensions and she wondered what would happen to his views if an election should bring in a conservative government in the meantime she felt constrained and restricted by bureaucracy it could not seriously be true that she would have to stay in england if she wanted to go abruptly the thought of going to australia for a time became attractive to her if they said she couldnt go shed darned well go on monday she got a cable at her boardinghouse it read deeply grieved aunt ethel but so glad you were with her of course keep money and do come out here and visit us plenty of jobs melbourne about ten pounds weekly writing air mail jane dorman she stared at this in amazement that she could have got an answer to the letter she had written only a week before it made australia seem very near frequently when she wrote on sunday to her parents in leicester and missed the evening post she did not get an answer till thursday true jane dorman had cabled but even so jennifer felt as if jane dorman lived in the next county and australia no longer seemed to be upon the far side of the world it wouldnt do any harm to find out about it anyway she made a few discreet inquiries and took tuesday afternoon off on a pretext that she had to help her father clear up ethel trehearns estate which was totally untrue she went up to london and visited the p and o office and the orient line next door and australia house and victoria house she returned with a great mass of literature to study fascinating windows opening upon a strange new world on the thursday she wrote to the orient line and put her name down for a touristclass passage to australia five months ahead the earliest date that she could get a berth she sent ten pounds deposit on the assurance of the company that this would be returnable if she changed her mind and didnt go she wouldnt really go of course but it was nice to know she could go if she wanted to on the friday she got a bulky airmail letter from jane dorman in australia twelve days after she had written enclosed with it were four pages of advertisements in newspapers of situations vacant in melbourne for secretaries and typistes at salaries that made her blink jane dorman wrote six pages ending as regards the money do keep it as i said in the cable aunt ethel was terribly kind to us a long time ago when we first got married and i am only so deeply grieved that i didnt realize before that she was in need of help because now weve got so much with the wool sales as they are of course we all know that it cant go on but the debt upon the land and stock is all paid off now so everything is ours and even if wool fell to half its present price or less we should still be all right and safe for the remainder of our lives i need hardly say how much we should like to see you out here with us we live in a country district a hundred and fifty miles from melbourne i dont suppose youd want to live the sort of life we do because its very quiet here rather like living in the depths of the welsh mountains perhaps or in cumberland theres not a great deal for young people here unless theyre keen on the land and my children are all living now in the cities ethel and jane in sydney and jack in newcastle about a hundred miles north of sydney i expect if you came here youd want to work in melbourne and i am sending you some pages from the age and the argus to show you the sort of jobs available everybody is just crying out for secretaries it seems and youd have no trouble at all in getting work i do hope that you will decide to come and that before you take up work you will come and stay with us for as long as you like or as long as you can stand the country i do so want to hear about aunt ethel from somebody who knew her i had not met her for over thirty years of course but we wrote to each other every two or three months i cant really think of her as old even now do come and see us out here even if its only for the trip yours affectionately jane dorman jennifer had no very close friends in blackheath but she sometimes went to the pictures with a girl called shirley hyman who lived in the room below her shirley worked in the city and was engaged to a young man in a solicitors office she was with him every weekend but seldom saw him in the week that friday evening she was washing her hair for his benefit next day and jennifer went down to see her papers in hand she said shirley have you ever thought of going to australia miss hyman sitting on the floor before the gas stove drying her hair said for the lords sake whatever made you ask that ive got a relation there said jennifer she wants me to go out and stay what part of australia shes outside melbourne jennifer said id get a job in melbourne if i went perths the only place i know about have you been there miss hyman shook her head dicks always going on about it she said he wants us to go there when were married he thinks he knows a chap out there wholl take him on as soon as hes got his articles are you keen on it i dont quite know the girl said its an awful long way away when im with dick it all seems reasonable theres not much future here and if were going well its better to go before we start a family but its an awful long way ive been finding out about it jennifer said i got a letter back from my relation in twelve days it doesnt seem so far now as it did before is that all it took thats right she squatted down before the stove with shirley and produced her papers and pamphlets theres ever so many jobs according to these advertisements they turned over the brightlycoloured emigration pamphlets she had gleaned in australia house dicks got that one and that said shirley it looks all right in these things doesnt it but they wouldnt tell you the bad parts like half the houses in brisbane having no sewage system is that right asked jennifer with interest so somebody was telling dick he says its all right in perth but i dont believe it is what do people do asked jennifer go out in the woods or something they laughed together theyve cut down all the woods said shirley i was reading somewhere about australia becoming a dust bowl because theyve cut down all the woods i dont think that can be right said jennifer theyve got some woods left or they couldnt have taken these pictures they bent together over the pictures in the pamphlet about tasmania showing wooded mountain ranges stretching as far as the eye could see they probably kept those just to make these pictures to show mutts like us said shirley sceptically its probably all desert and black people round behind the camera they laughed and sat in silence for a time what do you really think about it jennifer asked at last do you think its a good thing to do the girl sat playing with her hairbrush on the floor beside the stove thoughtful and serious dick expects to be successful she said presently and i think he will hed have more opportunity out there with new things starting all the time as more people get into the country she raised her head and looked at jennifer and anyway whats the good of being successful in england they only take it all away from you with tax and supertax the way he looks at it if we stay in england hed do best in some government office and get a pension at the end he wants to be on his own though there was a pause i dont know what to think shirley said at last id never thought of leaving england up until the last couple of months it seems a horrid thing to do as if one ought to stay and help to get things right dick says theres too many of us in the country i dont know if somebodys got to get out i wish it wasnt me do you think it would feel strange asked jennifer would people like you in australia i dont know theres such a lot of english people there already i think one would find friends people who hadnt been out there so long themselves i think itld be like going to live in scotland for a job they talk with a funny accent some of them you know i dont think it could be as bad as the scotch accent jennifer said i went to edinburgh once and i couldnt understand what some of the people were saying porters and cab drivers you know i dont believe australians are as difficult as that youre all right of course said shirley you could come back if you didnt like it you could save the cost of the passage home its different for us if we went out wed have to go for good i know jennifer said slowly the trouble is i believe i might like it and stay there for good i dont want to do that the little ties that held her to her own land were still strong ties of friendships of places that she knew of things she had grown up with she went on with her work and life in blackheath for another three days uncertain and irresolute on the following tuesday she got a telegram from the orient line can offer returned single tourist passage melbourne in orion sailing december rd holding open for you till midday november rd november the twentythird was in two days time and if she took this she would have to sail within a fortnight her first reaction was that she couldnt possibly go it was too soon she hadnt made up her mind she got the telegram on her return from work shirley hyman was out that evening and there was nobody else with whom she could discuss the matter it was impossible for jennifer to stay in her room that evening she was too worried and restless she had her tea in an abstracted daze and walked across the heath and took a train for charing cross knowing that it was in her power to have done with that heath and with that train it was not raining but the night was cold and windy the chilly draughts whipped round her on the platform in the darkness in australia it would be high summer the train was unheated owing to fuel shortages and she was very cold by the time she got to charing cross she went out of the station and turned eastwards up the strand and there she met a disappointment she had hoped that the bright lights and the traffic would be stimulating and cheerful and that england would hold out a hand there for her to hang on to but the shop windows were all dark because of fuel rationing and the strand seemed sombre and deserted with little life she was there now however and very cold she walked eastwards quickly for the exercise she stopped now and then to look into a shop window in the light of an arc lamp but there was no joy in it warmth and feeling were coming back into her feet as she passed waterloo bridge she went on past the law courts down fleet street empty and dark but for the street lamps and the lights and clamour from the newspaper offices by the time she reached the bottom of ludgate hill she was warm and comfortable again and beginning to wonder why she had come there and where she was heading for there was no point in walking on into the city she moved up the hill at a slower pace looking for a busstop and so she came to st pauls cathedral an immense black mass towering up into the darkness from the blitz desolation that surrounded it she moved towards it and stood staring at the mass of masonry this was the sort of thing that australia would never have to show her this masterpiece of wren if she left england she would be leaving this for ever and a hundred other beauties of the same kind that the new country could never show her she stood there thinking of these things and two devastating little words came into her mind so what she had been taken inside st pauls once as a schoolgirl she remembered it as the biggest building that she had ever been in and for that alone she knew that she was probably foolish and ignorant because there must be much more to st pauls than that but she stepped back till she could see the whole bulk in the fleeting moonlight as the swift clouds passed and repassed she would be leaving this for ever and she must be honest with herself about it would she miss it very much she tried to examine her own feelings and she said to herself well there it is now am i getting a great thrill out of it she had to confess within her own mind that she wasnt the enormous inert mass of masonry meant little to her there was nothing in those great columns of stone to affect her decision one way or the other she turned back towards the west end rather thoughtful a bus came rattling by and stopped near her she ran and got on to it and rode back up fleet street she got off at charing cross and walked on to trafalgar square she stood by st martinsinthefields for a time looking found her at the national gallery the nelson column the admiralty arch the long broad way that was whitehall here was the centre of her country the very essence of it here were the irreplaceable things that she would have to do without if she left england surely that would be unbearable she felt that there must be something wrong with her because she knew that it wouldnt be unbearable at all in fact she didnt much care if she never saw any of them again she had a queer feeling now that she was becoming a stranger in her own country that she no longer fitted in she had to consult her parents in leicester about this matter of the passage and there was so little time she thought for a few minutes and then went diffidently into the charing cross hotel and spoke to the girl at the desk and ordered coffee and biscuits in the writingroom and sat down to write a letter to her father and mother she put the matter very simply to them and asked them to telegraph her to advise her what to do then she went by underground to st pancras station and posted her letter in the special box upon the platform so that it would get to them next morning she got a telegram from them in answer when she returned from work next day it read think you had better go but come home for a few days first our dearest love daddy and mummy she sailed a fortnight later for australia in the orion four the man with the crushed fingers got down awkwardly from the cab of the rickety dustcovered truck into the timber road his mate climbed over the tailboard and dropped down into the road beside him he raised a hand to the driver thanks jack well be right the door of the cab slammed to the engine roared and the truck moved on swaying and lurching down the unmetalled road in a great cloud of dust the two men stood together at the entrance to the timber camp the wooden hutments stood in a forest in a valley a little river ran beyond the buildings and a mountain climbed up steeply beyond that covered in eucalyptus gum trees full of brilliantlycoloured parrots the buildings stood among the trees for shade from the hot victorian sunlight blazing down out of a cloudless sky this way the well man said down here fourth hut along they turned into the camp the hand of the injured man was wrapped in a bloodstained rag and he walked with it thrust into his open shirt as in a sling he asked whats the bastards name splinter said his mate hell fix you up whats the bastards real name splinter thats all the name hes got hes right as good as any doctor company ought to keep a mucking doctor here the injured man said theyve got no mucking right to carry on with just a firstaid box one day some bastards going to cop it proper and i hope its mr mucking forrest hurting bad like bloody hell ill go down to the jig tonight get mucking well pissed they went into the fourth hut by the door in its end and into a central corridor of bare unpainted rather dirty wood the uninjured man opened a door at random and said to a man inside say jack which is splinters room last on the left down by the washroom someone hurt too right fred here got his hand under a log aw look he may be in the canteen see if hes in the room if not ill go find him the two men went down the passage to the last room and opened the door there was a man inside sitting on the bed reading an old newspaper a lean swarthy blackhaired man about thirtyfive years old he looked up as they entered aw splinter said the uninjured man this is fred the dark man smiled and nodded slightly he got his hand mucked up the man got up from the bed let me see he spoke with a pronounced central european accent the other turned to go ill get along fred youll be right the injured man withdrew his hand from his shirt and began to unwrap the bloodstained rags carefully with fingers that trembled a little the man called splinter noted that and stopped him wait and sit down on the bed he switched on the current to a china electric jug and dropped a few instruments into it to boil then he rolled up his sleeves and took a white enamel bowl and a bottle of disinfectant from the cupboard and went out to the bathroom he came back with his hands washed and sterile and with warm water in the bowl he moved the bare wooden table to a convenient position in front of the man and waited till the water in the jug boiled opening a packet of lint while he waited and adding a little disinfectant to the water in the bowl then he sat down facing his patient with the table between them arranged the hand in a relaxed position and began his work presently this is a bad injury he said softly it must hurt you a great deal now let me see if it is possible that you can move the fingers just bend a little to show that you can move them this one so and now this one so and this one so that is good it hurts very much now but a fortnights holiday and it will soon be well cripes said the man is it going to hurt like this a mucking fortnight it will not hurt when i have done with it the dark man said not unless you make a hit unless you hit it you must wear it in a sling till it is well and keep it carefully i must now hurt you a little more will you like whisky thanks chum the dark man produced a bottle of australian whisky from the cupboard and poured out half a tumblerfull the patient took it and sat drinking it neat in little gulps while the other worked what is your name fred fred carter where did you do this fred up on the shoulder and how did it happen loading twofoot sticks on a tenwheeler he meant treetrunks two feet in diameter on to a trailer truck the mucking chain broke and the stick rolled back whipped me crowbar back n pinched me mucking hand on to the next stick down the dark man nodded gravely now this will hurt you i am sorry but it must be done presently it was all over the hand bandaged and in a sling the injured man sat whitefaced the shock gradually subsiding as he smoked a cigarette given to him by the doctor and finished the whisky say chum he asked whats your name zlinter the dark man said carl zlinter most people call me splinter here where do you come from i am from czechoslovakia in pilsen i was born how long have you been here it is fifteen months that i have come to australia where did you learn doctoring i was doctor in my own country at home a real doctor the dark man nodded in prague i qualified in after that i was in hospital appointment in pilsen my own town and after that i was doctor in the army he did not say which army cripes then you know all about it the czech smiled i am not doctor any longer i am timberman in australia i may not be a doctor unless to go back to medical school for three years so i am timberman he stubbed out his cigarette and got up and went to the cupboard and shook out some white tablets into the palm of his hand go back to your camp and go to bed he said i will tell mr forrest for you that you cannot work go to bed and take three of these tablets and the pain will go away if it comes back in the night take these other three come back and see me after tea on sunday and i will change the dressings for you aw look the man said i was going down to the jig tonight to get pissed carl zlinter smiled it is your hand it will hurt very bad if you go down to the jig because you will hit it without knowing and it will hurt very bad if you go to bed it will not hurt he turned to the cupboard the bottle of whisky was about onethird full he gave it to the man take this he said and get pissed in bed but go to bed aw look chum i cant take your grog and say how much is it there is nothing to be paid the czech said mr forrest he pays for the dressings and the disinfectant the whisky you can shout for me down at the jig one day but not tonight he smiled see you sunday fred carter went away with the bottle and zlinter wondered if he would go to bed or whether he would drink the bottle and go down to the pub at merrijig just the same the labour camps were by the sawmills at lamirra four miles from merrijig and seventeen miles from banbury the nearest town by victorian law the hotel was supposed to close its bar at six oclock in the evening in fact it stayed wide open day and night and the police connived at it they knew that few of the timbermen would pass an open bar to go twelve miles farther on to banbury driving past in the dark night the police would see the blazing lights and hear the songs and see the trucks parked outside the solitary wooden building and they would smile as they drove past congratulating themselves upon the simple stratagem that kept the drunks out of town it was a friday evening the timbermen worked a fortyhour week on five days and saturday and sunday were holidays carl zlinter was a fisherman and december was the finest month in the year for troutfishing in the deserted mountain streams when fred carter had gone away he set to work to prepare for the weekend he had a spinning rod and a fly rod but the rivers were too shallow and too swift for spinning and he preferred to fish wet fly he cleared away the litter of his dressings sterilized his instruments again in the electric jug and washed out the basin and then set to work to make up a cast of flies and to pack his rucksack the delatite river flowed past lamirra near his camp but it was too small and too overgrown to fish just there and down by merrijig it was fished by many others zlinter had developed a weekend of fishing which took him into very wild almost untrodden forest country which he loved his rucksack was a big shabby thing with a light alloy frame which he had picked up in germany in and had carried ever since it held everything that he required for a weekend in the bush his habit was to start out from the lumber camp early on saturday morning and walk eight miles or so on half obliterated paths through the forest over a dividing range down into the valley of the howqua river untouched by any road here the fishing was firstclass there was a forest ranger living in the howqua valley a man called billy slim rather over forty years of age who lived alone with a few horses and was glad of any company when the solitude became oppressive he would ride out to the hotel at merrijig and spend the evening there billy had a bed for anyone who came his way and carl zlinter was in the habit of fishing down the howqua to billys place on saturday staying the night with him fishing up the river again on the sunday and so back to the camp by the way that he had come so far he was delighted with australia he had to work tor two years in the woods in return for his free passage from the displaced persons camp in germany and he was enjoying every minute of it he had nobody to consider but himself his father and mother had been killed in the russian advance that surged through pilsen late in he had heard nothing of his brother since and he believed him to be dead he had never married the war had begun soon after he was qualified and he was not a man to marry unless he could see at any rate a little way into the future he had remained unattached throughout his service in the german army and through the long ignominy of the peace when he had worked as a doctor in various displaced persons camps when finally the reduction of the dp camps gave him the chance to go to australia with one of the last batches of emigrants he was almost glad of the condition that he should not practise as a doctor he would have to work for two years as a labourer wherever he might be directed and then if he still wished to be a doctor in victoria he would have to repeat the last three years of his medical students course medicine had brought him nothing but the most intimate contact with the squalor and distress of unsuccessful war when the time came to choose his labour he elected to be a lumberman because he loved the deep woods and the mountains and he put medicine behind him on land he had been sent to a reception camp for a few days but as he was unattached and spoke tolerable engish he had been sent on quickly to lamirra and he had been there ever since he knew a good deal about camps and how to be comfortable in them and he settled down quite happily to work out his two years in the woods he loved he had little regret for the loss of his medical profession after his two years in the woods were over he would have to do something else he did not quite know what but in this prosperous country he was confident that he could earn a living somehow or other in the meantime he was well clothed and fed paid highly by the european standard and given so much leisure that he could get in two days trout fishing every week better than lying dead and putrefying in the pripet marshes or the fields round caen where he had left so many of his friends that was the old world he was glad to put it all behind him and enjoy the new he left the camp at about seven oclock that saturday morning before the day grew hot with his rucksack on his back and his fly rod in his hand in its cloth case he got to the river soon after ten and put up his rod and began to fish downstream wading in the cool water in his normal working boots and trousers he caught a rainbow trout after ten minutes fishing a good fish about two pounds in weight that leaped into the air repeatedly to shake the fly out of its mouth he kept his line taut and played the fish out and landed it upon a little shoal with one hand in its gills he never burdened himself with a net he caught a brown trout a few minutes later then as the day warmed up the fish went off the feed and he caught nothing more he got to billys place about midday the forest ranger lived in a clearing by the river in a long singlestoreyed building with a veranda built of course of timber with an iron roof there was a livingroom which was the kitchen with a harness room opening out of it which in turn communicated with the stable in winter when the snow was lying in the valley billy slim could feed his horses without going out into the snow his own bedroom opened out of the livingroom and there were two bunkrooms off the veranda he kept his house very neat and clean having little else to do in one corner of the livingroom there was a radio telephone set run off a large battery with which the ranger could communicate with his headquarters in case of forest fires or similar disasters when carl zlinter walked in billy was seated talking to the microphone he raised a hand in greeting then knitted his brows and bent again to his work giving his weekly time sheet to the girl operator on saturday mornings was always a trouble and a perplexity to him aw look florence he was saying tuesday oh yes look tuesday i went upstream to little bend and then over the spur to the sickle thats down on the jamieson river there was a party went in there last week from lamirra know who they were billy naw i didnt see them there was four of them on horses and two packhorses and one of the horses was ted sloans blue roan so ted must have been there one of the horses dropped a shoe and went lame on the way out they shot a few wallabies and camped three nights they lit fires which they didnt ought to ill see ted about that he paused wednesday i had to go into the jig to pick up a couple of sacks of horse feed thursday i stayed home i wasnt feeling too good got that florence over the loudspeaker said thursdays a working day billy whatll i tell mr bennett i dont like to put down you got sick again why cant you do your drinking at the weekend over aw look florence the ranger said i didnt drink nothing down at the jig you know me i wouldnt of a wednesday i got one of my bad goes on the

the paddock fence in the afternoon put down repairs to homestead and stockyards for thursday yesterday thats friday i was out all day i went up around mount buller as far as the youth hostel hut and then down to the king river and along by mount cobbler and the rose river i didnt get back till after nine last night today jack dormans coming out with alec fisher from banbury and theres carl zlinter here one of the lumbermen from lamirra over the loudspeaker said thatll be right billy i can make it up from that thats all i have for you over byebye florence said the ranger closing down now out he shut the set off with a sigh of relief and turned to carl zlinter come fishing if i may i would like to spend the night youll be right put your stuff in the end room i got jack dorman coming over with alec fisher know them zlinter shook his head i do not know them aw well jack dorman hes got a property just by the jig thought maybe you might know him alec fisher hes agent for the australian mercantile in banbury theyre coming out to do a bit of fishing zlinter smiled we shall crowd you out tonight with a large party too right makes a change to have a bit of company now and then will they come on horses might do alec fishers got a landrover they can get over the track with that id never sit astride a bloody horse if id got a landrover to ride in id have thought that theyd be here by now carl zlinter lett his rucksack in the end room and went down to the river cleaned the two fish and left them in billys larder for the evening he had brought a sandwich lunch with him from the camp canteen he went down to the river again and fished on downstream for a little no fish were moving in the heat of the day he gave it up after half an hour and found a shade tree standing in the middle of a grassy sward by the river and sat down undet it to eat his lunch it was very quiet in the forest a hot windless day a cockatoo screamed once or twice in the distance and near at hand there was a rippling noise of water from a little fall in the liver presently the quiet was broken by the low grinding of a vehicle coming down the horse track into the valley in low gear he guessed that it would be the landrover it passed along the track a few hundred yards upstream from him and he heard the water as it went splashing through the ford he heard it breast the rise up from the river to the rangers house and then the engine stopped and there was quiet again he went down to the river and drank from it after his meal cupping up the water in his hands then he went back and sat down under the tree again and lit a cigarette what a good country this was it had all the charm of the bohemian forests that he had loved as a young man plus the advantage of being english he had not learned to differentiate between english people and australians to him this was an english country and england had the knack of being on the winning side in all her wars he disliked and distrusted russians and his own land was gone for ever into the russian grip he liked south germans and got on well with them and spoke the language fluently more fluently than he spoke english the germans however had an unfortunate record for starting wars and losing them which made germany a bad country to live in australia had everything for carl zlinter the type of country that he loved freedom good wages and no war he would willingly forgo his medical career for those good things he revelled in the country like a man enjoying a warm bath he stubbed his cigarette out on a stone or what he took to be a stone in the meadow beneath the tree he looked at the stone curiously and it was not a stone at all but a piece of brick he looked about him with interest half buried in the grass was a low rubble of brick beside it on the level grassy sward was a series of rectangular patterns hardly to be described as mounds more like discolorations of the pasture he studied these for a minute while his mind accustomed to the solitude of the howqua refused to accept the evidence then he woke up to the realization of the fact that there had been a house there at one time even when he appreciated the evidence it still seemed incredible and for a very definite reason he knew that this part of australia had been first explored barely a hundred years before he had found out sufficient of the history of the country to have become aware that it was most unlikely that the howqua valley had seen any white man before if the evidence upon the ground before him were to be believed a house built wholly or partly of brick had been built and lived in and deserted and so entirely ruined that only a bare trace upon the sward remained all in less than a hundred years it did not seem possible he stood looking at the grass for a time deeply puzzled then he put it out of his mind for the time being and walked over to the stream and stepped out into the shallows and began to cast his fly he would ask billy slim about it that evening he fished on down the river he caught no fish and hardly expected to until the sun began to drop he stopped presently and smoked a cigarette and lay on his back under the gum trees and slept for a little when he woke up it was about five oclock he began to fish back up the river towards the forest rangers house and at once he began to catch fish mostly small undersized brown trout that he tired as little as possible and put back into the river then he caught a couple of takeable fish each about a pound and a quarter and with that he gave up and took down his rod and walked back along the forest path in the gloaming when he got to the shack the two newcomers were there a heavy man of fiftyfive or sixty that was jack dorman and a younger man perhaps of fortyfive alec fisher they greeted him shortly they were not unfriendly but waiting for this new australian from the lumber camp to disclose himself before showing themselves particularly cordial they represented the permanent population of the countryside the men with an enduring stake in the land the lumbermen were here today and gone tomorrow frequently drunk and a nuisance to the station people many of them were new australians who came for their two years sentencc on arrival from europe and fled to the towns as soon as they got their release and anyway the camps themselves were transient affairs to be moved on to some other district as soon as all the ripe timber from that forest had been taken out carl zlinter raised the matter of his discovery with the forest ranger over supper i have found what seems to have been formerly a house he said in a pasture where two horses are there is a big tree and under there are bricks all in grass and very old was there a house at one time the ranger said you mean where the river makes a turn under a big granite bluff about a quarter of a mile down that is the place there is a fast dark pool too right there was a house the ranger said that was the hotel my dad kept it but that was before i was born jack dorman said your dad kept the hotel did he i never knew that one of them the ranger said there was three hotels he kept the best one the buller arms two storeys it was with bedrooms used day and night those bedrooms were from what ive heard like that was it said alec fisher my word the ranger said these gold towns were all the same booze and dancing girls and all sorts carl zlinter said was there a town then my word the ranger said again it was a big place at one time over three hundred people youll find the adit to the mine up in the trees there back of the house paddock its blocked now it only goes in a few feet the battery is still there down by the dam in that clump of peppermint gums there was houses all over in this valley flat i knew there was a town here alec fisher said what happened did the gold run out aw look the ranger said i dont think there was ever much gold there in it started when they found a trace of gold in the conglomerate the rand mine in south africa that was conglomerate so they called this one the rand and floated a company in melbourne he paused and ate a mouthful of trout they got a little gold out just enough to make it look a good bet but it never really paid it ran on for ten years and then it bust in thats right said fisher everyone was gold mad at that time my old dad the ranger said he came out from home when he was just a kid back in the eighties some time he came from a place called northallerton in england n got a job in the police well then when they found gold here he gave the police away and came and started the hotel he was a fine big chap n handy with his fists which you needed running a hotel in these parts in those days he sold out in or and went to jamieson n got married i was born in jamieson how did they get all the stuff in asked jack dorman the tracks not so good aw it was better then said slim they had a regular road up from the jig and brought it in in bullock wagons i remember the road in here when i was a boy you could have driven a car in down it easy but trees grow up pretty quick n nobody came in here when the mine shut down people all went away said fisher thats right there wouldnt have been many left here after that theres not enough flat land to make a station and its a long way from the town carl zlinter asked what happened to the houses aw look said the ranger theres been a fire through the valley twice at least in and i come here first when i was just a nipper in the first war some time i dont remember seeing any houses theres not much left of houses after a fires been through he said only just the brick chimneys and they soon fall down most of the places would have had a wooden chimney too i remember the fire here in said dorman a bit too close to home it was for my liking my word the ranger said thoughtfully a fair cow that one just after i joined the forest service that one was the house was on the other side of the river then we rebuilt it after on this side because the land was flatter n better for the paddock he turned to fisher days n days of hot sun n not a breath of wind down in the valley here it got so that you couldnt hardly breathe for the scent from the gum leaves it made your eyes smart sort of distilling out in the hot sun n no wind to carry it away and then one morning i was out in the paddock lighting my pipe although i didnt really want it for the way the air made you choke and when i lit the match the flame burned blue there wasnt any yellow in the flame just kind of blue out in the open air dead still in the middle of the paddock the men stared at him my word said dorman softly we hadnt got no radio in those days the ranger said i put that match out quick and saddled up n rode out to the jig mr considine he was superintendent then n i got on the telephone and told him that my match burned blue out in the open air n he as good as said that i was drunk and then he said the fire on buller was heading down my way n id better get anybody in the howqua out n get my own stuff out he paused well there was nobody else in that i knew about and nothing in the house i thought a lot of but my gun that i got from my dad an english gun it was a good one that some toff had give my dad a twelvebore made by a firm called cogswell and harrison well i rode back towards the howqua and when i got up on the ridge i could see the fire on buller and it was a whole lot closer now not moren seven or eight miles away i sat on the horse and thought about the air down in the valley where the match went blue it was hot as hell n not a breath of wind i didnt like to go down there a bit my word i didnt not worth it for a gun said alec fisher i tell you said the ranger i wouldnt have gone down for the gun id have given it away but id got three horses down there in the paddock n id got to get them out so down i went and by the river here the air was worse than ever sort of choking i just grabbed the gun and left everything else n let the fence rail down and drove the horses out ahead of me and up the track i never been so frightened oh my word lucky to get away with it jack dorman said too right well i got back on to the ridge in jock mcdougalls pasture with my horses and the gun and there i stayed a while i wasnt going to stay down in the valley but id a right to stay as near i could to where i ought to be so i stayed there on the ridge for a while and about three in the afternoon that fire on buller she began to jump she come down this valley in leaps about two mile each time shed be blazing way off up the valley n then thered be a sort of flash and youd see everything alight and burning two miles closer on then shed rest a while and then shed leap on another mile or two mile down the valley in a sort of flash alec fisher said in wonder the whole air was exploding thats right the ranger said the whole air was exploding thats how the old house come to be burned down after that we built this one next year carl zlinter said let me understand it was hot so hot that the sun evaporate the eucalyptus oil out of the trees and that explodes thats right said jack dorman ive heard of that happening over in east gippsland by buchan in the cave country but that is terrifying too right said the ranger it terrified me you cant do anything about a thing like that said fisher you cant stop a fire from spreading when it jumps two miles the forest ranger said folks down in the city think you can stop a forest fire by spitting on it they come along after and ask why you didnt put it out maybe you can do a bit to stop one starting like getting campers not to light a fire in january but only god can put it out when it gets hold we do not have fires like that in my country said zlinter perhaps it is too cold and too much rain we have fires sometimes but not to jump two miles which is your country asked jack dorman where do you come from from czechoslovakia the other said in pilsen i was born the names meant nothing to the australian working up at lamirra that is right i work there for two years like it i like it very much it is like czechoslovakia with the forests and the mountains i would rather be working here than in the city billy slim said you dont have gum trees in your forests over there do you no we do not have the gum tree there all is pines and larches and oak trees a few and sometimes the silver birch get much snow in winter asked the ranger oh we get much much snow three feet four feet deep from november until march it is much much colder in czechoslovakia than it is here i wouldnt want four feet the forest ranger said four inches is enough for me carl zlinter said i am from europe where villages remain for many hundred years i do not know of any village in bohemia that has vanished with no sign left as this one has the ranger said aw well theres plenty left here if you look for it only there arent no people living here any longer theres the mine adit and the battery and down the river bout a mile theres the cemetery with all the stone headstones still standing up the fire couldnt burn up those wheres that asked alec fisher you know where theres a red stone bluff on the right side going down well on past that theres a big treetrunk lying along the bank where i pulled it with three horses when it fell across the river the cemeterys in behind that on the north side many graves there aw no just a few just a few headstones thats to say might have been more one time with a wood cross perhaps there wouldnt be nothing left to show those jack dorman sat puzzled hardly hearing what was going on a vague memory of little peter loring and ann pearson stirring in his mind say he said to the czech is your name cylinder by any chance are you a doctor my name is zlinter carl zlinter said the other i am a doctor in my own country but not here in australia here l work at the timber camp thats right said dorman i heard about you one time didnt you pick up a boy that had fallen off his pony zlinter smiled he had very high temperature he said the lady was helping him when i arrived it was not that he fell off because he could not ride he was ill that little boy with a bad ear thats right you took him into hospital the czech nodded i think his mother was a stupid woman not to see that he was ill when he left from his home to go to school it could have been a serious accident but he was scratched a little only you speak pretty good english said jack dorman curiously dyou learn it since you came out here the other shook his head i learned english at school and then for nearly five years i was in germany where many people now speak english in the camps and with the officers also i have been here now for fifteen months and perhaps i have improved whats it like coming to australia from europe now it is good the czech said it is a good country plenty to eat and to drink and plenty of freedom youve not got plenty of freedom working for two years in the woods the other shrugged his shoulders i like the woods and the mountains it is not cruel to me to send me here alec fisher said lot of people coming out here to this country now my word said jack dorman my wifes got a niece an english girl arriving in about a fortnights time seems like its better out here now than it is in england an english migrant like your wifes niece asked zlinter she will not have to work for two years like a new australian the grazier shook his head i dont think so this girl shes coming out just on a visit though paying her own passage she says shes going back again in six months time it must be very expensive to do that she got a little legacy the grazier said shes spending it in coming out here for the trip to see what australias like they settled down to an evening of local gossip with the assistance of a bottle of scotch whisky produced by alec fisher they were all up soon after dawn to take advantage of the cool of the day when fish feed well they had a quick breakfast of eggs and bacon and split up for the days fishing they tossed a coin for who should go alone and alec fisher won he started off upstream carl zlinter and jack dorman went downstream having arranged to fish alternate pools leapfrogging each other they fished on downstream for an hour or so catching a few fish and exchanging a word or two when they overtook each other presently carl zlinter going on ahead came to a red stone bluff upon the right side of the river and a memory of the conversation of the night before came to his mind jack dorman was not far behind him he sat down and waited for the grazier by a little rapid when he came carl said there is the red bluff that billy spoke about somewhere here is the cemetery of the old town of howqua the australian grunted want to go and look for it it is a pity to be here and not to see it the czech said he said it was behind a treetrunk lying along the bank didnt he there is a treetrunk there perhaps that is the one they laid the rods down on a boulder by the rapid and pushed their way through the scrub that lined the river away from the water there were wattle trees in bloom among the gum trees of the forest vivid splashes of a bright mimosa colour in the dappled sunlight for a time they saw nothing of the cemetery they moved down the bank in the forest keeping near the river presently jack dorman spied a leaning headstone and they were there there was not very much to see three leaning headstones and four or five lying on their faces on the ground partly covered in creepers and trash if there had been a fence at any time it had gone the way of the houses in the forest fires if there had been wooden crosses marking graves fire and the ants had taken them jack dorman bent to read the lichened names carved on the three headstones still erect peter quillam of tralee ireland samuel tregarren of st columb cornwall he came to the third headstone and stood staring at it amazed hey zlinter he said this some relation of yours they stooped together at the stone it read here lies charlie zlinter and his dog born at pilsen bohemia died august th the czech read it carefully in silence then he looked up at the grazier smiling a little that is my name he said carl zlinter and i was born at pilsen in bohemia of all the things that have happened in my life this is the most strange five the dormans left leonora for their holiday in melbourne on new years day they drove down in the old chevrolet utility leaving mario in charge of the station and taking tim archer with them sitting all three in the front seat and with four suitcases in the truck body mario had had letters from lucia her passage was booked on the neptunia for april and he was busy with the builder working on the shack extension of the stable that they were to live in tim archer came to melbourne with them to drive the old utility back to leonora and to see his parents jack dorman had already arranged to buy another nearnew ford utility at an inflated price in melbourne and to drive it home they went with an air of festival excitement thinking back over their long married life jack and jane had been unable to remember when they had last gone away together for a real holiday there had been trips to melbourne for various business reasons always cramped and curtailed by the need for rigorous economy and by the need to get back quickly to the station certainly they had not had a genuine holiday for at least ten years now with two men to help them and with what was for them unlimited money they were able to relax and to enjoy the fruits of thirty years hard grinding work jane dorman had heard from jennifer that she was coming to australia and that she proposed to take a job at once in melbourne and would like to come out to merrijig to see them as soon as she could get a holiday jane thought this a bad idea the orion was due to dock in melbourne on january rd and they had put forward the date of their holiday to meet the ship there had been no time to write to jennifer before she sailed but jane had written to her at port said and at colombo urging her to come back with them to leonora for a short visit before taking a job in the city she was arriving at the hottest time of the year jane said and office work in melbourne might be trying till the end of february for anybody just arrived from england especially if the summer was a hot one it was hot the day that they drove down from merrijig at midday the shade temperature in the country was in the nineties before long they stopped by the roadside for jack dorman to take off his coat and undo his collar tim archer got out of the front seat and into the back with the luggage the dust swirled round him there and made sweat streaks of mud upon his temples but it was cooler so for all of them and better travelling they stopped at bonnie doon for the cold light australian beer and at buxton for lunch by four oclock they were running into melbourne perhaps the pleasantest city in the commonwealth and at fourtwenty they drew up in front of the windsor hotel tim took the utility away and the dormans went up to their bedroom a fine lofty room with plenty of cupboards and a bath after the constrictions of their rather mediocre station homestead it seemed like a palace to them the hard years fell behind them and for the moment they were young again jack said jane dont lets see anyone tonight lets just have a very very good dinner and go to a theatre any theatre dont you want to see angie angie can wait till tomorrow said her mother i want to see a theatre angles probably seen them all lets go out alone all right he said ill go down and see what we can get seats for she said and i want a bottle of champagne with dinner my word he said whatll i order for dinner mutton you dare oysters and roast duck or as near as you can get to it they went out presently and walked slowly in the heat down the treeshaded slope of collins street tacking from side to side to look at the shops jane said presently i know what i want to buy whats that a picture he stared at her what sort of picture an oil painting a very very nice oil painting what of i dont mind i just want a very nice picture you mean in a frame to hang on the wall thats right we had lots of them at home when i was a girl i didnt think anything of them then but now i want one of my own he thought about it trying to absorb this new idea to visualize what it was that she wanted i thought you might like a bracelet or a ring he said with so much money in their pockets after so long she should have something really good she squeezed his arm thats sweet of you but i dont want jewellery id never be anywhere where i could wear it no i want a picture he tried to measure her desire by yardstick any idea what itll cost i dont know till i see it she said it might cost a hundred pounds a hundred pounds he said my word well whats the ford going to cost you aw look he said thats different thats for the station no its not she said the chevll do the station work for years to come its for you to run about in and cut a dash and its costing fourteen hundred pounds its for both of us he said weakly and it comes off the tax not all of it she said if youre having your ford custom im going to have my picture he realized that she was set on having this picture it was a strange idea to him but he acquiesced theres a shop down here somewhere he said maybe thered be something there you like when they came to the shop it was closed but the windows were full of pictures religious and secular he knew better than to offer her a picture of the infant christ in her present mood although he rather admired it himself he said thats a nice one that one of the harbour the one where it says st ives it was colourful and blue with fishing vessels its not bad she said but its a reproduction i want a real picture an original he studied the harbour scene where would that be he asked is it in england thats right she said its a little place in cornwall funny the way people want to buy a picture of a place so far away he said i suppose its because so many of us come from home there was nothing in the shop window that she cared for nor did it seem to her that there was likely to be what she wanted deeper in the shop id like to go to picture galleries she said they have a lot of galleries where artists show their pictures and have them for sale could we see some of those tomorrow jack course we can he said ive got to pick up the custom in the morning but well have all day after that she smiled no we wont youll be wanting to drive round in the custom well go to the picture galleries in the morning and pick up the custom in the afternoon they went back to the hotel and rested for a time in the lounge with glasses of cold beer and dined and went out to see worms eye view and laughed themselves silly they got up late by their standards next day and early by those of the hotel and went down to their breakfast in the diningroom as country folk they were accustomed to a cooked breakfast and the hotel was accustomed to station people half a pound of steak with two fried eggs on top of it was just far enough removed from normal to provide a pleasant commencement for the day for jack jane ate more modestly three kidneys on toast and a quarter of a pound of bacon fortified for their days work they set out to look at pictures with a view to buying one the first gallery they went to was full of pictures of the central australian desert the artist had modelled his style upon that of a shortsighted and eccentric old gentleman called cezanne who had been able to draw once but had got tired of it this smoothed the path of his disciples a good deal the dormans wandered nonplussed from mountain after mountain picture glowing in rosy tints all quite flat upon the canvas with queer childish brown scrawls in the foreground that might be construed into aboriginals a few newspaper clippings pinned to the wall hailed the artist as one of the outstanding landscape painters of the century jack dorman deep in gloom at the impending waste of money said which do you like best thats a nice one over there jane said i dont like any of them i think theyre horrible thank god for that her husband replied the middleaged woman seated at the desk looked at them with stern disapproval they went out into the street its this modern stuff jane said thats not what i want at all what is it you want he asked whats it got to be like she could not explain to him exactly what she wanted because she did not know herself its got to be pretty she said and in bright colours in oils so that when its raining or snowing in the winter you can look at it and like it and its got to be like something not like those awful daubs in there the next gallery that they went into had thirtyfive oil paintings hung around the walls each picture depicted a vase of flowers standing on a polished table that reflected the flowers and a curtain draped behind thirtyfive oil paintings all carefully executed all with the same motif a few newspaper cuttings pinned up announced the artist as the outstanding flower painter of the century jane whispered do you think she can do anything else i dunno her husband said dont look like it do you like any of these some of them are quite nice jane said slowly that one over there and that but they arent what i want she paused id never be able to forget that there were thirtyfour others just like it if i bought one of these the last exhibition that they visited that morning was of paintings and sculpture by the same artist at the door a newspaper cutting informed them that the artist was a genius at the interpretation of australia the centre of the floor was occupied by a large block of polished mulga wood with a hole in it of no recognizable shape or form poised at eyelevel on a stand that you might admire it better beneath it was the title design for life like that one to take home asked jack he glanced at the catalogue its only seventyfive guineas the paintings were a little odd because this artist was a primitive unable to paint or to draw and hailed as a genius by people who ought to have known better purple houses that might have been drawn by a fiveyearold child straggled drunkenly across vermilion streets that led to nowhere and meant nothing men with green faces struggled mysteriously and perhaps discreditably with ladies who had square blue breasts thats a nice one said jack thoughtfully jane said lets get out of here people must be mad if they like things like that out in the street he said theres another gallery in bourke street up by william street or somewhere jane said i want a cup of tea they turned into a cafe over the tea she said that she was through with picture galleries i know what i want she said but its not here i want a picture that an ordinary person can enjoy not someone whos half mad ill find it some day he said tentatively there might be time to go down and pick up the ford before dinner lets do that she said take the taste of those foul paintings out of our mouths the new utility was a very lovely motorcar a low flowing darkgreen thing with more art in it than anything that they had seen that day twenty minutes before lunchtime it became their property and they got into it thrilled by the new possession and drove it very carefully and slowly to park it in the treasury gardens jack dorman locked it up whistling softly between his teeth i dont want her you can have her shes too fat for me his wife caught the air and smiled a little we must ring angie she said see her this afternoon their daughter was staying for a few days with a college friend in toorak the most fashionable suburb of the city her father said maybe we could run her out into the country somewhere she might like a drive she was in fact driving in their utility at that moment with tim archer he had picked her up in the old chevrolet that morning and was driving her southwards to bathe in port phillip bay thirty miles from the city he had collected a lunch of sandwiches and soft drinks and they had set off at about twelve oclock they were now coming to the beach that was their destination angela dorman was twenty years old she was taking social studies at melbourne university and was just about to start upon her third and last year she was a wellbuilt blonde girl superbly healthy like many australian girls a country life in her early years with an abundance of good food plenty of riding plenty of swimming and the good australian climate had made her a magnificent physical specimen she would have graced a magazine cover in any country of the world now she was going through that phase of youth that can find nothing good in its own country in australia the only places that could satisfy her were melbourne or sydney and her one ambition was to escape altogether from australia to a rosetinted and a glamorous england she had known tim archer for three years since he had come to work for her father at leonora she knew that he was devoted to her in the inarticulate dumb manner of a dog she found him slow and unenterprising without much interest in the world outside victoria a typical country boy for all her restlessness she had enough of her fathers shrewd common sense not to throw away lightly something that she might want later on she was sufficiently realist to know that she might not find so steady an affection easily again she left most of his letters unanswered but she was kind to him when they met and when he had rung her up and asked her to come swimming down past mornington she had put off another engagement to go out with him they parked the old utility beside the road took their lunch and bathing gear and walked down through the tea trees to the beach they had it practically to themselves that little beach they went back into the tea trees to change and came out in their bathers wearing dark glasses to sit and sun themselves a little before going in then they swam in the hot sunshine keeping an eye open for the possible shark although they were both strong swimmers like most australians they did not venture very far from shore sharks in port phillip bay were a rarity but then you only met one once they came out presently and sat drying in the sun on the hot sand till they began to burn then they moved into the shade of the tea trees and got out their lunch over the cigarettes he broached the subject that was foremost in his mind coming up to leonora soon he asked i suppose so she said reluctantly im going to spend a week or so in sydney with susie martin at the end of the month i suppose ill have to go home for a bit before that its nice up there now he offered cooler than the city theres nothing to do there she replied its different for you youve got a job to do when i come home theres nothing to do but help mummy with the cooking and washing up theres nobody to talk to i know he said patiently it must seem a bit slow she turned towards him dont you ever get tired of sheep seeing the same sheep every day theres the beef cattle he said slowly and quite seriously they make a bit of a change but dont you get bored up there i dunno he said theres always something that wants doing fences or rabbits or spreading the super were going to plough about eighty acres of the middle paddock in march and sow it down to ryegrass and clovers will that make it better my word he said if we did that all over we could carry twice the stock costs a lot of money though she was silent she knew that she ought to be able to take an interest in the property that had given her the university and pretty clothes and leisure she knew that the fault lay in her i cant stand the country she said quietly he knew that what she said was true and it was painful to hear her say it what are you going to do when you leave the university he asked get a job down here in the city she said i want to go to england whats the matter with australia he asked in his slow way its so small so petty and so new she said everything we think about or talk about everything thats worth while comes from england were such secondraters here i want to go home and work in london and be in the centre of things and meet some firstclass people i want to be where things really happen things that are important in the world australias all right he said weve got some pretty good people here but not like england she said its not like things are at home you dont get enough to eat in england thats all nonsense the childrens health at home is as good as it is here she paused the trouble is we eat too much here be a good thing if we all ate a bit less and sent more home whatld you do in london he asked presently td like to get a job with a hospital she said an almoner or social work of some kind with one of the big london hospitals if i could get that itld be a job worth doing down in the slums he asked with very poor people she nodded i want to get a job where one could help help people who need helping couldnt you do that in australia theres not the scope she said there arent any poor people here not like there are at home he knew that to be true and he thought it was a very good thing too many people in england he said thats the trouble do you know this girl jennifer merton that your mas come down to meet she shook her head ive never seen her nor has ma l dont think any of us know much about her she worked in london so your ma was saying she might be able to give you a few tips i want to meet her the girl said be somebody to talk to up at leonora anyway he lay propped on one elbow on the warm sand staring out at the sunlit beach and the blue sea he was trying not to keep looking at her but it was difficult to keep his eyes under control when do you suppose youll be going he asked at last about this time next year she said ive not told the parents yet but its what i want to do i think theyll let me if the wool keeps up how long do you think youll be gone for she stared down at the sand and traced a little pattern on it with one finger i dont know she said id rather work in london than work here i might never come back bit hard on your dad and ma he said i know thats what makes it difficult she paused l ought to be home by five tim she said i must see dad and ma this evening too right your dad wont worry because he was taking over the new ford today your ma will want to see you though like me to run you straight to the hotel or do you want to go back to toorak first she thought for a moment id better go back to toorak i cant go to the windsor straight from here like this ill run you back and wait while you change and take you on to the hotel will you tim thats terribly sweet of you he coloured a little and she noticed it and knew that she had been a shade too kind thats all right he said gruffly wed better get changed and get upon the road if you want to be at the hotel by five they changed back into their clothes in the tea trees and got into the utility and drove back to the city with hardly a word spoken all the way the orion docked at eight oclock next morning with jennifer on board jane dorman had written to her again at fremantle and jennifer had replied agreeing to go to leonora for a few days before she came back to the city to take a job now as the vessel docked she was uncertain if she had been wise she knew little of the dormans and nothing of australia she would have preferred to go to a hotel for a few days and find a lodging in the suburbs and settle down in her own way it was impossible to refuse the evident kindness however and it would be interesting to see a bit of the country before starting on a city job moreover it was to visit jane dorman that her grandmother had given her the money but for that she would not have been there at all when she met the dormans in the touristclass saloon in response to a loudspeaker call she was surprised in one or two respects for one thing they were far smarter than she had expected them to be jack dorman in a new grey suit heavy though he might be was better dressed than her father and jane dorman though her hands were old and worn was very smart in a new black and white coat and skirt their daughter angela was with them rather younger than jennifer but even better turned out than her parents jennifer felt pale and shabby in comparison with this glorious young woman as she came into the saloon jane dorman got up to meet her in the crowd of passengers and friends she came straight to jennifer its jennifer morton isnt it she said im jane dorman jennifer said how did you know me mrs dorman jane said youve got a look of your grandmother about you my aunt ethel i knew you right away then there were introductions and inquiries about the passage and business of the luggage the dormans had brought both utilities to the pierhead and tim archer was sitting in the chevrolet below presently jennifer was passing through the customs and then her suitcases and trunk were down in the new ford utility and she was free into australia she drove to the hotel with jack and jane dorman angela following behind in the chevrolet with tim in a blur of first impressions the width of the streets and the great number of motorcars impressed jennifer most whatever else melbourne might be it was a beautifully laidout city and obviously a very prosperous one the dormans had engaged a room for her at the windsor for a couple of nights she found herself whisked up into this and then they all had lunch together except for tim archer who had started back for merrijig in the old utility jennifer decided that it was easier to submit until the hospitality of these kind strangers had exhausted its first impetus she felt that it would be rude and ungenerous to battle against it now angela disappeared after lunch upon her own affairs and jane and jack dorman took jennifer out to the new ford utility they all sat together in the wide seat and started out on a long drive up into the dandenong mountains clothed in trees finer and taller than any that jennifer had seen in england at the outset she protested diffidently at the waste of their time in making this outing for her but she was quickly told about the newness of the car and made to realize that her host would certainly have done that anyway that afternoon for his own pleasure indeed the fun that jack dorman was getting out of his new possession was so evident that jennifer relaxed content to enjoy herself by the time they got back to melbourne she was dazed with new impressions by common consent they spent the evening quietly in the hotel jennifer was tired and at leonora the dormans were in the habit of getting up at six in the morning and going to bed soon after nine each night so for a while after dinner jennifer sat talking quietly with jane dorman in a corner of the lounge of the hotel while jack smoked a cigar and read the herald the girl said presently id like to take a little time tomorrow looking for a room or a small flat to live in here its terribly nice of you to ask me up to leonora and id love to go back with you for a week but after that ill have to come back here and take a job i thought id better see about that tomorrow jane said i know just how you feel well get you fixed up with somewhere nice to live before we go back home i dont think you ought to be in too much of a hurry to start work though the temperature was over a hundred the day before yesterday in the city here its the worst time of the year for anybody coming out from england and youre bound to feel it more than we do youd be much more comfortable if you stay with us at leonora for a month and start work in the autumn its much cooler out there the girl said awkwardly i think i ought to start earning something sooner than that even if it is a bit hot the austerities of england were still strong in her to relax and rest was somehow vaguely disgraceful im living on your money as it is she said the older woman said evenly youre doing nothing of the sort my dear when we sent that money to aunt ethel we gave it to her that was the end of it so far as we were concerned the girl said im sorry i oughtnt to have said that but i would rather start earning my own living fairly soon i dont want you to think im ungrateful when youve been so very kind but ive got to paddle my own canoe some time and the sooner i start the better i know said jane so long as you know that we should love to have you for as long as you can stay with us none of our children are home now angie will be coming up at the end of the week but she wont stay longer than ten days its dull for young people up at merrijig of course nothing ever happens there i think id find it rather interesting said jennifer if i stayed up there too long with you i might not want to come back to the city at all jane glanced at her curiously have you ever lived in the country at home the girl laughed no she said frankly ive always lived in towns in leicester and then in london i dont really know what living in the countrys like i suppose thats why im interested in it it can be very dull in the country jane said long periods of doing nothing but the daily work a woman has to do cooking and washing and cleaning the house no one but your husband and the men to talk to and only the radio to listen to but i dont know i wouldnt like to live anywhere else jennifer thought about this for a minute then she asked how many sheep have you got jane looked up in surprise i dont quite know about three thousand i think jack how many sheep are there on leonora he looked up from his paper three thousand five hundred and sixty unless someones been along and pinched some of em then theres the beef cattle jane dorrnan said about two hundred herefords two hundred and six said mr dormari and returned to his paper i suppose you sell a lot of them for meat said jennifer sell about six or seven hundred fat lambs every year jane replied and a good few ewes but most of the money comes from the wool clip of course i wasnt thinking so much about the money the girl replied it must be rather fun raising so much food fun dont you feel pleased at being able to turn out such a lot of meat jane smiled i never thought about it send them to market and thats the end so far as were concerned except to bank the cheque when it comes in it seems such a good thing to be doing said the girl jane dorman glanced at her curiously it was the first time that she had heard it suggested that there was any ethical value in the work that she and jack had spent their lives in in the early years they had been looked down upon as country hicks unable to make a living in the city and so compelled to live upon the land in those hard days between the wars when wool was one and six a pound nobody had cared whether they lived or starved in recent years with wool ten times the price they had been abused as profiteers in neither time had anyone suggested in her hearing that their work had any social value jennifer she thought came to australia with a fresh outlook it would be interesting to find out what it was she asked how are things at home now in regard to food whats it really like for ordinary people jennifer said its quite all right theres really heaps of food of course its not like it is here or on the ship but theres heaps to eat in england not meat is there no meat is a bit scarce when you say scarce jennie what does that mean one hears such different stories one day you see a picture of a weeks ration of meat in england about the size of a matchbox and then someone like you comes along and says its quite all right can you get a steak oh no not what youd call a steak what about restaurants you cant go in and order a grilled steak the girl shook her head i dont think so you might at the dorchester or some hotel like that that ordinary people cant afford to go to id never tasted a grilled steak till i got on the ship never tasted a grilled steak no even if you could get the steak i dont think youd cook it that way because of wasting the fat jane asked but what do you cook when you go out on a picnic the question rather stumped the english girl i dont know she said and laughed not that anyway you eat a lot of fish dont you jennifer nodded a lot do you get much fish here not much fresh fish i dont think weve got the fishing fleets that youve got at home we get a lot of kippers and things like that like the english kippers herrings they are the english kippers jane said scotch rather they all seem to come from aberdeen do you get those out here why yes you can buy kippers all over australia theyre getting very scarce at home the girl said i remember when i was a schoolgirl in the war the kippers were awfully good but its very difficult to get a kipper now at home funny jane said weve had lots of them out here for the last two or three years it always makes me feel very near home when we have kippers for breakfast the girl asked have you ever been home since you came out here jane shook her head jack suggested we should go home on a trip a few months ago she said but i dont know all the people that id want to see are dead or gone away its over thirty years since i left home and everything seems to have changed so much i dont know that id want to see it now our old house is a school it used to be so lovely i dont want to see it as a school thats what everybody says the girl replied that england used to be so much nicer of course i only know it as it is now old people have always talked like that i suppose said jane and yet i think theres something in it this time there was a silence and then jennifer said have you been doing a lot of shopping since you came down here oh my dear do you know anything about pictures jennifer knew absolutely nothing about pictures but she listened with interest to the results of the picture hunt to date she went to bed early with the dormans thinking that these were simple and unaffected people that she was beginning to like rather well she went shopping with them next day feeling rather shabby as she walked with them on a round of the best shops jane wanted to buy a wristwatch for jack dorman to commemorate their holiday and they all went into a shop that jennifer alone would never have dreamed of entering and looked at watches finally jane bought a gold selfwinding wristwatch for her husband for ninetytwo guineas and never turned a hair clothes did not appear to appeal to jane very much i so seldom go anywhere jenny but shoes were another matter and she bought thirtyeight pounds worth in half an hour jack left them while this was going on and they went on to myers and bought a new refrigerator for a hundred and twenty pounds and a mass of miscellaneous kitchen gadgets and equipment for fiftythree pounds eighteen shillings and sixpence we get down to melbourne so seldom jane said happily jennifer wandered after her relation in a daze she had never spent a morning like that before jack caught up with them as they were having morning coffee and said that hed sometimes thought that jane should have a car of her own and not use the station utilities and hed found a morris minor that had only done a thousand miles and was a bargain at a hundred quid above list price and would jane like to come and look at it they went and looked at it and bought it and then they had lunch and started on the curtain materials and carpets the homestead is so shabby jane remarked i dont know what youll think of it coming from england i must brighten it up a little by teatime they were all dead tired and they had spent about thirteen hundred and sixty pounds jennifer felt with all her instincts that the dormans must be crazy and then she reminded herself of the letter to aunt ethel and the statement that the wool cheque had been twentytwo thousand pounds and thought perhaps that goingson like this were normal to australia after all australia was on the other side of the world and so all australians and she herself must now be walking upside down relative to england so it was reasonable that all their standards should be upside down as well we dont always go on like this said jane in fact i dont think weve ever done it before later that evening she showed jennifer a gold and blue enamel dressingtable set that jack had bought for her all by himself and had presented to her rather sheepishly jennifer felt that surely there must be something wrong in spending so much money her upbringing in the austerities of england insisted that this must be so the queer thing was that here it all seemed natural and right the dormans had worked for thirty years without much recompense and now had won through to their reward in spite of the violation of all her traditions jennifer was pleased for them and pleased with a country that allowed rewards like that she had been brought up in the belief that money spent by the rich came out of the pockets of the poor and she had never seriously questioned that but in australia it seemed there were very few poor people if any in her two days in the country she had seen great placards at the railway stations appealing for boys of nineteen to work as railway porters at twelve pounds a week and she had seen sufficient of the prices in the cheaper shops to realize that such boys would be much better off than she had been when working for the ministry of pensions in england it was all very difficult and very puzzling and she fell asleep that night with a queer feeling of guilty enjoyment in australia they took things a little more easily next day and bought nothing but an english grandfather clock for a hundred and eighty guineas because it was just like one that jane remembered in her english home thirty years before they took delivery of the little morris before lunch and jane drove it to toorak to show it to angela and after lunch they all drove out in the two cars jane driving the morris with angela beside her and jack dorman following with jennifer in the new ford utility to pick up the pieces if jane hit anything they followed the shore of port phillip bay in the hot sunshine nearly to mornington and had tea in a cafe a devonshire tea with splits and jam and a great bowl of clotted cream with a yellow crust they were back in the city in time for drinks before dinner and then to the theatre to see sonia dresdel in a message for margaret next morning jane and jennifer went out early in the little car to look for a boardinghouse and found one that they had had recommended in a suburb called st kilda not far from the sea and about twenty minutes from the centre of the city in the tram there was no room vacant for three weeks which jane dorman considered to be a very good thing jennifer liked the look of the woman who kept it and bowed to the inevitable and paid a deposit and engaged the room jane and jennifer drove back to the city and had their hair set rather expensively ill have to watch out how i spend my money the girl said a little ruefully youre getting me into bad habits we dont go on like this at home said jane i think we must be a bit touched the amount of money that weve spent in these few days weve never done it before do your father and mother ever go mad like this jennifer shook her head thinking of the hard economies her parents had to make i dont think you could do it in england even if you had the money she said there wouldnt be the things to buy not the cars anyway they went to the pictures that night and saw gary cooper next day they left for leonora by a lastminute decision angela came with them the virtues of a utility became clear then to jennifer because jack dorman went out in the morning and loaded up the refrigerator and the grandfather clock and about a hundredweight of kitchen gear and came back and took on board five suitcases and jennifers trunk at about eleven oclock they were ready to start jane dorman was not a fast driver and the morris was new to her it was evening when they came to leonora after a slow drive through magnificent mountain and pastoral country jennifer learned a good deal of victoria as they drove she was amazed at the brilliance of the birds the robin was more brightly coloured than a bird had any right to be and the red and blue parrots in the woods amazed her here birds apparently had few enemies and so no need of a protective colouring and freed from that restraint they had let themselves go only the lyre bird a sombre being with a long tail like a peacock appeared to exercise a british discretion in colours the rest of them thought jennifer were frankly gaudy they saw wallabies at one point hopping across a paddock at a distance from the road and at another place a black and silver animal about the size of a large cat with a bushy tail like a silver fox fur ran across the road in front of them she learned that this was a possum she saw a good many rabbits exactly like the english rabbit and was told about their depredations and the methods that were used to keep their numbers down the style of the small towns and villages through which they passed reminded her of movie pictures of the middle west of the united states the same wooden houses with wide verandas and tin roofs the same wide streets at one time cattle tracks it was a gracious pleasant country that they passed through on that drive the grass becoming yellow in the midsummer sun but a wellwatered and a friendly country all the same in the evening they came to leonora homestead on the slopes of the buller range above the bridge and school and hotel that was merrijig jennifer was driving with jane dorman for the last part of the journey she closed the last paddock gate and got back into the car and jane drove into the yard behind the homestead where the new ford was already parked with mario and tim admiring it they got out of the morris and stretched after the long journey well this is it said jane is it like what you thought it was going to be jennifer looked around her all the buildings were severely practical the walls of whitepainted weatherboard the roofs of corrugated iron painted with red oxide there were numbers of great corrugated iron water tanks cylindrical in form disposed to catch the rain that fell upon the roofs and there was another such tank high up on a wooden stand from which the house was supplied the house itself had deep verandas on two sides and flywire doors and screens on all the windows standing in the yard she had a wide view out over the basin of the delatite pastures and occasional woods and behind that again the sun was setting behind a wooded mountain it was very quiet and secure and peaceful in the evening light i think its simply lovely said the girl from london i dont think ive ever been in such a beautiful place they turned to the homestead and started on the business of getting themselves and the luggage indoors and the refrigerator and the grandfather clock and began the business of preparing supper mario had killed a sheep and butchered it and there was cold roast mutton in the larder salad and tinned peaches with cream and plum cake completed the impromptu meal which they ate in the big kitchen that was the central room of the homestead leonora homestead had several bedrooms but with tim archer and mario both living in angela dorman and jennifer shared a room jennifer soon found that angela was frankly curious about england the barrage of questions began as soon as they retired have you ever seen westminster abbey angela asked jennifer was taken by surprise why yes its very beautiful isnt it the girl from london had to think a bit its all right she said at last i dont know that i ever noticed it particularly its where they have the coronation isnt it where the king and queen get crowned jennifer wasnt quite sure if the coronation took place there or at st pauls neither of them meant a great deal in her life i think it is she said and laughed you know it must sound awfully silly but im not quite sure im sure its westminster abbey said the australian girl i was reading a book about the coronation of the king and queen in it had a lot of pictures taken in the abbey it must be marvellous to see a thing like that i should think it would be jennifer agreed i havent seen it of course i was a kid at school in leicester i remember that we got a whole holiday we got a holiday here of course said angela i was only little but i remember banbury was all decorated with flags and bunting everywhere jennifer tried to visualize the little country town that they had passed through all decorated and rejoicing over an event that happened twelve thousand miles away and failed really why of course and then when the film came to the picture house daddy and mummy took me to it it was the first film i ever saw i think i was about five it came back during the war and i saw it again then ive seen it three times altogether i remember it was a good film said jennifer i saw it in england she reflected as she brushed her hair that angela dorman then a little country schoolgirl at merrijig probably knew a good deal more about the coronation ceremonies and westminster abbey than she did have you ever seen the king and queen asked angela jennifer tried to remember if she had or not surely she must have seen them some time other than at the cinema surely she must have in any case she couldnt possibly say she hadnt recollection came to her just in time and saved her from having to tell a lie i saw them in the procession when princess elizabeth got married she said i was standing in the mall they passed quite close how marvellous the mall thats the avenue between buckingham palace and the admiralty arch isnt it thats right it was incredible how much angela knew about london did you see princess elizabeth too jennifer nodded and the duke of edinburgh yes ive seen them several times tell me do they look like their pictures yes i think so as much as anyone looks like their picture they look very good sorts it must be wonderful to see them close to like that angela said i suppose youve seen everything there is to see in london i dont know about that said jennifer i lived in london for two years but i was outside in one of the suburbs at a place called blackheath i worked in an office there i didnt see an awful lot of london really im going to london next year if the wool holds up said angela i want to get a job in one of the big hospitals have you ever seen winston churchill im not sure said jennifer ive seen him on the pictures so many times one gets muddled up she searched for a palliative for her disgrace ive seen bob hope have you really have you seen any other film stars one or two i saw dennis price once at a dance you are lucky have you seen ingrid bergman i think shes beaut it went on and on long after they were both in bed and growing sleepy to angela the english girl was a visitor from another planet a beautiful rosecoloured place where everything that happened was important to the world i should think youll find it awfully dull in melbourne after living in london she said once nothing interesting ever happens here jennifer could have answered that nothing interesting ever happened in blackheath but she forbore to she had not known angela for long enough to damp such a guileless enthusiasm for england and everything english she herself so far had found australia far more interesting than england she liked the prosperous dignity of melbourne better than the shabby austerity of london she was deeply and inarticulately pleased with the good country she had seen that day with the brilliant birds and the novel beasts that roamed the woods and pastures where there were so few people to disturb them she could do without the sight and the propinquity of famous or of interesting people in return for these good things for a time anyway she slept well and woke with the first light of dawn to the sound of people moving about in the homestead she looked at her watch and found that it was halfpast five outside was sunshine and a mans step in the yard she rolled sleepily out of bed and sat on the edge angela opened an eye and said whats the time halfpast five we dont get up till eight i never do people seem to be moving about its only mummy she gets up in the middle of the night all the year round angela rolled over firmly and went to sleep again jennifer got up and dressed in jumper and slacks and found jane dorman drinking a cup of tea at the table in the kitchen the fire was already lit in the new stove she poured jennifer a cup you didnt have to get up she said angela isnt is she i thought not i often get a bit of cooking done before breakfast in the hot weather its better than having the stove going in the middle of the day jennifer went out presently into the yard in the fresh morning and found tim archer lifting a couple of dogs into the back of the old chevrolet utility they were nondescript dogs one a sort of mongrel collie and the other a blue roan a kind of dog that jennifer had never seen before she asked tim what it was and he said it was a heeler but when she pressed him to say if that was a breed or not he could not tell her it was a heeler because it went for the heels of the cattle and not their heads apparently do you use them for the sheep as well she asked my word he said im going down to get the mob out of the river paddock n put them down the road want to come along she got into the utility with him and they started off acrosscountry in it driving over the short pastures they went about a mile passing through three gates and drove round behind the sheep here tim stopped the utility and put the dogs out he shouted a few orders to the dogs and got one out on one flank and one the other and got the sheep moving seven or eight hundred of them in the direction of the gate they got back into the utility and drove about the paddock for a time rounding up the stragglers with the dogs then when the mob was compact in one bunch they drove along behind them in the centre one dog at each side they went very slowly at the walking pace of a sheep jennifer stretched in the warm sun i suppose this is the modern way of herding sheep she said by motorcar too right he said its a sight quicker and easier than messing about with a horse the boss he likes a horse and hed ride if he was on this job but to my way of thinking by the time youve caught the horse and saddled up you could have done the job in a utility he turned to her dont they use utilities in the paddocks in england she was nonplussed i dont think so she said they dont have utilities at all most of the farms in england are quite small much smaller than these its all different here i know he said the properties are bigger here but youve got better land or else perhaps you improve it more than we do how do you like it here after england i like it so far she said its a very very pretty bit of country this he stared at her in surprise prettier than england its different she said youd have to go a long way to find such unspoilt country in england england might have been like this once he digested this in silence for a time then he said angie doesnt like it here she wants to go to england i know she was telling me last night do you think shell like it there shell like it all right said jennifer shes determined to shes expecting an awful lot and shell have some disappointments i should think but yes shell like it they drove on for a time in silence while he digested this unpalatable opinion the sheep baaed and scuffled in front of them the dogs whimpering on either side what i cant make out he said at last is why anybody leaves england if its such a bonza place as that is it because they dont get enough to eat i dont think its that said jennifer england can be difficult at times she paused i think angie may find that when the glamour wears off i shouldnt think shed want to spend her life in england after living here you think shell come back here he asked quickly she laughed i dont know she might marry somebody in england and settle down there too right he said quietly she might do that it seemed to be a difficult conversation and jennifer changed it and asked him what sort of sheep they were he told her that they were corriedales and described to her the points that made them so from that they passed to discussing the hereford cattle in an adjacent paddock and the difference between those and shorthorns i wish i knew more about all this she said presently about the land and how to make it grow more grass thats important isnt it he said well stands to reason if you grow more grass you can feed more beasts theres a lot to be done in this part of the country to improve the pastures arent people doing all they can aw look he protested it costs money you know mr dorman hes ploughing up eighty acres of the river paddocks weve just come from this autumn and sowing it down to clovers and ryegrass hell have to spend three hundred pounds on seed alone let alone the labour and the tractor and that and then the paddock will be out of grazing for six months id like to see him doing a lot more than that but its a big thing to close a paddock for six months with wool the price it is i see youd get more meat and wool later on but not this year youd get less thats right and next year the prices might not be so good the time to close the paddocks for reseeding is when prices are low and then you generally cant afford to do it its terribly important to turn out more meat said jennifer i should have thought people would have taken a chance its just a matter of pounds shillings and pence he said its a good thing to do as well she retorted that ought to count for something he stared at her how do you mean the foods so badly needed she said its important to turn out as much as possible isnt it well i dunno all his life tim archer had lived in communities that had a surfeit of food it was a condition of his employment on a sheep station in victoria that he should be entitled to buy as much mutton as he wanted at threepence a pound and this for a family meant half a sheep a week it was hard for him to realize what this english girl was getting at we dont need any more food here he said you mean because of people at home she nodded itld make a difference at home if people could live like you live here it isnt till one comes away that one realizes how bad things have got in england if anybody here wants to do something for england they can just set to and grow a bit more food i wish youd tell angie that he said with a faint smile he could not keep from talking about angie to this girl every topic seemed to work round to her in the end shes wanting to do something for england by going home to take a job in a london hospital she wants to see england jennifer said thats what she wants to go for shed do a better job for england by staying here at home on leonora and driving the tractor to help make more food well you just tell her that he was grinning now i dont mind but it wont cut any ice she wants to see england but its true all the same if there was a bit more food we mightnt want so many hospitals jennifer spent the morning in housework with jane angela did a little bit about the house and then borrowed her mothers morris and disappeared for the day to look up old school friends in the district and to bring back a few vegetables and stores from banbury jennifer refused an invitation to go with her preferring on this first day to stay around the homestead and help jane to get the lunch it was hot in the kitchen and they let the wood stove out at about ten oclock and served a cold saddle of lamb for dinner with a great dish of potatoes cooked upon a primus and a cold jam tart they sat out after washingup in deckchairs on the veranda jack and the two men were away in one of the paddocks cutting up a dead tree for firewood there was a little breeze from off the mountain cool and refreshing they sat drowsing and gossiping looking out over the wide valley in the blazing sunshine presently jane said tell me about aunt ethel what did she die of i didnt gather that from your letters it was an awkward question and one that jennifer was not prepared to answer directly ealing and the surburban house in the dark november rain seemed very far away she was an old dear she said at last but in some ways she was rather stupid she ran out of money and she wouldnt tell anybody about it you see her pension came to an end she explained the matter of the pension to jane she had another old lady living with her jennifer explained a mrs harding widow of an army officer is that the one she called aggie who died thats right said jennifer aggie died last may and that probably made things difficult because of course they shared expenses my mother wrote and asked her but she said that shed be quite all right well she wasnt all right at all it was about that time her pension came to an end but she never told anybody about that she hadnt got anything to live on then so she began selling things furniture that she hadnt any use for and little bits of jewellery my dear we didnt know a thing about it the girl said i went and saw her one sunday only a month before she died and she gave me a marvellous lunch roast duck with all the trimmings and a mince pie made out of some of the dried fruit parcels that you sent her it was incredible sitting here on the veranda in the warm breeze that those cartons had come from here she had buttered scones for tea and a great big cake she never let on for a moment that there was anything wrong and all the time she was well starving thats what it amounted to when she got ill it came out that she hadnt eaten anything for days except a few of your dried fruits my dear i am so very very sorry i know the girl said she was very proud and she wouldnt tell a soul she neednt have let things get to such a pitch if she didnt want to tell us she could have got help from the town hall theres an official called the relieving officer whos there to deal with cases like that and help with money she could have gone to him but she wouldnt do that she didnt want to take charity i suppose the girl said i think that was it shed have thought that was an awful thing to do i cant imagine aunt ethel ever taking charity she she was different i dont think it a very good thing to be different in england jennifer said its better if you go along like everybody else they talked about the details of what had happened in ealing for a time presently jane asked tell me jenny is this sort of thing common now do old people people of aunt ethels sort do many of them die in poverty the girl said cautiously i think a good many of them have a pretty bad time its difficult to tell because one doesnt hear a lot about them old ladies who die quietly and make no fuss dont get into the newspapers granny didnt have to die like that she was too proud to let anyone know that she was hard up she could have died like that anywhere it wasnt anything to do with england it could have happened in australia it could but it doesnt said jane why not i think this countrys too prosperous for that to happen an old lady who was as oldfashioned and as proud as that would almost certainly have some relation some son or grandson or nephew who was making a whole heap of money to whom the little assistance that shed need would be a fleabite it could happen here as you say but i cant imagine it doing so she had some odd ideas jennifer said presently it all happened within twentyfour hours of her death so i suppose she would be a bit funny what sort of ideas the girl said she was thinking of the time when she was young and how easy and how prosperous everything was then in england she kept talking about that saying what a much better time shed had when she was a girl than i was having i let her talk of course one couldnt argue she sat staring out across the sunlit valley to the blue hills and then your letter came with the five hundred pounds and you said that you were sending it because the wool cheque had been twentytwo thousand i suppose you said that to make it easy for her to accept jane said i thought it was best to tell her shed known that we were hard up for so many years i thought that was it i think she thought a lot about your wool cheque although she didnt say she was lying there so still i think she got to feeling that if you had twentytwo thousand a year youd be living in the way that she lived in when she was young a great big house with three servants and a butler and grooms and hunters and being presented at court all that sort of thing i think she thought that if i came out here to see you id be getting back into the world she knew when she was young poor old dear jane said softly you mean she was a bit confused i think she was said jennifer i dont think she could realize that all that sort of thing has gone for ever i wonder if it has said jane jennifer turned and stared at her people dont live like that out here do they there was a short silence no jane said slowly only a very very few big station owners in the western district they have big homes and play a lot of polo and they hunt and give dances and get presented to the governorgeneral they do live rather in the way aunt ethel lived when she was young but there arent very many of them ninetyfive per cent of graziers are people like ourselves people whove always been hard up until the last few years since the beginning of the war the price we get for meat and wool has gone up steadily and now weve got so much money that we dont know what to do with it so far weve all been paying off our debts and mortgages what happens next is anybodys guess jennifer asked but will these high prices go on i dont know said jane wed still be well off if they fell to half what they are now theyre bound to fall arent they wools bound to fall she said wool will go down when the rearmament stops but meat has been going up steadily for years the world seems to want more and more food and each year more and more gets eaten in australia as our population rises and so theres less each year to export its the same in the argentine and everywhere that seems to mean higher and higher prices for meat she laid her darning in the basket and got out her cigarettecase and gave jennifer one they sat smoking in silence for a little i dont know whats going to be the end of it she said this property would fetch about ninety thousand pounds at presentday prices and its all free of debt thats heaps to leave the children when we die we want them to work not live on money that we leave them we want to go on working here ourselves its what we like doing and these enormous sums of money keep coming in i dont know what well do with it im sure make a trip home suggested jennifer weve thought of that said jane i dont know that i really want to go to england now i dont think id know anybody there at all jack sometimes says hed like to make a trip to europe and go to gallipoli but he doesnt really want to i dont think she sat smoking in silence for a minute if angie goes next year we might go home the year after to see her but that wouldnt take much money not compared with what were making jennifer smiled youll have to buy another grandfather clock jane laughed i know it was stupid jenny but i did like buying it made in chester in before this country was even explored its a lovely thing to have she spoke more seriously no if things go on like this some day id like to rebuild the homestead rebuild this house jane shook her head id like to build another house down by the river and turn this over to a foreman ill show you where i want to have it a new brick house designed by a good architect rather like an english house but single storey a house with english trees and an english lawn and a garden all around it like we used to have at home leave the stables and the stockyards all up here and let the men have their meals up here with the foremans family i want a gracious sort of house where jack and i can slack off as we get older and not have to cook for the men a house where one can have good furniture and good pictures and good china and glass like we used to have at home when i was a girl an english country house said jennifer thoughtfully like that in a way but adapted to the country and the station she paused i believe a good many peoplell start doing that if the money goes on like this so youll get a lot of english country houses here we might said jane after all the english country houses came when agriculture was doing well and agricultures doing well here now we all came out from england and weve got the english way of doing things i dont see why we shouldnt have the same sort of houses adapted to the times and to the labour shortage cut out the butler jennifer suggested jane smiled and the second parlourmaid itll be different of course more cars and travel and no servants but it might be something just as good you mean theres something in what granny was trying to say there might well be old people have a knack of being right sometimes jennifer settled down at leonora very happily in recent years she had worked in an office first in leicester and then in london and working so she had done little serious cooking or housework it was no burden to her to take some of the cooking and cleaning off jane for a few days she rather enjoyed it having nothing else to do and as a means of learning new techniques she went out in the paddocks and the stockyards with jack dorman and the men whenever she got asked and she found the management and care of stock and pastures interesting after her office life she found a very great deal to occupy her at leonora she would have found it even pleasanter if the weather had been cooler and she came to realize the value of janes insistence that she should avoid the city at the height of the hot weather till she was acclimatized it was an exceptionally hot january each day the sun rose in a cloudless sky at dawn and set in a cloudless evening sky at dusk each night angela and jennifer lay with few coverings in the somewhat stuffy little bedroom of the homestead unable to sleep till midnight for the heat each day thin wreaths of smoke behind the mountains told of forest fires in the high country to the south of them each day jack dorman listened to the wireless weather forecasts worried for some news of rain dont like the look of it at all he said more than once its a fair cow he was too worried and preoccupied for jennifer to bother him with questions and angela knew little about the station and cared less she asked tim archer to tell her what the trouble was and he said that the boss was worried over the condition of the top paddock bordering on the forest the spring up there which usually ran all through the summer had dried up some weeks before and the paddock had got very dry on account of the lack of water they had moved the stock out the paddock in consequence had been little grazed for some time and the grass was far too long for safety if a fire should run through the forest to the leonora boundary it would sweep across that paddock in a flash the homestead would probably be safe enough but fences would be destroyed the dry wood of the posts would burn like tinder the trouble is with these darn fires you dont know where theyll stop said tim you cant do much about it either it was on one of these cloudless days that jane went into town with angela in the morris to make a break for her jennifer had volunteered to get the dinner so that jane could dine at the hotel with angela she served the inevitable hot roast mutton with potatoes and vegetables competently though she was dripping with sweat tim and mario finished the meal and helped her with the washingup then they went out to their work and jack dorman stood with her on the veranda looking at the wreaths of smoke rising almost straight up into the sky behind buller he said anxiously i believe thats nearer think ill run up the road a bit in the ford n see if i can find out where shes burning like to come she got into the car with him and they started up the road towards the mountain they passed the merrijig hotel and went on towards lamirra and the timber camps at lamirra jack dorman stopped the car and went with jennifer into the store kept by an english couple who had recently come out from portsmouth but they knew little of the local conditions and were ignorant about the fires they did not think that they were very near run up the road a bit to where theyre cutting jack said when they got outside well get a view over the ridge up there and see for ourselves they drove on up a broad smooth wellengineered road winding up the mountainside he told her that this was a timber road made for the passage of the timber lorries getting the wood out it was designed eventually for use as a main highway they went on winding up the hillside and it was cool in the forest the great trees met high over their heads and practically the whole road was in shade from time to time they passed a trailer truck loaded with treetrunks coming down sighing with air brakes from time to time they passed a track leading off into the forest on one side or the other and saw groups of men handling the fallen timber who paused in their work to stare curiously at the new utility they stopped to ask the ganger of a group of roadmakers what the fire position was he was reassuring he said that it had not crossed the king river and he did not think it would the forest fire patrol were there and they had cleared a fire break three miles long to save the forest timber jennifer sat in the car while the men gossiped understanding only about half or what they said the names of mountains rivers people and official bodies meant nothing to her and she did not fully understand what it was all about it was lovely sitting there in the car they were at an altitude of about four thousand feet and in the speckled shade of the forest for the first time that day she was cool and dry from sweat she stretched luxuriously in her clothes it was quiet in the forest or it would have been but for the distant and rhythmic rumbling of a bulldozer at work she sat listening to the bulldozer as the men talked the noises repeated in a regular cycle a roaring acceleration of the motor followed by a few seconds of steady running then a period of idling and then a few seconds of light running as the thing reversed another idling period and the cycle began again it varied very little she sat listening to it dreamily half asleep in the coolness of the forest the cycle was disturbed and woke her from her doze a rumbling of heavy timber broke in and the roaring of the engine mounted suddenly to a climax and then stopped dead there was a noise of tumbling machinery and a continued rumbling of rolling logs a few men shouted in the distance their voices puny and lost among the greater noises then everything was quiet again the men broke off their discussion of the fire and looked in the direction of the row whats going on down there asked jack bulldozer at work shifting logs the ganger said sounds like hes got into trouble those bloody things are always getting into trouble we had one bogged up to the seat last winter took a winch and a days work to pull him out they went on with their talk down in the forest everything was quiet presently the ganger went on and jack dorman let the clutch in and the car moved on uphill sounds a bit better he said to the girl beside him well go up to the top of the road and have a look he says we can see the fire from there a quarter of a mile farther on a track led down the hill to the right as they approached they saw a man running up this track towards the road a man in lumber jacket and dirty canvas trousers a rough man running clumsily uphill half foundered he waved at the car when he saw it they stopped and waited for him to come up to them aw look he panted give us a run down the road to lamirra theres been an accident in there and two blokes got hurt bad i got to telephone the doctor and the ambulance at banbury n find a bloke called splinter six jennifer opened the door of the utility and slid across the seat towards jack dorman the man tumbled in beside her and slammed the door he was panting and streaming sweat jack dorman began to turn the car its a proper muckup the man said urgently i got to get splinter quick the car swung round and headed down the road where dyou want to go you know the office building other side the bridge theyll telephone the ambulance from there maybe theyll know where splinters working where it says the name of the company on a big board thats right theyll telephone from there and then ill have to find splinter they did not speak again jack dorman devoted his attention to the road as they went flying round the curves down into the valley once as they swung violently round a corner with a scream of tyres the man was flung heavily against jennifer he wrenched himself off her and said sorry lady thats all right she said who is this man youve got to find who splinter hes the doctor here jack dorman eyes glued to the road said is that the chap that goes fishing at the weekends thats right the man said hes just one of these dps working in the timber with the rest of us hes a doctor in his own country like hes not allowed to be a doctor here they came to the office building at the bottom of the stream a small weatherboard shack of three rooms the man flung himself from the car ill wait here a bit jack dorman called after him case you want to go back they sat in the car for a few minutes waiting where is the nearest proper doctor the girl asked banbury he said theres a hospital there with an ambulance and theres a doctor dr jennings how far is that from here about seventeen miles she was a little shocked accustomed as she was to city life it was difficult to realize that there could be no doctor close at hand how long will it take him to get here he hesitated that depends if hes in banbury and hes free he might be out here in an hour but i believe this is his woods point day whats that he goes to woods point once a week he said they havent got a doctor there i think this is the day he goes there tuesday im pretty sure it is how far is that from banbury about forty miles she said you mean it could be hours before he could get here too right but what happens in a case like this just got to do the best you can he said most doctoring for accidents is common sense they sat together in the car waiting then the man that they had brought down from the woods came to the door of the office with the manager a man called forrest jack dorman knew him slightly as an acquaintance in various local bars eh jim he said got a bit of trouble jim forrest glanced at him in recognition and then at the new custom utility he crossed the road to dorman aw look jack he said are you busy not particularly joe here he says theres two men got hurt bad up where you picked him up upon the road theyll have to be fetched down and taken into hospital unless we can get the ambulance to come out for them could you stand by a few minutes while we get through to banbury if weve got to send them in theyll travel easier in this utility than in one of my trucks do anything i can ill run them into banbury if you want it thanks a lot ive got the call in now say while youre waiting could you run joe up to camp four fetch a man called zlinter i know him thats the chap that fishes thats right hes a dp doctor been working here for quite a while i got him on the telephone and hes gone down to his camp by truck pick up his stuff id appreciate it if youd slip down there n pick him up joe can show you by the time youve got back here ill have spoken to banbury the utility went sliding off with joe in it again a mile down the road it turned into the camp and ran between the rows of hutments under the gum trees and stopped outside the fourth on the right joe got out and called to a man at the door hey he said seen splinter anywhere about the man said hes inside joe vanished into the hut and jack dorman got out of the utility with jennifer together they unfastened the black twill cover of the trucklike body joe came out carrying in his arms a very large firstaid box put it in the back said dorman a tall dark man came to the door of the hut and glanced at the utility and then at dorman recognition came to him so he said we have already met upon the howqua it is your car this thats right carl zlinter paused in thought i have much to take he said it will be all right to drive this car into the woods up to the accident i should think so the grounds pretty hard i will take everything then hi the car he went back into the hut and reappeared with joe carrying five cartons roughly packed with packages of cottonwool dressings splints bandages bottles of antiseptic these with a worn leather case completed his equipment it only took three or four minutes now we are ready to go he said joe got up into the back with the stores and zlinter got into the front of the utility with jennifer and dorman it is better to bring everything he said much will be not needed but for the one thing left behind it is better to take everything dorman said go back first to the office i think so perhaps the ambulance and doctor are already on the way in any case we must pass by that place they slid off up the road again to the weatherboard office the manager came out to meet them cant get through yet he said you go on up and ill be along soon as the call comes through jack dorman said the doctors day in woods point isnt it i dont know tuesday ive an idea it is jim forrest made a grimace it would be will you take zlinter up there jack ill be up there myself soon as this call comes through he turned to the czech do what you can carl till the doctor gets here okay mr forrest said carl zlinter i will do the best that i can the utility moved off and up the hill carl zlinter sat in silence mentally conning over the stores that he had brought with him the information of the accident that he had got from joe a man called bertie hanson with a crushed leg trapped beneath the upturned bulldozer a man called harry peters the bulldozer driver unconscious with a head injury he was not troubled by the injuries his long experience in the medical service of the german army had accustomed him to frontline casualties in russia and in normandy it was the lack of stores that worried him most there was no blood plasma and no equipment for transfusion and no dressing station still he had worked and saved mens lives with less than he had now what a clumsy fool that bulldozer driver must have been jennifer sat silent between the men as the utility sped up the hill she was somewhat at a loss only half understanding what was going on the tall dark foreigner beside her had medical experience though he was not a doctor apparently he was a lumberman for he was dressed like one yet in this emergency joe and even the manager seemed to defer to him she did not clearly understand what it was that had happened in the forest and nobody had enlightened her indeed perhaps joe was the only one who really understood the accident and he was inarticulate unable to communicate exactly what he knew they passed the road gang and reached the track that led down off the road jack dorman headed the ford down this timber lane in low gear and they went lurching and swaying down the hill between the trees directed by joe they turned presently and traversed the hillside to the right and came out into a sloping open space where all the timber had been felled down at the bottom of this sloping space upon the edge of the unfelled forest there was a bulldozer lying on its side and forepart lying across a log about two feet in diameter two more treetrunks lay above the bulldozer one caught upon the spade the other poised in the air above it perilously apparently about to fall there were men with ropes working carefully around this game of spillikins attempting to guy back the log poised in midair my word jack dorman breathed you wouldnt think a bulldozer could get like that the girl from london sat silent these things which had happened in the forest were outside all her experience dorman drove the ford slowly forward till its way was barred by scrub and timber then he stopped it and the dark foreigner with them got out and made his way quickly to the accident he was wearing soiled khaki drill trousers and a grey cotton shirt open at the neck his arms were bare to the elbow and very tanned yet he had unmistakably the air of a doctor dorman followed after him with joe and the girl came along behind them uncertain what she was going to see she saw a man pinned beneath the bulldozer by one leg bent below the knee in an unnatural attitude he lay upon the ground beneath the log that rested one end on the bulldozer spade most insecurely his face was badly lacerated on one side and there was blood congealed upon the coat that had been thrust as a pillow beneath his head he was conscious and the eyes looked up with recognition at carl zlinter the lips moved good old splinter he muttered better than any mucking doctor in the mucking state get me out of this the dark man dropped down on his knees beside him lie very quiet now he said i am giving an injection which will make you sleep lie very quiet now and sleep he opened his case fitted up the hypodermic with quick accurate movements sterilized it with alcohol broke the neck of a capsule and filled it and sterilized the forearm of the man upon the ground all in about thirty seconds he drove the needle in and pressed the plunger down lie very quiet now and go to sleep he said softly everything now will be all right when you wake up you will be in hospital in bed the mans lips moved mucking german bastard he said faintly good old splinter good old mucking german bastard carl zlinter got up from beside the man and crossed to the other casualty men parted as he came and jennifer saw lying on the ground the second man he lay upon his face or nearly so apparently unconscious he had been bleeding from the ears and the nose and the mouth he lay still breathing with a snoring sound irregularly great gaping wounds were on his scalp the fair hair matted with blood with white bone splinters showing here and there jennifer bit her lip she must not show fear or horror before these men we didnt like to move him till you came splinter said somebody the poor muggers got his skull all cracked we reckoned it was best to leave him as he was the dark man did not answer but dropped down on his knees beside the casualty and began preparing his injection gently he bared an arm and sterilized it and thrust the needle in he withdrew it and sat back on his heels his fingers on the pulse studying the patient he did not touch the head at all presently he got to bis feet we will need stretchers he said two bedframes each with a mattress i will not wait for the ambulance mr dorman please will you fetch bedframes and mattresses for us in the utility sure one of you chaps come along with me n show me where to go the utility went off up the cleared glade and jennifer was left with the lumbermen and the casualties the dark foreigner went back to the first man with the trapped foot and dropped on one knee beside him gently he lifted one eyelid and felt the wrist he bent to an examination of the leg beneath the bulldozer is it possible to lift this thing he asked aw look said one its a crook job we got to take the top stick out backwards first n when we get the weight from off the butt of this one itll roll off on the top of him we got to shore up this one first n then take the top one off backwards n rig a sheerlegs n a tackle n try and get this one off backwards too after that we might roll the dozer over or jack it up maybe but its a long job splinter n the stickll roll off on him if we dont watch out how long will it take the man said itll be dark by eight if we can get the stuff up here n lamps and that we might get the dozer shifted about midnight can you safely move these sticks working in the dark so that there can be no further accident for him the man said uneasily we got to get the poor mugger out of it splinter but its a crook job working in the dark id a sight rather do it in the day the dark man stood in silence for a minute the men stood round him waiting for a lead and jennifer could sense the trust they had in him i do not think that we can save the foot in any case he said it is practically severed now if we should lift the dozer by midnight and get him out of it the leg must then come off in hospital i think the risk now is too great to move these sticks for nothing to be gained but to risk injuring him more i think it will be better if i take the leg off now and get him to the hospital we will wait for a message first to find out if the doctor comes somebody said softly poor old sod another spat and said i wouldnt guarantee to shift them mucking sticks without one slipping there was a long silence after that presently carl zlinter crossed to the other man and knelt down by him again and very gently began to run his fingers over the skull exploring the unnatural depressions of the scars he lifted his head after a time and said is there water water in a clean billy there is an enamel bowl in one of the cartons use that and a clean piece of cloth of lint from the blue square package in the big carton somebody with very clean hands open it and give me a piece of the lint water was brought in a billy and a man found the package of lint he glanced at his hands and then at jennifer you do it he said you got cleaner hands than any of us here she tore open the wrappings and bared the lint she said to the dark man do you want disinfectant in the water please the big blue bottle just a little about one tablespoonful he glanced at her not that the other bottle that is good now give it to me here and a small piece of the lint she took the bowl and the lint to him he dipped his hands in the solution and wiped them with the lint and threw the lot away she got him more lint and disinfectant while the men stood round them in a circle watching and he began very carefully to wipe the dirt from the wounds on the mans head scissors he said in the leather case the middle one of the three pairs and the forceps also put them in the water in the bowl she brought them to him and stood with the men watching ashe worked the glade was very still the sun was sinking towards the mountain and it was not now so hot as it had been the air was fragrant with the odour of the gum trees and from far away a faint whiff of the forest fire scented the air in the distance a white cockatoo was screeching in some tree the dark foreigner worked on upon his knees oblivious of the audience jennifer stood with the lumbermen looking down upon him as he worked it was impossible for her not to share their confidence with every movement the man showed that he knew exactly what he was doing what the result of every tiny movement of his hand upon the scalp would be she could feel the confidence that the men standing with her had in splinter and watching him at work she shared their trust this man was good presently there was a faint noise on the road above them a man by jennifer raised his head truck coming down he said thatll be mr forrest come to say about the ambulance they listened to the approaching truck till it emerged into the glade and stopped near the wrecked bulldozer the manager got out and came to them and zlinter got to his feet and went to meet him the men crowded round jennifer with them theres no ambulance zlinter he said its gone to woods point with the doctor for an appendicitis case they dont know if its coming back tonight or not one of the men said disgustedly no mucking doctor either one of his mates nudged him indicating jennifer no doctor said jim forrest im sorry cobber but thats the way it is aw look said one weve got a doctor old splinter hes a doctor isnt he what about it zlinter asked the manager whats the damage it is not good the dark man said this man i think we should take off the foot and take him into hospital not to leave him here for hours while we lift the dozer the manager pulled him to one side it is all right he cannot hear he is now well doped we cannot save the foot in any case and we must try now to control the shock or he will die if he is left here for many hours i think he will die take the foot off now and get him out of it that is the right thing to do he must be in a warm bed soon with many blankets and hot bottles he is already very cold i think that he is very bad that one i do not think that he has been a healthy man perhaps he drinks too much what about the other one they crossed to the man with the fractured skull this one the dark man said he seems more badly but i do not think so his skull is broken in three places but he is a healthy man and there is yet no damage that is not repairable i have seen men as bad as this recover and be very good quite well men with him it will be necessary to move him very carefully to where he can be operated on to lift the pressure of the bones upon the brain if we can so arrange that he is dealt with quickly then i think he will have a good chance to recover and be well jim forrest bit his lip have you done operations of that sort zlinter i have done such operations many times the man said but not since the war ended where did you do them in the war with russia the man said i was surgeon in the army in france also at the battle of falaise many times i have done emergency trephine it is not difficult if you are very careful and very very clean the danger will lie in moving him to where an operation can be done i could not do that here the manager stood in silence for a minute jack dorman will be back in a few minutes he said at last hes bringing bedframes and mattresses theyll ride softer in that utility than in the truck he walked a little way away from the men deep in thought he knew that he was in a delicate position here and he wanted a few moments to think it over zlinter had no qualifications as a doctor in the state of victoria but he was probably competent to do a trephine operation and it seemed logical that he should be allowed to do it indeed he was the only man within reach who could attempt it without his ministrations the man might well die the obvious place to do the operation was in banbury hospital but would the matron agree to a lumberman who claimed to be an unregistered practitioner doing such an operation in her hospital almost certainly she would not it might well be that while everyone was arguing the man would die he might die anyway upon the road to banbury he went back to carl zlinter what will you do zlinter he asked will you take them into banbury whats the best thing to do will the doctor come to banbury tonight hes operating at woods point on the appendicitis case this evening if he comes back it will be very late we can get him on the telephone at the hotel at about six oclock he will not be back at banbury before ten or eleven i dont think so carl zlinter stood in silence for a minute he was very well aware of his position if he operated on this fractured skull and the man died there would be trouble and he might end up in prison a bad start to his new life in australia he said at last i will take off the foot of the man at the dozer now we cannot save that foot for the other one we must take him very carefully down to lamirra as he is and you must telephone again from there i will decide then what is best to do okay zlinter what help do you want somebody who knows to hand me things from the case and to keep clean and sterile as possible the young lady was good just now he looked round and saw jennifer standing a little aside please he said come here she came towards him i am going to take off that mans foot he said have you ever seen an operation she shook her head never he looked her in the eyes would you be afraid to help me if you cannot do it you must say so now can you help this man and not faint or do any foolish thing i shouldnt faint she replied i might do something stupid because ive never done anything like this before but ill do my best he smiled at her and she was suddenly confident it will be nothing difficult he said just to keep giving me the things i shall want i will show you the things before we begin just to do what i shall tell you quietly and to keep a calm head he took her to the utility and began rummaging through his cartons for the dishes and appliances that he would need he picked up a white rubber sheet and carried it over to the bulldozer and laid it on the ground beside the trapped man immediately beneath the menace of the hanging log she helped him to arrange it neatly on the fragrant leafcovered ground beside the man now come with me he said she became oblivious of the men who stood around and watched them her whole attention became concentrated on the job she had to do and on this foreigner in dirty clothes who wielded so much power he made her swab her hands and arms in disinfectant at the tailboard of the utility and then she helped him put the instruments into the bowl and to arrange the ligatures the dressings and the bandages neatly on the white rubber sheet then she went with him and knelt down beside the man and for a time she listened while he instructed her naming each article after him both became utterly immersed in the work that lay ahead the professional detachment of the doctor communicated itself to her as he intended that it should and robbed the business of all horror she saw no sympathy and no emotion in his work upon the injured man only a great technical care and skill that noted impersonally every sign of feeling every change in respiration and pulse as the work went on and made adjustment for it he took the leg off about eight inches below the knee with a local anaesthetic injected in several places around the leg waited ten minutes for this to take effect and then did the job from the time they knelt down together by the rubber blanket till the bandaging was complete about twentyfive minutes elapsed and in that time jennifer was completely oblivious of what was going on around her concentrated only on the work in hand carl zlinter sat back on his heels so he said now we must get him to the utility he raised his head the mattress please bring it and lay it down here he got to his feet and jennifer got up stiffly with him from her knees she felt exhausted drained of all energy she was surprised to see jack dorman there among the men and to see the utility parked immediately behind the bulldozer she had not seen or heard it arrive carl zlinter spoke to her it was very well done the help that you gave me he said you have been a nurse at some time she shook her head no she said ive never done anything like that before he raised his eyebrows so he exclaimed softly it was well done very well you have a gift for this he glanced at her kindly and now you are very tired she forced a smile i dont know why one should be it is the close attending he said i also i get tired every time it would be wrong if one did not grow tired i think for that would mean i had not done the best i could she smiled at him i suppose thats right i suppose thats what it is and then somebody said where will they put the mattress splinter he moved aside here lay it down here like this she turned towards the utility and jack dorman was there good show jenny he said with genuine respect howre you feeling get into the car and sit a bit im all right she said it takes it out of you though she got into the car and sat with the door open talking to him i brought up a bottle of whisky from the store case it was needed he said he produced it let me pour you out a nip i dont want that she said im all right sure honestly he slipped the bottle back into the door pocket of the car i couldnt have done what you did he said id have turned sick that wasnt true because when it comes to the point men and women are far stronger than they think but he thought that it was true he had seen death and wounds in plenty thirty years before but time had wiped the details from his mind and this had come as a fresh shock to him he was genuinely surprised at the strength of this girl from london under the direction of the czech the men lifted the unconscious man carefully on to the mattress and carried it to the utility and laid it in the back assisted by jack dorman and the manager jennifer got out while this was going on and stood and watched but there was nothing she could do to help the evening sun was now sinking to the tops of the gum trees flooding the glade with golden light in the midst of her fatigue and these strange happenings she could wonder at the beauty and the fragrance of the place carl zlinter came to her by the car we have now to put the other man on the mattress he said do you feel able to help me it is more delicate because of the head injuries of course she said what do you want me to do she crossed with him to the other man while the mattress was brought and laid adjacent to him they knelt down while zlinter carefully examined the head again and felt the pulse and tested the degree of unconsciousness he made her fetch a triangular bandage and he raised the injured head while she slipped the bandage beneath it then very carefully they manoeuvred the rubber sheet beneath the body and head zlinter and forrest lifting each part an inch or so from the ground while the girl slipped the sheet under straightening the folds as she progressed in ten minutes the man was lying on the sheet with three men lifting the sheet on each side of the body and zlinter tending the head at the same time they slipped the mattress under and carried it to the utility and laid it in the back beside the other then they were ready to go jack dorman got into the utility with zlinter and jennifer forrest followed on behind them with the truck full of men leaving the bulldozer to be sorted out and put upon its feet in the morning dorman drove the utility over the rough ground of the glade at no more than a walking pace with zlinter continually observing the effect of the motion on the wounded men through the back window once or twice he stopped the car and got out to examine them more closely presently the truck drew up beside them and it was arranged that forrest should go on ahead and telephone the doctor at woods point the utility moved very slowly up the track towards the road jennifer sat silent between the men dorman giving the whole of his attention to getting the car over the rough road with as little motion as possible zlinter silent and preoccupied with the condition of the head injury but presently he roused himself and said please mr dorman this young lady that has been of so great help i do not know her name will you make an introduction please the australian said why sure jennifer morton my wifes niece or something the girl laughed jennifers the name she said jenny if you like she hesitated you might as well complete it she observed your name isnt really splinter is it zlinter he said carl zlinter miss jennifer he achieved as near to a bow as he could manage in the cab of the utility pressed up against the girl they call me splinter when it is not something ruder i am from czechoslovakia you are australian of course im nothing of the sort the girl said im a pommie from london ive only been in the country a few days so a few days only i have been here for fifteen months do you like it he nodded it is ver beautiful almost like my own country in bohemia in the mountains i would rather live there in my own country but i do not like communists if i may not live there then i would rather live here i think than any other place in the world you like it so much as that he smiled i have been happy since coming here from germany i like the country and the working in the trees the utility emerged on to the made road with a lurch zlinter made jack dorman stop the car and got out to inspect his patients what he saw was evidently not very satisfactory because he got up on to the mattresses and crouched over the man with the fractured skull he got down presently on to the road and came to the window at the drivers side i will ride in the back he said the motion is not good but if i kneel down there i can keep the head still i think go very very carefully very slow jennifer said can i help if i get in behind doctor you must not call me doctor he said not in australia she did not understand that there is not room for more than one person he said i can manage alone but please go very very slow i am afraid for splinters of the bone he got back into the rear portion and knelt down between his patients jack dorman let the clutch in and the car moved off at walking pace it took them half an hour to cover the three miles down to the lumber camp in the valley they stopped twice upon the way for zlinter to adjust the folded blanket that served as a pillow it was sunset when the utility crept up to the office building jim forrest came out into the road to meet them the doctors still at woods point he said i got through to the hotel but hes not there the place hes operating in isnt on the telephone i left a message asking him to ring us here soon as he could i rang the hospital and asked if they could send a nurse out here they cant do that theyve got one nurse sick and another off on holiday as far as i can make out theyve only got the sister and a couple of ukrainian wardmaids there the sister said wed have to bring them into banbury there was a silence everybody seemed to be expecting zlinter to say something and carl zlinter apparently had nothing to say at last he got down from the back of the utility please he said may i come into your office mr forrest sure the manager led the way inside in the bare rather squalid room that was the office of the lumber camp the czech turned and faced the manager this man is now very bad he said quietly the man with the fractured skull mr dorman he drives very carefully and very slow but i have not been able to prevent the head from moving there are broken bones you understand pieces of the skull that are broken like the shell of an egg with every movement of the car there is a a movement of these pieces of the skull against each other and a rubbing on the matter of the brain jim forrest made a grimace the pulse is now worse zlinter said dispassionately and the colour of the face is worse also the total condition is now seriously worse than when you saw him in the woods by the accident i do not think it is wise to take him into banbury another seventeen miles till he has had some attention youll think hell die upon the way zlinter shrugged his shoulders i do not know it is seventeen miles and the road is not good until the last part so we must go very slow it will take two hours if we go faster there may be much damage to the brain i cannot say if he will die or not if he is treated so i can tell you only that i would not advise for him to go father than here till he has had attention what sort of attention zlinter i think the head should be examined carefully in clean and antiseptic surroundings with good light i think that we shall find a portion of the bone is pressing on the brain if that is so that portion must be lifted or removed entirely to relieve the pressure the operation that we call trephine when that is done if it needs to be done the matter is less urgent he must then be put into some cast or splint for the movement of the head and taken to a hospital could you do that lift that bit of bone you think wants lifting i have done that operation many times in this country i am not allowed to practise because i am not qualified if the man should die in the end there would be trouble perhaps i think it is for you to say what is to be done if i said have a go at it would you be willing i would be willing to do what i can for him the czech said even though it might mean trouble if the thing goes wrong zlinter smiled i have crossed that river already he said i am in trouble now with the other man if things go wrong for i have taken off his leg and that i am not allowed to do l think i am in one trouble now already and another of the same kind will not matter much jim forrest nodded may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb he stood in silence for a minute looking out of the dirty window at the golden lights outside as the sun went down it would be dark before they could get this man to banbury which would not make the journey any easier for him there was no guarantee that when they got him there he would receive attention before morning the matron certainly would not undertake an operation for trephine herself and she would almost certainly prevent carl zlinter from doing anything of the sort in her hospital even though the patient were in a dying state until he could get some news of when the doctor was expected back at banbury it might be adverse to this man in every way to take him there too few doctors in the bloody country he thought and they tried to stop you using the ones youd got he was australian to the core bred in the country with only a few years of school in town an individualist to the bone a foe of all regimentation and control he turned suddenly from the window my bloody oath he said weve got to do something and its no good taking him to banbury unless the bloody doctors going to be there you tell me whats the best to do splinter and ill tell you to do it the dark foreigner laughed i think we take them to hut five he said that was a new hut recently constructed and so reasonably clean and there were empty rooms two rooms we shall want one for the amputation to lie in bed the other with a bed and a long table from the messroom very clean on which i can lay this man with the injured head while i examine him when i have done that i will tell you if i should go further with trephine or if we can wait till the doctor comes in that room i shall need a very bright light with a long cord of flex from the lamp fitting the camp was lit by electricity from a diesel generator right said forrest well get on with that and give the bloody hospital away he stepped briskly out of the office to the utility and started giving orders to the men carl zlinter went to the door of the utility and spoke to jennifer mr forrest has decided to make here a little hospital for the night he said we shall clear two rooms and make all as sterile as we can i am to make an examination of the man with the broken head and then we will decide what is the best thing to be done he hesitated will you be able to stay and help me she said of course ill stay if i can help at all she turned to jack dorman thats all right isnt it sure he said stay as long as you like ill probably go back and tell jane and then come back here if youre going to work long youd better have some tea zlinter said it will be a help if miss jennifer can stay while i examine the head she understands more quickly than the men the things i want i will see she gets a meal if it is necessary to work long jennifer got out of the car what have we got to do two hours later in a little hot room that was roughly hung with sheets and that stank of carbolic zlinter straightened up above the patient on the table it had taken them most of that time to rig up their little hospital and make the surroundings roughly sterile for the last halfhour jennifer had held the electric light bulb in the positions that he told her and had handed him the swabs and bowls and scissors that he needed from the office table behind her it was airless and stuffy in the little room for they had closed the window to keep out the dust and the bugs that flew in the australian night the girl from london was sweating freely and her clothes were clinging to her body she was growing very tired it is not good said zlinter no it is not good at all she could see that much even with the untrained eye now that the hair was cut away the huge unnatural depression in the skull was an appalling sight it is ver hot the man said hang the lamp upon that nail and we will go outside where it is cool perhaps there is now some news of the doctor it was fresh outside the hut and she felt better in the velvety black night zlinter asked the darkness if jim forrest was there and from the darkness somebody said that he would go and get him another voice asked hows he going on miss she strained her eyes but they were still dazzled by the light she had been holding and she could only see a dark blur of a figure she could not give a reassuring report she temporized and asked which one harry peters the voice said the one what got his head cracked hes going on all right she said it was all that she could say bert hanson hes awake another voice said i just been talking to him in their preoccupation with the head injury they had rather forgotten the amputation lying in the next room where they had laid him in bed with blankets and hot bottles an hour before jennifer plucked zlinter by the arm did you hear that mr zlinter they say the other mans awake awake he turned back to the hut and she followed him in in the little room next to the head case the light was shaded with a towel roughly draped across the fixture in the half light the man lay on his back as they had left him but the eyes were open now and looked at them with recognition so said zlinter how are we now he took the hand and laid his finger on the pulse and stood counting looking at his wristwatch the mans lips moved and he said feebly good old splinter mucking german bastard the czech stood silent smiling a little as he watched the second hand move round then he laid the hand down do you feel any pain he asked kind of numb all up my leg the man muttered no sharp pain anywhere the man said something that they could not hear zlinter bent to him and made him repeat it then he straightened up hes thirsty he said to jennifer fetch a glass of water there is a glass in the washroom from the darkness outside a voice said audibly thatll be the first time berts tasted bloody water in ten years tomorrow zlinter said the ambulance will come to take you into hospital at banbury but for tonight you will stay here lie very quiet now and sleep again if there is pain call out i shall be in the next room and i will come at once and give you something that will stop the pain but i do not think you will have pain again tonight behind him jennifer came with the water he knelt and raised the head and gave the man a drink but he took only a few sips now rest and go to sleep again he said it is all right now there was a knock at the door and zlinter went out into the corridor with jennifer jim forrest was there this one is doing well he said softly the amputation he is now conscious and resting the other one the head case is not good will the doctor come tonight the manager said his appendicitis case has turned out bad zlinter peritonitis or something i told him what you said about not taking the head case any further before examining him and he said to do the best you can i asked if i should get you to ring him but hes going back to his appendicitis hell be back at the hotel about ten or eleven he said to do the best you can and hell be out here in the morning did you tell him i may have to lift the bone to ease the pressure on the brain i told him that you thought an operation might be necessary tonight what did he answer when you told him that he said he couldnt be in two places at once and youd have to do the best you could it was a crook line and i had to make him repeat a good many times but thats what it amounted to the czech stood silent for a minute then he said i would like you to come in and look at him with me you do not mind the sight of a bad wound thatll be right they went into the room and jennifer followed the manager in spite of his assurance drew his breath in sharply when he saw the extent of the injury zlinter moved his hand above the great depression the bone here is much depressed as you will see he said there is haemorrhage in the brain cavity also he motioned to jennifer to move the light she held it above the face puttycoloured and with a bluish tinge he is a bad colour said zlinter softly and the breathing is bad also and the pulse is weak i do not think this man will live until the morning in his present state what do you think mr forrest the manager said i dont know ive never seen a thing like this before splinter i should think youre right hes dying now isnt he the czech said i think he will be much improved if we can lift the bone and ease the pressure on the brain he motioned jennifer to put the light back on the nail and took them out into the corridor when the door was shut he said i have wanted you to see him now mr forrest so that if he should not recover from the operation you can say how he was youre going to operate splinter the czech nodded i am going to lift the bone and perhaps take some of it away completely right what do you want carl zlinter turned to jennifer are you too tired to go on again she said im all right it will be long perhaps two hours ill be all right she said again he smiled at her that is good he turned to the manager we must eat before we start again he said especially this lady we shall need a small meal very quickly now because we must not wait some tea and boiled eggs perhaps something that will be ready soon in a few minutes after that we will begin the work we shall need much boiling water they went into the little room again at about a quarter to nine freshened by a meal in the canteen and a cigarette heat and not horror was the enemy that jennifer had to battle against in the next two hours there was no flyscreen on the window and it was impossible to open it because of the moths and the flying beetles that crashed against the pane attracted by the light it was impossible to have the door open without sacrificing sterility both worked in a steady drip of sweat made more intense by the heat from the highpower lamp that jennifer held most of the time in the positions that the surgeon told her from time to time they rested and drank lukewarm water from a pitcher before going on thinking it over afterwards jennifer came to the conclusion that the heat made the experience easy for her she was so miserably hot and uncomfortable that it was all that she could do to keep her wits about her to keep on handing him the things he wanted at the time he wanted them she had no nervous energy left with which to be upset at what she saw she needed all her energy for what she had to do it was a quarter past eleven by the time the head was finally bandaged zlinter went out into the corridor to get some help and with forrest and dorman and two other men they lifted the patient in a sheet from the operating table to the bed and laid him there the men stood looking on while zlinter felt the pulse forrest said looking better isnt he splinter the czech said i think so too it is now a question of the operation shock if he can live through that i think he will recover and be a well man he turned to the door we will leave him for a little now i shall come back later he moved them out of the room and shut the door carefully behind them and leaned for a moment limply against the wall he said to jennifer you must be very tired she was drenched with sweat her clothes sticking to her body at every movement it was so hot in there she said she felt now as though she might be going to faint lets get out into the air jack dorman took her arm and they moved towards the door of the hut zlinter stopped at the room of the other man and went in softly to look at his amputation case the man was lying on his back and breathing deeply sound asleep he did not seem to have moved since zlinter had seen him last he lifted the sheet and glanced at the bandaged leg and lowered the sheet again good he said softly to forrest this one is all right he moved to the door and then stopped for a moment do you smell anything carbolic said the manager i thought i could smell whisky jim forrest laughed too right splinter jack dormans got a bottle in his car its me youre smelling come on and have one it was cool and fresh out in the forest night after the close stuffiness of the small room and the air smelt wonderful after the stenches of the operating table jennifer felt better when they got outside jim forrest fetched glasses from the canteen and she drank a small weak whisky and water with the men and felt better still they stood smoking together and relaxing in the cool night air letting the freshness cool and dry their bodies and their clothes talking in short desultory sentences about the operation once jennifer asked will he really recover like an ordinary man the czech said he may not to do bulldozing again perhaps but for light work he may recover very well there will be danger of paralysis on the right side we will see he turned to the manager it is this man who is the student is he not thats right said jim forrest hes trying to save up to do a university course he paused should be able to the money that one has to pay a bulldozer driver jennifer asked whats he going to do at the university metallurgy i think he turned to the czech what about tonight splinter will he wake up i think he may in two or three hours time i shall stay with him all night myself jennifer asked will you want me again he looked down at her not again tonight he said i could not have done very much for these men without your help i find it wonderful that you have never been a nurse she smiled my fathers a doctor she said perhaps that makes a difference so he said a doctor in england thats right she replied he practises in leicester and you have helped him in his practice she shook her head i know a little bit from living in the house of course one cant help learning little bits of things you have learned more than little bits of things he said now you must be very tired you should go home and get some sleep youre sure you wont want me any more no he said nothing will happen now that will be urgent till the doctor comes in the morning she said id like to know what happens to them sure he said perhaps i may come in and tell you at the homestead jack dorman said thats right come in for tea tomorrow or the next day if i can i will do that he said when the doctor comes he may wish that i go to banbury with him to the hospital to show what i have done and to hand over the cases in the proper way i do not know i will come and tell you tomorrow or the day after she said simply ill look forward to you coming she got into the utility and jack dorman drove her home jane and angela were waiting up for her with a small meal of cold meat and salad and cheese she was hungry but before she ate she had to rid herself of her clothes that stank of sweat and chemicals she went and stood under the shower and put on clean pyjamas and a housecoat and came back to the kitchen and ate a little cold mutton and drank a cup of tea while telling them about it jack dorman told jane it was that fellow zlinter that ann pearson told us about when peter loring got his mastoid hes quite a surgeon so it seems she said the one that you met over on the howqua who found his own grave thats right they all call him splinter up at the camp jennifer said sleepily found his own grave thats right said dorman get him to tell you about it its quite a story she was too tired to go into that at the moment hes very sure of himself she said reflectively he knew exactly what he wanted to do right from first to last angela asked is he goodlooking rather like boris karloff jennifer told her but hes got a nice smile she paused i should think hes a very good doctor he wouldnt be as good as an english doctor though would he asked angela jennifer smiled at the rosecoloured dream of england i dont know she said all english doctors arent supermen i thought the english medical schools were the best in the world said angela every aussie doctor who wants to do postgraduate work goes to england maybe thats because they cant get dollars to go to america jane said dryly jennifer got up from the table i think ill go to bed she said i should think wed all better go to bed im sorry youve had to stay up like this for me makes a bit of a change a thing like this weve not had so much excitement since the cow calved jane remarked dont get up tomorrow jenny sleep in late thats a damn good idea said angela i didnt mean you said her mother at the lumber camp after the utility had gone carl zlinter sat on the steps of the hut in the cool velvety night talking to the manager jack dorman had left the remains of his bottle of whisky with them to finish off the czech had a second but refused a third i should sleep if i drink more he told jim forrest and i must stay awake tonight presently this man he will wake up and i must be with him then look said the manager is there anything i can do ill stay up with you if you like it is not necessary there are men sleeping in the hut if it should be needed i will send for you but i think it will not be needed everything i think will now be all right presently jim forrest went back to his house to bed carl zlinter finished his cigarette and went back to the hut he looked in on his amputation case the man was still in the same position apparently asleep from the door zlinter could hear the even regular breathing he did not go in or make any close examination better to let him sleep he went into his trephine case and began cleaning and tidying the room clearing away the debris of the operation and cleaning and drying his instruments an hour later at about one in the morning the man began to come to he became conscious once or twice the eyes opened and closed the colour and the breathing were now much better presently the lips moved the man was trying to say something carl zlinter bent beside him dont talk harry he said dont move about you got a blow upon your head but youre right now dont try and talk or move about just lie quietly as you are and rest youre right now he could not make out if the man had understood or not the lips moved again and he bent to try and hear what he was saying but now there was a humming in the air unmelodious but recognisable as a tune in one of the cubicles of the hut somebody was humming or chanting to himself in a low tone god save the king it was impossible for the czech to hear if his patient was speaking or if the lips were merely moving by some reflex originating from the damaged brain he got to his feet in annoyance the men in the hut were all good types and they knew very well that there were critically ill men in the hut with them they should know better than to make a row like that in the middle of the night he went out into the corridor to find out where the noise was coming from and stop it it was coming from the nextdoor cubicle that housed his amputation case he opened the door in the dim shaded light bert hanson was lying on his back awake maundering through god save the king in low alcoholic tones and beating time with one hand the air was heavy with the aroma of whisky he took no notice of the doctor but continued beating time and singing his eyes half closed the voice getting stronger and the tune louder with every minute thy choicest gifts insore on him beplea stupore zlinter went into the room and plucked the towel from the lamp the room was flooded with light he saw a lump under the bedclothes turned them back and there was the bottle uncorked and practically empty he dropped it on the floor with tightened lips wondering if his patient had drunk the whole of it from the look of him he probably had the man said genially in a strong voice good old splinter good old mucking bastard he burst into laughter in an access of bonhomie come on les sing god save the king together and muck the mucking germans a man appeared in the corridor dressed in pyjama trousers and no top want any help splinter this verdamt stupid bloody fool said the czech angrily somebody has given him a bottle of whisky we must try and keep him quiet for his own sake and for the man next door the next two hours were a nightmare at an early stage zlinter sent a man to fetch forrest from his house by the time he came running the pandemonium was terrific with three men fighting to keep bert hanson in his bed with zlinter himself attempting to keep his trephine case quiet and tranquil in the next room behind a beaverboard wall the man was frantically fighting drunk at one stage he got hold of the bottle and used it as a club till it broke mercifully upon the wall beside him it was with the greatest difficulty that they got the jagged broken neck out of his hand jim forrest said to zlinter at the height of it youll have to give him something morphia the czech said i do not think that will be good when this is over there will be reaction and he will be very weak i do not think that any drug will work while there is so much alcohol unless to give it in a great dose as would kill him later what the hell are we going to do with him hold him until the thing passes if these men grow tired get other men hows harry going on he is going on ver well it would be better for him if there was less noise ill do the best i can but if he cant have any dope hell have to work it out and hes got some way to go at about three oclock and almost suddenly the man stopped struggling and shouting and entered on a stage of collapse carl zlinter left his trephine case and gave his whole attention to his amputation drunk the heart was now very weak the man lay in a stupor of weakness gradually sinking at about four oclock zlinter gave an injection of strychnine which only had a very temporary slight effect at about halfpast five in the first light of dawn bert hanson died seven it is the duty of the police to take note of all serious accidents occurring in their district and sister fellowes at the hospital in banbury had rung up sergeant russell the previous evening to tell him there had been an accident at lamirra and that the doctor was away at woods point on an operation case the police got to the lumber camp at about halfpast seven in the morning inspired more by a genuine desire to assist than with any thought of invoking the processes of law it was unfortunate however that they got there before dr jennings who would probably have extended bert hansons life a little upon paper and signed a death certificate which the police sergeant would have honoured in a country chronically short of doctors it was no business of the police to go round making trouble as it was they came upon the scene before the stage was set for them they found a czech lumberman utterly exhausted who had conducted two major operations without any valid medical qualifications whatsoever and they found one of the patients dead and in a shocking state of death for there had been little time or energy to clean the body up the other patient on whom a major head operation had been performed was clearly very ill and in the view of the police sergeant probably dying too the whole thing was irregular and possibly criminal in any case the coroner would have to be informed and there must be an inquest dr jennings arrived direct from woods point half an hour after the police he found them taking statements from jim forrest and carl zlinter in the canteen hut zlinter having refused pointblank to go to the office of the lumber company half a mile from his patient when the doctor came in he got up from the table this can wait he said to the police sergeant with small courtesy for he was very tired there are now more important things that must be done he walked out of the canteen and took the doctor over to the trephine case at once jim forrest turned to the sergeant hes right sarge hes got to hand over his case to the doctor maybe i can go on telling you what happened the sergeant thumbed his notebook how long have you employed this man aw look i couldnt say for certain september or october a year back i think fifteen or sixteen months maybe has he acted as a doctor before well what do you think said the manager if you had a doctor working as a lumberman youd use him if a chap got hurt wouldnt you cuts and sprains and bruises and that anything serious gets sent into the hospital we havent had a real accident before this one the sergeant wrote in his book did you know this man wasnt registered as a doctor in victoria he asked presently sure said the manager i got him as a labourer through the immigration office if he was a doctor hed have been doctoring when did you start using him as a doctor aw look i forget hes been a labourer all along the men started going to him for cuts and sprains and that things it wouldnt be worth going into banbury for or getting dr jennings out here he started coming to me for bandages and stuff so i made over the firstaid box to him and got a lot more stuff he said we ought to have it just grew up you might say but hes been working as a labourer all along thats right did you ever make any inquiry into his medical qualifications only what he told me sarge he said hed been a doctor in his own country in prague or pilsen or some place like that and in the german army he told me from the first he wasnt allowed to practise in australia i knew that anyway did you authorize him to do this operation which one well both lets say the man who died the amputation first he asked me and i told him that hed better go ahead and take the foot off we couldnt get a doctor we couldnt even get a nurse out from the hospital look sarge it was like this sergeant russell said presently i dont want you to think im making trouble jim i got to get the facts right for the coroner because therell have to be an inquest theres no doctor that can sign a death certificate i got to get the facts he thumbed over his book and sat in silence for a minute or two reading through his notes these operations he said the one where he took off the foot and the one on the other fellows head how long did they take the manager thought for a moment aw look i couldnt say the foot was pretty quick twenty minutes maybe not so long as that the other one was much longer two hours id say or longer than that the sergeant wrote it down did you help him no sergeant russell raised his head and looked the manager in the eyes sensing prevarication who did help him he didnt do operations of that sort all on his own there was a girl there the manager said an english girl staying with jack dorman she was in the utility with him she gave a hand thats jack dorman of leonora thats right whats her name i dont know jack called her jenny i think she was english is she here she went back to leonora last night with jack about midnight shes probably there now ill look in and see her the sergeant said on my way back he glanced over his notes ill have to see this man zlinter again he said ill have to know the medical degrees hes got in his own country thatll come into it i think thats all the questions theres one you havent asked sarge said jim forrest getting up and id like to know the answer whats that who gave bert the bloody booze the manager said td like to know the answer to that one in the hut dr jennings and carl zlinter were debating the same point standing and looking dispassionately at the body of bert hanson too bad this had to happen said the doctor hes been an alcoholic for some time id say well probably lind an enlarged liver at the postmortem have you any idea how he got the stuff the czech shrugged his shoulders there were his cobbers all around all night here in the corridor he said i was operating in the next room and i could not see it must have been in that time when i had finished the trephine i came in to see this one and i then smelt whisky and i asked mr forrest and he said he had been drinking himself so i did not think more about it and afterwards when i came in again i had had a drink of whisky also so i did not notice the doctor looked at the broken bottle still lying on the floor he probably drank a whole bottle i think so too we found the lead that is around the cork of a new bottle and theres no saying who gave it to him mr forrest asked this morning but nobody would say i do not think we shall be able to discover that i dont suppose we shall he stood in silence for a minute and then pulled the sheet over the body therell have to be an inquest zlinter he said at last its a pity i couldnt have got here before the police i think ill see the coroner before the inquest and tell him how it all came about the czech nodded they will be angry because l have done operations i suppose its going to have to be explained and put in the proper light you dont have to worry about anything though youll probably have to give evidence one does the best one can the other said it is not possible to do more than that if i had waited till you could arrive and not done anything both men would have been dead today we have now one alive and we would have the other but for some verdamt fool who gave the whisky ill go and telephone for the ambulance the doctor said youd better come down with me to the hospital and well have a look at what you did to that chaps head together take an xray first perhaps jennifer was still in bed when the police car drove up to the homestead at about halfpast eight jack dorman was out on his horse in one of the paddocks but mario was in the shearing shed and jane sent him to fetch her husband she made sergeant russell comfortable with a cup of tea in the kitchen and went to call jennifer who was awake jenny she said youll have to get up my dear youll be sorry to hear that one of those men died the one with the amputated foot the police sergeants here and he wants to ask you a few questions about what happened jennifer sat up dumbfounded he couldnt have died she exclaimed he was getting on splendidly it was the other one who was so bad thats what he says my dear youd better get up and put some clothes on and come out and see him ive sent mario to find jack to come along as well ten minutes later jennifer was sitting at the table with a cup of tea facing the sergeant who told her about the whisky its just a matter of form miss he said ive got to make out a report for the coroner on all this he asked her name and her address which jane told her to give as leonora then he said i understand you helped this man carl zlinter to do both operations she nodded thats right had you ever helped him to do an operation before she stared at him of course not i only met him yesterday for the first time ive only been in this country about ten days he wrote in his book thats right he said equably its just these questions that i have to ask now what made you help him this time she hesitated not knowing quite where to begin well i suppose because my hands were cleaner than anybody elses look sergeant this is what happened jack dorman came into the kitchen while she was telling her story jane briefed him in a whisper with what was going on he pulled up a chair and sat down to listen jennifer came to an end of her story and the sergeant made a note or two and looked back at his notes of what jim forrest had said there was no real discrepancy which was satisfactory he said thats all clear enough miss morton now theres just one or two things arising out of that did this man tell you at any time that he wasnt a registered doctor she wrinkled her forehead i remember he told me that i mustnt call him a doctor some time or other she sat in thought for a moment im afraid i just cant remember she said such a lot happened last night and i was so tired i cant remember who said what i certainly knew that he wasnt supposed to do operations but whether he told me or someone else i couldnt say you did know that miss you knew he wasnt supposed to do operations yes she said i knew that he made a note in his book then why did you help him to do the operations he asked she stared at him well someone had to help him jack dorman broke in aw look sergeant there wasnt any other doctor someone had to do something jim forrest tried all ends up to get dr jennings in the end we just had to do the best we could without a proper doctor jenny here gave him a hand id have given him a hand myself but she could do it so much better you dont think we should have let em lie until the doctor came this morning do you the sergeant closed his book it doesnt matter what i think jack he said im just the copper its what the coroner thinks that matters and hes got to have the facts im not saying that in jim forrests shoes i wouldnt have done the same as he did or in this young ladys shoes either but if the coroner thinks different when he hears the facts of this mans death there could be a charge of manslaughter against carl zlinter oh my word now thats the truth of it he went away leaving them dumbfounded jennifer said as they watched the car departing through the gates it cant be like he said they couldnt be so stupid jack dorman scratched his head what does he think we ought to have done left em lying till the doctor came it wont go any further jenny she said im so sorry for carl zlinter if theyre going on like this it must be beastly for him and hes not deserved it the fire that had burned in lieutenant dorman thirty years before flared up again if they start anything against that chap ill raise the bloody roof he said evenly pack of bloody wowsers i never heard of such a thing jennifer said if it should come to manslaughter i cant see how it could but if it should id be in it too wouldnt i i mean i helped him do the operations jane said oh no theyd never bring you into it dear you only helped you didnt do anything yourself im sure we could keep you out of it i dont want to be kept out of it the girl said i was glad to be in it last night and im glad to be in it still i think it was the right thing to do she turned to jack dorman i would like to have a talk with him about whats going to happen with carl zlinter he said hed come round here today but if theres a row on he may not come jack dorman said i might take a run up the road and have a talk with jim forrest if zlinters there ill tell him were expecting him he got into his utility presently and went up to lamirra he found jim forrest in his office morning jim he said weve had the police sergeant at our place asking jenny all about last night pack of bloody nonsense the manager said he hasnt got enough to do ive been trying to find the bloody fool that gave bert hanson the whisky but ill never do it he had a bottle did he mr dorman asked with interest a whole bottle i dont know how full it was when he got hold of it probably full we found the tinsel paper that goes round the cork he had most of what there was except what got spilt into the bed he took a lot did he in the ordinary way oh aye he was a pretty fair soak a lot of them are of course theres nothing else to do in barracks in a place like this he paused the new australians are the sober ones here all saving their money for when their two years are up to buy a house or start a business or something but for the language trouble theyre the best men that ive got this chap zlinter whats he like hes right said the manager dont drink a lot not more n you or i goes fishing all of his spare time i know i met him on the howqua one time down at billy slims place he paused the sergeant was saying that if this goes wrong at the inquest he could be up for manslaughter i know i dont know what in hell they expect one to do but anyway it wont go wrong weve got doc jennings on our side hes satisfied that what was done was right is he i think so theyve gone into banbury now with harry in the ambulance him and zlinter they took bert hanson in the bottom bunk hes going to do a postmortem on him after hes got harry fixed up right i said that id go in tomorrow afternoon and get the news id like to come in with you dorman said my girl jennys all mixed up in this if it should come to manslaughter the manager stated at him oh my word he said it couldnt go that far it could if we dont watch it said jack dorman zlinters in banbury now with the doctor thats right they went in in the ambulance jenny wants to see him id like to see him myself n have a talk about all this ive got a truck coming out this afternoon with diesel oil leaving the shell depot after dinner i told him to get a ride out on that ill ring the hospital and tell him to drop off at our place and ill bring him on here later carl zlinter walked up from the road to leonora homestead at about three oclock that afternoon dressed in a shabby grey suit of continental cut it was hot coming across the paddocks from the road in the blazing sun and he carried his coat over his arm jennifer sitting in a deckchair on the veranda saw him coming and went to the last gate to meet him come and sit in the shade she said you look very hot she was wearing a clean summer frock and her legs were bare she looked cool and pretty the sun lit up the auburn colours in her hair it was many years since carl zlinter had talked to a welldressed girl and he was rather shy of her in the camps that he had lived in for so long in europe women had not dressed like that he took courage from the memory of the sweating girl who had helped him a few hours before and went with her to the veranda where jennifer introduced him to jane they sat down together in the deckchairs and talked for a little about the hot road out from banbury he wiped his forehead with a handkerchief it is ver beautiful here he said for me this is a very lovely piece of country just this part around here between mount buller and the town of banbury with the rivers the howqua and the dalatite i would be happy if i were to stay here all my life jane was pleased you like it so much as that she paused we came here twenty years ago and weve sometimes talked of getting another station nearer in to melbourne but well i dont know weve never been in the habit of going to the city much and i wouldnt want to live anywhere else than here if we went it would only be to see more of the children i would never want to live in any better place than here he said jennifer smiled but not as a lumberman he looked at her smiling also there are worse things than to be a lumberman he said it is not what i was educated for but if i may not be a doctor in this country i would rather be a lumberman in beautiful country such as this than work in the city the girl said its such a waste for a man like you to have to work in the woods how long will it be after your two years are up before you can be a doctor again he said i do not think that i shall ever be a doctor in australia why not it costs too much he said it is necessary for a foreign doctor to do three years of medical training again in a melbourne hospital before he may practise in this country that would cost fifteen hundred pounds and that i have not got and i shall never have if i should have the money it would then be very difficult to get a place in a hospital because the hospitals are full with your australian doctors he paused i do not think that i shall be a doctor again he said but what an idiotic regulation the girl said he looked at her smiling at her indignation for him it is not so idiotic he said there must be some rule the doctors from some countries are ver bad i would not like you to be treated by a rumanian doctor or a doctor from albania jane asked what do you think youll do when your two years are up he shrugged his shoulders i do not know perhaps i shall stay on and be a lumberman for ever it seems a frightful waste the girl repeated jane changed the subject tell me she said hows your patient getting on the one with the fractured skull i think he will recover he said we took an xray at the hospital and then we took off the dressings that dr jennings could see what had been done and he was happy he did not want to do anything else we made all clean and more sterile with the better equipment at the hospital if that one does not drink a bottle of whisky i think he will be well he wouldnt want to would he jennifer asked you said that he was a better type than the man with the foot did i say that i think that is true dr jennings is to do a postmortem on the man who died this afternoon i think that he expects to find cirrhosis of the liver itll be rather a good thing if he does find that wont it she asked if it proves he was a bad life anyway he shrugged his shoulders i do not think it matters a great deal he died because he drank a bottle of whisky after amputation there was a little silence the police sergeant was here today she said he wanted me to answer a lot of questions he looked up i am ver sorry is that because you helped me in the operating she nodded im not sorry a bit if theres going to be a row im quite willing to be in it there is no reason for you to be in it he said you did nothing but to hand things to me when i wanted them and hold the light i shall say to the police that you had nothing to do with the operation dont do that she said just let things take their course and see what happens there is no reason for you to get into trouble with the police i dont mind getting into trouble with the police a bit she said i think id rather like to it was a good thing to have helped in and im glad i did it id rather like to have the chance of getting up in court or somewhere to say that its her red hair mr zlinter jane remarked quarrelsome young person isnt she she might be an australian there was a step on the veranda behind them and jack dorman appeared how do zlinter he said go on sit down you dont have to get up youre just the same as marie he dropped down into a chair beside them and laid his hat on the floor by him warming up he said been down to the howqua again i was there last saturday and sunday the czech said but it is now too hot i only caught two little fishes and those i set free to grow bigger the grazier glanced at jennifer has he been telling you how he found his own grave found his own grave she exclaimed you said something about that last night you dont know nothing yet jack dorman said go on and tell her about it carl the czech laughed a little embarrassed it is nothing the girl said do tell me it is a stupid thing he said have you been into the valley of the howqua river miss morton the names jenny she said ive not been there yet thats the next valley isnt it over those hills that is the one he said it is very wild because there is no road to it and very few people have been there but once there was a town a town for the gold miners because there was a mine there you understand but now all that is finished and the town is finished because the forest fires they burnt it so that now there is nothing of the town left to see at all only a little machinery by the entrance to the old mine and nothing else at all only the stones in the old cemetery are there still because those the fire would not burn when did this happen carl she asked when was the town there fifty years ago he said it was nearly fifty years since all the people went away because the gold was finished and after that the fires came and there was no one living there to protect the town and so it was all burnt all except the headstones that is right i met mr dorman fishing in the howqua a month ago and we went together to find the stones that are on the graves and on one stone there is an inscription with my own name and my town in czechoslovakia he reached for his coat on the floor beside his chair and took a wallet from the inside pocket i have copied the inscription he took a paper unfolded it and handed it to her that is what is written on the stone jarfe dorman leaned over and they read it together the girl said what an extraordinary thing is your name charlie carl he replied and i was born in pilsen but not in he paused it is not so very extraordinary he said we were a large family with many branches in pilsen and many people from pilsen emigrated in this last century when times were hard the extraordinary thing is that i should have found the grave i myself with the same name he paused and turned to the grazier i wondered if you have ever heard the name in this country so that i could find out who this charlie zlinter was he was certainly a relation of some kind jack dorman shook his head ive never heard the name he said i dont suppose anybody in this country could tell you anything about him now i should think youd find out something more easily in pilsen get the names of people who left for australia at the end of the last century the czech shook his head it is not possible to find out anything from pilsen now he said i do not even know who i could write to there to ask and if i did write any letter might make trouble from the russians they do not like people who get letters from the west why did it say charlie zlinter and his dog asked jennifer was the dog buried with him i do not know i would like to know ver much jack dorman said i think youll have a job to find out much now after fifty years there would not be a record of deaths in the shire what about the parish register the girl asked i doubt it dorman said slowly i never heard there was a church in howqua the nearest church would be in banbury if there was one there then i shouldnt think that theyd have taken much account of what went on at howqua there might have been a shire officer there but i rather doubt it these goldmining towns were pretty free and easy in those days would there have been a policeman living in the town asked zlinter i shouldnt think so not in theyd send police out from banbury if there was any trouble it is not likely then that there would be any record of charlie zlinter anywhere its just a chance said dorman if he belonged in banbury if he lived there you might find something about him at the shire hall its just possible there may be descendants in the district people of the same name sons or grandsons though i never heard the name before apart from that the only thing would be to find somebody who was living in the howqua at the time they might remember something about this charlie zlinter some old person would it be easy to find such an old person i shouldnt think it would those goldmining towns they werent settled places if you know what i mean people went there to take up claims and work the gold if it didnt work out right for them they went off to some other place west australia or south africa maybe where there was gold to be found they didnt stay around where there wasnt any gold i think youll have a job to find anybody who was living at howqua then the czech said quietly that is very bad luck he seemed so disappointed that jennifer asked is it very important he smiled at her it is not important at all he said only if a member of my family had been here before me i would have liked to know presently jane went to the kitchen door and rang the handbell on the veranda to warn tim and mario that it was five oclock and time to knock off for tea jack dorman took the czech off for a wash he came back to the veranda presently and found jennifer there alone he said laughing i must try to remember the way to behave this will be the first time that i have eaten in a private house since i left germany nearly two years she was appalled at the casual statement is that really true but yes i do not think that i know anybody in australia yet although i have been here for fifteen months hotels and bars and cinemas i know those this is the first time that i have entered a persons home she did not know what to say i suppose you dont meet many people living up there in the camp he smiled ordinary people keep away from camps and sometimes for good reason and i have spent much of my life in camps since i have lived always in camps with practically no break twelve years l really do not know how ordinary people live he laughed over the meal they talked of small casual matters of the countryside and afterwards in the cool of the evening they sat on the veranda smoking when in the dusk he took his leave dorman offered to run him back to lamirra he refused that saying that jim forrest was coming out of town and would pick him up upon the road they did not press it thinking that perhaps he meant to stop at the hotel and have a drink on his part he was unwilling to extend their hospitality and preferred the fourmile walk back to lamirra jennifer strolled across the paddocks with him to the road she knew that the matter of charlie zlinter and his dog was still upon his mind and she raised the subject for him in case he wanted to talk about it its funny about that headstone she said charlie zlinter i would like to find out something about charlie zlinter he said i think he must have been related to me in some way all of the zlinters in pilsen are uncles or cousins of each other he turned to her when you leave your own place and you start again in a new country with nobody that you know it is wonderful to find that someone of your family has been there before he said even fifty years before it makes a tie with your own home and however good the new country may be unless you know somebody in it you are not a part of it they walked on in silence for a time she had not met such loneliness before you know some real people now anyway she said you know the dormans and me more substantial than charlie zlinter i hope youll come and see us again some time i would like to do that he said but also i would like to find out about charlie zlinter and his dog she laughed i believe youve been making it all up i dont believe theres any such person really he laughed with her i promise you that it is true i would say that i would take you there and show you the stone but it is ten miles to walk and ten miles back some day when mt dorman goes with mr fisher in the landrover to fish in the howqua you must come with him and i will show you the stone thats a bargain she said id like to do that some day i should be much honoured if you would he said they walked across the last paddock to the road in silence it was nearly dark at the gate on to the road he turned to her now i must say goodbye i am afraid that i have been awkward in company this evening and i ask if you will forgive me youve not been awkward a bit she said youve been very interesting and very charming mr zlinter i hope youll come again he laughed diffidently it is many years since i have been in company with people of good family like you you must forgive the awkward things i must have done but i would like to come again and some clay i would like to take you to the howqua to see the stone well fix that somehow or other she said goodnight carl dont get run over on the way back and dont stop at the pub too long goodnight miss jennifer he said formally thank you again for all that you have done for me i shall not stop at the pub tonight at all i bet she laughed goodnight come and see us again she walked back across the paddocks deep in thought she found jane sitting on the veranda with jack dorman angela was away with friends in banbury driving her mothers morris jane said i rather like carl zlinter jennifer dropped down into a chair its extraordinary she said hes been in the country fifteen months and this is the first time that hes been inside a private house is that right asked jack dorman thats what he said jane said slowly well i can understand that in a way although it sounds rather awful theyre a pretty rough lot up at lamirra before that camp started up jack and i used to go down sometimes to the hotel and have a glass of beer and chat with mrs hawkey the landlady but we havent been for a long time too many drunks from the lumber camp yes from lamirra of course hes different to the ordinary lumberman jack dorman explained hes an educated man there was a little silence i dont suppose he thinks much of australia and australians jane said he thinks its a lovely country jennifer told her he doesnt want to live anywhere else only hed like to know some people thats why hes so keen to find out something about charlie zlinter and his dog in the dim light jane stared at her but charlie zlinters dead i know all the same hes the only person in australia that dr zlinter knows outside the lumber camp my dear i think thats rather touching i thought that too the girl said i told him he must come and see us here again i hope you dont mind it seemed such rotten luck of course jenny i liked him makes a change to talk to somebody whos lived outside the shire of banbury he wants to take me over to the howqua some time to see his tombstone she said id like to see it and id like to see the howqua but im not going to walk ten miles there and ten miles back in this hot weather jane said you dont have to walk ten miles to get into the howqua surely you can ride over on a horse i cant said jennifer id fall off jack dorman said you could probably get into the howqua in a utility in this dry weather you can get in in a landrover any time of year its easy going on the track this side the other sides a bit steep you could leave the utility parked up in jock mcdougalls paddock on the top of the ridge and walk down to the river thatd only be about two miles zlinter can drive i suppose i really dont know jennifer said i should think he could i never met a doctor yet who couldnt drive a car said jane he wouldnt be used to driving on our side of the road anyway said jennifer aw look jack dorman said theres only a mile and a half of road before you turn off on the track across the paddocks up into the timber he wont hit anything in that distance if you want to get into the howqua make him drive you up to jock mcdougalls paddock and then walk you can take the chev thats awfully good of you the girl said well ask if he can drive if he turns up again id be afraid he might smash the chev up its worn out anyway ive been thinking we should get a landrover to replace it thats enough of that said jane weve got too many cars already im going to have my painting before we get another car i thought youd forgotten about that he said indeed i havent its just that i dont know how to get the sort of painting that i want im not going to have one of those modern things we saw in melbourne jennifer went to bed that night unreasonably happy she was deeply grateful to jack dorman for his casual offer of the old utility she had wanted to do something to ease the loneliness of carl zlinter but she had been powerless to do much about it by herself she was still happy next morning till the postman came by just before dinner and mario went down to pick up the mail from their box on the mam road there was a letter from her father airmailed from england the happiness went from her face and was succeeded by a troubled frown jane saw it and said casually everything all right at home not absolutely the girl said mummys been in bed with bronchitis they seem to have had terrible weather in england of course its january not serious is it oh no the thing is that when mummys ill it makes things hard for daddy theyve only got a woman who comes in in the mornings she paused it happened last winter and i took ten days of my holiday and went up there and ran the house l didnt bargain on it happening again this winter she said no more but she was troubled at the thought of difficulties in the snow and rain of the midlands so far away it needed a strong mental effort to picture the conditions of an english winter in the australian summer heat though she had left so recently at dinner jack dorman said im going in this afternoon to meet jim forrest at the hospital anyone got anything for the post i shall have jennifer said i want to write an airmail to my mother ill let you have it after dinner what time are you going not till about three ill write it as soon as weve cleared away jack dorman drove into banbury in the new utility posted jennifers letter before he forgot it and drove round to the hospital jim forrests car was parked in the street he parked behind it and went in a new australian wardmaid told him that mr forrest was with dr jennings in the office he put his head in at the door come in mr dorman said the doctor i was just telling jim here about these men he was a small brownhaired man with a sandy little moustache and blue eyes he had been an officer in the royal australian army medical corps in the war and he still had the appearance of an officer in civvies jack dorman went in and sat down whats the news doctor i was telling jim the doctor repeated ive just finished the postmortem the man was an alcoholic all right you never saw such a liver im preserving part of it in spirit until after the inquest just in case anybody wants to see it he was full of whisky too jim forrest said with feeling he must have been he certainly was matter of fact i should have thought there was more than a bottle in him but i suppose im wrong there was certainly a lot he paused i had a look at the amputation while i was at it it was carefully done one of the ligatures was damaged a little probably while he was struggling but the job was done all right jim forrest said hed have been right but for the whisky i wouldnt say that sepsis might easily have set in as i understand it the amputation was done out in the open to free him from the bulldozer all i can say is that the job was well done from the surgical point of view jack dorman said it wasnt a botched job no it wasnt a botched job the damaged ligature was clearly the result of a blow he probably kicked it against something in the struggle while you were trying to keep him in bed jim forrest nodded he was thrashing about all over the place there was a pause as regards the other one the doctor said the fractured skull its much the same story i took an xray this morning if i had been doing the job here id have taken an xray before operating of course if i had done so i should probably have removed one more small piece of bone that zlinter has left in working without the xray as he did i should very likely have left it as he did considering the xray this morning i decided to leave well alone i dont really think that itll make much difference and one doesnt want to submit the patient to a further operational shock he paused there again infection is the danger zlinter showed me what he did and i dont think anybody could have done much more but theres no denying that the conditions were bad for any cranial surgery jack dorman said taking it by and large though he didnt do a bad job i think thats a fair statement taking it by and large he didnt do at all a bad job considering the difficulties youll tell them that at the inquest doctor will you asked jim forrest thats right thats what i shall say at the inquest jack dorman said if he can do a job like that why cant he be a doctor properly get a licence or whatever you call it theres a ruling about these immigrant doctors in this state theyve got to do the last three years of their training over again it varies according to the state i think i know its easier in west australia pack of bloody nonsense said the grazier we could do with another doctor here and now weve got one and were not allowed to use him youve got to have a rule jennings said most of these dp doctors are crook doctors oh my word youd be the first to raise a scream if some of them got loose upon your family thats right is it asked jim forrest theyre very bad i dont really know the doctor said youd have to ask somebody who knows about these things i believe the truth of it is this when theyre first qualified their standard is much lower than ours what they pick up from experience in practice may bring them up to our standard but whos to say take this zlinter for example he seems to be a careful sort of chap and since he qualified hes had a very wide experience of surgery in frontline conditions with the german army youve seen him at his best he certainly knows a lot about these sort of accidents but thats not general practice ninety per cent of the general practitioners job is trying to decide if an old ladys pain is heart trouble or wind or whether a kiddys got scarlet fever or a sore throat zlinter may be useless at that sort of thing probably is he paused i dont want you to think im against zlinter he said i think hes a good man if he was qualified id like to see him practise in this district and take some of the work off me but not until hes been checked over at the hospital and been passed out as competent and that takes three years i dont know if that would apply to zlinter i dont know if they make any exceptions probably not i think he probably would have to do three years again it seems the hell of a long time the grazier said the doctor got up from the desk he had still a lot of work ahead of him its better to be safe than sorry the grazier went out into the street with the timber manager what about a beer they got into their cars and drove down to the main street and parked under the shade of the trees in front of the queens head hotel it had been market day in banbury but the market was over before dinner and now in the late afternoon only the dregs of the crowd remained in town the bars which had been hot and crowded most of the day were thinning out the tired barmen were relaxing watching the clock for closing time at six jack dorman and jim forrest went into the saloon bar and ordered beers and stood discussing what they had learned from the doctor about zlinter it was still warm and the beer was very cold they had a glass of beer and then another and another in the space of twenty minutes as they stood their talk was mostly about zlinter how he would be situated at the end of his two years of lumber work whether he would have a chance to qualify as a doctor how much it would cost whether he could raise the money on a loan from any bank whether if he had the money he could get admission to a hospital the bar that they were standing in was merely a partitioned part of the long barroom but it was select and mostly frequented by graziers and those with money to spare drinks at this portion of the bar cost a trifle more and there were little plates of onions cheese and other snacks all highly spiced to induce a pleasant thirst a yard away from jack dorman and jim forrest as they discussed carl zlinter was an old man sitting hunched upon a stool a redhaired old man now turning grey but still fiery on top a broadshouldered old man who must have been a very strong man in his time he had a comical twist to his mouth and a general appearance of good humour and he was drinking whisky evidently determined to sit it out until the bar closed from his appearance he had been there all the afternoon presently the barman said last drinks and the clock stood at two minutes to six jim forrest hurriedly ordered four more beers and the barman pushed the dripping glasses across the counter the old man by their side sat sunk in reflection or in slumber a half glass of whisky before him they drank two beers apiece and then at ten past six the barman said were closing now and it was time to go he said to the old man come on pop closing now the old man did not stir but mumbled something incoherent jack dorman smiled and put his hand on the old mans shoulder come on pat he said time to go home now finish up your drink got your jinker here the old man raised his head and very slowly lifted his glass and drank it off with the utmost deliberation jim forrest smiled who is he pat halloran hes got a place five miles out on the benalla road jack knew the old man fairly well he had come out from southern ireland as a stableboy at the end of the last century and he had been about the district ever since but for one trip home to limerick between the wars he was a widower and his two sons ran the property and did most of the work he enjoyed coming into market and meeting his cronies and getting drunk a simple pleasure that he could afford on his fivefigure income his sons drove large and powerful utilities rather too fast but the old man had never learned to drive a car and came to town each market day in a jinker a twowheeled trap drawn by an old horse jack dorman smiled again waited till the old man had drained his glass and said come on pat its closing time were getting thrown out of here where did you leave your jinker its in the yard out at the back the barman said take him out through this way if you like take the other arm jim said jack dorman well put him in the jinker and hell be right the old man got down from the stool and they steadied him one on each side thats right he said with a marked irish accent sure put me up in the jinker and ill be right he paused for reflection and they began walking him to the back premises and the yard i know you he said youre jack dorman up to leonora thats right the old man turned and stared at the timber manager with bleary eyes i dont know you jim forrests the name from lamirra oh dyou know my name its pat halloran from limerick thats right said jack dorman i know you and you know me watch these steps now three steps down thats fine im right the old man said only im drunk i know you youre jack dorman up to leonora he swayed wildly and they steered him into the passage the barman holding the door open for them its a shameful thing im telling you he said seriously but im drunk drunk as charlie zlinter the grazier started whats that pat who am i as drunk as drunk as charlie zlinter the old man repeated i know you youre jack dorman up to leonora you know me pat halloran from limerick you know me i know you and you know charlie zlinter good old charlie i dont know charlie zlinter pat the other said who was charlie zlinter it was quite possible that this old man could have been in the district when howqua was a thriving township pat halloran turned bellicose he checked in the passage he was still a powerful man and brought them to a standstill what was that you would be saying who was charlie zlinter havent i heard with my own ears you two talking all the while of charlie zlinter is it a fool that yed be making of me just because im having drink taken will ye fight me now nobodys making a fool of you pat and i wont fight you said the grazier come on lets find the jinker tell us about charlie zlinter when you knew him and ill tell you what i know about him and therell be a pair of us what did charlie zlinter do he got bloody drunk the old man said i got bloody drunk you got bloody drunk sure were all bloody drunk they came into the stable yard and there was the jinker the horse patiently waiting to take his master home jim forrest untied the reins from the tethering ring tried the girth and looked the harness over while jack dorman steadied the old man shes right he said the grazier said the jinkers right pat can you get up in it the old man grabbed the splashboard and the seatrail put one foot upon the step and swung himself up into the seat the habit of fifty years undefeated by alcohol he took the reins and lifted the whip from the socket ill be right boys he said sure an ill be wishing you a very good evening now that he was in his vehicle he seemed to be at home indeed he looked almost sober the grazier stood for a moment at the wheel looking up at the old man what else did charlie zlinter do pat besides getting drunk the old man stared down at him charlie zlinter and then he stood up in the jinker and recited with dramatic flourishes of the whip that made the grazier retreat hurriedly charlie zlinter and his heeler hound fell into the howqua and got bloody well drowned be warned fellow sinners and never forget if he hadnt been drunk hed have been living yet he touched the horse skilfully with the whip and drove out of the yard the grazier was left facing jim forrest who was laughing what the hell was all that about jack the grazier scratched his head charlie zlinter he replied but i reckon its a different charlie zlinter to the one we know eight carl zlinter arrived in banbury at about nine oclock on saturday morning riding in the back of a utility that had picked him up upon the road in that sparselypopulated district where trucks and utilities were the normal transport it was not difficult to get a ride into town in something or other he had never had to walk more than half an hour in the direction of the town without getting picked up he had not breakfasted and he went and had it in a cafe bacon and two eggs and coffee they gave him a melbourne paper two days old to read and he sat smoking a cigarette after it enjoying the leisure when he paid the bill he said to the girl who had served him do you know a family called shulkin they are new australian the man works on the railway she looked at him blankly she came of a family of australians that had been casual labourers for generation after generation bad stock and mentally subnormal she and her family were bitterly hostile to all immigrants especially the european ones who worked too hard and were guilty of the social crime of saving money thereby threatening the australian way of life never heard of them she said scornfully he looked at her with clinical interest as he paid his bill wondering if she were tubercular in spite of his decision to abandon medicine he could not rid himself of interest in symptoms a wasserman test would be interesting and probably positive he smiled at her and went out and walked down the long wide treelined avenue of the main street towards the railway station the booking office was closed because upon this singletrack line there were only two trains a day but the stationmaster lived beside the station in a weatherboard house and he asked there for mr shulkin the stationmaster said aw look stan shulkin hes not working today theres a greenpainted shack the third house down this road with an old railway coach they use for sleeping in alongside youll find stan there unless hes in the town he found the shack and railway coach a poor sort of habitation there was a man digging in the garden a man of about fortyfive or fifty with black hair going bald on top behind the railway coach he saw a freshfaced woman with a dumpy peasant figure hanging out some washing and there were a couple of children playing in the background he opened the gate and went in and spoke to the man are you stan shulkin the man straightened up and said with an equally marked accent i am stanislaus shulkin the czech said in german my name is carl zlinter and i work in the timber camp at lamirra do you prefer to speak english always the man said always i speak english it is better for the children the wife she speaks it very bad she does not try carl zlinter said you must excuse but i have heard that you can paint very good pictures the man smiled shyly across his broad face i paint pictures only now one or two each year he said there is not time and people here do not want pictures when i came first to this place three years ago i said now i will paint pictures and we shall make much money but it did not happen in that way now i paint only a little you work upon the railway in the platelaying gang it is very hard work and not good for the hands for painting i do not think that i shall paint many more pictures you are esthonian lithuanian the man said i am from kaunas i am from pilsen zlinter said in my country i was a doctor but now i am a labourer the man nodded in comprehension i have friends who want a picture they are not artistic but they have much land and plenty of money they are more educated than some and they have bought all the motorcars that they can use and now they want an oil painting so said the lithuanian i would have thought it would have been a radio or a washing machine they will have those also said zlinter but the woman wants an oil painting she has seen exhibitions of ugly pictures in melbourne and those she does not want she is simple and she wants a beautiful picture that will give pleasure to those who do not understand about pictures there is a man called spiegel in the camp who told me you can paint such pictures i can paint such pictures shulkin said i can paint any sort of picture may i see shulkin led the way into the railway coach it had been an open coach without compartments at one time now it had been roughly converted into three rooms with matchboarding partitions much of the seating still remained unchanged and each of the three rooms still had two doors upon each side the end room that they went into was furnished with a bed an easel and a great litter of old canvases and frames stacked along one side i buy old canvases and frames at the sale the artist said it is cheaper so he pulled out a canvas from the heap a beautifully executed still life of two herrings on a plate a loaf of bread a pat of butter and a glass of beer laid out in strong light on a soiled tablecloth with a dark background this i did in the camp i call it lithuanian fishermans breakfast he plucked another canvas from the heap and set it on the easel in place of the still life this a portrait of my mother the stern old face glowered at them from the canvas a powerful picture finely executed he whisked it away and planted another canvas on the easel this the delatite river it was a bright river scene with a fine blue sky and white clouds and a riot of golden wattles on the bank making a delicate harmony of colour so said carl zlinter this you should show her the others they are beautiful in a different way but this or something like this is what she wants i can paint anything she wants the artist remarked but usually they cannot say the czech stood back and looked critically at the river scene i do not know pictures he said at last but i would think that this is very good he paused you must have had a great deal of experience i studied in paris and in rome the platelayer replied i was professor of artistic studies in the university of kaunas there did not seem to be anything to say to that zlinter stayed a little while and had a cup of tea i will tell mrs dorman about you he said if she wants a beautiful picture she does not need to go to melbourne for it she can find it here in banbury i will tell her this evening he went off presently and caught a bus out on the benalla road twenty minutes later he was walking up to the halloran homestead a small girl came to the kitchen door and he asked for mr pat halloran she turned and called into the house ma theres a feller asking for grandpa in the wood shed hes in the wood shed she said round there in the wood shed zlinter found a redhaired old man splitting sawn logs with a sledgehammer and wedges doing the work with the skill of a lifetime rather than with any great muscular effort please he said may i speak to you the old man rested on his sledge an who might you be my name is zlinter charlie zlinter the czech said i work in the timber camp up at lamirra sure an you cant be charlie zlinter charlie zlinters dead these fifty years i am another one with the same name i am trying to find out about the one who died an what made you come here may i ask mr jack dorman he said you were talking about charlie zlinter in the queens head on thursday whos this jack dorman jack dorman at leonora sure an i havent set eyes on the man these last six months perhaps you do not remember the czech said diplomatically he helped you up into the jinker on thursday would that be so well glory be to god i didnt know a thing about it would you believe that now he evaded the rhetorical question jack dorman said that you were speaking of this charlie zlinter i have seen the grave ye have not charlie zlinter was buried in the howqua and the fire went through theres nothing left there now the headstones are left the other said they are stone and so they did not burn the headstones are there now all of them in the forest by the river where there was the cemetery do ye tell me that he had gained the old mans interest and he held it while he explained the position to him this charlie zlinter he was from pilsen in bohemia he said at last that is on the stone i am another charlie zlinter also from pilsen in bohemia i am trying to find out what i can about him the old man leaned on his sledge he was a bullocky he said at last i wouldnt be able to say at this distance of time if he worked for himself or if he worked for murphy he drove a wagon with a team of bullocks six bullocks or eight would it have been holy saints above im losing all my memory i couldnt say at all if it was six or eight i was just a bit of a boy myself i came out to this country in while the old queen was on the throne god rest her soul i worked two years in the stables for jim pratt that had the queens head in those days and then i joined the police there was work for a policeman in this country then do you remember charlie zlinter the czech asked sure i do that he was a german and he drove a bullock team in and out of the howqua from the railway here to howqua and back again there wasnt a fine broad highway then with the motorcars all racing along at sixty miles an hour there wasnt hair nor hide of a made road at all at all bullocks were the only teams to get a wagon up over the spur and down into the howqua passengers and machinery and food and drink and everything all went by bullock team will ye believe what i tell you the bullock drivers were the boys that made the money the miners they never did much in the howqua and in the end the company went broke what gold there was went into the pockets of the bullock drivers not a breath of it did the shareholders ever see what was charlie zlinter like ah he was a fine big fellow with dark curly hair and he spoke english in the way you speak it he was one for the booze and he was one for the girls holy saints above he had a cabin in the town at howqua for he went there as a miner first of all and then he had the wit to see hed make more money with a wagon and a team by the mother of god id think shame to repeat all that went on in that cabin he was a big lusty man and drink and women were his downfall thats the truth im telling you he paused drink and women drink and women he said its a sad sad thing he shot a humorous glance at zlinter he used to drive in here the one day and back the next twentyone miles each day hed come in here the one evening and then hed be away up to the howqua the next day ten hours or so it might take him and he had two teams one resting and one working he used to come to the queens head hotel and hobble the bullocks on the green outside and feed them hay and then hed come into the hotel and get drunk and hed sleep in the wagon and away off out of it next morning back to the howqua and as like as not thered be a young girl going to the howqua for a barmaid in peter slims hotel a girl no better than she should be or she wouldnt be going to the howqua he thought for a minute they were fine noble days those times when we were all young what did he die of drink and drowning the old man said drink and drowning and his dog with him only the dog wasnt drunk though it might have been at that the company it kept it was august and the river was running full with the melting snows there was a girl living in the howqua by the name of mary nolan oh a wicked girl id think shame to tell you all that that girl did and she so soft and well spoken and pretty too she lodged on the other side of the river from the buller arms hotel that peter slim kept billys father him thats the forest ranger in the howqua now and charlie zlinter he stayed in the hotel till close on midnight and then he made to go across the river to see this girl well most parts of the year yed cross the howqua and never wet your feet by stepping on the stones but in august and september with the melting of the snows on the high mountains it runs five or six feet deep there was a cable bridge a bridge of two wire ropes with planks across the way youd walk on them and a third one to hold on to and charlie zlinter drunk the way he was must go across this bridge ta see this girl yed think now for a man as drunk as charlie to go on a bridge like that at midnight would have been enough but he must take the dog with him he had this heeler dog he kept for rounding up the bullocks and to guard the wagon when he was in banbury and he must take it with him over the river and when he came up to the bridge the dog wouldnt go upon it and so charlie picked it up in his arms and started off across the bridge in the dark night with the dog in his arms and the bridge swaying and going up and down with every step he took and he as drunk as a lord and that was the end of it he fell off the bridge into the water he did that they found him half a mile downstream come the morning him and the dog together there was never a priest there to say a mass for him and they buried him and the dog in the one grave which the priest would never have allowed he paused aye it was a sad thing he was a fine noble boy it made a great wonder in the countryside for he was well known on account of coming in and out of banbury and people riding with him and they put a poem in the paper about him ah a lovely lovely poem did ye never hear it the czech shook his head the old man declaimed charlie zlinter and his heeler hound fell into the howqua and unhappily drowned be warned fellow sinners and never forget if he hadnt been drunk hed have been living yet ah he said it was a lovely lovely poem this charlie zlinter was almost certainly some relation of my own said the czech because he came from my own town did you ever hear anything about him who his relations were or who he wrote to did he leave any papers to say that sure an i wouldnt know a thing like that at all the old man said i was a policeman in those days and on other duties i only knew about him from the gossip of the time i wouldnt know what happened to his gear it was soon after that the mine closed down and howqua came to an end within the year there were only a few people living in the place i wouldnt say that anyone took on the bullock team after he passed away i wouldnt know the howqua was going down and there wasnt the work there had been in the beginning carl zlinter asked you do not know what happened to his papers ah i wouldnt know at all theres only one person left might know about a thing like that who is that sure mary nolan herself mary nolan is she still alive ah shes alive she was a wicked girl and father geoghegan he was the priest here then he would have nothing to do with her until she came to the confession and that she would not do and holy mother of god its not to be wondered at and so when the mine closed down and everybody left the howqua what must she do but go for a barmaid at woods point in the hotel there and very strict she came to be so that there was no loose talk or dirty jokes in mary nolans bar i did hear that she made her peace with father obrian from warburton who went to woods point in those days and like enough he didnt know the whole of it and then she married a man called williams who lived on an allotment out by jamieson and they lived there until he died at the beginning of the second war and then she sold the place and went to live at woods point with her brotherinlaws family id say shed be living there yet i havent heard she died she must be old now said the czech seventyfive maybe the old man said indignantly shed not be a day older than seventyfive thats not so old at all sure theres many a man fit and hearty at the age of seventyfive do you think that mary nolan might have kept charlie zlinters papers or know what happened to them when he was drowned ah i wouldnt be saying that at all shes the only person living in the district now that might know something though its a long while ago ill say this now she knew charlie zlinter better than anyone else and better than she had any right to as a single woman carl zlinter left him presently and walked back ulto the town and got there in time for dinner he went to a different cafe for his meal where they were kinder to the new australian and got a lift out halfway to merrijig in a truck driven by george pearson on his way to buttercup he walked for two miles then for it was saturday afternoon and there were few people on the road and finally got picked up by the storekeeper from lamirra driving out of town in his utility he got down at the gate of leonora and walked across the paddocks to the homestead he was just in time tor tea and they made him welcome he said to jack dorman it is quite correct what you have told me about mr pat halloran and charlie zlinter i have learned a great deal of my relative this morning what did you find out asked jennifer he cocked an eye at her i found out that he was a very bad man l do not think that i can say all that he did with ladies in the room jane and jennifer laughed you can keep the juicy bits to tell jack afterwards jane said tell us the rest jennifer asked what did he do for a living he was a bullock team driver said the czech he drove a wagon and a team from the railway at banbury to the town at the howqua river is that what he did jack dorman exclaimed the pieces of the puzzle were beginning to fall together now a bullocky driver would have been well known in banbury and his death would be remembered longer than if he were a transient miner the verse that pat halloran had declaimed would not have been composed except for a man of some local reputation good or bad did you find out anything else about him zlinter told them the story as they sat at tea mrs williams jane said thoughtfully old mrs joshua williams would that be used to live at sharon out past jamieson i do not know he said i did not hear the name of the station only that she married a man called williams i think that must be the one she turned to jack you remember old mrs williams the one who used to breed geese when we came here first you remember we got six goslings from her and they all died but one the first year we were here didnt her husband die and she went to woods point i remember those bloody goslings jack dorman said emphatically they were no good when we bought them and she knew it id have made a row and got my money back but we were new here then and i didnt want to start out with a row she went to live at woods point didnt she i dont remember easily find out im sure she was the one they finished tea and washed the dishes and went out on the veranda and sat down jack dorman gave his guest a cigarette inquests on monday morning he said youll be there i suppose carl zlinter smiled a little wryly i shall be going with mr forrest he said i think he will come back without me because i shall be in prison thats not going to happen the doctors on your side and its what he says that counts he shrugged his shoulders i would not care a great deal if i went to prison he said so long as it should stop at that but in my state if i should do a crime in this two years i think they can send me back to germany into a camp that would be very bad jennifer said theyd never do that carl its not going to be like that at all he shrugged his shoulders gloomily it could happen she laughed theyd have to send me too because i helped he turned to her will you be at the inquest ill be there the police rang up this morning and said they wanted me it would be different for you if this went badly he said the worst that they could do for you would be to send you back to england and that is your home this place is now the home for me and this is where i want to stay nothing like thats going to happen jack dorman said shortly theyve got more sense i hope that that is true it seemed to jennifer that he was taking this very badly but in his position that might be inevitable she did not like to think of him brooding all the weekend over possible deportation back into the displaced persons camps of europe you promised that youd take me to see charlie zlinters grave some time she said i want to see the howqua what about tomorrow he glanced at her smiling it seemed too good to be true i would like to take you there ver much he said but i think it is too far for you to walk jack said hed lend us the utility the chev could we go tomorrow mr dorman sure he said sundays the best day to take the chev he turned to zlinter say can you drive a car the czech smiled i can drive before the war i had a little car an opel in my own country and in the war i drove many cars and trucks i have not driven in australia and i have not got a licence ah look it dont matter about the licence not up here you can take the chev tomorrow if you want it the dark man beamed it is very very kind i will be ver careful of it mr dorman you wont be able to be careful of it not up on that howqua track but itll take you there all right up on to the top that is by jock mcdougalls paddock i wouldnt take it down the other side not down into the howqua valley i was telling jenny but that cuts it down to a twomile walk instead of ten he said again it is very very kind presently he said there is one other thing mrs dorman this morning i visited a new australian who can paint pictures a man called stan shulkin do you know about him no i know about him said her husband chap who works on the railway that is the man have you seen his pictures jack dorman shook his head i remember someone saying in the pub one day there was a new australian who can paint carl zlinter turned to jane i think it might be interesting to you to go down to his small house and see what he can paint he said i went there this morning i think perhaps that he could make the sort of picture that you want she laid her sewing down l want a really good picture carl done by a proper artist i dont want anything done by an amateur i want a good picture i do not know very much about pictures he replied i saw some very tine oil paintings this morning that this man had done i think that he could make a picture that you would enjoy she wrinkled her forehead has he ever studied anywhere i mean it might be difficult if i went there and his pictures were too bad for what i want you do see what i mean i understand he said he has studied in paris and in rome before the war he was professor of art studies in the university of kaunas i think he is a very good artist but whats he doing here he works as a labourer upon the railway she stared at him is that the only thing that he can find to do he shrugged his shoulders i do not know he came to australia three years ago as a displaced person and he was sent for his two years to work upon the railway here in banbury he has stayed here since and what else can he do here he has a house and easy work and a quiet life after the camps in germany he has tried to sell paintings a little but not many people buy an oil painting in banbury i think he could paint a picture that is what you like are his pictures pretty are the colours nice i saw a very beautiful picture of the delatite river in the spring all blue and golden with the wattles it looked like the river and the colours were ver beautiful that sounds the sort of thing she said id better go and see him she laughed it would be funny if i found the sort of picture that l want in banbury after searching all over melbourne for it jennifer walked down to the road with carl zlinter when he went away jane watched them disappear across the paddocks are you going with them tomorrow she asked he grinned give em a break i dont know that its a good thing she said i dont know that her father and mother would be very pleased they shouldnt have let her come twelve thousand miles away from home by herself then he said far as i remember your father and mother werent too pleased either i rather like him she said once you get used to the foreign way hes right he said as they were walking across the paddocks jennifer was saying i dont think theres anything to be afraid of in this inquest carl honestly i dont i do not think there is a need to be afraid he said but i shall be happy when it is over they cant possibly make any trouble he looked around him the moon was coming up and the bowl of the delatite valley was touched with a silvery light it was very quiet there is only one trouble that i would be afraid of he said quietly that is to be sent away from this country and back to europe are you so fond of it as that carl he was silent for a minute here is a beautiful empty country he said with freedom and opportunity and more than that a king to whom every man may appeal if there is injustice it is a great thing to have a king a leader to prevent the politicians and the bureaucrats from growing stupid the germans had the same idea in seeking for a fьhrer only they had the wrong man the english have managed so much better the americans also have discovered great men for their presidents in some way that is difficult to understand he paused i should be very unhappy if it happened that i had to leave this country he said i think i should too said jennifer im english of course but this is very lovely in many ways its like what england must have been a hundred years ago from what part of england do you come he asked from leicester she said thats where my home is i worked just outside london for a time before i came out here leicester he said i have heard the name but i do not know where it is its in the midlands she told him right in the middle of england a hundred miles or so from london what is it like there he asked is it beautiful she shook her head its a manufacturing town she told him one always likes the town that one was born in i suppose and i like leicester well enough but no i couldnt say its beautiful i think its rather ugly and when you worked in london what was that like i have never been to london i worked outside in one of the suburbs she said i was in an office there it wasnt very different from leicester really why did you come to australia he asked have you come here to live im not sure about that carl she said i had a grandmother who died and left me a little money she didnt want me to save it she wanted me to spend it in coming out here on a visit i think she thought that if i came out here id want to stay and that id have a happier life than if i lived in england englands very different now from what it was when granny was a girl and shed seen things decaying all her life i think she had an idea that if i came out here i might be getting back into the england that she knew seventy years ago when everything was prosperous and secure so he said and how do you find it ive been here such a little time its hard to say i really havent seen anything only a couple of days in melbourne and this little bit of country here from what you have seen what do you say its a lovely country the girl said prosperous yes its very prosperous secure i suppose it is nobody seems to be afraid an atom bomb is going to land next door tomorrow like we are in england no he said all that seems very far away from here here we are very far from enemies and a great distance between you and your enemy is still the best defence he turned to her i cannot tell you how i love this country for that reason perhaps best of all since i was a young man there has been this threat of war or war itself and death and marching and defeat and camps of homeless people and the threat of war again and of more marching of more death of more parting from ones home unending here in this place all that is put behind here is a country where a man can build a home without the feeling that all will be useless and destroyed next year here is a country where a man can live a sane and proper life even if it is only one little log hut in the middle of the woods for a home i love this country for those things because here one can gather a few toys around oneself a fishing rod or two some books a little hut a place to call ones own and all is safe if then a war must come to europe it may be roy duty to go to fight again upon the side that australia will be on and that i do not mind because after the war is over if i live i can come back to my little place here in australia my hut my fishing rods and my books and all will be quite safe and i can be at peace again he turned to her i am so sorry i have spoken too much im glad you did she said i wondered what made you so fond of this country now i think i understand a bit i think it is how all we homeless people feel he said people who have lost their own country want more than anything to find a place where they can build a new home round themselves without the fear that they will ever lose it again whatll you do when your time at the camp is up she asked where will you make your home i do not know that he said i think that it will be not very far from here they came to the road gate i have a strange idea in my head he said but i will not tell you now oh carl what is it he laughed perhaps i will tell you tomorrow are you sure that it will be all right if we go to the howqua id love to if youre free im not doing anything i will come here for you at about ten oclock ill be ready and ill have the lunch packed he made a stiff little bow till then goodnight miss jennifer if were going out tomorrow carl cut out the miss jennifer everybody calls me jenny here all right goodnight jenny goodnight carl on sunday mornings the dorman family slept late but jennifer was up by seven in the kitchen with which she was now tolerably familiar she was a fair cook in an unpractised way capable of interpreting and following a recipe with a reasonable chance of an acceptable result she made some pastry and cooked half a dozen sausages and made sausage rolls in the oven and having the oven hot she made a few jam tarts surveying the results of her efforts she came to the conclusion that it looked a bit light for a lumberman in the larder she found cold mutton and some cold potatoes and an onion and so set to work again and made a couple of enormous cornish pasties there were plenty of bananas and grapes and passion fruit in the house so she took some of those and then because the basket still looked empty she cut a pile of honey sandwiches jack dorman came out in his dressinggown and found her pondering my word he said hes not going home hungry she said anxiously do you think its enough he wont starve if he gets outside that lot what are you taking to drink she smiled i was wondering if you could let us have some beer beer was in short supply in that hot weather the expanding population had beaten the expanding beer output as it had beaten the output of everything else in australia ill let you have two bottles he grumbled im not going to give him any more thats awfully sweet of you he fetched the bottles and put them on the table hows he getting down here from the camp he asked hell get a lift down probably she said he said hed be here at ten oclock he may not find it easy on a sunday morning he said hell have to start off walking about nine or so ill take a run up the road in the chev after breakfast and pick him up if youll get breakfast for me before then janes sleeping in she glanced at the clock it was about halfpast eight ill have it on the table in a quarter of an hour breakfast was a running meal that day she fed jack dorman and then tim archer and mario and finally jane came out and sat down with a cup of tea it was still on the table when jack dorman came back with carl zlinter whom he had picked up on the road half a mile outside the camp morning carl said jennifer have you had any breakfast he said thank you i have had some coffee coffee is that all youve had he smiled in my country we do not eat a cooked breakfast but you eat a proper breakfast here dont you before going out in the woods jane said laughing go on carl sit down and let her cook you bacon and eggs she wants to do it he laughed with her all right thats better said jennifer breaking a couple of eggs into the pan i wouldnt like you to faint by the way especially if youre driving me in the chev hes been driving it this morning down from the camp said jack dorman you have to keep on telling him which side to drive on carl zlinter laughed it is the first time i have driven on the left side of the road and with the steering so in spite of that he proved himself to be quite a reasonable driver when they started off in the utility half an hour later it was still sunny and cloudless with the promise of another hot day jennifer opened the last paddock gate on to the main road at merrijig let the chev pass through and closed it carefully behind as she got back into the car she said did you bring your rod he shook his head i would not want to fish today it would not be sociable she laughed ive never seen anybody flyfishing id like to know how its done so he said it is very delicate and always one is learning something new that is why i like it because never do you come to the end of learning some new thing also it makes you go to beautiful deserted country and that also i like i will show you how to do it one day if you like but now the water is too warm the fish will not take a fly until the water grows more cold in march he drove across the bridge over the delatite and on up the road towards the lumber camp till after a mile or so he turned off into a paddock and they drove on a rough track across pastures for a time heading for the hills their passage stirred a great flight of white cockatoos from the trees they wheeled above the car brilliant against the deep blue sky before settling in the next paddock presently the track left the pastures and entered the woods and began to wind uphill through a forest of gum trees it was quiet in the dim aisles of the woods and scented fantastic parrots with brilliant red bodies and equally brilliant blue wings flew before them up the track and vanished in the glades its amazing the colours the girl from london said quietly dont birds have to camouflage themselves in this country he said i do not think that there are any beasts of prey to worry them such as leopards or wild cats i do not think that birds or koala bears have many enemies in this country she said i never thought id see such lovely birds flying about wild he smiled there are many lovely things in this country that one would not see in any other place the track wound up through the forest utterly deserted once or twice a wallaby started at their approach and went bounding away among the trees and once a red english fox with a great bushy tail crossed the track in front of them and vanished in the undergrowth perhaps hunting the occasional rabbit that appeared and looked at them and scuttled away with flashing scut and once carl zlinter said you have seen a koala bear never she said theyre little creatures arent they he did not answer but drove on for a few yards stopped the car and got out quickly and ran into the bush he was in time to catch the koala under the armpits as it clambered unhurried up a tree to get away from him he disengaged it gently and carried it to her on the track a tubby little brown animal with tattered fur that struggled feebly but did not seem particularly distressed by capture oh carl she said what a lovely little beast hes just like a teddy bear he did not understand the allusion i think he is a very old bear this he said his fur is bad you can stroke him if you like he will not hurt you but do not let him scratch you because his claws will be dirty and poisonous and a small wound may go bad he held the bear from behind gently controlling it while she stroked it its a wild one isnt it she asked puzzled he is a wild bear he told her he lives here in the forest but he seems so tame he doesnt mind being handled or stroked a bit he has no enemies in the woods he said no animal hunts koala bears to kill them only men and now that is forbidden very strongly because he has no enemies he has no fear what will happen if you let him go carl let him go and see he released the bear and they crouched beside him he looked from one to the other looked around then walked deliberately to a tree and began to climb up it holding on with the great claws upon each foot jennifer walked after him and stroked him as he went till he was out of reach he paid no attention to her they stood watching him as he slowly made his way up the trunk above their heads he is going up there for his dinner carl said he eats only the fresh shoots of the gum trees and he needs several different sorts of gum tree for good health that is why you cannot keep them in a cage as captives how did you get to know all that carl have you handled them before many times he told her in the woods felling the timber we come on them many times sometimes one in each day or more it is forbidden to kill them and they are so harmless nobody would kill them if he could help it sometimes as we fell the timber we find a tree with a bear in it and that we leave if possible till the next day when he has gone away sometimes it is necessary to fell that tree with the bear in it and usually he is only shaken and frightened a little so then we pick him up and put him in a smaller tree that we shall not fell in a part where we have been to and we shall not come again it is easy to handle them but you must not let them scratch they got back into the utility and went on up the track winding around the contours of the hills between the trees a rough rutted track more of a watercourse than a road presently they came out on top of the ridge there was a cleared pasture here or perhaps a natural clearing due to some geological formation that checked the growth of trees zlinter drove into it and stopped the car this is jock mcdougalls paddock he said here we must leave the car and walk for the rest of the way down to the howqua the paddock stood upon the summit of the ridge with a wide view across the wooded mountainous country to the south in the brilliant sunlight line after line of blue hills stretched to the horizon with here and there a thin wisp of smoke showing a fire oh carl she said what a marvellous place are there farms and people living in this country he shook his head here is nobody he said nobody at all he thought for a minute there where you see the smoke there is a forest fire a little one and there there may be men trying to control it and to put it out it could be also that somewhere in this country there would be another lumber camp as at lamirra where there would be men but except those there would only be the forest rangers there would not be more than three or five people in the whole of the country that you see she stared entranced how far does it go he shrugged his shoulders the sun is behind us we are looking to the south seventy or eighty miles perhaps the forest goes not more then comes the coastal plain i think of farms and pastures that they call gippsland and then the sea he stood looking over the wide blue expanse of forest with her this is another reason why i love this country he said quietly it is a little like my own home in bohemia she turned to him do you get homesick carl he shook his head not now i would not ever want to go back there to live so much is changed and i have changed so much myself also but i remember how it was at home when i was a schoolboy and this is like the forests are at home a little and so i am happy to be here he glanced down at her do you have big forests such as this in england you do not have them do you she shook her head not now it might have been like this in england two hundred years ago but its not now if this was england it would all be cut up into farms with roads and fillingstations and villages and towns and people everywhere theres nothing like this at home is it too big for you he asked does it frighten you its strange she said its very very lovely but its strange if i lived here i should have to get to know what you do in a big forest if you should be lost once i knew that i dont think id be afraid of it she paused its not as if it was full of lions and tigers he smiled only flies and mosquitoes very many of those and a few snakes but you are right in these forests there is nothing much to fear but your own ignorance he turned back with her to the utility to take her basket and she saw that he had put a flabby newspaper parcel on top of her basket of food and that he had brought a grill with him whats that she asked meat he said i brought some steaks with me to make a fire and grill them in the way of this country have you done that they are very good she said ive never done that carl but were going to have far too much food he smiled if there is too much we can take it home or give it to billy slim can we make a fire in the forest carl without setting everything alight at this time of year it is necessary to be very careful he said at the howqua by the river there are stones built up to make a fireplace and there billy slim allows a fire to be made the fishermen cook steaks there sometimes i have done thar myself he would not let her carry anything and they set off down the track through the woods into the valley as they went he told her billy slims story of the match that had burned blue down in the open paddock in the valley and the fire that jumped i have not seen that in the two summers i have been here he said one might work in the woods for fifty years and never see that thing yet i think that it is true that was the fire that burned the town that was here she asked he nodded one of them i will show you where the town was presently through the green aisles ahead of them and below they saw a turn of the river and then another they dropped down into the valley flat and came out on an open sward beside the river where no trees were growing a meadow of perhaps five acres along the river bank on the other side of the river in among the trees there was the iron roof of a weatherboard house that is where billy slim lives he told her the forest ranger he put the basket and the grill down under a tree that stood alone in the meadow not far from the river this is where the town was he said she looked round startled where here here where we are standing in this flat he said there were many houses here fifty years ago and in the trees up the hill where we have come there was absolutely nothing to distinguish the place from any other natural glade in the forest no sign of any habitation but the forest rangers house it seems incredible that it has gone so completely she said and so soon how many houses were there here he shrugged his shoulders a hundred perhaps more there were three hotels he moved a little way from the tree can you see the line here the rectangle and here another room and here these bricks this was the buller arms hotel that billy slims father kept here came the girls to serve as barmaids to the miners the naughty girls if that old irishman was right he paused only fifty years ago and now all is gone she had great difficulty in believing it she said carl how have the trees recovered so quickly these trees are very big some of them have they all grown up since the last fire fire does not kill the gum trees he told her all other trees die in the forest fire but not the eucalypts after the fire when everything is burned to blackened stumps you think the forest will be spoiled for ever but next spring the gum trees shoot again and in a very few years all is as it was before he turned and showed her blackened streaks upon the bark of the tree they stood under you can see this one has lived through the fire only the gum tree can live through the fire like that all other trees are killed i think that that is why these forests are all eucalypts where is the cemetery she asked it is a mile down the river perhaps a mile and a half he said there is a path that leads to it but it is very overgrown also it crosses the river three or four times and it is necessary to walk through the water would you like for me to ask billy slim if he can lend a horse for you it will be easier for you so she laughed id fall off a horse carl i cant ride how deep is the water that weve got to walk through i do not think it will be deeper than your knees well thats all right i dont mind getting these shoes wet itll be rather nice to paddle on a day like this the sun blazed down upon them as they stood it was unthinkable that wading in the river could be anything but pleasant they left the basket of food hung up on a branch of the tree and started off along the meadow by the river a clear trout stream running rippling over waterworn stones with alternate runs and pools presently the path led them down to the water and was seen emerging from the river on the far side among the bushes here is the ford zlinter said i will go first i do not think it will be deep he walked into the water and turned to look back at her she followed him gingerly the water was cool and refreshing about her ankles plucking at her slacks she stooped and rolled them up above the knee her blouse sagged open and he saw the soft curve of her breasts because in that hot weather she had little on he let his eyes rest for a moment in enjoyment and then quickly averted them in case she should see him looking she finished with her slacks and stood erect and found him studiously looking up the river betraying himself she knew what he had seen and coloured slightly but she did not mind her own eyes had rested once or twice on his brown chest and arms with secret pleasure she followed him across the river as it grew deep she reached out and took his hand and he guided her across in the thicket on the other side he said it would be better to put down your trousers now or you will get your legs scratched and she did so slightly turned away from him he went ahead of her on the narrow path forcing the bushes aside where they grew thickly and holding them back for her to pass the path wound along through the forest by the river a narrow track used only by the forest ranger and his horse and by an occasional fisherman on foot presently they crossed the river again and then a third time and a fourth as the path changed from side to side to avoid spurs and rocky outcrops it was very quiet in the forest the sunlight fell in dappled patches on the undergrowth through the sparse foliage of the gum trees an occasional parrot squawked and flew away ahead of them but they saw no animals they went on till they came to a red stone bluff on the north side of the river the path wound round this and carl zlinter stopped it is somewhere here he said there must have been a road here at one time from the town but there is nothing to see now l think the stones are over there somewhere jennifer said whats that over there by the white tree that is right that is one of them he guided her through the undergrowth of bracken and tea tree scrub and they came to the three stones that were still standing he stooped beside the farthest stone and rubbed the surface of it this is the one she stooped beside him and read the inscription she had never doubted his story but it was a satisfaction to her to see the carved letters with her own eyes charlie zlinter and his dog she said quietly it was nice of them to bury the dog with him he looked at her and smiled that old irishman he said the priest would not have allowed it but he did not know do you think he was a relation of yours carl perhaps he said i would like to think he was i would like to think that someone of my family had been here before me and had liked this place as i like it i think he must have liked it here because he had his cabin here somewhere not in banbury you would think a bullock team driver who drove every day between this place and banbury would have had his home in banbury where there was a railway and more life but it was not so he had his home here she looked up at him smiling would you like to have a home here he nodded soberly i would like that very much for many years i have now lived in camps always with other men and for at least another nine months i must still live so i would like very much to have a little cabin in the woods by a trout river like this one where i could come and live at the weekend and keep some books and be alone a little i would like that very much indeed you wouldnt be lonely he shook his head i have seen so much of other men all the time in all the camps you wont want a cabin in the woods in nine months time she said youll be off somewhere qualifying to be a doctor he shook his head i do not think that i shall be a doctor again it costs too much and three years of study is too long i do not think that i shall be a doctor what will you do when you leave the camp then carl he smiled perhaps i shall not leave the camp perhaps i shall go on as a lumberman thatld be an awful waste she said you ought to do something better than that it is a good life he replied i like living in the woods i like that very much if i had a cabin on the howqua here as charlie zlinter had that i could come to at the weekends i could be very happy as a lumberman until the lumber camp moved on and it was too far for you to come here for the weekends she said that is the danger he said i have already thought about that i think we shall be at lamirra for another two years but after that the camp may move he got to his feet and helped her up i have shown you what we came to see he said charlie zlinter and his dog who fell into the water and got drowned only fifty years ago and practically forgotten now i wonder if anybody in pilsen ever got to hear about it somebody would have written surely perhaps i do not know now i have shown you what we came to see let us go back to the centre of the town and i will take you to the restaurant and we will see our steak cooked on the grill she laughed with him a silver grill no he said in this place it would be a gold grill they walked back by the way that they had come at the meadow by the river he showed her the rough fireplace of a few stones heaped together remote from any inflammable scrub he gathered a few dry fallen branches from the gum trees and a handful of bark and laid the fire and put a match to it she was amazed to see how quickly and how easily a fire was made in that hot summer weather he laid the grill across the stones sprinkled the steaks with a little salt and laid them over the fire in ten minutes from the time that the fire was lit they were ready to be eaten its awfully quick this way she said and theyre delicious it is the best way to cook meat he said especially in this country the fire is easily made and the smoke of the gum tree adds a little to the flavour also we cook many steaks like this in the forest when we are at work they ate in silence sitting on the grass in the shade of the big tree where billy slims father had kept his hotel where the naughty girls came to work as barmaids where the bedrooms worked day and night and where small bags of waterworn gold once passed across the bar in payment for drinks and other recreations in the tree above their heads a ringtailed possum peeped down at them shyly wondering if these two intruders into his domain meant danger to his nest they lay smoking on the grass when they had finished eating carl the girl said at last you promised last night that youd tell me about your strange idea he raised himself on one elbow laughing noting the soft curve of her neck with quiet delight i have nearly told you that already what have you nearly told me that i want to build a cabin for myself here in the howqua valley i know that but whats the strange idea you will say that it is sentimental she raised herself and looked at him wondering what was coming of course i shall if it is it may not be any the worse for that what is it he looked down at the grass it was a stupid little fancy he said it was nothing tell me he raised his head laughing a little in embarrassment it was just this here have been many houses a hundred perhaps and three hotels at least i would like if i can to find where charlie zlinter had his house and build mine there on the same place she smiled why do you want to do that carl i do not know he said i just want to do it i think we are of the same family and i have to build my cabin somewhere i think that i would like to build it there i think thats rather nice carl you do not think it stupid she shook her head not a bit but how would you find out where charlie zlinter lived i would like to go and have a talk with billy slim presently he said but i do not think that he will know because he was not born at that time i think it is more likely that i would learn something from mary nolan she smiled one of the naughty girls he laughed with her yes one of the naughty girls but she will not be naughty now she must be over seventy years old shes sort of sterilized they laughed together that is right she rolled over and looked at him she wouldnt talk about that time would she she hesitated trying to choose her words i mean carl if she was a naughty girl when she knew charlie zlinter she wouldnt want to tell people about it when shes seventy years old he stared at her perplexed i had not thought of that you mean she might know things about him but she would not say because of what they did when she was young she nodded i should think youd have an awful job to get anything out of her shed have to know you very well before shed talk especially to a man he lay staring over the rippling lights of the river running over stones towards a dark pool it is not about personal things that i would ask her only about any papers that he might have had in his cabin or about what happened to his papers and his property after he was dead she smiled if she hadnt been a naughty girl she couldnt know anything about the inside of his cabin she replied she probably does know quite a lot she might tell another woman possibly but shed never tell you he turned to her would you come with me to see her perhaps she might talk to you she laughed i meant another woman of her age carl not a young one like me not unless i was a naughty girl like she was youd want another woman of her age you are pretty and young as she was when she knew charlie zlinter he said simply i think she might talk to you when she would not talk to me i dont mind going to see her with you jennifer said it would mean another of these delightful days if nothing else its just possible she might open up with me but i dont think its likely what exactly is it that you want to know about any papers that would tell us who he was he replied if there was a passport or identity document or letters or photographs of home anything that would say who he was what happened to those things atter he was dead and where the cabin was shed never be able to tell you that now she remarked the place has changed so much billy slim might be a better bet we will try him presently he said we will go across the river and ask him but will you come with me to see the old lady one day soon if nothing else it would mean another one of these lovely days with jennifer of course i will carl you mean to woods point he nodded that is where she lives how would we get there perhaps jack dorman would lend the utility again if i pay for the petrol youll need all your money to pay the fines if you go driving about the country without a licence i would not mind that if i could find out the things i want her to tell me she considered for a minute wed better go on saturday she said shes a catholic so sunday might not be a very good day he hesitated you would not mind to do this for me he asked a little shyly she turned to him of course not carl id like to go and see her with you they got up presently and went to see billy slim the bridge across the river to his homestead consisted of two steel cables slung across the river with planks lashed to them to form a footway another two cables formed handrails with rabbitwire sides from the handrails to the footway jennifer paused before going on to it and turned to carl do you think this is the same bridge very likely be said it is only fifty years ill have to be careful not to do the same thing he was drunk and it was dark and he had a dog in his arms zlinter said it is a little different it was nice of him to carry the dog said jennifer he was probably rather a nice man mary nolan thought so she turned and saw a gleam of humour in his eye and made a face at him they found billy slim asleep that hot summer afternoon there was a stir from the bedroom as they stepped on to the veranda and presently he looked out at them clad only in a pair of khaki shorts aw look he said i wont be more n a minute he came out presently with a shirt on just having a bit of shuteye he said i saw you splinter earlier on today going down the river somewhere zlinter said this is miss jenny who is staying with jack dorman this the young lady who helped you do those operations at lamirra this is the one how did you get to know about that aw everybody knows about that i heard about it at the jig to jennifer he said how do you do miss ill just put on the kettle for a pot of tea he busied himself with a primus stove they sat down at his table we have just been to see the gravestones at the cemetery zlinter said to see the one that has my name upon it slim paused teapot in hand i went and had a look at it myself the other day charlie zlinter and his dog just like you said i have found out a little more about charlie zlinter he drove a bullock team he started in and told the forest ranger most of the information that he had collected from pat halloran omitting the information that mary nolan was still alive now i would like to find out where he lived in howqua he said at last billy slim set the cups before them and poured out the tea you mean where the hut he lived in was that is what i want to know you dont know the street or the number the czech said i do not know anything but that he lived here in the town of howqua the ranger sat down at the table with them and stirred his tea i never saw the town myself he said i come here first as just a little nipper some time in the first war but that was some years after it was burnt through for the first time the fire went through here in or was it i dont know one or the other there wasnt any town here when i saw the valley first but there were a lot more stumps of brick chimneys and iron roofing and that sort of junk when i come here i picked up all the iron there was and used it as walls for sheds with new iron on the roof i had a stable built of it before the second fire came through the chimney stumps well they just went away in time fell down were the houses in streets carl zlinter asked oh my word the forest ranger said it was all laid out proper jubilee parade ran round by the river from my dads hotel by the big tree and victoria avenue crossed it running up towards the path that you came down most of the houses were on one of those two streets but there were several others i know i forget their names jennifer said i suppose you dont know where charlie zlinter lived the ranger shook his head i dont i dont think anyone could tell you that not at this distance of time what do you want to know that for carl zlinter said it was just a fancy i would like to build a little hut here a place where i could sleep when i come fishing and not always trouble you a little place of one room where i could leave fishing rods and blankets and perhaps a few tins of food it is better when you live always in the camp to have a little place that is your own to come away to sometimes the forest ranger nodded sure he said you could do that youd have to buy an allotment from the lands department what is that the lands department in melbourne they own all the land and theyve got it all mapped out as town lots in the valley here they sell these lots see like in any town you buy a vacant lot for a house well if youve got a lot and you dont pay the rates after a while you lose your allotment and it goes back to the lands department and they can sell it to someone else he paused thats happened with every one of the township allotments here theyre all back with the lands department because everybodys gone away and stopped paying the rates but the townships still mapped out that way and if you want a bit of land youll have to buy a town allotment jennifer asked you mean if you wanted to put up a hut down by the river youd have to buy a town site thats right youd get so many yards frontage on the street and so much depth they laughed and the girl said no jubilee parade thats right carl zlinter asked how much would that cost aw look the forest ranger said theres not a lot of competition for town sites in howqua just at the moment i wouldnt pay more than five quid for it not unless you picked a corner side they might make you pay ten quid for that because of having frontage on both streets and being able to do more trade that way he grinned how much would the rates be the ranger scratched his head i couldnt rightly say the councils been running on the cheap the last half century they might make you pay five bob a year for the allotment he could not tell them any more and presently they left him to his lonely life and went back across the wire bridge to the meadow by the river it was very still and quiet and beautiful in the valley the sun was dropping towards the hill and already the shadows were growing long its a lovely lovely place the girl said whether you find out about charlie zlinter or not carl its a lovely place to build a little hut you like it so much too he asked eagerly i do she said i think its perfectly beautiful they turned from the river and walked slowly up the track towards jock mcdougalls paddock and the utility they talked as they went about paris mostly jennifer had spent a fortnights holiday in paris in and carl had spent several leaves in paris in and so that though they had seen it under different circumstances it was a bond between them as a place that they both knew and had enjoyed they came to the utility too soon and stood for a time looking over the wide forest in the evening sunlight at last the girl said its been a wonderful day carl thank you so much for taking me she held out her hand instinctively as if she were saying goodbye and it seemed better to say what they had to say here in the solitude and quiet of the forest than at the homestead where there would be other people he said if i ask jack dorrnan to lend us this chev again will you come with me to woods point on saturday of course id love to do that carl i will ask him when we get back he looked at her smiling it will seem a very long time he said not so long as that she said i shall see you tomorrow tomorrow she laughed up at him at the inquest the inquest i had forgotten all about it thats what i hoped youd do she said getting into the car dont start thinking about it now they drove down the rough track through the woods not talking very much but very conscious of each other they came out in the end upon the main road to lamirra and then too soon they were at leonora opening each paddock gate as they passed through jack dorman met them in the yard glancing critically at the chev brought it home all in one piece i have not hit it against anything said zlinter it was very very kind of you to lend it to us jennifer left him talking to jack dorman by the car leading up to a suggestion that they should borrow it again on saturday and went into the house she found jane in the kitchen ironing there was a telegram for you from england jenny she said it came over the telephone i wrote it down she passed an old envelope with pencilled words written on the back across to the girl not too good news im afraid the girl took the paper from her it read think you should know mummy very ill bronchitis and asthma sends you all her love with mine writing airmail daddy nine the telegram jerked jennifer back into the hard bleak winter of england that in the heat and ease and beauty of the australian summer she had almost forgotten it was only about seven weeks since she had sailed from tilbury but in the short time that she had been in australia she had become so steeped in the australian scene that it was difficult for her to visualize the conditions of winter weather in england with the shirt sticking to her back in the heat it was difficult for her to think about the freezing fogs of leicester and all that they meant to her bronchial and asthmatic mother at janes suggestion she wrote her mother a telegram that they telephoned through to the post office a telegram of sympathetic conventional words of love she felt as she drafted it that it was totally inadequate and for the first time she felt real regret that she had ventured so far from her home but there was nothing to be done about that now and no other words but the hackneyed ones to express what she would have liked to convey to her mother jane said casually of course you can telephone if you really want to i believe it costs about two pounds a minute they say its very good jennifer had become so used already to the australian way with money that she considered this seriously for a moment i dont think so she said she hasnt got the telephone in her bedroom so she couldnt take the call herself unless i could speak to mummy personally i dont think it would be worth it she sat down and wrote her a long airmail letter instead all about everything except carl zlinter and the howqua valley she went into banbury next morning with jane and jack dorman in the ford utility the inquest was held in the police court next to the police station a smallish room uncomfortably furnished with jury box and a dock and a few wooden benches the coroner was an elderly grazier a mr herbert richardson who had been a justice of the peace in banbury for many years and took the infrequent inquests that arose as deputy coroner for the district jim forrest was there with carl zlinter and dr jennings and a fair number of onlookers inquests did not happen very often in banbury mr richardson was rather deaf and unaccustomed to an inquest he needed a good deal of prompting by the police but finally he opened the proceedings by inviting sergeant russell to tell the story of the death of albert hanson which the police sergeant did with commendable detachment the deceased he said had been the victim of an accident to a bulldozer in the bush above lamirra the manager of the lamirra timber company was present in the court the foot of the deceased had been amputated on the scene of the accident by a man called zlinter who was present mr zlinter was not registered as a practitioner in victoria he was assisted in the operation by a miss morion who was present and who held no qualifications as a nurse the man hanson had died some hours later at the camp at lamirra and dr jennings who was present had seen the body shortly after death the deceased was known to the police as an alcoholic the circumstances leading up to the mans death appeared to the police to be irregular but they had not yet made any charge on the suggestion of the police sergeant the coroner called mr forrest to give evidence he took the oath and started in to tell the story the coroner laboriously writing down his evidence in longhand presently he asked so you authorized the man zlinter to take off the foot of the deceased man did you too right said mr forrest i couldnt do anything else zlinter said the foot would have to come off anyway and i could see that for myself did you know at the time that he had no medical licence to practice in australia i knew that but you authorized him to do this operation aw look the manager said what would you have done we couldnt get a doctor n we couldnt leave him there all night if wed tried to shift the sticks and bulldozer quick wed have dropped one on top of him like as not i reckoned i was lucky to have a doctor of any sort there even if he was a crook one the old man wrote all that down slowly i see and then when you got him to the camp what happened then the tale went on and then some silly bastard went n give him a bottle of whisky the manager said at last he got fighting drunk n it was all that we could do to keep him in the bed my word and then after an hour or two of that the doctor give him something n soon after that he died when you say the doctor you mean mr zlinter thats right mr zlinter who was in charge of this man when he got the whisky there was an awkward pause well we was all in charge of him you might say id got the doctor and the nurse there n i was round about myself most of the night by the nurse you mean miss morton thats right the coroner whispered for a moment with the police sergeant that will do mr forrest call miss he peered at a paper before him miss jennifer morton jennifer went to the witness stand and took the oath in a low voice the coroner said are you a registered nurse she shook her head and said no eh whats that what did she say sergeant russell said she said no sir to jennifer youll have to speak up a bit the old man said were you in charge of the deceased man at the camp before he died she said i i dont think so but you were acting as a nurse yes i was helping dr zlinter the coroner said testily will you please stop talking about dr zlinter as i understand it he is not a doctor at all the girl flushed and said nothing there was a pause at last the old man said were you supposed to be looking after this man before he died i dont think so sir i couldnt have been i was helping mr zlinter in the next room with the other operation that was the head injury yes we must have been in that room for over two hours it was in that time that he must have got the whisky and in that time you were not looking after him no sir the coroner whispered to sergeant russell who shook his head that will do miss morton and jennifer went back to her seat tired with the brief strain the coroner said call dr jennings the doctor took the oath i understand that you examined this man shortly after death thats right what was the cause of death the doctor said operational shock aggravated by an excessive amount of alcohol i understand that the man drank a whole bottle of whisky yes you conducted a postmortem i did did you find whisky in the body i did i found a very large amount in your opinion if this man had not taken this unfortunate dose of whisky would he have recovered from the operation the doctor said carefully i think he would have recovered he had an enlarged liver somewhat diseased i have preserved a sample of that that condition is usually due to habitual excessive drinking such a man would not be a good subject for an operation of any sort and so it is a possibility that he might have died after the operation in any case but the operation was skilfully and properly performed and so i should say that he would have had a good chance of recovery apart from the whisky it took some time to write that down the operation was properly done i examined the amputation at the postmortem the doctor said it was properly done and i should have expected it to be successful i see the old man finished writing thought tor a minute and then said i understand that this man zlinter did another operation on the same evening can you tell us anything about that one how that is going on dr jennings said that was a much more difficult operation than the amputation it involved the removal of a portion of the skull completely and the lifting of two other pieces normally one would not like to tackle such an operation without full hospital facilities but in this case it was done by mr zlinter in very difficult and improvised conditions assisted by miss morton that operation also seems to have been very well done particularly well in the circumstances the patient is now conscious and likely to recover there was a long pause while this was written down i see am i to take it that these men received satisfactory medical attention then the doctor thought deeply for a minute so far as the operations are concerned he said i think they were well done the aftercare was not so satisfactory it was probably impossible to remove the head injury to hospital until the ambulance became available it would have been possible perhaps to take this man hanson into hospital and he wouldnt have got the whisky there but that is being wise after the event and i dont think one should blame mr zlinter for his decision to keep both men at the camp till i arrived with the ambulance the coroner whispered again to sergeant russell then he said have you ever known the man zlinter to do an operation before no sir i have known him to do dressings and first aid for minor injuries which have sometimes come to me for treatment later on at the hospital and you have been quite happy that he should do that sort of work up at lamirra yes sir i understand that he is qualified as a medical practitioner in his own country but not in australia he is quite competent to do that sort of firstaid work do you consider him competent to do the sort of operations that he did on this occasion dr jennings the doctor said carefully as a general rule sir i should not regard him as competent to operate until he had complied with the regulations of the medical registration board which means that he should have to do a further period in a medical school here in this particular emergency both these men would probably have died but for his care that was the alternative the operations that he performed should have saved both lives but unfortunately one man has died through his own intemperance he paused i should like to make it clear that i have quite a high opinion of mr zlinters capabilities as a surgeon the old man blinked at him you have a high opinion of him certainly sir if he were properly qualified in this country i should be glad to have him as a partner a further bout of whispering with the police sergeant that will do doctor thank you call mr zlinter carl zlinter stepped to the witness stand and took the oath what is your nationality mr zlinter i am a czechoslovakian sir and have you any medical qualifications i am a licentiate of the university of pilsen and a doctor of medicine sir he pulled some papers from the breast pocket of his coat i have here my diploma he passed it to the police sergeant and the coroner who looked at it with interest unable to read one single word very good the coroner leaned back in his chair you have heard all the evidence mr zlinter he said i think we have heard enough evidence now to determine the cause of this mans death and i do not propose to ask you any questions i have called you because i have some things to say to you he paused and went on slowly and deliberately you have heard the evidence and from the evidence it is fairly clear that in an emergency you performed two operations competently and well one of which was a very serious and delicate operation i have to thank you on behalf of the community and at the same time i have to give you a warning you are not licensed as a doctor in this state or in australia at all and if you should do any further operations and if they should turn out badly you would be open to a charge of manslaughter because in this country you are not a doctor i do not want to seem ungrateful to you but that is the law before doing any further operations you must get yourself qualified or you may find yourself in trouble do you understand that carl zlinter said yes sir i have always understood that ver well well youd better get yourself qualified as soon as you are able to thank you mr zlinter you can stand down now carl zlinter went back to his seat and the coroner whispered again with the police sergeant at last he raised his head shuffled his papers and said this inquest has been called to ascertain the cause of the death of albert hanson the evidence that we have heard shows that the man died of operational shock following upon an accident with a bulldozer and that the operational shock was aggravated and intensified by a great quantity of alcohol which the man got hold of in some way that cannot be ascertained and drank i do not think the fact that the operation was performed by an unregistered surgeon had any particular bearing on the cause of death but the fact that whisky was supplied to him after the operation was certainly a factor in his death for this the management of the lamirra timber company were responsible i cannot close this inquest without expressing my opinion that some negligence occurred on the part of mr forrest in the aftercare of these men it appears that no organization for the treatment of serious injuries exists at lamirra i think that there should be such an organization a small hospital or dressing station where such injuries can be properly treated and isolated if that had existed the life of this man might have been saved i find a verdict of accidental death with a strong recommendation that the company should consider what i have said i shall not be so lenient with them if this should happen again he shuffled his papers together rose from his seat and went out of the court the people on the public benches began to stream out of the door jack dorman unostentatiously got out early and fell into step with dr jennings as he walked towards his car all went off very well doctor he said the doctor nodded i was sorry jim forrest got a rap but i suppose somebody had to have it i think there was some carelessness jim must have known the man was a boozer and he might have thought some of his mates would try to slip him something aye said the grazier but i dont suppose jimll lose much sleep he should put up a dressing station of some sort maybe hell do that he hesitated it was good of you to say what you did about splinter he said it could have gone crook for him the doctor nodded i know he did a good job as good as anybody could have done in the conditions i thought it was only fair to make that clear when you said youd be glad to have him as a partner jack dorrnan remarked i suppose that was just a manner of speaking for the police and old bert richardson the doctor stopped and glanced at him i dont know that i meant it to be taken very seriously he said we could do with two more doctors in this district but were not likely to get them so long as any young chap just qualified can put his plate up in a suburb of the city and make a go of it if zlinter was qualified i wouldnt mind having him hes probably quite a good doctor however hes not qualified so theres an end of it he might be one day the grazier said are you thinking of financing him jack dorman laughed not on your life i was just wondering how youd feel about it if he ever turned up in this district as a proper doctor i wouldnt mind a bit the doctor said he certainly did those two operations very skilfully outside the courthouse jane dorman stopped carl zlinter as he was about to get into the utility with mr forrest carl she said whats the best way to get hold of this man shulkin what would be the best time to go and talk to him about pictures i think the weekend zlinter said in the week he will be working always on the railway somewhere jim forrest said he wont be working today mrs dorman she turned to him why not the railwaymen are on strike are they whats it for this time its a twentyfourhour stoppage he said the wharfies went to the arbitration court for another pound a week for something or other and they didnt get it so theyve stopped work for a day to show their displeasure and the railwaymen have done that too like what they call a day of mourning in india my word said jane everybodys making too much money in this country thats the trouble too right said mr forrest you think id find shulkin at his home unless hes in the pub these twentyfourhour stoppages most of em spend the day of mourning in the pub i do not think that shulkin will be in the pub said zlinter i think he is a serious man i think that you will find him in his garden or perhaps painting mr shulkin was painting but not in the style that zlinter had visualized jane and jennifer found him distempering a bedroom of the little weatherboard house beside the railway coach he got down off a chair to greet them brush in hand a little girl about five years old smothered in distemper and rather dirty stared at them finger in mouth jane said are you mr shulkin he smiled i am stanislaus shulkin mr zlinter was telling me that you paint pictures he beamed at her pulled forward the chair and dusted it please i am so sorry you must find me like this carl zlinter he was telling me that there is there is a lady who was wanting beautiful picture so jane said i do want a very very nice oil painting mr shulkin the trouble is i dont want just anything i dont even know what i do want until i see it he smiled also you do not know if i can paint such a picture that you will want she laughed with him thats right i can paint any kind of picture he said just like the carpenter he can make any wood a chair a table a bed a cupboard the good carpenter he can make all things in all woods so the good artist he can paint all kinds of picture but the good carpenter he makes some things in some woods ver ver well and the others just like anyone could make so the good artist some things i can do ver ver well and others just as any artist soso he glanced at her you understand me perfectly so now we will go and i shall show you some pictures he took jennifer and jane to the railway coach and showed them his pictures for half an hour he pulled canvas after canvas out of untidy piles set them up upon the easel and described them of the ten or fifteen canvases displayed jane set aside three all landscapes one of them the delatite river picture with the wattles that zlinter had admired these are something like it she said slowly but not just what i want im sure theyre good enough in the technique but they are not my picture do you understand what i mean he nodded i understand ver well she said slowly let me tell you something mr shulkin i grew up with pictures and i never thought about them much i was born in england and my people were well off and there were lots of paintings in the house i think some of them must have been very good but i never thought about them at the time its only now that im getting old that im beginning to realize what a lot you miss by not having good paintings when we couldnt have them because we hadnt enough money i never worried about them or thought about them much but now weve got a bit more and i want a good picture almost more than anything he nodded slowly may i ask a little question or two of course what is it that you do he asked what interests have you i dont do anything except the housework she said its a wholetime job upon a station you cant get any help are you interested more in flowers or in people he asked she smiled cold beef or thursday she thought for a moment i think really i like flowers more than people they never disappoint you do you like the high mountains and the rivers better or the bright lights in shop windows in the coming darkness of a winter night he asked i like the high mountains and the rivers better she said i dont really like the city he said surprisingly this young lady she is a relation of you why yes this is jennifer morton mr shulkin shes a kind of niece shes only just arrived from england so she is english he moved round jennifer and looked at her in profile thoughtfully ver interesting he said at last now one last question mrs dorman do you like better the picture that is full of colour or that is full of good drawing with the colour more quiet jane thought for a long time i think the picture that is full of good drawing she said one gets such brilliant colours in this country all day long unless it was very unusual colour it would be a repetition of what you see all the time and i think one might get tired of that i think i like quiet colours with good drawing so he replied now i will say what i can do for you he looked at her smiling i like to paint he said but i cannot now buy canvases and paints for pictures that nobody will buy i would like to paint three pictures of this size he raised a canvas and show the three for you to choose which you like best if you like one to buy it you shall pay me seventy pounds if you do not like any of the pictures then you shall pay me five pounds for the cost of the canvases and the paints that is all that i would need the money that i shall have spent that sounds fair enough jane said but if i dont like any of the pictures youll have done a great deal of work for nothing i like to paint he said simply i will have been able to paint three more pictures because you will have paid for the materials he paused also he said the work is not alone for me this young lady will require to work with me me asked jennifer these pictures are to have quiet colour and good drawing he said equably your head also has quiet colour and good drawing one of the pictures is to be a portrait of you upon some landscape background of this place there was a momentary silence its not a bad idea jenny jane said at last youve got some lovely colours in your hair if he could ever get them right i also have noticed those said mr shulkin it will be ver difficult and i may not do well but i would like to try the portrait for one picture i dont mind sitting said jennifer ive never done it before though how many times should i have to come three times said shulkin if it was not possible in three sittings then it would be impossible and we should stop and do something different but i think it will be possible they arranged for jennifer to come down to his cottage in the evenings after tea he wanted her at the weekends but she objected to that having in mind her excursion to woods point with carl zlinter she thought of offering to drive herself in to these sittings in janes little morris she had driven her fathers car in england a little and she held an english licence but she abandoned that idea jane was still proud and jealous of her little morris and would probably not have taken kindly to the idea and the chevrolet was bigger than anything that jennifer had driven and she was rather frightened of it it wont be any trouble driving in after tea just three times jane said i should come into town more anyway the week was an uneasy one for jennifer each day a letter from her father came by air mail she knew that he must be very troubled to be writing every day these letters had been written earlier than the cable that she had received of course and disclosed a crescendo of her mothers illness worse with each letter she got no more cables which comforted her a little she wrote to her mother and father every day long cheerful letters about the australian scene these troubles were half smothered by the beauty and the interest of her life at merrijig she went into market one day with jack dorman and spent a couple of hours among the pens of sheep and pigs and cattle with the grazier and tim archer studying the form and characteristics and the prices of the beasts they sold one of the homestead cows that had gone dry and bought another one and she enjoyed every minute of it she sat twice for shulkin in the little railway coach a couple of hours each time till it became too dark to work while dumpy little mrs shulkin brought her cups of tea and little foreign macaroons and biscuits that she had made herself conversation with mrs shulkin was difficult because she spoke practically no english with the artist she got on very well once she asked him are you glad you came to australia mr shulkin he did not answer at once being in the middle of a careful stroke he finished it stepped back from the canvas and then said you are just from england no not australian im not australian she laughed you can say what you like with me im english so the pose again please just for one minute so he stepped up to the canvas worked for a moment and stepped back again i think it was best to come to australia from the camp in germany he said when i come first and i was told that my work would be on the railway i was sad then that it had not been possible to go to the united states but there also i think perhaps my work would have been upon the railway because there also they have then own teachers of fine arts so if it is to work upon the railway in germany or america or australia he stepped up to the easel again and began to work then i think australia is good because here is more opportunity for my children than even in america he stepped back again and looked critically at his work one little minute and then you may relax also he said it is now three years that i have worked upon the railway and it is not bad work it is happier i think to live quietly in the country than to strain always with the mind to teach art all the day and to think art all the day nothing nothing nothing but art so i think the mind will soon be sour like bad milk he waved his hand towards the untidy stacks of canvases i have here pictures that i painted before the war in kaunas that i took with me in the war to germany and so to the camps and after here to banbury because i thought they were good pictures ver good that would show me the great artist in australia but now these pictures do not please me they are strained too much complicated too much technique too little to be said you may rest now he stepped back and looked critically at the picture too much art he said art all the day and night i think my mind was sour perhaps it is better to work on the railway for the living and come to art for pleasure not so often he stood with halfclosed eyes staring at the portrait this will be a good picture he said thoughtfully this will be better than the paintings that i brought from germany in these sittings jennifer could sit quietly with her own thoughts and these were mostly on the howqua valley and the memory of her day there with carl zlinter the howqua had a dreamlike quality of unreality for her a place so beautiful and so remote from anything she had encountered in her life before that it fell into the category of a fairy story in her mind a fairy story with a prince charming moreover her life up to that point had been in the somewhat bleak settings of leicester and the london suburbs these places were more real to her than melbourne or merrijig she knew what to do with a red london bus but it was still unreal to her that a horse should be used in this country as a normal means of locomotion stranger still was the story of charlie zlinter and his dog whose tombstone she had felt and touched who had driven his bullock team daily from this town named in the memory of banbury near oxford only fifty years ago and who had drunk and loved in a town called howqua that had vanished absolutely from the face of the earth and had left only beauty in the place where it had been this sort of thing didnt happen in leicester or blackheath and as she sat quiet in the little railway coach while the lithuanian platelayer painted her portrait she wondered which of her two lives was real and which was a dream carl zlinter rang up from lamirra on wednesday evening to ask jack dorman if he could borrow the utility on saturday to go to woods point with jenny thatll be right the grazier said she told us you wanted to go over there want to speak to her when she came to the telephone she was in a slight flutter of eagerness to speak to him which annoyed her slightly because the telephone was in the kitchen and everyone was there she made the arrangements with him about lunch and time of starting with elaborate casualness that deceived nobody then he said there is one other thing i have now got a map of the town of howqua where on earth did you get that from carl it was in the shire hall at banbury he said it belongs to the lands department i went in there yesterday to see if perhaps there would be anything and there i found this map it is very yellow and torn and they would not allow me to take it away and so i went out and bought paper and i made a tracing of it does it show where the houses were it shows all the streets and all the town allotments with their numbers he said it does not tell us where charlie zlinter lived or anybody else because there are numbers only on the map street names and the numbers of the lots it is ver interesting she said could you tell from it where any particular house was i think it would be possible he said there are marks on it which a surveyor will understand but i do not these i have copied with great care i will ask mr forrest before saturday if he can tell me what they mean and how to find the place where any house was from the map thats fine carl im awfully glad what have you been doing all the week ive been sitting for my portrait to mr shulkin for your portrait yes hes painting me ill tell you about it when we meet i shall want to see this portrait he said i must visit stanislaus she laughed youre not to till its finished if then goodnight carl goodnight jenny i will not promise anything he came to the homestead on saturday morning with his grill and his steaks in newspaper having got a lift down from lamirra on a truck she was ready for him and the chev was full of petrol he made a halfhearted attempt to reckon with jack dorman who said aw forget it it all goes on the farm n conies off tax so they started for woods point before the day grew hot jane watched the chev go off across the paddocks to the road well there they go again she said i dont know what her fathers going to say or her mother from the looks of it her mother wont be saying anything before so long he remarked thats right she replied it doesnt look too good from the letters shes been getting neither of them had ever met jennifers mother and they could discuss the matter dispassionately whatll she do if she dies he asked i think she might go back jane said shes very fond of her father and hed be alone she dont want to get too deep with this chap zlinter then she stood silent for a minute its her business she said at last shes got her head screwed on right we cant interfere as jennifer got back into the chev after closing the last gate and as they started on the road for banbury and woods point carl zlinter said will you mind if i drive over the police sergeant when we go through banbury not specially said jennifer it might make trouble though because you havent got a licence does one need a licence to drive over police sergeants in this country my word she said it was easy to fall into the idiom you can go to prison if you do that without a licence why do you want to drive over the sergeant anyway it was not necessary to have that inquest at all he said he knew the answer before he started anything it was stupid and it caused me very much worry so i could not sleep the night before there were a lot of things that could have stopped you sleeping the night before she observed too much steak for one thing it was the inquest he asserted i was ver worried for that they would send me back to germany i could not sleep if we see that police sergeant we will not run over him because i have not got a licence but we will give him a very big fright now we will go and see stanislaus shulkin on our way to woods point and we will see what he has been up to she turned to him carl youre not to go and see that picture its not finished and its nothing like me anyway so he said if it is a bad picture of you then i will cut it with my knife so it cannot be finished if it is good then i will let him finish it and i will hang it in the house that i shall build in howqua city she burst into laughter you are a fool you cant have it its for jane dorman hes painting three pictures for her to choose from she told him what was happening all right he said we will now go and see this picture and decide what is to be done with it she could not move him from that and she did not try very hard his mood was different from anything that she had known in him before hitherto she had known him as a surgeon faced with a difficult and delicate task in improvised conditions and as a man with the threat of a manslaughter charge on his mind she was now seeing a totally different carl zlinter a man on his way out from years of life in camps a man beginning to enjoy life who was unused to joy a man laughing clumsily because he was unused to laughter she did not know quite what to make of him mr shulkin was working in his garden he stopped and came to the gate as the utility drew up so he said the model has arrived you have come to make another sitting she has not said carl zlinter she has come to ride in this utility with me to woods point she has told me that you make a portrait of her and i have come to see if it is good enough mr shulkin said i do not think that any portrait will be good enough when you have her with you a portrait is for when you cannot see the sitter but you may see if you want it is not finished he led the way into the railway coach and they followed him the picture stood upon the easel he had given more space to the background than is usual in modern portraits using rather a wide canvas and placing the head to one side for the background he had chosen a part of leonora station with the delatite river the paddocks and the wooded slopes behind he had made it a spring scene when the tips of the gum trees take a tinge of orangered so that the colour motif of the leonora scene repeated the bronze lights in jennifers hair it is not a portrait said mr shulkin as they looked at it in silence it is an order for a beautiful picture with quiet colour and good drawing that the lady will like to live with the portrait is nothing nothing only a detail of the whole picture you understand a bunch of flowers would have done as well but they would not have had the fine drawing and the delicate colour of the head of this young lady it is a very lovely thing the czech said quietly the artist had painted jennifer in profile with lips slightly parted and a faint colour in her cheeks as if a blush was just beginning as he had said the portrait was subordinated to the colour values of the picture as a whole and so became the more impressive by a type of understatement its going to be a very lovely picture the girl said but i dont believe i really look like that a bit i have seen you look like that the surgeon said i have seen you look like that many times it is very true of you the girl coloured a little and looked very like the portrait zlinter turned to the artist you must do something else for mrs dorman he said she has not seen this no i will buy this one mr shulkin smiled broadly that is not possible i have three pictures that i must paint for mrs dorman and she will choose the one that she will like the best already she has paid me for the materials for all the three so this canvas is her canvas and this paint is her paint if she will not choose this picture and she wishes to have one of the other two or none at all then i will sell you this picture if you can pay enough money i am ver expensive i gain more than ten pounds each week on the railway i am ver expensive man he grinned carl zlinter said you must now paint two more pictures very very good much better than this one so she will choose one of those perhaps you need not show her this one at all jennifer laughed she knows all about it carl i told her you dont want it anyway what on earth would you do with it i would sell it to a manufacturer of soap he said because it is so beautiful he paused or i would hang it in the house that i am going to build in the howqua i do not know it would be better to sell it to the manufacturer of soap the artist said because then you would have money to build the house but i do not think that i shall sell it to you if that is what you are going to do with it jennifer said what about me dont i have any say in this carl zlinter said you will get the soap what soap the soap that the manufacturer will give so you will say it is the best soap in the world and he can put it underneath the picture dont sell it to him stan she said i dont want it used as a soap advertisement i would not sell it to him in any case the artist replied he is a bad man and not serious only when he cuts off peoples legs and they die i do not know why you go out with him they left him presently and got going on the road to jamieson and woods point it ran through pastoral station country to begin with an undulating wellwatered country in a bowl of hills the pastures becoming dried and brown in the hot sun the road climbed slowly and became more wooded presently they came upon a considerable river a wide river running in a series of pools and shallows on a rocky bottom carl zlinter said my word i did not know that there was such a river here he stopped the car by the roadside and they got out and looked at it it ran completely deserted winding through the woods and pastures rippling in white foam at the little falls and rapids with deep brown pools between it must be full of fish this river the czech said what is it carl whats its name i do not know i think that it is perhaps the goulburn but i did not know the goulburn was like this the english girl asked can anybody go and fish there carl or is the fishing preserved he shook his head it is all free fishing here there must be very many fish in this river i will come and fish here one day there doesnt seem to be anybody fishing the girl said it is not like europe this he replied here in this country there are not very many people and so not many fishermen it is another reason why i am happy to be here she turned to him youre very fond of australia arent you carl i have lived here fifteen months he said and i have seen only this little corner of this big country but now i should be sorry to live anywhere else he glanced at her are you happy to be here and not in england i think so carl she said slowly there are so many things though ive lived in towns most of my life one does in england and all this is strange to me i like it i think id rather live here than in an english town she hesitated one has so many ties with england and its so far away ive been getting airmail letters from my father all this week about my mother shes very ill ive been wishing i was back in england all this week i am so sorry he said what is it that is the matter with her she told him all about it standing there with him above the goulburn river it was a relief to be able to tell somebody everything she thought theyve been a very selfcontained pair my father and mother she said i had two brothers but they were both killed in the war one in a corvette and one in bomber command daddy and mummy had so many interests that they shared l was always a bit out of it after the war thats why i didnt mind going away from home to work in london and why it didnt seem too bad to come out here but now i wish i was back i dont know wholl be running the house for daddy or how he can be getting on if mummy were to die l think id have to go back l dont know what daddy would do all on his own it would be very sad for me if you went back he said quietly it would be very sad for me too she replied id rather stay here she turned to the car perhaps it wont happen the winter will be getting on now back in england and thatll make it better for mummy they drove on through a tiny village and crossed the river and went on tor ten miles or so through the woods along the valley by the river the sun was hot and the trees made dappled overhung patches of shade upon the road and the same brilliant parrots with crimson bodies and blue wings flew in the woods ahead of them they were delighted with the day and with the old car and with each other twice they stopped to walk down to the river and look at its desolate grandeur and they hardly stopped talking all the time they laughed a great deal about silly little things that were not really funny but they wanted to laugh they passed gasneys creek and a small gold mine shut down for the weekend the first that jennifer had ever seen from there the road wound upwards through the woods till they came out at the summit of a col the road going down into another valley ahead of them this is frenchmans gap i think said carl woods point will be about five miles farther on shall we have our lunch here with the gold grill she laughed again at the little joke its very lovely here she got out of the car and looked around can we do a grill here carl without setting the whole country grilling too there is here a fireplace he said and he showed her the blackened stones i think it will be safe if we shall make it here he set to work to grill the steaks while jennifer laid out the rest of the meal on a clean cloth upon the grass in the shade of a gum tree carl she said tell me a bit more about mary nolan was she irish i think perhaps she was he said there were very many irish people in this country at that time she paused considering her words did she have a job in howqua or how did she come to be there i mean a job apart from being a naughty girl he laughed and she laughed with him i do not know if she had another job he said i have thought perhaps that she came to howqua as a barmaid in the hotel or perhaps she was to help one of the women with the children i do not know and i do not know how she happened to be living on the other side of the river perhaps she will tell us today perhaps she wont the girl said i think were going to have a job to get anything out of her at all they cooked the steaks and ate them hot from the grill sitting on the warm grass in the shade of the trees looking out over the blue misty lines of hills its so different here to anything ive ever known carl she said once people with so much money that they dont have to worry who can afford to be generous if they want to and all made honestly in farming in this lovely empty place ive always lived where people were hard up even good clever people its all so different here to england he nodded i know i feel like that also i live in a camp and i must live so for nine months more but sometimes i wake up early in the morning and i look around and i think of all the fine things in this country that i can do in nine months the things that i could never do in europe he looked at her a little shyly i have a calendar upon the wall he said and each day when i get up out of bed i cross off one day with a pencil the day that has gone her eyes moistened a little oh carl do you do that he nodded it is a stupid thing but that is what i do in nine months now i shall be out of the camp life out of it for ever a free man when were you a free man last carl she asked when did you last live a normal life with a home in he said i lived then at my fathers house just after i became a doctor then came the germans and i joined the army its a terribly long time she said softly and then she looked up at him and smiled and said were you ever married he smiled back at her no he said i was never married i was spared that complication she said quietly you must have been very lonely all those years i do not think so not in the war years he said so much was happening so much of grief and work and pain i think that one had no time to be lonely after the war in the camps in germany he shrugged his shoulders perhaps one had got out of the habit of being lonely perhaps in germany where life was very hard there was so little happiness in married life that one did not want it i do not know it is only in the last year since i came here to australia and i have seen men living happily with wives and with their children and with no war in the country it is only since the last year i have been a little lonely in the evenings sometimes she said so then you go out and catch a fish he laughed yes then i go out and catch a fish he got to his feet and began to put the remains of their lunch together now we must go down to woods point and catch mary nolan they got back into the utility and ran down the long road into the valley before them woods point proved to be a little town of wooden houses at the bottom of a valley rather a straggling little town that had been wiped out from time to time with forest fires and so was built of fairly modern houses these houses stood about among the trees around two working gold mines there was not very much of it a hotel a bakery a store or two strung haphazard along the main street there seemed to be no reason why anyone should live there but for the gold mines carl zlinter stopped the chev at the hotel and went in to ask where old mrs williams lived he came out presently and got back into the car it is just a little way he said we must turn round jennifer said youve had a beer i have found where mary nolan mrs williams lives he said it is not right for you to say such things its not fair she said it is part of the womans burden in this country he remarked that they are not allowed in the bar they left the utility by the roadside three hundred yards back and walked down a grassy lane asked at a house and were directed to the right one a middleaged sandyhaired woman came to the door carl zlinter asked does mrs williams live here please she looked at him with interest at his accent thats right she said auntie lives here with us would it be possible if we should have a talk with her a little he asked my name is carl zlinter and this is miss morion to jennifer the woman said how dyou do im elsie stevens mrs stevens what dyou want to talk to auntie about shes pretty old you know and she dont have to do much talking to get tired jennifer said weve come over from leonora station out past banbury mr zlinter works in the timber at lamirra hes trying to find out about a relation of his who was in the howqua in the old days leonora the woman wrinkled her brows would that be jack dormans place thats right oh i know with contact established she became more friendly did you say it was about the old days in the howqua that is right the czech said there was a man there of the same name as me who died and was drowned and buried there i have seen the stone at the grave with his name carved upon it it is the same name as my own charlie zlinter i was told that your aunt was living in the howqua at that time and i have thought that she could tell me about him who he was and where he lived the woman stood in silence for a minute well i dont know im sure she said at last auntie was in the howqua for a bit before she came here but she wouldnt remember anything about that now jennifer said could we have a talk with her do you think just for a few minutes we dont want to tire her the woman said slowly well i dont mind asking her what did you say the name was charlie zlinter the woman stood staring at him for a moment while the elusive memory of a local jingle scattered through her mind ive heard that name before she paused some rhyme about a dog thats right said jennifer charlie zlinter and his heeler hound fell into the howqua and unhappily drowned thats right the woman said we used to say that when we was children at the sunday school just wait here a minute and ill ask auntie she turned to zlinter did you say your name was charlie zlinter thats right like in the rhyme thats right i am called charlie zlinter well isnt that funny just wait here a minute and ill tell auntie she went indoors and they stood in the lane waiting presently she came out again to them auntie wants to see you she said she hesitated you mustnt mind her if she talks a bit queer and i wouldnt stay very long they went into the livingroom of the house a very old woman was sitting in a chair before the fireplace with a shawl round her shoulders she wore rather shabby black clothes her features were lean and long and she was wearing steelrimmed spectacles her white hair was parted in the middle and done in a bun behind her head there was still plenty of it her niece said to her these are the people come to see you auntie this is charlie zlinter the old woman raised her head and looked at them he is not she said and there was still a touch of the irish in her voice hes nothing like charlie zlinter the czech said my name it is charlie zlinter like the man who lived in the howqua and was drowned there with his dog she turned towards him and fixed him with her eyes i do not know if he was a relation of me or not she said you talk like him where do you come from the same place as he did that is right he said i come from the same town in bohemia whos this she asked indicating jennifer your wife no he said just a friend she snorted a little as if in disbelief i wouldnt know anything about charlie zlinter no more than any of the other men she said he got drowned thats all i know carl zlinter said i am trying to find out if he left any papers or books or any letters from his family in pilsen or anything to tell us who he was i think you are the only person in this district who was living in the howqua at that time and i have wondered if you could tell us anything if you remember the old woman said testily i know nothing about that man or any other of those men why should i know anything about his papers there was a man there with that name thats all i know about it do you remember what happened after he was drowned perhaps the czech asked do you remember what happened to the things that were in his house who took them the old woman made a gesture of irritation sure how would i be knowing that after all these years she said there was many a man went away or died or was away out of it for one reason or another and there was no keeping track of them all if a body had wanted to if a body had wanted to she repeated carl zlinter asked can you remember where he lived would you know where he had his house i tell you i know nothing about the man at all the old woman said angrily he was drunk and he got drowned thats all i know how would i be knowing where he lived or what happened to his gear i was a decent girl she stared at them fiercely there auntie there said her niece he didnt mean nothing he just wants to know if you remember anything about this man the old woman sank back into her chair i dont know nothing about charlie zlinter she said sullenly there was an awkward silence jennifer looked up at carl zlinter and he nodded slightly it was developing as they had thought he said i am so sorry when i heard that you had been in howqua at that time i thought perhaps you might remember something he moved towards the door i have now to take my utility to the garage before we start back we have burst a tyre may i leave miss morton here for half an hour till i have had that repaired mrs stevens said oh thatll be right i was just going to give auntie a cup of tea youll have a cup of tea with us while youre waiting miss jennys the name the girl said id love a cup can i do anything carl zlinter slid out of the door behind her oh its nothing she bent to the old woman youd like a cup of tea auntie she asked rather loudly jennys going to have a cup of tea with us im just going to put the kettle on i could drink a cup of tea the old lady said her niece disappeared into the next room and jennifer squatted down on a stool before her i went over to the howqua last week she said theres nothing left there now only the gum trees you went into the howqua the girl nodded we drove the utility up to the top of the ridge and then walked the last two miles down into the valley eh youd never drive down that track in a motorcar i heard of one man tried it once but they had to get a team to pull him out again bullocks they used to use when i was there eight bullocks to a wagon in and out of banbury that was before the days of motorcars she peered about her whats happened to that man who was here just now the foreigner hes gone to take the car to the garage jennifer said we had a flat tyre coming here we had to change the wheel hes gone to get it mended before we start back there was a long silence the old woman sat staring at the paper flowers in the fireplace in red and silver tinsel what did he say his name was charlie zlinter the girl said its just a coincidence i think hes got the same name as a man who used to work in the howqua the old woman shook her head he never worked in the howqua he was a bullocky used to drive a bullock team between banbury and the howqua she paused for a while he talked like this fellow foreign he was there was another long silence from the next room jennifer could hear the rattling of cups youre a pretty girl the old woman said at last too pretty for the likes of him not getting up to any mischief with him are you the girl said no and smiled colouring a little well mind you dont dont you let him do nothing till hes married you these bullock drivers and the miners too theyll say anything and then in the end you find theyre married already with a wife and three children out behind some place and you to have a fourth mrs stevens came back with the tea and saved jennifer from the necessity of answering that one when the old lady was sipping her cup the girl brought her gently back to the subject by asking did the charlie zlinter that you knew look like this one ah charlie zlinter was a fine upstanding man she replied twice the man of this one he was a great strong man with black curly hair strong enough to break the neck of an ox and he with his bare hands alone broader in the shoulders he was than this man of yours and a champion at anything that hed be setting his hand to a grand powerful man she sat sipping her tea and staring at the tinsel flowers lost in memories there was a slab of stone before the fireplace in his cabin she said the way the ashes would be kept back in the fire a slab as big as that four hundredweight he said it weighed ive seen him lift that slab with his two hands and carry it away sure there wasnt a man in howqua could have done the like of that anvils barrels of beer loads no two men could carry hed just lift them down from off the wagon to where they had to be and he whistling a tune and thinking nothing of it it must have been a terrible loss when he got drowned the girl said ah said the old woman it was a sad sad day and howqua was never the same after the mine closed down and the folks began to drift away because with the mine shut and the gold finished there was nothing left to stay for by the time i went out there was every other cabin in the place empty and folks just walking in and out picking over stuff that had been left behind for that it wasnt worth the charge to take it out to banbury upon the wagons its a sad desolate thing to see houses left that way and nobody to live in them i did hear that the whole of howqua came to be like that with nobody to walk along the streets but wallabies and rabbits that was before the fire came through the valley which cabin did charlie zlinter live in the girl asked no buller street the old woman said it was just the one room with a fireplace and a bed and a bench where hed sit working at the bullock harness sewing with a palm upon his hand like a sailor he was a sailor one time so he told me thats how he came to be in australia he jumped his ship and came up to the goldfields but he found that he could make more money with the wagon did he make much money my word the bullockies made money the old woman said more than the miners or prospectors ever did everything that came to howqua had to pass through their hands and they charged terrible for bringing it but they were generous as well ah charlie zlinter was an openhanded man a kind generous man manys the thing he used to bring me from the town a new saucepan from england or an alarm clock from america or maybe a length of dress material if it was christmas anything hed see that would take his fancy hed bring out of town for me as a surprise for that id never be thinking ah he was a grand kind man you must have been great friends the girl said better than we should have been maybe mary nolan said quietly but there it didnt seem to be no harm at the time and now its a long while ago there was a silence after she said that jennifer sat at her feet hoping that carl zlinter wouldnt come back and break the spell she felt now that she could ask this old woman anything she said presently did anybody live in charlie zlinters cabin after he died the old head shook there was people leaving howqua every day from that time on nobody lived in it before i left there were houses to spare the way youd see doors open all along the street youre sure of that are you that no one lived in it nobody lived in it before i went she said i would have known about it if they had what happened to all his things i mean what did happen in the howqua when a man died like that did the police take them mary nolan set her cup down there was a policeman mike lynch was his name from county kerry he lodged about the middle of jubilee parade but im not sure if he was there i dont think there was anything in the cabin to trouble with early in the morning the day that he was found in the river i went to his cabin in buller street because he was back from banbury i knew that because i heard him in the dark night singing outside the hotel that peter slim kept and i knew that he was having drink taken and i thought maybe hed have fallen asleep in his clothes or done himself an injury in the cabin and so i went out and went to his cabin on the far side of the water before it was light the way the neighbours wouldnt see me go i had done that before sometimes and cleaned him up and made him breakfast and taken his clothes home to wash very early in the morning so nobody would know but glory be to god the man was dead already and i crossed the bridge that he had fallen from and never knew jennifer said did he leave any papers or books in the cabin mrs williams can you remember anything like that never a book she said there wouldnt have been many books in howqua at that time charlie was no scholar but he could read labels and that not the longer words he did have papers of some sort with him although he never showed me he kept them all locked up in a tin box he called his ditty box not very big the girl asked what happened to the box after he was dead can you remember that it wasnt there said mary nolan i remember looking for it special when i found he wasnt in the cabin and his door left open because i knew he set store by it sometimes it stood on a little kind of ledge hed made in the earth chimney and other times it wouldnt be there at all so when i went into the cabin i looked but the box was away out of it and then i looked around a little but i didnt see it i didnt give much heed to it because it wasnt always there i wouldnt know what happened to that at all could he have left it in banbury he might i wouldnt know at all it could be that he had it with him when he fell into the river he had the dog in his arms said jennifer he wouldnt have gone to cross the river with the dog and the box too would he he was a wild reckless boy when he had drink taken mary nolan said but there he had a way with him and a body could deny him nothing i would not say anything of what he might have done when he had drink taken what would have happened to the rest of his things the girl asked who looked after those sure and there wasnt very much the old lady said he was buried in his sunday suit they told me i never went near because there had been tongues wagging in the howqua about him and me and i knew that if any of the women spoke against me i would have flown out at them and that i would not do at charlies burying so i stayed in my own cabin all the while but they told me he was buried in his sunday clothes there would have been some working clothes maybe but nothing of value and his wagon and the bullocks there was a scots boy worked for him jock robertson i think he took the wagon and the team when the working clothes and the harness were gone from the cabin there wouldnt have been much left and what there was nobody would want for all the folks were starting to leave about that time she stared at the tinsel flowers in the grate i looked into the cabin once and the bedclothes were still upon the bed but a possum or a rat had nested there and the bucket still half full of water and a loaf of bread still in the cupboard all gone green with mould she shivered a little and drew the shawl more closely round her its not good to go back afterwards to places where there has been happiness she said it tears at your heart i never went back again and soon after that i left the howqua myself id say the cabin stayed like that until the fire came through the girl took one of the old hands and held it in her own you must have loved him very much she said whisht said the old woman theres a word that you must never use until theres marrying between you and charlie zlinter was a married man already in his own country he was a kind gracious man and i looked after him when he would let me thats all there was between us child this foreigner that brought you here today and has the same name is he a married man no said jennifer i asked him that maybe youll be luckier than i was mary nolan said maybe hes telling you the truth of it the other charlie zlinter never told me any lies they sat in silence for a time the old woman was tiring and it was evidently nearly time to go one last question jennifer said did charlie zlinter ever tell you anything about his wife the wife he had in his own country mary nolan shook her head he wouldnt be after telling me the like of that the girl stayed ten minutes longer for politeness then she said that she would have to go and see how zlinter was getting on with the car or they would be late in getting home she said goodbye to the old woman elsie stevens stepped outside the door with her she had a nice talk with you she said i havent seen her so bright for a long time i hope i havent made her too tired the girl said oh no i think it does old people good to have a talk about old times now and then it comes easy to them did she tell you what you wanted to know jennifer shook her head she couldnt tell us anything very much except where he lived she did tell us that but she didnt know anything about him really ah well it isnt easy after all these years she said goodbye to mrs stevens and walked up the lane to the utility carl zlinter was sitting there in it smoking she got talking when you went away carl she said she told me a lot of things but i dont know that any of its much good to you shall we drive out of town and then stop and you can tell me what she said lets do that lets go back and stop somewhere by that river and ill tell you all i can remember they drove back over the col where they had lunched and down to gaffneys creek and to the goulburn river presently they parked the car at a place where the river ran near the road and walked across a strip of pasture to a bend as they went she told him all about it she didnt know much really that you didnt know already carl she said there were papers in a box a tin box but she doesnt know what happened to that or what was in it she told him what she had heard from the old woman she did look for it particularly that morning but it wasnt there she didnt know of any other place he might have put it the girl shook her head she thought he might have had it with him when he fell into the river in that case itld be at the bottom of the howqua they walked on for a few steps in silence she was so sweet jennifer said quietly the way she went out very early to the cabin to find where he was and clean him up she said she often did that she must have been very much in love with him to do that for a drunken man i think she was the girl said yes i think she was they came to the rocky edge of the river and sat down on a boulder in the shade to watch the water and to talk the water made a little lilting noise from the run at the end of the pool a cockatoo screeched now and then in the distance and the air was fragrant with the clean scent of the gum trees in the summer sun she said he lived at number fifteen buller street jennifer told him is that enough to tell you where the cabin was he took a folded paper from his breast pocket and began to spread it out whats that she asked it is the township plan that i copied in the shire hall he said he stood up and spread it out on the flat boulder that they had been sitting on she helped him to hold the corners down the paper was dazzling in the bright sun he moved his finger down the plan here is buller street he said here is fifteen the number on the block i think perhaps this was the place she bent to look at the faint pencil lines with him her head very close to his own her hair brushed his cheek and he could smell the fragrance of her skin this is fifteen he said a little unsteadily the cabin must have been on this allotment could you find the actual place on the ground from this map carl is there anything left there now to show thats marked upon this map she stood up and moved a little away from him it was difficult for her also to be quite so close i think that we could find the place from this he said here this solid marking this must be the buller arms hotel and that still shows upon the ground a little this map is to the scale of two chains to each inch perhaps there are other markings left that billy slim will know i think it will be possible to measure out upon the ground and find this block fifteen in buller street when are you going to do that i would like to do it tomorrow he said would you come with me once more to the howqua tomorrow she looked at him with laughing eyes i dont know what the dormansll think if i keep going out with you like this carl he smiled back at her does that matter very much you will be going to melbourne very soon to start your work and then we shall not go out any more and the dormans will be happy i know mary nolan had told her that the other charlie zlinter had a way with him and a body could deny him nothing perhaps these charlie zlinters were all the same of course ill come with you charlie she said unthinking he laughed and met her eyes still laughing i am not charlie zlinter he said i am carl and you are not mary nolan that was fifty years ago we are much more respectable people than that she laughed with him flushing a little i dont know why i said that ive been talking about charlie zlinter all the afternoon i suppose i do not think it is a compliment he said charlie zlinter was a very bad drunken man and he was a bullock driver she looked up and met his eyes still teasing her a little well what about you she asked youre a very bad man and a lumberman i dont see much difference i am offended he announced a bullock driver is much lower in the social scale than a lumberman i would not say that you were like to mary nolan i would not be so rude i hope you wouldnt there was a pause he looked from her across at the little rapids of the river at the smooth water running to the stones then he turned to her again smiling i might have said it he remarked mary nolan was kind to a man who was very far from his own home i might quite well have said that you were like to mary nolan she did not answer that but dropped her eyes and picked a little piece of clover in the grass that she was sitting on also he said i think that charlie zlinter although he was not a very good man he was in love with mary nolan i think perhaps that is another likeness lonely people often think that theyre in love when they arent really she said quietly it must take a long time to be sure youre properly in love with anybody and not just lonely of course he reached out and took her hand and held it in his own hard brown one will we be going to the howqua tomorrow he asked she smiled at him if you want to carl more and more like mary nolan she thought but she could deny him nothing if youre quite sure that its safe for a girl so like to mary nolan to go back into the howqua it is very safe he told her there is no charlie here only a carl no bullock driver only an unregistered doctor full of inhibitions and repressions she laughed and withdrew her hand i wouldnt put much trust in those she replied she got to her feet id love to come with you tomorrow carl she said well make it all right with the dormans one way or another they began to walk back across the paddock to the car very near to each other but not touching to ease the tension she began to question him about the house that he wanted to build in the howqua valley how big it was to be what would it be built of and how would he get the materials in there he told her that it would be very small and simple no more than twelve feet long by ten feet wide he could afford sawn timber for a house of that description and he thought that he could get everything he needed from the sawmill at lamirra and get a lorry driver to take it up to jock mcdougalls paddock on a saturday from there billy slim could probably get it down for him on a sledge or he would borrow a horse and a sledge from billy and shift it himself he would roof it with tarred felt sheeting of some sort he thought that he could build it in the weekends before winter it would be very simple inside with just one builtin bunk and a fireplace and a table it is all i need he said just somewhere to be at the weekends and to leave fishing rods she said and youre going to build it on the site of charlie zlinters house i think so i do not really think that charlie zlinter was related to me jenny there are many zlinters in pilsen it would be pleasant if he was but anyway i do not think that we shall ever know but since there was a man of my name there if his house was in a pretty place i will build mine where he built his because we came from the same town i think it will be pretty from the map buller street ran up the hill not far from the river and not far from the track that leads down to the crossing now perhaps the track itself was buller street perhaps billy slim will know but if it is a pretty place i will build there jennifer said it sounds as if the house you want to build will be just about the same size as charlie zlinters house he nodded we are very much alike both living as single men both working with our hands not rich men either of us my needs will be no more than his needs were i think it may be very like his house she thought of charlie zlinters house as mary nolan had described it to her when she saw it last the swinging open door the pail half full of water the loaf gone green with mould and the bedclothes that a possum or a rat had made a nest in she shivered a little im not sure that i like the thought of building there she said perhaps its an unlucky place he felt for her hand and took it in his own as they walked along together we will go and see it tomorrow he said we shall know as soon as we are there if it is a lucky or an unlucky place i think perhaps it knew great happiness that place and if that is true it cannot be unlucky they walked up to the road in silence hand in hand at the old chevrolet they stopped unwilling to get into it and drive away the sun was dropping down towards the tops of the hills it was time that they were making their way home to leonora they lingered by the car a little without speaking and now he was holding both her hands it is here that we should say goodbye he said at last i will not stay tonight long at the dormans he hesitated it is very impertinent and very wrong he said but may i kiss you she smiled up at him colouring a little if you want to carl she said he put an arm round her shoulders and they stood locked together by the car for a few minutes presently she drew back a little still standing in his arms and said softly i dont want you to go away with the idea that im in love with you carl he stroked her cheek and said smiling what are we doing this for then she said because i dont suppose you get a chance to do this very often in the camp how long is it since you did this to a girl carl he thought back over his life holding her in his arms and caressing the soft hair behind her neck in eight years poor carl she drew closer and kissed him on the lips eight years is a long time presently he released her and they got into the car and drove back sitting very close together in the sunset light through jamieson and banbury to leonora station ten jack and jane dorman stood on the veranda of their homestead next morning watching the old utility as carl zlinter drove it to the road across the paddocks with jennifer beside him the grazier made a little grimace and turned away shes going to tell him i suppose he said his wife nodded she didnt want to tell him here with all of us about he glanced at her you think shes really serious shes serious all right jane replied i must say i think a lot of her for this there was never a doubt in her mind about what she ought to do jack dorman kicked the leg of a deckchair he couldnt have married her he said anyway not for years hes got another nine months to do in the camp for a start and then another three years as a student if he wants to be a doctor its probably all for the best jane went to the door of the kitchen well theres nothing we can do about it shes not known him very long she may forget about him shell have a bad time though jennifer sat quiet by carl zlinter as he drove the chev from the lamirra road up through the paddocks on the way to howqua getting out at each fence to open the gate for him to drive through she was tired and rather pale but she had worked with jane to get a nice lunch ready for him whatever might have happened it seemed to her important not to spoil his day it was the same fine cloudless summer january weather that they had had all the time that she had been at leonora the same thin wisp of smoke curled up from behind the buller range the same flocks of white cockatoos shrieked and wheeled in shining clouds from gum tree to gum tree in the paddocks that they drove across as they passed from the paddocks into the woods she roused herself and asked him how are you going to find out where the cabin was carl he smiled down at her i have a surveyors tape and little wires with coloured marking rags on them he said they are in the back i have asked jim forrest if i might borrow these things for today those are what you use for measuring out are they he nodded i think we can measure and find where the cabin was if billy slim is there he will help us they drove on up the track to jock mcdougalls paddock and the crimson and blue parrots flew ahead of them through the woods as they had before and a wallaby loped off among the trees till it was lost in the dappled sun and shadows of the aisles presently they came up to the meadow at the top of the ridge and parked the car in the shade and got out jennifer stood looking out over the wide view at the line after line of blue forestcovered hills merging into the distance in the bright sunlight this must be one of the loveliest places in the world she said this is where i should want a cabin if i lived in this country he smiled at her it would be wet and windy and cold up here in the winter he said with deep snow sometimes it would be more comfortable down in the valley by the river she did not answer but stood looking out over the blue ripples of the forests storing her memory he glanced at her and noticed for the first time that she was pale and drawn almost haggard you are looking tired he said shall i see if we can drive the chev down to the river she forced a smile she must not spoil his day im all right she said i didnt sleep very well last night thats all a walkll do me good wed better not risk getting the chev stuck or we might not be allowed to have it again they turned to the utility and took their lunch and the grill and the surveyors gear out of the back he would not let her carry anything it is quite all right he said if there is any more argument i will carry you too she laughed id like to see you try she said incautiously he dropped everything and caught her round the waist and lifted her quickly off the ground for a moment she rested in his arms feeling secure for the first time that day then she put on the mask of flippancy again and laughed down into his eyes all right you big brute she said now put me down again i knew i wasnt going to be safe here with a charlie zlinter in these woods he put her down kissed her on the cheek and released her flushing and laughing and bent to pick up the various packages and baskets she stood by him confused i wouldnt like to think that this kissing business was developing into a habit she said it is the usual thing he assured her in my country we kiss everybody goodmorning i dont believe thats true she replied and anyway this is australia if you go round kissing every girl you meet goodmorning youll find yourself in trouble i would not want to kiss every girl i meet goodmorning he said only one she made a face at him and they set off together down the track into the howqua all care momentarily put aside when they got down on to the river flat where the house had been they left the baskets and parcels at the end of the wire bridge and crossed to billy slims house on the other side they found him chopping wood in the shade he straightened up and greeted them morning jenny morning carl come fishing we have not come to fish the czech said you remember when last we came here we talked about the town of howqua and where charlie zlinter lived thats right you was talking of buying an allotment the czech said i have found out now where charlie zlinter lived wheres that number fifteen buller street the forest ranger scratched his head buller street he said somebody once told me where that used to be was it up the hill off victoria avenue i have here a map said zlinter i found one in the shire hall at banbury and i have made this copy they went into the livingroom of the house and spread it out upon the table my word the ranger said all the years ive been here this is the first time ive seen a map of howqua thats right theres buller street theres victoria avenue and theres the river he studied the map for a minute aw look he said it must have led up the hill just a little way upstream from the track looks like it was the old track down into the town jennifer said perhaps thats why he lived there because it was on the track out of the town too right the ranger said thats where a bullocky would want to live carl zlinter said do you know anything left on the ground from which we could measure to find where he lived i have a tape shouldnt be too difficult the ranger said lets get across the river and see id like to have a copy of that map some time i will make you one two hours later two hours that had been spent in measurement and argument over the dim lines on the land and the pencil tracings on the map they reached agreement they were standing on the slope of the hill fifty feet or so above the river overlooking the meadow where the town had been here there was a small space of flat land about half the size of a tennis court in the middle of the woods this must be it the ranger said thisll be where charlie zlinter lived jennifer said it must have been a much larger house than i thought mary nolan said that it was just a little cabin of one room aw look the ranger said this wouldnt all have been the house hed have to have had a place to put the wagon and maybe a store tor hay and that the house would only be on just a little bit of this flat if you wanted the exact place youd have to dig around a bit youd find stumps in the ground maybe or else the fireplace i would like to do that zlinter said if i come over to your place may i borrow a pick and a spade sure said the forest ranger borrow anything you like jennifer walked with them to the bridge carl went across with the ranger to the homestead to get pick and spade and she picked up the lunch basket and carried it back to the forest flat where charlie zlinter had lived she dropped down upon the grass in the thin shade of the gum trees and sat waiting for him to come back with the tools she was tired very tired with sorrow and joy too closely mixed glad for him that he had found so beautiful a place in which to build his fishing hut sad for herself that she was never going to see it he came back to her presently and found that she had laid a cloth upon the grass and put the food out on it wed better not make a fire here had we carl she asked i wouldnt like to see you start off by setting the forest on fire and weve got masses of cold meat here that jane gave us without the steaks he looked around i would like to find charlie zlinters fireplace and cook a steak on it for ceremony he said she smiled well dig around a bit after lunch and cook a ceremonial steak they ate together on the grassy patch of ground examining it as they sat and speculating where the cabin had been presently zlinter got up sandwich in hand and drove the spade into the vertical hill face at the end of the plateau farthest from the river the earth was blackened with soot here is the chimney he said quietly by making the house so against the bank it was more easy for him the earth bank itself would make the back of the fire and the heat would keep it solid what was above could easily be made of wood in this way he would need no bricks at all they discussed this as they sat eating it seemed reasonable enough will you make your cabin like that carl she asked he thought about it for a minute i do not know he said in the winter when there is no fishing my cabin may be empty for several months and then the earth will be wet and there will be no fire to keep it dry it might fall in upon the fireplace i think it will be better if i arrange my cabin differently and have a brick chimney away from the earth bank perhaps on that side over there i do not think it would be good to build my cabin right against the earth bank as he did it would be better to build it here where we are sitting now and not use the bank at all the water might run down and into the cabin when i am away she nodded put the wall about three or four feet from the bank she said you dont want to get the other wall too near the outer edge though the earth might slide there mightnt it with the weight of the walls he measured it with his eye it is to be only a little place no more than twelve feet long he said i have not got enough money for a palace she laughed i think there will be plenty of room but you are right the inner wall should be three or four feet from the earth bank and then there will be room outside the river wall to make a veranda and a bench to sit on and look out over the river or perhaps a deckchair she smiled youve got it all planned out havent you he laughed a little embarrassed it is important to me this to have a little place that is my own i know she said you must have that carl and youve picked a lovely place for it they sat smoking together after they had finished eating discussing the cabin where the door was to be where the fireplace the window and the bed presently they stubbed their cigarettes out carefully and packed away the lunch they got up and began to investigate the place more closely zlinter took the spade and cleared the briars and the undergrowth from the vertical earth face the sooty blackened earth extended over about three feet of the face showing clearly that the fireplace had been there and about centrally disposed upon the end of the flat he stood looking at it critically the side walls they would run outwards from the face he said at right angles perhaps one was somewhere here he set to work and began slicing the turf and leafmould from the level ground in a few minutes he was rewarded by a charred stump of rotten wood sticking up out of the soil they examined it together here was a wall he said he threw off his thin jacket and went on working in shirt and trousers only and gradually uncovered the remnants of the charred walls shown mostly by blackened streaks in the top soil in half an hour he had laid bare two rectangles of blackened soil and charred stumps and rested wiping the sweat from his neck and arms its fascinating carl the girl said its like digging up pompeii or something what would this one have been she indicated the outer rectangle he shrugged his shoulders perhaps a hayshed or a stable no he could not have put eight bullocks in there for hay i think and harness they rested together looking at what he had uncovered presently she asked where will your cabin go now carl i must make a drawing he said i will do that this week and give an order to mr forrest for the timber and the planking i think it would be best to have the chimney there and the door here opposite she shook her head its going to be very draughty you wont have a warm corner in the place if the doors opposite the chimney he nodded that is true i want to keep the outer wall for a window to see the height of the river when i shall get out of bed to see if i will fish or stay in bed she laughed the door should be on this side but we will put the chimney here on the side of the earth bank but four feet away thats like charlie zlinter had it but moved out a bit that is right he measured four feet with his eye from the blackened chimney marks on the earth face and said here will be the new fireplace he drove his shovel down into the ground to mark the place for her it hit with a metallic clang on stone there is rock here he said in surprise till then he had encountered nothing but soft earth he sliced away the leaves and top soil and uncovered a smooth face of rock level with the surface of the ground jennifer cried its mary nolans stone carl mary nolans stone she said there was a slab of stone in front of the fireplace in his cabin to keep the ashes back in the fire she said it weighed four hundredweight and he used to lift it up and carry it about to show her how strong he was this must be it he glanced at her if it weighs four hundredweight i do not think that i will pick it up and carry it about to show you how strong i am i think we will do that another day she laughed youre no man that is true he said nor are you mary nolan he went on clearing away the soil and revealed at last an irregularly shaped slab of stone about four square feet in area practically level on the top a thrust of the spade showed a white residue of ash between it and the earth face there was the fire he said it is as she said it was that settles it anyway the girl said this is charlie zlinters cabin he nodded this is the cabin i suppose they used to put saucepans and kettles on that to keep them warm before the fire she wrinkled her brows would there have been a wooden floor i think so he said i think they would have had a wooden floor and not just earth this stone was to prevent the fire from coming forward to burn the floor i think that is a good idea if youre going to use it again youll have to shift it the girl said its right in the middle of where your fire is to be now youll have to do what charlie zlinter did carl pick it up and carry it about he nodded it will have to be moved he stood studying it for a moment and then smiled at her i will pick it up and carry it about in my two hands one day when you are not here he said then you can come and see it in the new place she looked up at him i shant be able to do that carl she said quietly he glanced at her why not im going away but you will be coming back again in your holidays to stay with the dormans she shook her head i wont be coming here again carl im going home to england he stared at her in consternation to england she nodded i wanted to have this last day in the howqua and tell you about it here not at leonora with other people about ive got to go back to england carl at once im going by air on tuesday on the qantas constellation from sydney ive got to leave leonora tomorrow he dropped the shovel and crossed to her and took her hand what is it that has happened jenny he asked quietly is it something very bad she looked up at him blinking we got a cable last night she said soon after youd gone it was from daddy my mother died yesterday carl yesterday or the day before the times are all so muddling she hesitated it means that daddys all alone there now ive got to go a tear escaped and trickled down her cheek he put an arm around her shoulders come and sit down he said and tell me he led her to the bank and they sat down together she was crying in earnest now with the relief from keeping up the strain of a pretence with him he pulled out his handkerchief and glanced at it doubtfully you have a handkerchief jenny he asked this one is a little sweaty she smiled through her tears and took it he held her with one arm round her shoulders and wiped her eyes ive got one of my own somewhere she said but made no effort to find itim sorry to be such a fool carl i didnt get much sleep last night l would never think you were a fool he said would you like to tell me what has happened or would you rather not she took his hand that held the dirty handkerchief and held it in her own ive told you most of it she said miserably mummy had bronchitis and asthma and she died a flicker of technical interest lightened his concern for her was she ill when you came away from england she was always ill in the winter the girl said not very ill you know but not too good she didnt go out much in the worst winter months i never thought that she was in any danger or i wouldnt have come away he nodded thinking of cases he had known in the camps of germany a small additional strain or an infection and the heart would give out somewhat unexpectedly the paper says that it has been a very bad winter in europe she said listlessly i suppose thats it they sat in silence for a minute or two carl zlinter sat staring through the trees down at the river sparkling in the afternoon sunlight thinking of the blank space that would be coming in his life when she had gone tell me jenny he said at last have you got any brothers and sisters she knew what was in his mind and she shook her head im the only child ive got to go home carl i spoke to daddy last night on the telephone and told him i was coming right away i never should have come out here at all it was a very good thing for me that you did he said quietly there was a pause and then he asked her did you really speak to your father to england from leonora station she nodded mr dorman said it could be done and he arranged it all the call came through at about four in the morning six in the evening at home i could hear daddy quite well it only cost three pounds she paused the dormans have been awfully kind carl i hadnt got quite enough money left to go home by air and it would have taken months to get a passage home by sea they wouldnt hear of me going any other way theyre driving me to a place called albany tomorrow to get the train for sydney and janes coming with me to sydney to see me off in the aeroplane they couldnt have been kinder he looked down into her face are you quite sure that it is the best thing for you to go back he asked could not your father come here from england to join you she shook her head i thought of that of course she said and i tried to see it that way but it wouldnt work daddys been in practice in leicester all his life he doesnt like the new health service but hed never leave leicester at a time like this you havent met my father carl he and my mother were so wrapped up in each other hell be absolutely lost for a time anyway but in leicester hes got all his interests and his friends in the rotary club and the conservative club and the masons and the british medical association and all the other things he does hell be all right there once hes got over the first shock if im there to look after him and run the house he couldnt leave all his friends on top of this and come out here to a strange place where he knows nobody it wouldnt be fair to ask him but you he said would you rather live in england or live here id rather live here of course she said theres no comparison its a pity i ever came out here and saw this country since ive got to go back it was a very good thing for me he said again she pressed his hand im sorry carl its just one of those things they sat together in silence for a time she had told him everything now and he had to have time to digest what he had heard presently he asked her do you think you will ever come back to australia i shall try she said thoughtfully thats all i can say carl i shall try there may be a war and we may all get atombombed in england or there may not be enough money for me to get back here she paused if the health service keeps on getting worse for doctors it might be possible to get daddy to think about trying it out here but hes nearly sixty and thats awfully old to uproot and leave everything and everyone you know i dont believe ill ever be satisfied again with england after seeing this i shall keep trying to get back carl i cant say if ill ever manage it his hand caressed her shoulder do you know what would have happened if you had stayed here for another year she looked up at him what he said i should have got a job as soon as i was free from the camp and then i should have asked if you would marry me she sat motionless in his arms not looking at him staring down towards the river what sort of job carl he shrugged his shoulders i do not know in a business office perhaps any sort of job that would give enough money to be married on he paused and then asked gently what would you have said i dont know carl she looked up at him unsmiling one doesnt always do the right thing i suppose id have said yes id like to think that id have had the guts to say no why do you say that jenny she saw pain in his eyes maybe its a good thing that im going back to england after all she said wearily id hate to think of you taking any sort of job just so that you could get married id hate to be the girl that did that to you she freed herself a little from his arm and turned to face him you ought to be a doctor again carl i know it means another three years in a medical school and i know you havent got the money maybe you havent tried very hard yet but if you gave up medicine and just took any sort of job to marry me well i wouldnt like myself very much with your ability you ought to be a doctor or a surgeon it is not possible he said quietly i have thought of this many times for me to be a doctor means three years training in a medical school again it would cost at least fifteen hundred pounds and i have not got one tenth part of that money it would mean that i would be nearly forty years old before i could work in australia as a doctor i know it is a waste of my experience but wars bring much waste in the world and this is part of it i shall never be a doctor again i think you will she said i dont believe youd be happy in any other sort of job starting at your age they sat in silence for a time at last he asked quietly shall i ever see you again jenny she did not answer but sat looking at the ground and watching her he saw another tear escape and trickle down her cheek he put his arm around her shoulders again and drew her close to him and wiped it away with the sweaty handkerchief i am sorry he said i should not have asked that question she raised her face thats all right she said it was right to ask it carl ones got to face up to things im going back where i belong twelve thousand miles away upon the other side of the world and it may be years before i manage to get back to australia again youve got another nine months to do in the camp and after that youll have no money and nothing to bring you to england i would come to england somehow if i thought that you would want to see me there he said id always want to see you she said simply weve not known each other very long carl we dont know each other very well if everything had gone right for us and you had wanted to marry me in a years time id probably have been a very happy person but things havent gone right for us and maybe its just as well while youre on your own living as a single man youll have a chance somehow somewhere to get to be a doctor again with a wife and perhaps a baby on your hands you wouldnt have a hope youd have to take just any sort of job that offered whether it suited you or not i dont believe that youd be happy i dont believe that id be happy if i married you upon those terms he looked down at her smiling gently i thought that i knew what you were like what sort of a person you are he said i now find that i know nothing about you nothing at all thats what i said she replied but that doesnt alter the fact that we might have been very happy if wed married he sat staring down at the river rippling in the sun over the white stones holding her in his arms i would like to think that we shall meet again before we are too old he said i know that what you have said is true and that you are now to go twelve thousand miles away to the other side of the world perhaps it is not very likely that we shall see each other again but i am older than you jenny and i have learned this that if you want something very badly you can sometimes make it happen i want very badly to find you again before we have both forgotten the howqua valley and each other may i write to you sometimes she said if you do carl i shall be nagging at you all the time about becoming a doctor again you may do that he said quietly a doctor in this country could save enough money to get to england they sat almost motionless after that for a long long time perhaps a quarter of an hour they had said all that there was to say at last she stirred in his arms and sat up and said youll go on building your cabin here just the same carl wont you he was doubtful i am not now sure it will cost some money even if i get the timber very cheap from mr forrest and i may need all the money i can save she said i think you ought to go on with it carl youve got another nine months in the camp and after that it will be somewhere cheap for you to come to for a holiday write and tell me how youre getting on with it and what its like if i go on with it he said i shall always hold the memory of you and of this day when first we found this place of charlie zlinters she smiled faintly go on with it then i wouldnt like you to forget about me too quickly presently he asked her before i take you back to leonora will you tell me some things about your home jenny so that i can imagine where you are when i shall write to you of course carl she said what sort of things this leicester he said you told me once that it was rather ugly is it damaged by the war it didnt get bombed very much she said not like some places nobody could call it beautiful though its an industrial city mostly boots and shoes its rather ugly i suppose i dont think anyone would choose to live there if they hadnt got associations or a job is there beautiful country outside the city he asked she shook her head its all just farming country as flat as a pancake rather grey and foggy in the winter do you live in the city or outside it she said we live in a house about a mile and a half from the centre of the city she said in a fairly good part near the university its a suburban street of houses in a row all rather like the onenextdoor its not far from the shops i shall have nothing very interesting to tell you in my letters carl because very interesting things dont happen to women who keep house in leicester but ill do my best one other thing he said there is so much i ought to know about you that i do not know when is your birthday she said laughing oh carl its in august the twentyfifth and im twentyfour years old in case you want to know when is yours on june the seventeenth he said and i am thirtysix years old i am too old for you jenny thats nonsense she said quietly weve got enough difficulties without that one she paused theres so much we ought to know about each other and so little time to find it out i cant even think of all the things that i shall want to know it will be something to put into the letters from leicester he said all the things you want to know about me he stood up and drew her to her feet i am going to take you home now jenny he said back to leonora we have said everything there is to say and you are very tired tomorrow you must start and travel for six days across the world before we say goodbye will you promise me two things if i can she said what are they i want you to go straight to bed when you get back to leonora station and sleep she pressed his hand dear carl ive got some packing to do but i think therell be time in the morning yes ill go to bed whats the other one i want you to remember that i love you very much he said ill always do that carl he left her then and took the spade and the pick down the hill to return them to billy slim she watched his lean form striding down the hill she was so tired that she could think of nothing clearly she only knew that she loved him and that he was much too thin she sank down on the grass again and sat there in the dappled sunlight under the great trees in a stupor of misery and weariness when he came back to her he was calm and matteroffact he picked up the basket and the grill and raised her to her feet i am going to take you home now jenny he said you have long travelling ahead of you and i have very much work we shall neither of us help ourselves or help each other by mourning over our bad luck she smiled weakly too right carl and then she said ive only been three weeks in this country but im getting to speak like an australian already we are both of us australians by our choice he said some day we shall be truly australians and live here together they walked up the steep rutted track through the woods slowly hand in hand not speaking very much his calm assurance comforted her and now the years before her did not seem so bleak they walked steadily not hurrying not pausing at the end of an hour they came to the old chevrolet utility parked in jock mcdougalls paddock he put the basket in the back of the utility and turned to her and took her in his arms this is where we have to say goodbye for a little time he said perhaps it will not be for very long we are both young and healthy and for people as we are twelve thousand miles may not be quite enough to keep us apart we will not stay here long because we have said everything now to each other and you are very tired other things we can say by letters to each other she stood in his arms while they kissed for a minute or two then he released her and with no more spoken he put her into the utility and got in beside her and drove down the track towards the highway and leonora station they came to the station half an hour later she got out and opened the three gates at the end they drove into the yard by the homestead he stopped the car by the kitchen door we will make this very short now he said in a low tone goodbye jenny she said goodbye carl and got out of the car and forced a smile at him and went into the house he turned back to the car expressionless and took the basket and put it on the edge of the veranda and got into the car again and drove it into the shed where it belonged he hesitated for a moment wondering whether he should go into the house to see the dormans and decided against it he would come in one evening in a few days time to thank them for the use of the car after jennifer had gone he took his grill and the measuring tape and the wire pegs from the back of the utility and made for the yard gate he turned the corner of the house and jack dorman was there sitting on the edge of the veranda waiting for him he paused and said i have put the chev back in the shed mr dorman it was very kind of you to lend it i do not think that we shall need to borrow it again jenny told you she was going back to england the grazier held out his packet of cigarettes the czech took one and lit it she has told me that he said too bad shes got to go back after such a short stay in australia jack dorman said it is bad luck carl zlinter said but she is doing the right thing and it is like her to decide the way she has thats right the grazier agreed they smoked in silence for a minute what are you going to do yourself jack dorman asked at last got another nine months in the woods havent you the other nodded after that i will try to be a doctor again i will go and see dr jennings very soon i think and talk to him and find if it is possible if i may not be a doctor here i will try other countries in pakistan i could be a doctor now at once but i do not want to live in pakistan i want to live here itld be quite a good thing to start off with dr jennings the grazier said thoughtfully he thinks a lot of what you did with those two operations he was very friendly to me at the inquest the czech said i will go and talk to him for a start the grazier got slowly to his feet come along and see us now and then and lets know how youre going on he said if you need a car to get around in theres the chev any time carl zlinter said it is very kind of you but i would not like to use your car weve got three cars on the station now the grazier said and im getting a fourth a landrover we shant miss the chev if you take it if youre going to be running in and out of town on this doctoring business you dont want to be stuck for a car it would be a great help certainly youd better get yourself a licence said jack dorman theres no sense in running foul of the police you can come and take the chev when you want it next day in the afternoon he drove a whitefaced rather silent jennifer with his wife to albury to catch the sydney express a matter of a hundred miles or so he said goodbye gruffly to jennifer at the station and turned his ford for home he got back to banbury by five oclock hot and thirsty and ready for a few beers he parked under the trees and went into the saloon bar of the queens head hotel it was full of his grazier neighbours and old pat halloran and dr jennings he crossed to the doctor and drank a beer or two with him slaking the dust from his dry throat presently he said i had a talk with splinter yesterday seems like he wants to be a doctor again after his times up he came to see me today the doctor said i told him that id write to the secretary of the bma in melbourne about him but i dont know that ill do much good the medical registration board have made these rules and thats all about it its a pity said the grazier he tells me that hes going to leave australia if he cant be a doctor here seems like he can practise in pakistan on the degrees he got in his own place i wouldnt be surprised the doctor said drily he paused looking at his glass of beer in thought he didnt tell me that he said i could put that in my letter perhaps hows the chap with the fractured skull going on hes getting onfine zlinter took the most appalling risk with him operating under those conditions i suppose he couldnt do anything else anyway the patients going on all right hes been conscious for some days now and he seems to be completely normal mentally im going to put that in my letter of course we should have a job for a bloke like that the grazier said it seems all wrong that he should have to go to pakistan well yes with reservations jennings said hes probably a very gifted surgeon that sort of skill seems to be born in people either you can do it or you cant and if you cant youd better leave it alone at the same time there may be very big gaps in his knowledge and experience that we dont know about theres only one place to check up on that and thats in a teaching hospital it neednt take three years though said the grazier well perhaps not i dont know much about it jack maybe they make exceptions in a case like this maybe they dont im going down to melbourne in a fortnights time and ill look in and see the secretary id like to know how it goes on the grazier said he paused and took a drink of beer theres another thing he said and thats that he hasnt got any money i wouldnt mind helping a bit if that was the only thing the doctor glanced up thats very generous of you aw look jack dorman said you know how it is with wool these days the wife likes him and jenny likes him hes right if everything else was set i wouldnt want to see the thing go crook because of the money keep that under your hat though i havent told him and i dont intend to for a while you wouldnt mind it if i told the secretary though the doctor said it all helps to build a case up if one can say that local people are prepared to put up money its another thing you can tell him that the grazier said ill drop in and talk to him myself if they want any kind of sponsor but dont let zlinter know so long as you can help it much better let him manage it his own way if he can on saturday evening five days later the doctor posted his letter to the secretary of the british medical association in his overworked routine he had little time for correspondence and he had little practice in setting out a careful reasoned letter he finished a draft on wednesday he rewrote it on friday and copied it out and posted it on saturday feeling that if he worked upon it any longer he would make it worse on saturday evening carl zlinter slept at billy slims house in the howqua valley tired with a day of strenuous work he had driven out that morning in a truck belonging to the timber company to deposit his load of sawn lumber and a hundred bricks in jock mcdougalls paddock from there he had walked down to the forest rangers house to borrow a horse and sledge and he had trudged up and down hill all the day transporting his building materials down to the flat where charlie zlinters house had been he had driven himself hard for ten hours haunted by the memory of jennifer at each turn of the road giving himself little time for grief by nightfall he had got all his stuff down to the site and he was glad to pack up and go and grill his steak upon the forest rangers fire and chat with him for a short time before the sleep of sheer exhaustion on that same saturday evening jennifer morton drove in the coach from london airport to the airways terminal at victoria dazed and unhappy in the london scene a thin february drizzle was falling and the air was damp and raw after the hot australian summer she had bought a copy of the evening standard at the airport and had glanced at the headlines after which the paper lay unheeded in her lap the meat ration was down to matchbox size and was to be increased in price the minister for war had made a foolish speech and the minister for health an inflammatory one full of class prejudice she knew it all so well and she was so tired of these people tired tired tired of everything that she had come back to it was a terrible mistake she felt to go out of england if you had to come back it was far better to stay quietly at home and do the daily round and not know what went on in other happier countries she was too tired to go on to leicester that night although she could have done so too miserable to face her father in his grief till she had mastered her own troubles and grown more accustomed to the english way of life she took a taxi from the airways terminal to st pancras station and got a room for the night at the st pancras hotel a clean bare personal hotel room but warm and with a comfortable bed her head was still swimming with the vista of the countries she had flashed through her stomach still upset with irregular meals served at strange hours and in strange places she could not eat anything she threw off her clothes and had a bath and went to bed and lay for a long time listening to the clamour of the london traffic crying a little mourning for the brown foreigner she loved and for the clear bright sunlight of the howqua valley on sunday morning carl zlinter got up at dawn and went up early to the flat among the gum trees and stood for a few minutes planning his work he decided that it was not practical to place his house exactly where the other one had been he would move it laterally about a foot to clear the charred stumps of the old posts he came to the conclusion that he would build the brick chimney first and make the wooden house to suit the chimney for an inexperienced builder it would be easier that way he marked out the foundations for the chimney with thrusts of his spade and considered the stone slab reputed to weigh four hundredweight it now lay more or less where the fire was to be it would have to be moved back about three feet and to one side he went back to the forest rangers house to borrow his crowbar resolved to work all day and exorcise his troubles with fatigue again on sunday morning jennifer morton came by train to leicester station and left her two suitcases in the cloakroom for her father to pick up in the car and walked in a fine misty rain up the grey length of london road to her home by victoria park she pushed the familiar front door open and walked into the narrow hall it now seemed small and rather mean to her she opened the drawingroom door and caught her father just getting up out of his chair at the sound ot her step and realized that he had been asleep he looked older than when she had gone away about ten weeks before and the room was dirty and the tiny fire of coal was smoking his face lit up when he saw her jenny he cried i was waiting by the telephone because i thought youd ring from london she crossed to him and kissed him poor old daddy she said softly im back now anyhow i wish to god id never gone away eleven jennifer soon found that she had a fulltime job ahead of her in leicester in the last fortnight of her mothers life the house had been in complete confusion with a nurse living in because of the extra work the domestic who came in each morning had given notice and left and it had proved impossible to replace her the hospital nurse as nurses will in an emergency had done cleaning and housekeeping for her patient jobs which were no part of her duties since she had left little had been done within the house jennifers father had been greatly overworked in that grey winter season and in the crisis he had taken all of his meals out to ease the burden he had gone on taking his meals out after the funeral and the house had been let go it was dirty and uneared for and her mothers bedroom was still full of all her clothes and personal belongings on top of that her father was working fourteen hours a day and requiring meals at irregular hours and every day at surgery hours jennifer had to monitor innumerable patients who came for a prescription of a few tablets of aspirin on the health service or a certificate from her father exempting them from work until she came to do the job herself jennifer had not realized how great a burden can be thrown upon a doctors wife in the english system of state medicine without staff and buildings adapted for the crowds of patients as she had realized the loss of his wife had made an enormous gap in her fathers life she found him distracted and morose and with a morbid interest in her mothers grave and the choice of the tombstone and the text to go on it at first she fell in with these interests because they seemed to be the only ones he had but presently she came to feel that the continual walks up to the cemetery were not good for him and started to try to get him interested in other things they dined several times at a hotel and went to the pictures but neither of them enjoyed these evenings very much edward morion wasnt greatly excited by the cinema and both of them disliked the poorlycooked and standardized meals at the hotel presently she found that when her father managed to get free from patients to go to his club for a game of bridge before dinner he came back relaxed and cheerful from good company and whisky and she began managing the patients to contrive that he should get at least two of these evenings a week she came to look with some resentment at the surgery patients with their trivial requirements for free medicine and their endless papers to be signed the bottom was reached for her when a man came for medicine and a certificate exempting him from work because he couldnt wake up in the morning presently she extended these activities and by disciplining the patients with a sarcastic tongue she managed to free her father for lunches of the rotary club for dinners of the organizations he belonged to and even for an occasional game of bowls as summer came on patients began to shun this cynical badtempered redhaired girl who thought so little of their rights to free aperients and said rude things about the forms that they brought to be signed by the doctor and they began to transfer their allegiance and their capitation fees to more accommodating practitioners which jennifer thought was a very good thing with the closer insight that she now had into her fathers finances she was coming to the conclusion that he could do a good deal less work and still be comfortably solvent she was distressed to find how much he had been saving for her mother in case he had died first and how restricted his own life had been in consequence she was staggered to find how much her mothers illnesses had cost how much her father had been paying out in life insurance premiums for her security she got him to surrender two of the policies in june she had no close friends in leicester having worked in london for some years the two or three girls with whom she had been intimate at school had married and gone away and though she had a number of school acquaintances in the district she did not bother much with them she felt herself to be a transient in her own home town and though she had only been in australia for about a month she felt herself to be far more australian than english in her outlook controls that she had once accepted as the normal way of life now irritated her it infuriated her when she neglected to order coal before the given date and so lost two months ration of the precious stuff studying to make meals more interesting for her father she thought longingly of the claret that jack dorman bought in fivegallon stone jars for seven shillings a gallon and of unlimited cream the ration books perplexed her and meat was a continual badtempered joke she did her best to conceal these feelings from her father she had not come home to england to distress him by whining about a better country on the other side of the world all his friends and all his interests were in leicester and her job was to make the best of it she was not entirely successful in her efforts edward morton was no fool and as the grief at his wifes death abated he began to take more interest in his daughter the frequent airmail letters that she never discussed with him showed that her interests were very far away and the fact that most of them were in a continental handwriting intrigued him he was quite shrewd enough to realize that in the few weeks she had spent out there a man had come into her life he set himself to draw her out one evening siting by the fire when they had done the washingup whats it really like out in australia jenny he inquired is it very different from this i dont mean physical things like food and drink whats it really like she sat staring down at the socks that she was darning its very like england in most ways she said the people out there think of everything in terms of england i believe they think more of the king and queen than we do england seems to mean an awful lot to them i dont know how to tell you what its really like its like england only better he sat digesting this for a minute or two is it like ethel trehearn thought that it would be like england was half a century ago not really she said slowly there arent the servants and the social life that she was thinking of all thats quite different but out there you feel perhaps it may be rather like the england she was thinking of essentially if you do a good job you get a good life she raised her eyes its all so very english she said when they make some money they spend it in the sort of way wed spend it if we were allowed to make any and if we were allowed to spend it you didnt feel as if you were a stranger there she shook her head i never felt as if i was a stranger he filled and lit his pipe meet any doctors out there i met one she said they dont have any health service there do they i dont think so she said theres no panel even like we used to have i think there may be some sort of a voluntary insurance scheme but im really not very sure daddy are there enough doctors to go round too many or too few far too few i think thats in the country where the dormans live i dont know about the towns he sat in silence for a minute thinking it over this doctor that you met do you know what he charged a visit i dont know he wasnt in practice there was no harm in telling him and it might make things easier between them than if she were to keep up an unnecessary concealment he was a dp a czech doctor whos not on the register hes the one who keeps writing to me oh i wasnt trying to be nosey jenny i know you werent i dont mind telling you about him whats his name carl zlinter she said they call him splinter in the lumber camp all dps have to work where theyre directed for two years when they first come to australia he works at cutting down trees he graduated at prague and then he was a surgeon in the german army in the war he opened his eyes this daughter of his had certainly wandered far from leicester how did you meet him jenny there was an accident with a bulldozer in the forest she said i was with jack dorman we came along just after it had happened she could smell the aromatic odours of the gum tree forest and feel the hot sunshine in her memory she stared into the fire too small for coal economy to warm the room two men were hurt very badly one with a foot trapped under the bulldozer that had to be taken off upon the spot and one with a fractured skull there was nobody to do anything about it but carl and no woman to act as nurse but me so he asked me to help him with the amputation and the trephine he did both of them beautifully but then the man with the amputation got hold of a bottle of whisky and got fighting drunk and died there was a fearful row about it because carl wasnt on the register of course her father was deeply interested in all his medical experience such a situation had never arisen in leicester he asked a number of questions about the operations and the treatment but refrained from more personal inquiries and jennifer did not take the story further than the medical side her father had enough information to digest without telling him about the lost township of howqua and charlie zlinter and his dog all she said was working with him like that kind of broke the ice he writes to me still her father smiled i imagine that you couldnt be too distant after getting yourselves into a scrape like that jennifers mother had been a nurse his mind went back to the day when he had met her first at st thomass when he was a medical student he had stepped back suddenly and made her drop a thermometer which broke and then he had to pacify the sister and explain that it was his fault medicine was strong in jennifers family but it was a pity that she had got mixed up with a foreigner who wasnt on the register jennifer kept up a correspondence with jane dorman largely about angelas coming visit to england with some reluctance the dormans had decided to let her go and take a job in the old country provided that she had a job lined up to go to before leaving australia and they had booked a passage for her for the following january jennifer and her father went to some trouble over this and finally got the promise of a job for her at st marys hospital in paddington and put her down for a room in a hostel for young women in marylebone they were rewarded by an ecstatic letter from angela and a steady flow of food parcels from jane tim archer wrote rather a depressed letter about all this to jennifer who told him in reply that he had nothing much to worry about in her opinion paddington would probably cure angela of her obsession in about two years and what he had to do was to get himself a grazing property within that time from jane she heard about her oil painting stanislaus shulkin had painted a picture of the main street of banbury in glowing sunset light which jane liked for its glorious colours and jack dorman liked for its exactitude and because it showed the queens head hotel it now hung in the kitchen of leonora homestead and in planning the new house jane dorman was making a special place for it where she could see it as she sat before the fire it had been much admired in the neighbourhood and mr shulkin had got commissions from two of their station neighbours who had come to the conclusion that a thing like that was rather nice to have about the house i dont know what hes done with the portrait he was doing of you jane wrote he told me that he couldnt finish it because youd gone away and anyway he said it wasnt any good i asked him once if i could see it because i never saw it at all but he turned all arty and said that he never showed unfinished work to anyone my own belief is that splinters got it but i dont know that perhaps you do of carl zlinter she said we see him about once a month he came here to tea on sunday dr jennings wrote to the british medical association about getting him on the register in less than three years and carl has been to melbourne twice for interviews he thinks hell probably get some concession and he seems very anxious now to get on to the register and be allowed to practise in victoria but i dont know where the moneys coming from to keep him while he studies jack told me to see if i could find out how he stood for money and i tried to without asking the direct question but he wasnt a bit receptive apparently he thinks he can manage his affairs himself and of course its much better if he can but where the moneys coming from i cant tell you however there it is and he seems quite certain that hes going to be a doctor again the only thing that seems to worry him is that its going to be a long job and that hell be so old before hes able to set up a home jennifer heard from carl zlinter at odd intervals usually tour or five times in a month he wrote to her irregularly and when the mood was on him on one occasion she got three letters in a week and then nothing for a fortnight his letters contained few protestations of love they were mostly factual accounts of what he had been doing sometimes with touches of sly humour as jane had supposed jennifer knew all about her picture i have your portrait hanging in my hut in the howqua he wrote and because i go there regularly even in this bad weather i see you every weekend last saturday there were three inches of snow in jock mcdougalls paddock where we parked the chev and i got my feet wet but i had plenty of dry wood in the hut and we soon had a big fire going harry peters was with me the driver of the bulldozer who had the head injury that we operated upon he is quite recovered now and is back on the job driving a truck but i do not think he will be able to drive a bulldozer again safely he does not want to he wants to go to melbourne and study metallurgy and get a job in a steel works and i think he will be doing this before very long in the meantime he comes out with me each week to howqua jennifer wondered what on earth they found to do in the howqua valley in the snow he had told her in a previous letter that the fishing season was over perhaps they worked upon the furnishings and details of the hut i had a great deal of trouble with stan shulkin over your picture because he did not want to give it to me he said it was too good to give to mrs dorman and he was going to keep it and put it in an exhibition i told him that you would certainly bring him to court if he did that without asking your permission and i should go at once to the police sergeant russell and tell him and then he said that i could have it if i paid him for it i told him that he was a very greedy man because mrs dorman had paid him for three pictures and then he said this was an extra that he had not shown to mrs dorman however i got it from him in the end by promising to pay him when i became qualified as a doctor and now it hangs in the hut at the howqua and i look forward all the week to going there to see it again he told her very little about his negotiations with the medical registration board thoughout his letters there was a calm assurance that he would be a doctor again but he had no definite ideas on how iong it would take he said once i am going to melbourne again next week to see the mrb and i think it may be easier to get into a hospital in england than in melbourne because the melbourne hospitals are very full of australian students i am thinking of booking a passage to england because it may take a long time to get a passage and they will give back the money if you do not go apparently he was not short of money and this puzzled jennifer a good deal she asked in her next letter if he had really booked a passage to england but he did not answer nor did he answer when she asked a second time she stopped asking after that if he did not want to tell her things he need not they were of different nationalities and from different backgrounds and she knew that it would be a long time if they ever married before she understood him thoroughly his letters were a great pleasure to her and his calm assurance that all would be well was comforting in september she got a letter that thrilled her and informed her at the same time it has been arranged for me here that i can study for the english medical degree at guys hospital in london because there is no room in the melbourne hospitals i do not know how long it will be necessary for me to study and i do not think that they will tell me till i get there i have passed two examinations in melbourne since you left for england and these results are good in london you see i have been working very hard in the evenings at lamirra and at howqua learning again in english all the text book medicine i learned and forgot when i was a young man so now they say that if i can get to england i may go to guys hospital i do not know how long i must work there before i become qualified perhaps not more than a year and in any case i do not think longer than two years so now i must come to england there is a ship called the achilles that is now loading sugar at townsville in queensland and i may be able to take a job on her as steward or on some other ship because this is the season when the sugar is sent to england i may have to pay for the passage and if that is needed i will pay but i have not got very much money so if i can work i would like it i am leaving lamirra at the end of this week to go by train to townsville which i think will take three days i am sorry to leave this place it has been good for me after so many years in camps in europe to work for a time in the woods i like this country very much and when i am qualified to work as a doctor i would like much to come back to banbury and work with dr jennings if he has still no other doctor to help him i am bringing your picture with me in a packingcase i have asked billy slim to look after my hut at howqua and i have left him a little money for repairs and if a window blows in or a sheet of iron on the roof comes loose he will mend it for me so it will be there for me to have when i can come back to this country and there for you also i hope i do not think that it will be possible for you to write to me again because i do not know what ship i shall go on or when it will start or when i shall come to england i will write to you to tell you these things as quickly as i know them and i will come to leicester to see you very soon she read this letter over and over again in the privacy of her bedroom the sheer tragedy of her return to england was working out in comedy carl zlinter was on his way to england and she would see him again a picture came into her mind of the dynamic energy and competence of this dark lean man that had produced this result and in so short a time in a barrack hut at lamirra a hut similar to the one that he had operated in with her smelling of washing and whisky and raw unpainted wood he had studied every night at medical text books he had then gone down to melbourne and sat for two examinations in a language foreign to him in a strange place with strange people and had passed them over and above this academic effort he had somehow or other financed himself and he had negotiated and corresponded till he had secured himself a place in a hospital in england twelve thousand miles away a country that he had never been to and an alien enemy country this man was shouldering his way through all these difficulties and brushing each of them aside in turn because he wanted to practise as a doctor in the country of his choice and because he wanted to marry her she could not possibly keep this news to herself at dinner that night she said as casually as she could manage carl zlinters coming to england daddy hes going to requalify at guys he noted her shining eyes and her faint colour and he was glad for this daughter of his whatever changes there might be in store for him thats interesting he said equally casually how did he manage that she told him if not all about it as much as she thought good for him to know they discussed the matter for a quarter of an hour in the end he asked whats he going to do when hes qualified practise in england in the health service she shook her head i shouldnt think so he wants to go back to australia and practise at banbury theres a doctor there dr jennings i told you about him hes very overworked carl thinks dr jennings might take him as an assistant if he can get qualified before anyone else gets in he was about to ask her if she would like to go back to australia herself but he stopped and said nothing no sense in asking her a thing like that he knew very well that if she were free of her responsibilities to himself she would never have corrie back to england if this chap zlinter were to ask her to marry him and go back with him to australia he could not possibly stand in her way for the first time the thought of going to australia came into his mind as a serious possibility leicester without his wife was not the place it once had been for him if jennifer were to marry and go back to australia he might have to choose between going with them and attempting to carry on alone in leicester where he had worked all his life and where all his friends were it was not a thing to be decided lightly he would hardly make many new friends at his age in australia but he would be desperately lonely if he tried to live alone at home in leicester in australia he might do a little work perhaps and earn a little money and so be able to come back to england every year or two to see his friends jennifer heard from carl a week later that the achilles had sailed without him and he was coming home upon a ship called the innisfail probably sailing in about three days time they will not take me as steward he wrote and i shall have to pay for the journey which is a very bad thing but i shall have time to work i have brought many medical books with me to read upon the journey if i was qualified as doctor i could work as ships doctor on the journey because they have difficulty in getting doctors now at townsville but although i have showed my prague degree they will not accept it because english ships must have an english doctor when i am an english doctor i shall be able to practise anywhere in the world i think she heard nothing more until she got an airmail letter from port said nearly a month later his ship had called for fuel at colombo we do not go very fast he said and although we have gone steadily all the time it has taken us thirtyfour days to get to this place i think we shall arrive in london in about another fortnight and i must then find a place cheap to live near to the hospital as soon as it is possible i will come to leicester but i cannot say what day that will be on he came to her on a friday evening at the end of november she had walked down to the chemist to pick up a parcel for her father it was a fine starry night with a cold wind that made her walk quickly she was fighting her way back headdown against a freezing wind in the suburban street she raised her head as she got near the house and saw a man peering at the houses in the half light of the street lamps trying to read the numbers perhaps looking for the doctors plate upon the door he was a tall man rather thin dressed in a foreign soft felt hat and in a shabby raincoat she cried carl and ran to meet him he turned and said jenny and took both her hands she dropped the parcel and something in it cracked as it fell it lay unheeded at their feet as he kissed her she said presently oh carl when did you get to england he held her close we arrived on tuesday he said to the london docks i have found a room to live in in coram street in bloomsbury and i have been to the hospital yesterday and i am to start working on monday i do not know how long it is that i shall have to work but i think that it will be for one and a half years i do not think it will be longer than that she said oh carl thats splendid what are you doing now have you come for the weekend he said a little diffidently i did not know if it would be convenient if i should stay i have brought a bag but i have left it at the station in the cloakroom perhaps i could take a room at the hotel and see you again tomorrow of course not carl weve got a spare room here ill make up the bed thats where we live she said nodding at the house daddys in there now he wants to meet you she stood in his arms thinking for a moment weve got such a lot to talk about she said daddys got a meeting of the committee of the bowls club in our house tonight hes the chairman or the president or something dont lets get mixed up in that would you mind if we go out and have a meal some place where we can talk they finish about nine oclock generally we can come back then and you can meet daddy he smiled down at her of course he said whatever you will say is good for me wait here just a minute she said ill go in and put this parcel down and tell daddy what were doing she vanished into the house and he stood waiting for her on the pavement in the diningroom her father was laying out the table with paper and pencils before each chair for the bowls club meeting when this happened they had their evening meal at the kitchen table she came to him in her overcoat flushed and brighteyed daddy she said i got this parcel and i dropped it and heard it crack i believe ive bust whatevers in it carl zlinters here and im going to make up the spare room for him im going out to dinner with him now and well be back when this committee meetings over could you get your own meal do you think its sausages theyre in the fridge and theres half of that jam tart we had for lunch the day before yesterday on a plate in the larder he smiled at her excitement his concern over the parcel half forgotten thats all right he said what have you done with him hes outside waiting for me well bring him in and lets say howdoyoudo to him not now she said ill bring him in when your committees over when youve got time to meet him properly well be back about halfpast nine or ten she whisked out of the room and the front door slammed behind her she left her father unpacking the parcel and smiling thoughtfully changes were coming to him again whether he liked it or not jennifer joined zlinter underneath the street lamp i know a little place where we can get a meal she said not like wed have got in australia of course but good for here its quiet there and we can talk she took his arm and they went off together down the street walking very close to each other she took him to a cafe near the station a frowsy place undecorated for some fifteen years but reasonably warm inside and cheap she knew that he was short of money and she knew that he would never let her pay for her own meal there was no meat on the menu so they ordered fish pie and cabbage with apple tart and custard to follow and then they settled down and talked and talked and talked they sat so long over their meal that the bored waitress began turning out the lights they woke up to the fact that it was eight oclock and the place was closing jennifer said well have to go carl he paid the bill and helped her into her coat he said shall we go back to the station and get my bag and take it to your house its too early she objected that blasted meeting wont be over yet and theres no fire in the drawingroom she thought for a moment theres a little picture theatre carl she said its a bit of a bughouse its showing one of those pictures the americans make for south america all gigolos and blackhaired beauties dancing with tambourines a perfect stinker the housell be half empty if we go in there we can talk quietly at the back of the circle they went there and the flick was as she had described it a noisy picture with plenty of orchestra and raucous singing in the warmth of the circle seated very close together they gave no attention whatsoever to the screen tell me one thing carl she said when they were settled down what are you doing about money you told me once that you wouldnt be able to get to be a doctor again because youd never have enough money are things very difficult he pressed her hand between his own i must be very careful he said i have now about one thousand one hundred pounds and on that i must live till i am qualified then i shall ask if you will marry me and by that time i shall be quite broke well manage somehow carl i have not asked you yet he observed i am only warning and im warning you that if you dont look out i might say yes he leaned a little from her and undid his overcoat he fished in an inside pocket and pulled out a little object he put it in her hand it is for you he said one day perhaps not yet she held it up to the reflected light from the technicolour scene it was a ring formed heavily of reddish gold with curious cablelike markings around it oh carl she said is this a wedding ring he took it from her you go too quickly he said it is an engagement ring but it is not for you just yet not till i have met your father and he has said that he agrees well let me see it anyway i promise i wont put it on he gave it back to her its just like a wedding ring she said its gold isnt it i know that an engagement ring it should have precious stones he said i could not afford to buy precious stones to put in it jenny but this is solid gold gold from the howqua he smiled down at her i know that it is very pure gold because i made it myself she stared at him in the dim light from the screen you made it i made it he replied harry peters showed me how to make a ring like this or a bracelet of gold or a pendant he is the man who had the broken head on who we did trephine it is very lucky that we managed to save his life or he could not have taught me how to do these things but carl where did you get the gold from it is charlie zlinters gold he told her quietly it would not be good for you to talk about this perhaps even here in england and on the other side of the world in the stuffy half light of the midland cinema she stared up at him i wont say a word carl charlie zlinters gold there was a box he said the box that mary nolan told you she had seen a tin box that he called his ditty box in this box he kept his valuables thats right said jennifer when she went back to the cabin the morning he was drowned the door was open and she looked for the box to put it away for him and she couldnt find it he nodded charlie zlinter had put it away before he was not too drunk to look after his money what do you mean she asked where did he put it he smiled at her he had a very simple place for his box a place that would be safe from forest fires and thieves and anything perhaps only a very simple man a sailor and a bullock driver would have thought of such a simple place to keep his box and yet that was so safe where was that carl under the stone he said the stone that weighed four hundredweight that only he could lift you remember the big stone we found together on our last day in the howqua she could remember every detail of that day and the sheer grief of it and the sunshine and the clean scent of the eucalypts and the flashing reflections from the river down below and the brilliance of the parrots in the woods of course i do she said was the box under that it was under the stone he said i found it only one week after you were gone to england but i did not dare to say that in a letter i think if it was known i had found gold it would be taken by the police perhaps in england also so you must not talk about it i think that it is better that i use it to become a doctor i wont say a word carl how much gold was there there were fiftytwo coins of one pound he told her sovereigns they are called also there was just over five pounds in weight of washed river gold the gold dust that they find in the river beds billy slim has told me that in howqua this gold dust was used for money the hotel would take it for payment and they had little scales in the bar to weigh the gold with how much it was worth i think also the bullock driver he took gold for payment too because in the box were little brass scales also his gold dust was in two leather bags one large bag and one small bag was he a relation of yours carl were there any papers to say who he was he shook his head i do not know the water had been lying in the hole beneath the stone and the box was eaten away with rust there had been papers once but nothing was left nothing that i could read there was only the rusted sides and bottom of the box and the two leather bags rotten and with the gold spilling out from them and the fiftytwo gold coins lying in the rust and the little scales he paused i do not think that we shall ever know who charlie zlinter was what a shame she sat thinking about it for a time absently watching the coloured mime upon the screen presently she turned to him again you must have had a job lifting that stone carl she said did you have anyone to help you he shook his head i was quite alone he hesitated i might have had billy slim to help he said it was lucky it was the first time that i had been there since we said goodbye and i was sad and i went there to work very hard and to be quite alone because it is good to work very hard when everything seems bad she pressed his hand i had the timber for the house and i borrowed billys crowbar and i levered up each corner of the stone and put underneath a wedge of wood it took nearly all the day to move it four feet back and make the new place for it and then when it was moved away from the old hole i saw the box she asked him what did you do when you saw it carl were you terribly excited he said quietly i was very sad that we had not found it together i stood looking at the rusty pieces and the things in the hole and i thought that must be the box that mary nolan talked about and i was not at all excited i was very sad that you had had to go away and that you were not there to share the discovery with me she put her face up impulsively and he leaned forward in the half light and kissed her presently she said what do you do with gold dust when youve got it carl if you cant tell anybody about it he smiled down at her there are several things that you can do with gold dust he told her but they are all very wicked and if you are discovered you will go to prison one way is that you can take out a licence to be a prospector for gold then you go camping up the river in deserted places washing the gravel in a little pan to try to find gold presently you find it and come back with it and sell it to the bank she laughed did you do that no he said i thought that it would become complicated if they ask where i had found it it might she agreed well what did you do another way he said imperturbably is to build a little hut in the middle of the woods where nobody would ever think to go like the howqua she laughed softly it could be like the howqua he agreed and you must have a friend a good friend who thinks he has a debt to you who understands metallurgy and how metals can be melted like harry peters she observed i wondered why on earth you took him to the howqua it would be like harry peters he agreed and there in the hut you make a little furnace with a cylinder of gas to heat a little crucible and these things have to be hidden very carefully from billy slim oh carl and then he said you bring many candles and you melt the wax and you carve a bracelet out of candlewax or it could be a ring like this ring and you put the wax bracelet in a pan of soft plaster of paris and you let the plaster set till it is hard and then you heat the plaster and the wax melts and runs out of a small hole you make and so you have a mould in the middle of the plaster where the wax bracelet was then you pour in the melted gold and let it cool and break the plaster away and there is your bracelet or your ring made of solid gold she looked up laughing is that how my ring was made carl he pressed her hand i made that ring and a hundred and five bracelets all in four weekends a hundred and five bracelets what on earth did you do with them it is very tedious he said you must take one bracelet and go to a jeweller in melbourne and to him you say that your aunt catherine has died who lived in the goldfields fifty years ago and you have found this bracelet in her jewel box and then you ask if he will buy it for the weight of the gold the proper price is fifteen pounds for each ounce of the weight but he will only give nine or ten pounds he paused it is very slow and difficult because it is not safe to go to more than two or three jewellers in each town there is a better way that i discovered very soon whats that carl he said this third way is very simple and very easy you must wait till a ship from india with an indian captain comes to melbourne and you wait until the captain comes on shore you go then to the captain in the hotel and you say can i sell you my gold in bombay he can get thirty pounds for each ounce but he must smuggle it out of australia and into india how much did he give you carl eighteen pounds an ounce and thats where the eleven hundred pounds came from he nodded i think that it was worth the risk he said because i wanted to come to england to see you jenny and to be a doctor again it was worth it carl she said softly wed better forget all about it now and never talk of it again we dont want anybody else to get to know about that gold they sat talking together in low tones till halfpast nine not paying the slightest attention to the picture then jennifer stirred and looked at the clock by the screen and she said lets go home carl that meeting must be over now and daddy will be waiting for us well go round by the station and pick up your bag is it heavy to carry he shook his head it is only for the night i have not many clothes in any case i must now buy some but they must be cheap they went out of the theatre in the vestibule they stopped to do up their coats she took his arm and they went out into the street in the darkness the freezing wind hit them with a blast she felt his sleeve and said is this the thickest coat youve got carl i must get a thicker one he said i had not thought that england would be cold like this it is as cold as germany they bent against the wind and walked quickly arm in arm to the london road station will you tell me one thing truthfully carl if i know the answer jenny he said did you really have to come to england carl to do your medical training couldnt you have done it in australia possibly he looked down at her smiling what questions you do ask you said youd tell me i could have done it in australia he said they grew so tired of seeing me in the office that at last they would have given me whatever i should want i came to england because i wanted to find you again they turned into the bleak shabby covered cabway of the railway station dimly lit for gas economy thats what i thought she said it was very sweet of you to do that carl to give up everything australia has to offer and come back to europe after getting away once she paused and looked around her at the stained and dirty brickwork at the antiquated building at the wet streets in the blustering windy night he laughed at her gently australia is cold and wet in the winter he said and there are dirty railway stations in australia too and dirty streets they walked to the cloakroom and he handed in the ticket they stood waiting while the porter went to fetch his bag carl she said your hut up in the howqua thatll be all right will it she looked up at him half fearful you dont think its like the other charlie zlinters hut with a door swinging open and a green loaf in the cupboard and a possum or a rat nesting in the bed he pressed her arm i also thought of that he said i left everything there very clean with no bedclothes or cloths at all and with insect powder sprinkled all over billy slim is to go there once each week and light a fire and open all the windows and he has money for repairs also it will be there clean and waiting for us when we can get back to it when we can get away from europe for a second time well get back to it all right she said some day somehow well get back there again
