chapter one the alley was dark and stank of piss and vomit it was home for quickfooted rats and the bony hungryeyed felines who hunted them red eyes glinted in the dark some of them human all of them feral eves heart tripped lightly as she slipped into the fetid dampedged shadows hed gone in she was sure of it it was her job to follow to find him to bring him in her weapon was in her hand and her hand was steady hey sweetcakes wanna do it with me wanna do it voices out of the dark harsh with chemicals or cheap brews moans of the damned giggles of the mad the rats and cats didnt live here alone the company of the human garbage that lined the sweating brick walls was no comfort she swung her weapon crouched as she sidestepped a battered recycling unit that from the smell of it hadnt worked in a decade the stench of food gone over smeared the humid air and turned it into a greasy stew someone whimpered she saw a boy about thirteen all but naked the sores on his face were festering his eyes were slits of fear and hopelessness as he scrabbled like a crab back against the filthy wall pity stirred in her heart she had been a child once hurt and terrified hiding in an alley i wont hurt you she kept her voice quiet barely a murmur kept her eyes on his maintaining contact as she lowered her weapon and thats when he struck he came from behind a roar of motion and sound primed to kill he swung the pipe the whistle of it stung her ears as she whirled dodged there was barely time to curse herself for losing her concentration forgetting her primary target as two hundred fifty pounds of muscle and mean sent her flying to the bricks her weapon flew out of her hand and clattered into the dark she saw his eyes the glint of mayhem heightened by the chemical zeus she watched the pipe raised high timed it and rolled seconds before it cracked against brick with a pump of her legs she dived headfirst into his belly he grunted staggered and as he reached for her throat she brought her fist up hard smashing it under his jaw the force of the blow radiated pain and power up her arm people were screaming scrambling for safety in a narrow world where nothing and no one was safe she spun used the impetus of the turn to deliver a roundhouse kick that shattered her adversarys nose blood fountained adding to the sick miasma of odors his eyes were wild but he barely jerked at the blow pain was no match for the god of chemicals grinning as blood poured down his face he smacked the thick pipe on his palm kill you kill you cop bitch he circled her swinging the pipe like a whistling whip grinning grinning as he bled break your head open and eat your brains knowing he meant it pumped her adrenaline to flash point live or die her breath came in pants the sweat pouring like oil down her skin she dodged the next blow went down on her knees slapping a hand on her boot she came up grinning eat this instead you son of a bitch her backup weapon was in her hand she didnt bother with stun the stun setting would do little more than tickle a two hundred fiftypound man flying on zeus it was set to terminate as he lunged toward her she hit him with full power his eyes died first shed seen it happen before eyes that turned to glass like a dolls even as he charged her she sidestepped prepared to fire again but the pipe slipped from his fingers his body began that jerky dance as his nervous system overloaded he fell at her feet a mass of ruined humanity who had played god you wont be sacrificing any more virgins asshole she muttered and as that wild energy drained she rubbed a hand over her face her weapon arm dropped the faint scrape of leather on concrete alerted her she started her spin weapon rising but arms clamped her lifted her to her toes always watch your back lieutenant the voice whispered just before teeth nipped lightly at her earlobe roarke goddamn it i nearly zapped you you didnt even come close with a laugh he turned her in his arms and his mouth was on hers hot hungry i love watching you work he murmured and his hand clever hand slid up her body to cup her breast its stimulating cut it out but her heart was thundering in reaction and the order was halfhearted this is no place for a seduction on the contrary a honeymoon is a traditional place for a seduction he drew her back kept his hands on her shoulders i wondered where youd gone off to i should have known he glanced down at the body at their feet what did he do he had a predilection for beating the brains out of young women then eating them oh roarke winced shook his head really eve couldnt you have come up with something a little less revolting there was a guy on the terra colony a couple of years back who fit the profile and i wondered she trailed off frowning they were standing in a stinking alley death at their feet and roarke gorgeous dark angel roarke was wearing a tuxedo and a diamond stud what are you all dressed up for we had plans he reminded her dinner i forgot she tucked her weapon away i didnt think this would take so long she blew out a breath i guess i should clean up i like you the way you are he moved into her again took possession forget dinner for now his smile was slow and irresistible but i do insist on slightly more aesthetic surroundings end program he ordered the alley the smells and the huddle of bodies winked away they stood in a huge empty room with equipment and blinking lights built into the walls both floor and ceiling were glassmirrored black to better project the holographic scenes available on the program it was one of roarkes newest most sophisticated toys begin tropical setting b maintain dual control status in response came the whoosh of waves the sprinkle of starlight on water beneath her feet was white sugar sand and palm trees waved like exotic dancers thats more like it roarke decided then began unbuttoning her shirt or it will be when i get you naked youve been getting me naked every time i blink for nearly three weeks he arched a brow husbands privilege complaints husband it was still a jolt this man with the warriors mane of black hair the poets face the wild irish blue eyes was her husband shed never get used to it no just an her breath hitched as one of his longfingered hands skimmed over her breasts an observation cops he smiled unfastened her jeans always observing youre off duty lieutenant dallas i was just keeping my reflexes sharp three weeks away from the job you get rusty he slid a hand between her naked thighs cupped her watched her head fall back on a moan your reflexes are just fine he murmured and pulled her down to the soft white sand his wife roarke liked to think about that as she rode him as she moved under him as she lay spent beside him this fascinating woman this dedicated cop this troubled soul belonged to him hed watched her work through the program the alley the chemicalmad killer and hed known she would face the reality of her work with the same tough terrifyingly courageous determination that shed possessed in the illusion he admired her for it however many bad moments it gave him in a few days they would go back to new york and he would have to share her with her duties for now he wanted to share her with nothing with no one he was no stranger to back alleys that reeked of garbage and hopeless humanity hed grown up in them escaped into them and eventually had escaped from them he had made his life into what it was and then she had come into it sharp and lethal as an arrow from a bow and had changed it again cops had once been the enemy then an amusement and now he was bound to one just over two weeks before he had watched her walk toward him in a flowing gown of rich bronze flowers in her hands the bruises on her face a killer had put there only hours before had been softened under cosmetics and in those eyes those big brandycolored eyes that showed so much hed seen nerves and amusement here we go roarke hed nearly heard her say it as she put her hand in his for better or worse ill take you on god help us now she wore his ring and he hers hed insisted on that though such traditions werent strictly fashionable in the middle of the twentyfirst century hed wanted the tangible reminder of what they were to each other the symbol of it now he picked up her hand kissed her finger above the ornately etched gold band hed had made for her her eyes stayed closed he studied the sharp angles of her face the overwide mouth the short cap of brown hair tousled into spikes i love you eve faint color bloomed on her cheeks she was so easily moved he thought he wondered if she had any idea how huge was her own heart i know she opened her eyes im ah starting to get used to it good listening to the song of water lapping on sand of balmy breezes whispering through feathery palms she lifted a hand brushed the hair back from his face a man like him she thought powerful wealthy impulsive could call up such scenes at the snap of a finger and hed done it for her you make me happy his grin flashed making her stomach muscles curl in delight i know with easy effortless strength he lifted her up and over until she straddled him he skimmed his hands idly up her long slim muscled body are you ready to admit youre glad i shanghaied you off planet for the last part of our honeymoon she grimaced remembering her panic her duginattheheels refusal to board the transport hed had waiting and how he had roared with laughter and had tossed her over his shoulder climbing on board with her cursing him i liked paris she said with a sniff and i loved the week we had on the island i didnt see any reason for us to come to some halffinished resort in space when we were going to spend most of our time in bed anyway you were scared it had delighted him that shed been unnerved by the prospect of her first off planet voyage and it had pleasured him to keep her occupied and distracted for the bulk of the trip i was not boneless she thought scared boneless i was justifiably annoyed that youd made the plans without discussing them with me i seem to recall someone being involved with a case and telling me to plan whatever suited me you were a beautiful bride it made her lips curve it was the dress no it was you he lifted a hand to her face eve dallas mine love swamped her it always seemed to come in huge unexpected waves that left her flailing helplessly i love you she lowered herself to him brought her mouth to his looks like youre mine o o it was midnight before they had dinner on the moonwashed terrace of the towering spear that was the nearly completed olympus grand hotel eve dug into stuffed lobster and contemplated the view the olympus resort would be with roarke pulling the strings completed and fully booked within a year for now they had it to themselves if she ignored the construction crews staff architects engineers pilots and other assorted inhabitants who shared the massive space station from the small glass table where they sat she could see out over the hub of the resort the lights brightly burned for the night crew the quiet hum of machinery spoke of roundtheclock labor the fountains the lances of simulated torchlight and rainbows of color running fluidly through the spewing waters were for her she knew hed wanted her to see what he was building and perhaps to begin to understand what she was a part of now as his wife wife she blew out a breath that fluttered her bangs and sipped the icy champagne hed poured it was going to take some time to understand just how shed gone from being eve dallas homicide lieutenant to become the wife of a man who some claimed had more money and power than god problem she flicked her eyes over his face smiled a little no with intense concentration she dipped a bit of lobster in melted butter real butter no simulation for roarkes table and sampled it how am i going to face the cardboard they pass off as food at the eatery once im back on the job you eat candy bars on the job in any case he topped off her wine lifted a brow when she narrowed her eyes you trying to get me drunk pal absolutely she laughed something he noted she did more easily and more often these days and with a shrug picked up her glass what the hell ill oblige you and when im drunk she gulped down the priceless wine like water ill give you a ride you wont soon forget lust hed thought sated for the moment crawled edgily into his belly well in that case he poured wine into his own glass teasing it to the rim lets both get drunk i like it here she announced pushing back from the table she carried her glass to the thick railing of carved stone it must have cost a fortune to have it quarried then shipped but he was roarke after all leaning over she watched the light and water show scanned the buildings all domes and spears all glossy and elegant to house the sumptuous people and the sumptuous games they would come to play the casino was completed and glowed like a golden ball in the dark one of the dozen pools was lighted for the night and the water glimmered cobalt blue skywalks zigzagged between buildings and resembled silver threads they were empty now but she imagined what they would be like in six months a year crammed with people who shimmered in silks glowed with jewels they would come to be pampered within the marble walls of the spa with its mud baths and body enhancement facilities its softspoken consultants and solicitous droids theyd come to lose fortunes in the casino to drink exclusive liquor in the clubs to make love to the hard and soft bodies of licensed companions roarke would offer them a world and they could come but it wouldnt be her world when they filled it she was more comfortable with the streets the noisy half world of law and crime roarke understood that she thought as hed come from the same place as she so he had offered her this when it was only theirs youre going to make something here she said and turned to lean back against the rail thats the plan no she shook her head pleased that it was already starting to swim from the wine youll make something that people will talk about for centuries that theyll dream of youve come a long way from the young thief who ran the back alleys of dublin roarke his smile was slow and just a little sly not so very far lieutenant im still picking pockets i just do it as legally as i can being married to a cop limits certain activities she frowned at him now i dont want to hear about them darling eve he rose brought the bottle with him so bythebook still so unsettled that shes fallen madly in love with a shady character he filled her glass again then set the bottle aside one that only months ago was on her short list of murder suspects you enjoy that being suspicious i do he skimmed a thumb over a cheekbone where a bruise had faded away except in his mind and i worry about you a little a lot he admitted to himself im a good cop i know the only one ive ever completely admired what an odd twist of fate that i would have fallen for a woman so devoted to justice it seems odder to me that ive linked up with someone who can buy and sell planets at a whim married he laughed turning her around he nuzzled the back of her neck go on say it were married the word wont choke you i know what we are ordering herself to relax she leaned back against him let me live with it for a while i like being here away with you then i take it youre glad you let me pressure you into the three weeks you didnt pressure me i had to nag he nipped her ear browbeat his hands slid up to her breasts beg she snorted youve never begged for anything but maybe you did nag i havent had three weeks off the job in never he decided against reminding her she hadnt had it now precisely she rarely went through a twentyfourhour period without running some program that put her up against a crime why dont we make it four roarke he chuckled just testing drink your champagne youre not nearly drunk enough for what i have in mind oh her pulse leaped making her feel foolish and whats that itll lose in the telling he decided lets just say i intend to keep you occupied for the last fortyeight hours we have here fortyeight hours with a laugh she drained her glass when do we get started theres no time like he broke off scowling when the doorbell sounded i told the staff to leave the clearing up stay here he snugged together her robe which hed just untied ill send them away far away get another bottle while youre at it she told him grinning as she shook the last drops into her glass someone drank all of this one amused he slipped back inside crossed the wide living space with its clear glass ceiling and feathersoft carpets he wanted her there to start he decided on that yielding floor with the iceedged stars wheeling overhead he plucked a long white lily out of a porcelain dish imagining how he would show her just what a clever man could do to a woman with the petals of a flower he was smiling as he turned into the foyer with its gilded walls and sweeping marble staircase flipping on the view screen he prepared to send the room service waiter to perdition for the interruption with some surprise he saw the face of one of his assistant engineers carter trouble carter rubbed a hand over a face that was dead pale and damp with sweat sir im afraid there is i need to speak with you please all right just a moment roarke let out a sigh as he flicked off the screen disengaged the locks carter was young for his position in his middle twenties but he was a genius at design and execution if there was a problem with the construction it was best to deal with it now is it the sky glide at the salon roarke asked as he opened the door i thought youd worked out the kinks there no i mean yes sir i have its working perfectly now the man was trembling roarke realized and forgot his annoyance has there been an accident he took carters arm steered him into the living area nudged him into a chair has someone been hurt i dont know i mean an accident carter blinked stared glassily miss maam lieutenant he said as eve came in he started to rise then fell weakly down again when she gave him a quick push hes in shock she said to roarke her voice brisk try some of that fancy brandy youve got around here she crouched down kept her face level with his his pupils were pinpricks carter isnt it take it slow i his face went waxy now i think im going to be before he could finish eve whipped his head down between his knees breathe just breathe lets have that brandy roarke she held out a hand and he was there with a snifter pull it together carter roarke eased him back onto the cushions take a swallow of this yes sir for christs sake stop sirring me to death color came back into carters cheeks either from the brandy or from embarrassment he nodded swallowed let out a breath im sorry i thought i was okay i came right up i didnt know if i should i didnt know what else to do he spread a hand over his face like a kid at a horror video he hitched in a breath and said it quickly its drew drew mathias my roomie hes dead air exploded out of his lungs then shuddered back in he took another deep gulp of brandy and choked on it roarkes eyes went flat he pulled together a picture of mathias young eager red hair and freckles an electronics expert with a specialty in autotronics where carter how did it happen i thought i should tell you right away now there were two high bruising red flags riding on carters pasty cheeks i came right up to tell you and your wife i thought since shes shes the police she could do something you need a cop carter eve took the snifter out of his unsteady hand why do you need a cop i think he must have he killed himself lieutenant he was hanging there just hanging there from the ceiling light in the living room and his face oh god oh jesus eve left carter to bury his own face in his hands and turned to roarke whos got authority on site for something like this weve got standard security most of it automated accepting he inclined his head id say its you lieutenant okay see if you can put together a field kit for me i need a recorder audio and video some seal it evidence bags tweezers a couple of small brushes she hissed out a breath as she dragged a hand through her hair he wasnt going to have the equipment lying around that would pinpoint body temperature and time of death there would be no scanner no sweepers none of the standard chemicals for forensics she carried habitually to crime scenes theyd have to wing it theres a doctor right call him hell have to stand in as the me ill get dressed o o most of the techs made use of the completed wings of the hotel for living quarters carter and mathias had apparently hit it off well enough to share a spacious twobedroom suite during their shift on the station as they rode down to the tenth floor eve handed roarke the palm recorder you can run this right he lifted a brow one of his companies had manufactured it i think i can manage fine she offered a weak smile youre deputized you hanging in carter yeah but he walked out of the elevator into the hallway on ten like a drunk trying to pass a competency test he had to wipe his sweaty hand twice on his slacks to get a clear reading on the palm screen when the door slid open he stepped back id just as soon not go in again stay here she told him i may need you she stepped inside the lights were blinding bright up to full power music blared out of the wall unit hard clashing rock with a screeching vocalist that reminded eve of her friend mavis the floor was tiled in a caribbean blue and offered the illusion of walking on water along the north and south walls banks of computers were set up workstations she assumed cluttered with all manner of electronic boards microchips and tools she saw clothes heaped on the sofa vr goggles lying on the coffee table with three tubes of asian beer two of them flattened and already rolled for the recycler and a bowl of spiced pretzels and she saw drew mathiass naked body swaying gently from a makeshift noose of sheets hitched to the glittering tier of a blue glass chandelier ah hell she sighed it out what is he roarke twenty not much more than roarkes mouth thinned as he studied mathiass boyish face it was purple now the eyes bulging the mouth frozen into a hideous gaping grin some vicious whim of death had left him smiling all right lets do what we can dallas lieutenant eve nypsd standing in until proper interspace authorities can be contacted and transported suspicious unattended death mathias drew olympus grand hotel room ten thirtysix august one hundred hours i want to take him down roarke said it shouldnt have surprised him how quickly how seamlessly shed shifted from woman to cop not yet it doesnt make any difference to him now and i need the scene recorded before anythings moved she turned in the doorway did you touch anything carter no he scrubbed the back of his hand over his mouth i opened the door just like now and walked in i saw him right away you you see him right away i guess i stood there a minute just stood there i knew he was dead i saw his face why dont you go through the other door into the bedroom she gestured to the left you can lie down for a while ill need to talk to you okay dont call anyone she ordered no no i wont call anyone she turned away again secured the door her gaze shifted to roarkes and their eyes held she knew he was thinking as she was that there were some like her who had no escape from death lets get started she told him chapter two the doctors name was wang and he was old as most medicals were on off planet projects he could have retired at ninety but like others of his ilk he had chosen to bump from site to site tending the scrapes and bruises passing out drugs for space sickness and gravity balance delivering the occasional baby running required diagnostics but he knew a dead body when he saw one dead his voice was clipped faintly exotic his skin was parchment yellow and as wrinkled as an old map his eyes were black almond shaped his head was glossy and slick lending him the appearance of an ancient somewhat battered billiard ball yeah i got that much eve rubbed her eyes shed never had to deal with a space med but shed heard about them they didnt care to have their cushy routine interrupted give me the cause and the time strangulation wang tapped one long finger against the vicious marks on mathiass neck selfinduced time of death i would say between ten and eleven pm on this day in this month in this year she offered a thin smile thank you doctor there arent any other signs of violence on the body so i lean toward your diagnosis of selftermination but i want the results of the drug run lets see if it was chemically induced did you treat the deceased for anything i cannot say but he looks unfamiliar i would have his records of course he would have come to me for the standard diagnostic upon arrival ill want those as well i will do my best to accommodate you mrs roarke her eyes narrowed dallas lieutenant dallas put a rush on it wang she looked down at the body again small man she thought thin pale dead pursing her lips she studied the face shed seen what odd tricks death particularly violent death could play with expressions but shed never seen anything like that wide goggleeyed grin it made her shudder the waste the pathetic waste of such a young life made her unbearably sad take him with you wang get me the reports you can shoot his basic paperwork to the telelink in my suite i need the next of kin assuredly he smiled at her lieutenant roarke she smiled back showed her teeth and decided she didnt want to play the name game standing she put her hands on her hips as wang directed his two assistants to transport the body you find that amusing she muttered to roarke he blinked all innocence what lieutenant roarke roarke touched her face because he needed to why not both of us could use some comic relief yeah your dr wangs a chuckle a minute she watched the doctor sail out in front of the dead boy on a gurney it pisses me off it fucking pisses me off its not such a bad name no she nearly did laugh as she rubbed her hands over her face not that the boy a kid like that tossing out his next hundred years of life that pisses me off i know he reached out to rub her shoulders youre sure it was suicide no sign of struggle no additional insults to the body she shrugged under his hands ill interview carter and talk to some others but the way i see it drew mathias came home turned on the lights the music he drank himself a couple beers maybe took a vr trip ate a few pretzels then he went in stripped the sheets off his bed made himself a rope fashioned a very precise professional noose she turned away scanning the room letting the scene into her head he took off his clothes tossed them aside he climbed up on the table you can see the smears from his feet he tied the rope to the light probably gave it a good tug or two to make sure it was secure then he slipped his head into the noose used the remote to raise the light and choked himself to death she picked up the remote shed already bagged for evidence it wouldnt have been quick its a slow ascent not enough to give him a nice clean broken neck but he didnt struggle didnt change his mind if he had youd see scrapes from his nails on his neck and throat from where hed tried to claw free roarkes brow knit but wouldnt it be instinctive involuntary to do just that i dont know id say it depended on how strong a will he had how much he wanted to die and why could have been cruising on drugs well know that soon enough the right mix of chemicals the mind doesnt register pain he might even have enjoyed it i wont deny theres some illegals floating around here its impossible to regulate and supervise every staff members habits and personal choices roarke shrugged frowned up at the gorgeous blue chandelier mathias doesnt strike me as the type for a habitual even an occasional user people are a constant surprise and its an unending wonder what theyll pump into their bloodstreams eve jerked her own shoulders in turn ill give the place the standard toss for illegals and ill see what i can find out from carter she dragged her hair back with a hand why dont you go back up get some sleep no ill stay eve he said before she could argue you deputized me it made her smile a little any decent adjutant would know i need coffee to get through this then ill see that you get some he framed her face in his hands i wanted you away from this for a while he let her go and walked into the adjoining kitchen to see about her coffee eve stepped into the bedroom the lights were low and carter was sitting on the side of the bed his head in his hands he jerked straight when he heard her come in take it easy carter youre not under arrest yet when his cheeks paled she sat beside him sorry bad cop humor im recording this okay yeah he swallowed hard okay dallas lieutenant eve interview with carter whats your full name carter ah jack jack carter carter jack regarding the unattended death of mathias drew carter you shared suite ten thirtysix with the deceased yeah for the past five months we were friends tell me about tonight what time did you get home i dont know about twelve thirty i guess i had a date ive been seeing someone lisa cardeaux shes one of the landscape designers we wanted to check out the entertainment complex they were showing a new video after that we went to the athena club its open to the complex employees we had a couple of drinks listened to some music shes got an early day tomorrow so we didnt stay late i took her home he smiled weakly tried to talk her into letting me come up but she wasnt having any okay so you struck out with lisa did you come straight home yeah shes just over at the staff bungalow she likes it there doesnt want to close herself up in a hotel room thats what she says it only takes a couple minutes on the glide to get back here i came up he drew a breath rubbed a hand over his heart as if to calm it drew had the door secured he had a thing about that some of the crew leave the locks off but drew had all that equipment and he was paranoid about anybody messing with it is the palm plate coded for anyone but the two of you no okay then what i saw him right away thats when i went up to you ah right whens the last time you saw him alive this morning carter rubbed his eyes trying to visualize the normality of it light food mumbling conversation we had some breakfast how was he upset depressed no carters eyes focused then and were for the first time animated thats what i cant get through my head he was fine he was joking around yanking my chain about lisa because i havent you know scored we were needling each other just friendly shit i said he hadnt scored in so long he wouldnt know it if he did and why didnt he get himself a woman and come along with us tonight to see how it was done was he seeing anyone no he always talked about this babe he was hung up on she wasnt on the station the babe thats what he called her he was going to use his next free cycle to pay her a visit he said she had it all brains beauty body and a sex drive that wouldnt quit why should he play with lesser models when he had state of the art you dont know her name no she was just the babe to be honest i figure he made her up drew wasnt what youd call babe material you know and he was shy around women and really into fantasy games and his autotronics he was always working on something what about other friends he didnt have many he was quiet around a lot of people internal you know he use chemicals carter sure your basic stimulant if he was pulling an allnighter illegals carter did he use drew his tired eyes popped wide no way absolutely no way he was a total arrow straight as they come he wouldnt mess with illegals lieutenant he had a good mind and he wanted to keep it that way and he wanted to keep his job move up you get tossed for that kind of shit only takes one time on a spot check are you sure youd have known if he decided to experiment you know someone you hang with for five months carters eyes went sad again you get used to them habits and everything like i said he didnt hang with other people much he was happier alone fiddling with his equipment diving into his roleplaying programs a loner then internal yeah that was his way but he wasnt upset he wasnt depressed he kept saying that he was onto something big some new toy he was always onto a new toy carter murmured he said just last week that he was going to make a fortune this time and give roarke a run for his money roarke he didnt mean anything by it carter said quickly defending the dead youve got to understand roarke to a lot of us well hes ice you know solid ice rolling in credits mag clothes outstanding digs power plus sexy new wife he broke off flushing excuse me no problem shed decide later if she was amused or flabbergasted that a boy barely twenty considered her sexy its just that a lot of us techs well a lot of people altogether sort of aspire roarkes like the epitome drew totally admired him he had ambitions mrs lieutenant he had goals and plans why would he do this suddenly his eyes swam why would he do this i dont know carter sometimes you never know why she led him back guided him through until she had a picture of drew mathias that gelled an hour later there was nothing left for her to do but put together a report for whoever would be transported in to close the case she leaned against the mirrored wall of the elevator as she and roarke rode back to the penthouse it was good thinking to put him in another room on another floor he may sleep better tonight hell sleep better if he takes the tranqs how about you will you sleep yeah id turn it over easier if i had a glimmer of what was troubling him what pushed him to it she stepped out into the corridor waited while roarke disengaged security to their suite the picture ive got is of your average tech nerd with grand aspirations shy of women into fantasy happy in his work she lifted her shoulders there werent any incoming or outgoing calls on his link no email sent or received no messages recorded and the security on the door was engaged at sixteen hundred hours by mathias disengaged at oh thirtythree by carter he didnt have any visitors didnt go out he just settled in for the evening then hanged himself its not a homicide no its not a homicide did that make it better she wondered or worse nobody to blame nobody to punish just a dead kid a life wasted she turned to him suddenly wrapped her arms tightly around him roarke you changed my life surprised he tipped up her face her eyes werent wet but dry and fierce and angry whats this you changed my life she said again at least part of it im beginning to see its the best part of it i want you to know that i want you to remember that when we get back and things settle into routine if i forget to let you know what i feel or what i think or how much you mean to me touched he pressed his curved lips to her brow i wont let you forget come to bed youre tired yeah i am she skimmed her hair back from her face as they started toward the bedroom less than fortyeight hours left she remembered she wouldnt let useless death mar the last hours of their honeymoon she angled her head fluttered her lashes you know carter thinks im sexy roarke stopped he narrowed his eyes i beg your pardon oh she loved it when that lilting irish voice turned arrogant youre ice she continued circling her head on her tensed shoulders as she unbuttoned her shirt am i am i really solid ice which is as mavis would say mag and part of the reason youre ice in case youre wondering is because you have a sexy new wife naked to the waist she sat on the bed and tugged off her shoes she flicked a glance over at him and saw that hed tucked his hands in his pockets and was grinning her lips curved as well it felt very good to smile so ice man she cocked her head lifted a brow what are you going to do about your sexy new wife roarke ran his tongue over his teeth then stepped forward why dont i demonstrate o o she thought it would be better facing the trip back being flung through space like a kids ray ball she was wrong eve argued using what she considered very logical reasons why she shouldnt get into roarkes private transport i dont want to die he laughed at her which had her eyes kindling then he simply scooped her up and carried her on board im not staying her heart jittered into her chest as he stepped into the plush cabin i mean it youll have to knock me out to get me to stay on this flying death trap mmmhmm he chose a wide scoopshaped chair in buttery black leather kept her in his lap and moving quickly strapped her in trapping her arms to limit any possible reprisals hey stop it panicked she struggled wiggled swore let me out let me off her snug butt jiggling on his lap gave him a solid clue as to how he intended to spend the initial hours of the trip take off as soon as you have clearance roarke ordered the pilot then smiled at the flight attendant we wont need you for a while he told her and engaged the locks on the cabin doors the moment she made a discreet exit im going to hurt you eve promised when she heard the hum of engines gearing up felt the faint vibration under her feet that signaled imminent takeoff she seriously considered gnawing at the safety harness with her teeth im not doing this she said definitely i am not doing this tell him to abort too late he wrapped his arms around her nuzzled her neck relax eve trust me youre safer here than you are driving through midtown bullshit oh christ she squeezed her eyes tight as the engine let out a powerful roar the shuttle seemed to shoot straight up leaving her stomach flopping on the ground below the gs slapped her back plastering her against roarke she was barely breathing by the time the ride smoothed out and she discovered that the pressure in her chest was caused by the fact that she was holding her breath she let it out in a whoosh then sucked in air like a diver surfacing from a great depth she was still alive she told herself and that was something now she would have to kill him it was then she realized that not only was she unstrapped but her shirt was unbuttoned and his hands were on her breasts if you think were going to have sex after you he merely swiveled her to face him she caught the glint of humor and lust in his eyes just before his mouth closed cagily over her breast you bastard but she laughed as pleasure speared into her and she cupped her hands behind his head to urge him on shed never take for granted what he could do to her do for her those wild floods of pleasure the slow thrilling glide of it she rocked against him let herself forget everything but the way his teeth nipped his tongue licked so it was she who pulled him onto the thick soft carpet she who dragged his mouth to hers inside me she tugged at his shirt wanting that hard muscled flesh under her hands i want you inside me we have hours yet he dipped to her breasts again so small so firm already warm from his hands i need to taste you he did lavishly the subtle variety of flavors from mouth to throat from throat to shoulder shoulder to breast he sampled with tenderness with finesse with a quiet concentration focused on mutual pleasure he felt her begin to tremble under his hands and mouth her skin grew damp as he roamed to her belly easing her slacks down nibbling his way between her thighs his tongue flicked there making her moan her hips arched for him even as he cupped them lifted them opened her when his tongue slid lazily into the heat he felt the first orgasm rip through her more greedy now he devoured she would let go for him as she had for no one else he knew she would lose herself in what they made together when she was shuddering when her hands lay limp on the carpet he slid up her body slipped into her mated her eyes fluttered open met his concentration was what she saw there absolute control she wanted needed to destroy it to know she could as he could destroy her more she insisted hooking her legs around his waist to take him deeper she saw the flicker in his eyes the deep dark need that lived inside him and pulling his mouth to hers scraping her teeth over those beautifully formed lips she moved under him he fisted his hands in her hair his breath quickening as he rammed himself into her harder faster until he thought his heart would burst from the ferocity of it she matched him beat for beat thrust for thrust those short unpainted nails digging into his back his shoulders his hips delicious little bites of pain he felt her come again the violent contraction of her muscles fisting over him like glory again was all he could think again and again and again as he hammered into her swallowing her gasps and moans shuddering from the thrilling sound of flesh slapping wetly against flesh he felt her body tense again revving toward peak as that long low throaty moan slipped through her lips he pressed his face into her hair and with one final thrust he emptied himself he collapsed onto her his mind fuzzed his heart thundering she was limp as water beneath him but for the rage of her heart against his we cant keep this up she managed after a moment well kill each other he managed a wheezing laugh well die well in any case i had intended a bit more romance some wine and music to cap off the honeymoon he lifted his head smiled down at her but this worked too it doesnt mean im not still pissed off at you naturally weve had some of our best sex when youre pissed off at me he caught her chin between his teeth flicked his tongue along the slight dent in the center i adore you eve while she was adjusting to that as she always did he rolled off got lightly to his feet and walked naked to a mirrored console between two chairs he laid his palm on it and a door slid open i have something for you she eyed the velvet box with suspicion you dont have to get me presents you know i dont want you to yes it makes you uncomfortable and uneasy he grinned perhaps thats why i do it he sat beside her on the floor handed her the box open it she imagined it would be jewelry he seemed to thrive on giving her body decorations diamonds emeralds ropes of gold that left her stunned and feeling awkward but when she opened it she saw only a simple white blossom its a flower from your wedding bouquet i had it treated a petunia she found herself sentimentally tearyeyed as she picked it out of the box simple basic ordinary one that might grow in any garden the petals felt soft dewy and fresh its a new process one of my companies has been working on it preserves without changing the basic texture i wanted you to have it he closed a hand over hers i wanted both of us to have it so we could be reminded that some things last she raised her eyes to his they had both come from misery she thought and survived it they had been drawn together through violence and tragedy and had overcome it they walked different paths and had found a mutual route some things last she thought some ordinary things like love chapter three three weeks hadnt changed cop central the coffee was still poisonous the noise abominable and the view out of her stingy window was still miserable she was thrilled to be back the cops in her unit had arranged for a message to await her since it was blinking slyly on her monitor when she walked in she figured she had her old pal feeney the electronics whiz to thank for bypassing her code welcome back lieutenant lovejoy hubbahubba hubbahubba she snorted out a laugh sophomoric humor maybe but it made her feel at home she glanced over the mess on her desk she hadnt had time to clear anything up between the unexpected closing of a case during her bachelor party and her wedding day but she noted the neatly sealed disc competently labeled sitting atop her stack of old work that would be peabodys doing eve concluded sliding the disc into her desk unit she cursed once and slapped the drive to cure the razzing hiccups it emitted and saw that the everreliable peabody had indeed written the arrest report filed it and logged it it couldnt eve mused have been easy on her not when shed been sharing a bed with the accused eve glanced at the old work again grimaced she could see she had court dates stuffed and layered together over the next few days the schedule juggling shed had to do to accommodate roarkes demand for three weeks away had had a price it was time to pay up well hed done plenty of juggling as well she reminded herself and now it was back to work and reality rather than review the cases she would soon give testimony for she bumped up her link and put out a search for officer peabody the familiar serious face with its dark helmet of hair fizzed onto her monitor sir welcome back thank you peabody my office please asap without waiting for a reply eve switched off the unit and smiled to herself shed seen to it that peabody had been transferred to the homicide division now she intended to take it a bit further she engaged the link again lieutenant dallas is the commander free lieutenant the commanders secretary beamed at her how was your honeymoon it was very nice she felt a quick flush of heat at the gleam in the womans eye hubbahubba had amused her this dreamy look made her want to squirm thank you you were a lovely bride lieutenant i saw the pictures and there were several news runs on the event and the gossip channels were full of it we saw clips of you in paris too it looked so romantic yeah the price of fame eve thought and roarke it was nice ah the commander oh of course one moment please as the unit buzzed eve rolled her eyes she could accept being in the spotlight but she was never going to enjoy it dallas commander whitneys grin was an acre wide and he had an odd look on his hard dark face you look well thank you sir you enjoyed your honeymoon christ she thought when was someone going to ask if shed enjoyed being fucked around the world and into outer space yes sir thank you i assume youve already read officer peabodys report on the closing of the pandora case yes very complete the pa is going for the maximum on casto you ran a close one there lieutenant she was very well aware how close shed come to not only missing her wedding day but the rest of her life it stings when its another cop she said i was rushed sir and only had time to give you my recommendation for peabodys transferral permanently to my unit her assistance in this matter and others has been invaluable shes a good cop whitney agreed i agree i have a request commander five minutes later when peabody stepped into her crammed office eve was tipped back in her chair scanning the data on her monitor ive got court in an hour eve said without preliminary on the salvatori case what do you know about that peabody vito salvatori is being tried for multiple murder with the added circumstance of torture he is an alleged distributor of illegal substances and stands accused of the murder of three other known dealers of zeus and trl the victims were burned alive in a small rooming house on the lower east side last winter after their eyes and tongues were cut out you were primary peabody recited the data matteroffactly while she stood at attention in her shipshape uniform very good officer did you read my arrest report on the case yes lieutenant i did eve nodded an airbus boomed by the window spewing noise and displacing air then you know that before i restrained salvatori i broke his left arm at the elbow his jaw and relieved him of several teeth his lawyers are going to try to fry me for excessive force theyll have a rough time of that sir as he was trying to burn down the building around you when you cornered him if you hadnt restrained him in whatever manner was possible hed have been fried so to speak okay peabody ive got this and several others to go over before the weeks up i need all the cases on my court schedule downloaded and condensed you can meet me with the requested data in thirty minutes east exit sir im on assignment detective crouch has me chasing down vehicle registrations only the faintest sneer in her voice indicated peabodys feeling about crouch and the garbage assignment ill handle crouch the commanders cleared my request youre assigned to me so pass off whatever grunt work thats been dumped on you and get your ass in gear peabody blinked assigned to you sir your hearing go bad while i was away no sir but have you got a thing for crouch it delighted eve to see peabodys serious mouth drop open are you kidding hes she caught herself stiffened up hes hardly my type lieutenant i believe ive learned my lesson about romantic attachments on the job dont beat yourself up over that one peabody i liked casto too you did a hell of a job on that one it helped to hear it but the wound was still raw thank you lieutenant which is why you are now assigned to me as my permanent aide you want a detective shield officer peabody knew what she was being given the opportunity the gift out of nowhere she closed her eyes a moment until she had her voice under control yes sir i do good youll work your ass off for it get the data i requested and lets move right away at the door peabody paused turned back im very grateful for the chance youre giving me dont be you earned it and if you screw up ill bust you down to traffic eve smiled thinly air traffic o o court testimony was part of the job and so eve reminded herself were highclass weasels like s t fitzhugh attorney for the defense he was slick and he was savvy a man who defended the lowest of lowlifes as long as their credits held out his success in assisting drug lords murderers and molesters into slithering out of the grip of the law was such that he could easily afford the creamcolored suits and handtooled shoes he affected he made a dashing figure in the courtroom his meltedchocolate skin a fine contrast to the soft colors and fabrics he habitually wore his long aesthetic face was smooth as the silk of his jacket thanks to the threetimesweekly treatments at adonis the citys top enhancement salon for men his figure was trim narrow at the hips broad at the shoulders and his voice was the deep rich baritone of an opera singer he courted the press socialized with the criminal elite owned his own jet star it was one of eves small pleasures to despise him let me try to get a clear picture lieutenant fitzhugh lifted his hands bringing his thumbs together to form a bracket a clear picture of the circumstances that led to you attacking my client in his place of business the prosecuting attorney objected fitzhugh graciously rephrased you did lieutenant dallas cause my client great bodily harm on the night in question he glanced back at salvatori who had costumed himself for the occasion in a simple black suit following his attorneys advice he had skipped his last three months of cosmetic and youth restoration treatments there was gray in his hair a sag to his face and body he looked old defenseless the jury would make the comparison eve imagined between the young fit cop and the delicate old man mr salvatori resisted arrest and attempted to ignite an accelerant it was necessary to restrain him to restrain him slowly fitzhugh walked back passing the recorder droid moving down the jury box drawing one of the six automated cameras with him as he laid a supporting hand on salvatoris thin shoulder you had to restrain him and that restraint resulted in a fractured jaw and a shattered arm eve flicked a glance toward the jury several members of the panel were looking entirely too sympathetic thats correct mr salvatori refused my request to exit the building and to put down the cleaver and acetylene torch in his possession you were armed lieutenant i was and you carry the standard weapon issued to members of the nypsd i do if as you claim mr salvatori was armed and resisting why did you fail to administer the accepted stun i missed mr salvatori was feeling pretty spry that night i see in your ten years on the police force lieutenant how many times have you found it necessary to employ maximum force to terminate eve ignored the jitter in her stomach three times three fitzhugh let the word hang let the jury study the woman in the witness chair a woman who had killed isnt that a rather high ratio wouldnt you say that percentage indicates a predilection for violence the pa surged to his feet objecting bitterly going into the standard line that the witness was not on trial but of course she was eve thought cops were always on trial mr salvatori was armed eve began coolly i had a warrant for his arrest in the torture murders of three people the three people whose eyes and tongues were cut out before they were set on fire and for which crime mr salvatori now stands accused in this courtroom he refused to cooperate by flinging a cleaver at my head which threw my aim off he then charged knocking me to the ground i believe his words were im going to cut out your copbitch heart at which time we engaged in hand to hand at that time i broke his jaw knocked out several of his teeth and when he swung the torch in my direction i broke his goddamn arm and you enjoyed that lieutenant she met fitzhughs eyes straight on no sir i didnt but i enjoyed staying alive o o slime eve muttered as she climbed into her vehicle he wont get salvatori off peabody settled in and to take the edge off the furnace heat trapped inside fiddled with the temperature control unit the evidence is too clear cut and you didnt let him shake you yes i did eve scooped a hand through her hair then headed into lateafternoon midtown traffic the streets were choked enough to make her grit her teeth but overhead the sky was crisscrossed with airbuses tourist vans and midday commuters we limp along getting pricks like salvatori off the street and men like fitzhugh make fortunes slipping them back out she jerked a shoulder sometimes it pisses me off whoever slips them back out we still limp along and slap them back in again with a half laugh eve glanced at her companion youre an optimist peabody i wonder how long thatll last im going to make a detour before we log back on she said changing direction on impulse i want to get the air of that courtroom out of my lungs lieutenant you didnt need me in court today why was i there if youre going after that detective shield peabody you need to see what youre up against its not just killers and thieves and chemiheads its the lawyers it didnt surprise her to find the streets clogged and parking nonexistent philosophically eve nosed into an illegal zone flipped the onduty light on as she stepped out of the car she gave a hustler on a glideboard a mild stare he grinned winked cheekily then zoomed away toward more conducive surroundings this areas loaded with hustlers and dealers and offlicense hookers eve said conversationally thats why i love it she opened the door to the down and dirty club stepped inside to air thick with the sour smells of cheap liquor and bad food privacy rooms lining one wall were open airing out the musky stink of stale sex it was a joint one that enjoyed being seamy and just skirted the edge of health and decency laws a holographic band had the stage and was playing listlessly for the smattering of disinterested customers mavis freestone was in an isolation booth in the back her hair a purple fountain two scraps of glowing silver cloth strategically draped over her small sassy body the way her mouth was moving her hips swiveling eve was certain she was rehearsing one of her more interesting vocals eve stepped up to the glass waiting until maviss rolling eyes circled around and landed on her maviss mouth the same searing purple as her hair rounded into a huge circle of delight she did a fast boogie then shoved the door open an earshattering blast of screaming guitars burst out of the booth with her mavis launched herself into eves arms and though she was shouting eve caught only every other word over the thundering music what laughing eve slammed the door shut shook the echo out of her head christ mavis what was that my new number its going to knock them unconscious i believe it youre back mavis gave eve two smacking and unavoidable kisses lets sit down lets have a drink tell me every detail leave nothing out hey peabody man arent you steaming in that uniform she dragged eve to a sticky table punched up the menu what do you want its on me crack pays me pretty solid for the couple gigs a week i do here hes going to be dredged that he missed you oh im so glad to see you you look terrific you look happy doesnt she look terrific peabody sex is so like therapeutic right eve laughed again knowing shed come just for this mindless entertainment just a couple of fizz waters mavis were on duty oh like somebody in heres going to report you unbutton that uniform some peabody im getting hot just looking at you how was paris how was the island how was the resort did he fuck your brains out everywhere beautiful wonderful interesting and yeah he did hows leonardo maviss eyes went dreamy she smiled and poked a silvertipped nail onto the menu board hes terrific cohabitatings better than i thought it would be he designed this costume for me eve studied the thin silver straps that almost covered maviss tidy apple breasts is that what you call it ive got this new number see oh ive got so much to tell you she snagged the fizz water when it plopped through the slot i dont know where to start theres this guy this music engineer im working with him were doing a disc eve full treatment hes sure he can peddle it hes great jess barrow he was blazing a couple years back with his own stuff maybe you heard of him no eve knew that for a woman whod lived on the streets a large portion of her life mavis remained stunningly naive about certain matters how much are you paying him its not like that maviss lips moved into a pout ive got to dish up the recording fee sure thats the way it works and if we hit he takes sixty percent for the first three years after that we renegotiate ive heard of him peabody commented shed unfastened her collar button a tribute to her fondness for mavis he had a couple of major hits a couple years ago and he was hooked up with cassandra at eves arched brow she shrugged the singer you know you a music lover peabody you never fail to amaze me i like to listen to tunes peabody muttered into her bubbly water like anyone well the cassandra connections dumped mavis said cheerfully hes been looking for a new vocalist and thats me eve wondered what else he might be looking for what does leonardo think he thinks its mag youve got to come to the studio eve catch us in action jess is a certified genius she intended to catch them in action the list of people eve loved was very short and mavis was on it she waited until she was back in the car with peabody heading to cop central run a make on jess barrow peabody without surprise peabody took out her diary plugged in the order mavis isnt going to like that she doesnt have to know does she eve veered around a glidecart offering frozen fruit on a stick then swung onto tenth where automated jackhammers were tearing up the street again overhead an ad blimp hawked a shoppers special at bloomingdales preseason sale on winter coats in the mens womens and unisex department twenty percent off such a deal she spotted the man in the trench coat shambling toward a trio of girls and sighed shit theres clevis clevis this is his turf eve said simply as she pulled into a loading zone i used to do this drag when i was in uniform hes been around for years come on peabody lets spare the little children she stepped onto the sidewalk skirting a pair of men arguing over baseball from the smell of them she judged theyd been standing in the heat arguing for much too long she shouted once but the jackhammers swallowed her voice resigned she picked up her pace and intercepted clevis before he reached the unsuspecting pinkcheeked girls hey clevis he blinked at her through the pale lenses of sunscreens his hair was sandy blond and curly around a face as innocent as a cherubs he was eighty if he was a day dallas hey dallas i havent seen you in a big blue moon he flashed big white teeth as he sized up peabody whos this peabody this is clevis clevis you arent going to bother those little girls are you no shit uhuh i wasnt going to bother them he wiggled his brows i was just going to show em is all you dont want to do that clevis you ought to get inside out of this heat i like it hot he wheezed out a chuckle there they go he said with a sigh as the trio of girls ran laughing across the street guess i wont be able to show em today ill show you clevis dont then eve huffed out a breath hed already pulled his trench coat apart under it he was naked but for a bright blue bow tied celebrationally around his withered cock very nice clevis thats a good color for you matches your eyes she put a companionable hand on his shoulder lets take a ride okay okeedokee do you like blue peabody peabody nodded solemnly as she opened the back door of the unit helped him inside blues my favorite color she shut the door of the vehicle met eves laughing eyes welcome back lieutenant its good to be back peabody all in all its good to be back o o it was also good to be home eve drove through the high iron gates that guarded the towering fortress it was less of a shock now to glide along the curving drive through those welltended lawns and flowering trees toward the elegant stone and glass house where she now lived the contrast of where she worked and where she lived no longer seemed quite so jarring it was quiet here the kind of quiet in a massive city only the very rich could afford she could hear birdsong see the sky smell the sweet aroma of freshly shorn grass minutes away only minutes was the teeming noisy sweating mass of new york here she supposed was sanctuary as much for roarke as for herself two lost souls hed once called them that she wondered if theyd stopped being lost when theyd found each other she left her car at the front entrance knowing its battered body and tasteless shape would offend summerset roarkes pokerbacked butler it was a simple matter to switch it to automatic send it around the house and into the slot reserved for her unit in the garage but she enjoyed her petty needling when it came to summerset she opened the door and found him standing in the grand foyer with a sniff in his nose and a sneer on his lips lieutenant your vehicle is unsightly hey its city property she reached down to pick up the fat oddeyed cat whod come to greet her you dont want it there move it yourself she heard a trill of laughter float down the hall lifted a brow company indeed with his disapproving eye summerset scanned her wilted shirt and slacks skimmed over the weapon harness still strapped to her side i suggest you bathe and change before meeting your guests i suggest you kiss my ass she said cheerfully and strolled by him in the main salon filled with treasures roarke had collected from around the known universe an elegant intimate party was happening glossy canapes sat elegantly on silver trays pale gold wine filled sparkling crystal roarke was a dark angel in what he would have seen as casual attire the black silk shirt open at the collar the perfectly draped black trousers cinched with a belt gleaming silver at the buckle suited him perfectly made him look exactly as he was rich gorgeous dangerous only one couple joined him in the spacious room the man was as bright as roarke was dark long golden hair flowed over the shoulders of a snug blue jacket the face was square and handsome with lips just slightly too thin but the contrast of his dark brown eyes kept the observer from noticing the woman was stunning a sweep of deep red hair the color of rich wine was scooped up into curls that tumbled flirtatiously down the nape of her neck her eyes were green sharp as a cats and over them were shapely brows as black as ink she had skin like alabaster creamed over high cheekbones and a sensually generous mouth her body matched it and was currently poured into a clinging column of emerald that left strong shoulders bare and dipped between her staggering breasts to the waist roarke she let out that fluid laugh again slid one slim white hand into roarkes mane of hair and kissed him silkily i have missed you dreadfully eve thought about the weapon strapped to her side and how on even its lowest setting it would send the bombshell redhead into a jittery dance just a passing thought eve assured herself and set galahad the cat down before she squeezed through the layers of fat and cracked one of his ribs you didnt miss him that time eve said casually as she stepped inside roarke damn him glanced over and grinned at her well just have to wipe that smug look off your face pal she thought real soon eve we didnt hear you come in obviously she snagged an unidentifiable canape from the tray and stuffed it into her mouth i dont believe youve met our guests reeanna ott william shaffer my wife eve dallas watch yourself ree shes armed with a chuckle william crossed over to extend a hand he moved in a lope like a thin horse going out to pasture a pleasure to meet you eve a genuine pleasure ree and i were so disappointed we were unable to attend your wedding devastated reeanna smiled at eve her green eyes sparkling william and i were desperate to meet face to face the woman who brought roarke to his knees hes still standing eve flicked roarke a glance as he handed her a glass of wine for now ree and william were in the lab on tarus three working on some projects for me theyve just gotten back on planet for some well deserved r and r oh like she gave a rats skinny ass the ontheboard projects been a particular pleasure william said within a year two at most roarke industries will introduce new technology that will revolutionize the entertainment and amusement world entertainment and amusement eve smiled thinly well thats earth shattering actually it has the potential to be just that reeanna sipped her wine and sized eve up attractive irritated competent tough there are potential medical breakthroughs as well thats rees end william lifted his glass to her with easy intimate affection in his eyes shes the med expert im just a fun guy im sure after putting in a long day eve doesnt want to hear us talk shop scientists reeanna said with an apologetic smile were so tedious youre just back from olympus silk whispered as reeanna shifted that staggering body william and i were part of the team that designed the amusement and medical centers there did you have time to tour them briefly she was being rude eve reminded herself she would have to become accustomed to coming home and finding elegant company to seeing gorgeous women drool over her husband very impressive even at midconstruction stage the medical facility will be more so when its staffed was the hologram room in the main hotel yours eve asked william guilty he said with a sparkle i love to play do you eve considers it work as it happens we had an incident while we were there roarke put in a suicide one of the autotronic techs mathias williams brow furrowed mathias young red hair freckles yes good god he shuddered drank deeply suicide are you sure it wasnt an accident my recollection is of an enthusiastic young man with big ideas not one whod take his own life thats what he did eve said shortly he hanged himself how horrible pale now reeanna sat on the arm of a couch did i know him william i dont think so you might have seen him at one of the clubs while we were there but i dont remember him as much of a socializer im terribly sorry in any case reeanna said and how awful for you to deal with such a tragedy on your honeymoon lets not dwell on it galahad leaped onto the couch skimmed his head under reeannas elegant hand id so much rather hear about the wedding we missed stay for dinner roarke gave eves arm an apologetic squeeze well bore you to tears with it i wish we could william offered reeannas shoulder the same smooth stroke as she gave the cats head were due at the theater were already late youre right as always with obvious regret reeanna rose i hope youll give us a rain check well be on planet for the next month or two and id so love the opportunity to get to know you eve roarke and i go back a long way youre welcome any time and ill see you both in the office tomorrow for a full report bright and early reeanna set her glass aside perhaps we can have lunch someday soon eve just females her eyes twinkled with such easy humor that eve felt foolish we can compare notes on roarke the invitation was too friendly to give offense eve found herself smiling that should be interesting she walked them to the door with roarke waved them off just how many notes she said as she stepped back would there be to compare it was a long time ago he snagged her by the waist for a delayed welcomehome kiss years eons she probably bought that body id have to term it an excellent investment eve lifted her chin to eye him sourly is there any beautiful woman who hasnt bounced on your bed roarke cocked his head narrowed his eyes in consideration no he laughed when she took a swing at him you didnt mean that or youd have hit me then he grunted when her fist plowed into his gut he rubbed it grateful shed pulled the punch i should have quit while i was ahead let that be a lesson to you lover boy but eve let him sweep her off her feet and over his shoulder hungry he asked her starving me too he started up the stairs lets eat in bed chapter four eve awoke with the cat stretched over her chest and the bedside link beeping dawn was just breaking the light through the sky window was thin and gray from the storm rolling in with morning with her eyes half closed she reached out to answer block video she ordered clearing sleep from her voice dallas dispatch dallas lieutenant eve suspicious death five oh oh two madison avenue unit thirtyeight hundred see resident foxx arthur code four dispatch received contact peabody officer delia to assist my authorization confirmed transmission terminated code four roarke had shifted the cat and was sitting up in bed lazily stroking galahad into feline ecstasy it means i have time for a shower and coffee eve didnt spot a robe handy so she walked toward the bathroom naked theres a uniform on the scene she called out she stepped into the shower unit rubbing her gritty eyes full power all jets one hundred two degrees youll boil i like to boil she let out an enormous sigh of pleasure as pulsing jets of steamy water battered her from all sides tapping a glass block she dispensed a palm full of dark green liquid soap by the time she stepped out of the shower she was awake her brow lifted as she saw roarke standing in the doorway holding a cup of coffee for me part of the service thanks she took the cup into the drying tube sipping while warm air swirled around her what were you doing watching me shower i like to watch you something about long lean women when theyre wet and naked he stepped into the shower himself and called for sixtyeight degrees it made eve shiver she couldnt understand why a man with all the luxuries in the world at his fingertips would actually choose cold showers she opened the drying tube and combed her fingers through her unstyled cap of hair she used some of the face glop that mavis was always pushing at her brushed her teeth you dont have to get up because i am im up roarke said simply and chose a heated towel rather than the drying tube do you have time for breakfast eve watched his reflection in the mirror gleaming hair gleaming skin ill catch something later he hooked the towel around his waist shook back his dripping mane of hair cocked his head yeah i guess i like looking at you too she muttered and went into the bedroom to dress for death o o street traffic was light airbuses rumbled overhead through the sizzling rain carting night shift workers home dragging day shifters to work billboards were quiet and the ubiquitous glida grills and carts with their offerings of food and drink were already setting up for the day smoke billowed through the vents in streets and sidewalks from the underground world of transportation and retail the air steamed eve headed across town making good time the section of madison where a body waited for her was pocked with exclusive boutiques and silvery spears of buildings fashioned to house those who could afford to shop there the skywalks were glassed in to separate the clientele from the elements and from the noise that would begin to boom within an hour or two eve passed a taxi with a lone passenger the elegant blonde wore a glittery jacket a sparkling rainbow of color in the dingy light licensed companion eve mused heading home after an allnighter the wealthy could afford to buy fancy sex along with their fancy clothes eve swung into an underground garage at the scene flashed her badge for the security post it scanned it scanned her then the light blinked from red to green and flashed the number of the empty space assigned to her it was of course at the far end of the facility from the elevator cops she thought with resignation as she hoofed it arent given optimum spaces eve recited the number of the unit into the speaker box and was whisked up there had been a time not so long before when she would have been impressed with the sumptuous foyer on the thirtyeighth floor with its pool of scarlet hibiscus and bronze statuary that was before shed entered roarkes world she scanned the small tinkling fountains flanking the entrance and realized that it was highly possible that her husband owned the building she spotted the uniform guarding the door of flipped up her badge lieutenant the cop shifted subtly to attention sucking in her stomach my partners inside with the deceaseds housemate mr foxx on discovering his companions body called for an ambulance we responded in addition as per procedure the ambulance is on hold sir until you clear the scene is it secured it is now her gaze flicked toward the door we werent able to get much out of foxx sir hes a bit hysterical i cant be sure what he might have disturbed other than the body he moved the body no sir that is its still in the tub but he attempted to ah revive the deceased had to be in shock to attempt it theres enough blood in there to swim in slashed wrists she explained from a visual confirmation hed been dead at least an hour before his housemate discovered the body eve took a firmer grip on her field kit has the me been notified on the way sir fine clear officer peabody in when she arrives and continue to stand open it she added and waited for the uniform to slide her master key in the slot the door slid open into the wall eve immediately heard the hard ragged sobs of terrible grief hes been like that since we arrived the uniform murmured hope you can tranq him soon saying nothing eve walked in letting the door slide shut and lock at her back the entranceway was elaborate in black and white marble spiraling columns were draped in some sort of flowering vine and overhead a black glass chandelier dripped in five ornate tiers through the portico was a living area that followed the theme black leather sofas white floors ebony wood tables white lamps drapes striped in black and white were drawn shut but lights showered from the ceiling spotlighted up from the floor an amusement screen was switched off but hadnt been slipped back into its recess glossy white stairs angled up to a second floor which was ringed with white banisters atrium style lush green ferns hung in enameled pots from the lofted ceiling money might drip she mused but death had no respect for it it was a club without a class system the sounds of grief echoed and drew her into a small den lined with antique books and cushy with deep chairs the color of good burgundy sunk into one was a man his handsome face was pale gold and ravaged from tears his hair was gold as well the glint of new coin and was tufted in spikes from his hands he wore a white silk robe that was spotted and smeared with drying blood his feet were bare and his hands were studded with rings that sparkled as his fingers trembled there was a tattoo of a black swan on his left ankle the uniform who was sitting miserably beside the man glanced over at eve started to speak eve shook her head quickly keeping her badge in plain sight she gestured toward the ceiling cocking her head in question he nodded jerked his thumb up then shook his head eve slipped back out she wanted to see the body view the scene before she dealt with the witness there were several rooms off the second floor still it was simple enough to find her way she simply followed the trail of blood she stepped into a bedroom here the scheme was soft greens and blues so that it felt like floating underwater the bed was an oblong of blue satin sheets mountained with pillows there was statuary here as well of the classic nude variety drawers were built into the walls giving it an uncluttered and to eve an unlivedin appearance the ocean blue carpet was soft as a cloud and spotted with blood she followed the trail into the master bath death didnt shock her but it appalled her and she knew it always would the waste of it the violence and cruelty of it but she lived with it too much to be shocked even by this blood had spurted showered streamed on gleaming tiles of ivory and seafoam green it had fountained over glass pooled over the mirrored floor from the gaping wound in the wrist of the hand that hung limply over the lip of a huge clearsided tub the water inside was a dark nasty pink and the metallic smell of blood hung in the air music was playing something with strings perhaps a harp fat white candles had been lighted and still burned at both the foot and the head of the long oval tub the body that lay in that cloudy pink water had its head resting on a giltedged bath pillow its gaze lifted and fixed on the feathery tails of a fern that hung from the mirrored ceiling he was smiling as if hed been desperately amused to watch himself die it didnt shock her but she sighed as she coated her hands and feet with clear seal engaged her recorder and carried her kit inside to stand over the body eve had recognized him naked bled almost dry and smiling up at his own reflection was the renowned defense attorney s t fitzhugh salvatoris going to be very disappointed in you counselor she murmured as she got to work eve had taken a sample of the bloody bathwater done her initial scan to estimate time of death bagged the deceaseds hands and recorded the scene when peabody appeared slightly out of breath at the doorway im sorry sir i had some trouble getting uptown its all right she passed peabody the ivoryhandled buck knife shed secured in clear plastic looks like he did it with this its an antique id guess collectors item well run it for prints peabody tucked the knife in her evidence kit then narrowed her eyes lieutenant isnt that yeah its fitzhugh why would he kill himself we havent determined that he did never make assumptions officer she said mildly first rule call in the sweepers peabody and lets get the scene tagged we can release the body to the me im done with it for now eve stepped back with blood smearing her sealed hands i want you to take a prelim from the two uniforms who responded while i talk to foxx eve glanced back at the body shook her head thats just the way hed grin at you in court when he figured hed tripped you up the son of a bitch still studying the body she used the cleaner from her kit to remove the blood tucked the soiled wipe into a bag as well tell the me i want toxicology asap she left peabody and followed the blood trail back downstairs foxx was down to choking whimpering sobs now the uniform looked ridiculously relieved when eve reappeared wait for the me and my adjutant outside officer give officer peabody your report ill speak with mr foxx now yes sir with almost unseemly delight he fled the room mr foxx im lieutenant dallas im sorry for your loss eve located the button that released the drapes pushed it to let watery light into the room you need to talk to me you need to tell me what happened here hes dead foxxs voice was faintly musical accented lovely fitz is dead i dont know how that can be i dont know how i can go on everyone goes on eve thought theres little choice she sat and put her recorder on the table in plain sight mr foxx it would help us both if you talked to me now im going to give you the standard caution its just a matter of procedure she recited the revised miranda while his sobs trickled off he lifted his head and aimed swollen redrimmed golden eyes at her do you think i killed him do you think i could hurt him mr foxx i loved him weve been together for twelve years he was my life you still have your life she thought you just dont know it yet then youll want to help me do my job tell me what happened he hes been having trouble sleeping lately doesnt like to take tranqs he can usually read listen to music spend an hour with vr or one of his games whatever to relax this case hes working on worried him the salvatori case yes i believe yes foxx wiped at his eyes with a damp and bloodied sleeve we didnt discuss his cases in any depth there was privilege and im not a lawyer im a nutritionist thats how we met fitz came to me twelve years ago for help with his diet we became friends we became lovers then we simply became she would need to know all of that but for the moment she wanted to see the events leading up to that last bath hes been having trouble sleeping she prompted yes hes often plagued with insomnia he gives so much to his clients they prey on his mind im accustomed to him getting up in the middle of the night and going into another room to program a game or doze in front of the view screen sometimes hed take a warm bath foxxs already ravaged face blanched oh god the tears started again flowing hotly down his cheeks eve took a quick look around and spotted a small serving droid in the corner of the room bring mr foxx some water she ordered and the little droid scooted away to comply is that what happened she continued did he get up in the middle of the night i dont even remember foxx lifted his hands let them fall i sleep soundly never have a bit of trouble wed gone to bed just before midnight watched some of the late news had a brandy i woke early i tend to what time was that perhaps five five fifteen we both like early starts and its my habit to program the morning meal personally i saw that fitz wasnt in bed assumed hed had a bad night and that id find him downstairs or in one of the spare bedrooms then i went into the bath and i saw him oh god oh god fitz all the blood it was like a nightmare his hand pressed against his mouth all glittering rings and trembles i ran over i beat on his chest tried to revive him i suppose i went a little mad he was dead i could see he was dead still i tried to pull him out of the water but hes a very big man and i was shaking sick he dropped his hand from mouth to stomach pressed i called for an ambulance shed lose him if she couldnt manage to rein him in tranquing him wasnt an option until she had the facts i know this is difficult for you mr foxx im sorry we have to do this now but its easier believe me if we can im all right he reached for the glass of water atop the droid i want to get it over can you tell me his frame of mind last night you said he was worried about a case worried yes but not depressed there was a cop he couldnt shake on the stand and it irritated him he took a gulp of water then another eve decided it was best not to mention she was the cop who had irritated him and there were a couple of other cases pending that he was plotting out the defense for his mind was often too busy for sleep you see did he receive any calls make any calls certainly both he often brought work home with him last night he spent a couple of hours in his office upstairs he arrived home about five thirty worked until nearly eight we had dinner did he mention anything that was troubling him besides the salvatori case his weight foxx smiled a little fitz hated to put on an extra pound we discussed him increasing his exercise program perhaps having some body adjustment work done when he had the time we watched a comedy on screen in the living room then went to bed as i told you did you argue argue you have bruises on your arm mr foxx did you and mr fitzhugh fight last night no he paled even more and his eyes glittered with the threat of another bout of weeping we never fought physically certainly we argued from time to time people do i i suppose i might have gotten the bruises on the tub when i was when i tried to did mr fitzhugh have a relationship with anyone else other than yourself now those swollen eyes went cool if you mean did he have outside lovers he did not we were committed to each other who owns this unit foxxs face went rigid and his voice was cold it was put in our joint names ten years ago it belonged to fitz and now it belongs to you eve thought i would assume mr fitzhugh was a wealthy man do you know who inherits other than charitable bequests i would inherit do you think i would kill him for money there was disgust in his tone now rather than horror what right do you have to come into my home at such a time and ask me such horrible questions i need to know the answers mr foxx if i dont ask them here ill have to ask them at the station house i believe this is more comfortable for you did mr fitzhugh collect knives no foxx blinked then went pasty i do i have a large collection of antique blades registered he added quickly theyre duly registered do you have an ivoryhandled knife straight blade about six inches long in your collection yes its nineteenth century from england his breath began to hitch is that what he used he used one of my knives to i didnt see i only saw him did he use one of my knives ive taken a knife into evidence mr foxx well run tests ill give you a receipt for it i dont want it i dont want to see it he buried his face in his hands fitz how could he have used one of my knives he fell to weeping again eve heard the voices and hums from the next room and knew the sweepers had arrived mr foxx she rose im going to have one of the officers bring you some clothes im going to ask that you stay here for a little while longer is there someone i can call for you no no one nothing o o i dont like it peabody eve muttered as they rode down to her car fitzhugh gets up in the middle of an ordinary night gets an antique knife runs himself a bath he lights the candles puts on the music then carves up his wrists for no particular reason heres a man at the height of his career with a shit load of money plush digs clients beating down his door and he just decides what the hell i think ill die i dont understand suicide i guess i dont have the personality for big highs and lows eve understood it shed even considered it briefly during her stint in staterun homes and before that in the dark time before that when death had seemed a release from hell that was why she couldnt accept it for fitzhugh theres no motivation here at least none that shows yet but we have a lover who collected knives who was covered with blood and who will inherit a sizable fortune youre thinking maybe foxx killed him peabody mulled it over when they reached garage level fitzhughs nearly twice his size he wouldnt have gone without a fight and there wasnt any sign of struggle signs can be erased eve muttered he had bruises and if fitzhugh was drugged or chemically impaired he wouldnt have put up too much of a struggle well see the tox report why do you want it to be a homicide i dont i just want it to make sense and the selftermination doesnt fit maybe fitzhugh couldnt sleep maybe he got up someone was using the relaxation room or it was made to seem so ive never seen anything like that peabody mused thinking back all those toys in one place that big chair with all the controls the wall screen the autobar the vr station the mood tube ever use a mood tube lieutenant roarkes got one i dont like it id rather have my moods come and go naturally than program them eve spotted the figure sitting on the hood of her car and hissed like now for example i can feel my mood shifting i think im about to be pissed off well dallas and peabody together again nadine furst top onair reporter for channel slid gracefully from the car how was the honeymoon private eve snapped hey i thought we were pals nadine winked at peabody you didnt waste any time putting our little gettogether on the air pal dallas nadine spread her pretty hands you bag a killer and close a very public and intense case at your own bachelor party celebration to which i was invited its news the public not only has the right to know they eat it up with a spoon ratings rocketed now look at this youre barely back and right in the middle of something else big whats the deal with fitzhugh hes a dead man ive got work to do nadine come on eve nadine plucked at eves sleeve after all weve been through together give me a nibble fitzhughs clients had better start looking for another lawyer thats all ive got to give you come on accident homicide what were investigating eve said shortly and coded open her locks peabody but peabody just grinned and shrugged her shoulders you know dallas its common knowledge that you and the dearly departed werent fans of each other the top sound bite after court yesterday was him referring to you as a violent cop who used her badge as a blunt instrument its a shame he wont be able to give you and your associates such catchy quotes anymore as eve slammed the car door nadine leaned doggedly in the window so you give me one s t fitzhugh is dead police are investigating back off eve started the engine torpedoed out of the slot so that nadine had to dance back to save her toes at peabodys chuckle eve slid a stony glance in her direction something funny i like her peabody couldnt resist looking back and she noted that nadine was grinning so do you eve smothered a chuckle theres no accounting for taste she said and drove out into the rainy morning it had gone perfectly absolutely perfectly it was an exciting powerful feeling to know that you had the controls the reports coming from various news agencies were all duly logged and recorded such matters required careful organization and were added to the small but satisfactorily growing pile of data discs it was such fun and that was a surprise fun had certainly not been the prime motivator of the operation but it was a delightful side effect who would succumb next at the flick of a switch eves face flashed onto a monitor all pertinent data splitscreened beside her a fascinating woman birthplace and parents unknown the abused child discovered hiding in an alley in dallas texas body battered mind blanked a woman who couldnt remember the early years of her own life the years that formed the soul years when she had been beaten and raped and tormented what did that sort of life do to the mind to the heart to the person it had made the girl a social worker and had made eve dallas into a woman who had become a cop the cop with the reputation for digging deep and who had come into some notoriety the previous winter during the investigation of a sensitive and ugly case that was when she had met roarke the computer hummed sliced roarkes face onto the screen such an intriguing couple his background was no prettier than the cops had been but hed chosen at least initially the other side of the law to make his mark and his fortune now they were a set a set that could be destroyed on a whim but not yet not for some little time yet after all the game had just begun chapter five i just dont buy it eve muttered as she called up data on fitzhugh she studied his bold striking face as it flashed onto her monitor shook her head i just dont buy it she repeated she scanned his date and place of birth saw that hed been born in philadelphia during the last decade of the previous century hed been married to a milicent barrows from to divorced no children hed moved to new york the same year as his divorce established his criminal law practice and as far as she could see had never looked back annual income she requested subject fitzhugh annual income for last tax year two million seven hundred usd bloodsucker she murmured computer list and detail any arrests searching no police record on file okay so hes clean how about this list all civil suits filed against subject she got a hit on that a short list of names and she ordered a hard copy she requested a list of cases fitzhugh had lost over the last ten years noted the names that mirrored the suits filed against him it made her sigh it was typical litigation of the era your lawyer doesnt get you off you sue the lawyer it gave another jab to her hopeful theory of blackmail okay so maybe were going about this the wrong way new subject foxx arthur residence five oh oh two madison avenue new york searching the computer blipped and whined causing eve to slap the unit with the heel of her hand to jog it back she didnt bother to curse budget cuts foxx appeared on screen wavering a bit until eve gave the computer another smack more attractive she noted when he smiled he was fifteen years younger than fitzhugh had been born in east washington the son of two career military personnel had lived in various points of the globe until he had settled in new york in and joined the nutrition for life organization as a consultant his annual income just tipped into the six figures the record showed no marriages but the samesex license he shared with fitzhugh list and detail any arrests the machine grumbled as if it were tired of answering questions but the list popped one disorderly conduct two assaults and one disturbing the peace well now were getting somewhere both subjects list and detail any psychiatric consults there was nothing on fitzhugh but she got another hit on foxx with a grunt she ordered a hard copy then glanced up as peabody entered forensics toxicology forensics isnt in but weve got tox peabody handed eve a disc low level alcohol identified as parisian brandy not nearly enough to debilitate no other drug traces shit shed been hopeful i might have something here our friend foxx spent a lot of his childhood on the therapists couch he checked himself into the delroy institute just two years ago for a month and hes done time piss away time but time nonetheless ninety days lockup for assault and he had to wear a probie bracelet for six months our boy has some violent tendencies peabody frowned at the data military family they tend to be resistant to homosexuality still i bet they tried to head shrink him into hetero maybe but hes got a history of mental heath problems and a criminal record lets see what the uniforms turned up when they knocked on doors in fitzhughs building and well talk to fitzhughs associates in his firm youre not buying suicide i knew him he was arrogant pompous smug vain eve shook her head vain arrogant men dont choose to be found naked in the bathtub swimming in their own blood o o he was a brilliant man leanore bastwick sat in her custommade leather chair in the glasswalled corner office of fitzhugh bastwick and stern her desk was a glass pool unsmudged and sparkling it suited eve thought her icy and stunning blond beauty he was a generous friend leanore added and folded her perfectly manicured hands on the edge of the desk were in shock here lieutenant it was hard to see shock on the polished surface of it all new yorks steel forest rose up glittering behind leanores back lending the lofty illusion that she was reigning over the city pale rose and soft gray added elegant muted color to an office that was as meticulously decorated as the woman herself do you know of any reason why fitzhugh would have taken his own life absolutely none leanore kept her hands very still her eyes level he loved life his life his work he enjoyed every minute of every day as much as anyone ive ever met i have no idea why he would choose to end it when was the last time you saw or spoke with him she hesitated eve could almost see wheels working smoothly behind those heavily lashed eyes actually i saw him briefly last night i dropped a file off for him discussed a case that discussion is of course privileged her slicked lips curved but i will say he was his usual enthusiastic self and he was very much looking forward to dueling with you in court dueling thats how fitz referred to crossexamination of expert and police witnesses a smile flickered over her face it was a match in his mind of wits and nerve a professional game for an innate game player i dont know of anything he enjoyed so much as being in court what time did you drop off the file last night id say about ten yes i think it was around ten id worked late here and slipped by on my way home was that usual ms bastwick you slipping by to see him on your way home not unusual we were after all professional associates and our cases sometimes overlapped thats all you were professional partners do you assume lieutenant that because a man and woman are physically attractive and on friendly terms that they cant work together without sexual tension i dont assume anything how long did you stay discussing your case twenty minutes a half hour i didnt time it he was fine when i left ill tell you that there was nothing he was particularly concerned about he had some concerns about the salvatori matter and others as well nothing out of the ordinary he was a confident man and outside of work on a personal level a private man but you know arthur foxx of course in this firm we take care to know and socialize at least lightly with the spouses of partners and associates arthur and fitz were devoted to each other no spats leanore cocked a brow i wouldnt know sure you would eve thought you and mr fitzhugh were partners you had a close professional and apparently a close personal relationship he must have discussed his homelife with you from time to time he and arthur were very happy leanores first sign of irritation showed in the gentle tapping of a coraltoned nail against the edge of glass happy couples occasionally have arguments i imagine you argue with your husband from time to time my husband hasnt recently found me dead in the bathtub eve said evenly what did foxx and fitzhugh argue about leanore let out an annoyed huff of breath she rose punched in a code on her autochef took out a steaming cup of coffee none was offered to eve arthur had periodic bouts of depression he is not the most selfconfident of men he tended to be jealous which exasperated fitz her brows knit youre probably aware that fitz was married before his bisexuality was somewhat of a problem for arthur and when he was depressed he tended to worry about all the men and women fitz came into contact with in the course of his work they rarely argued but when they did it was generally about arthurs jealousy did he have reason to be jealous as far as i know fitz was completely faithful its not always an easy choice lieutenant being in the spotlight as he was and given his lifestyle even today there are some who are lets say uncomfortable with lessthantraditional sexual preferences but fitz gave arthur no reason to be anything less than content yet he was thank you eve said as she rose youve been very helpful lieutenant leanore began as eve and the silent peabody started for the door if i thought for one instant that arthur foxx had anything to do with she stopped sucked in a breath no its simply impossible to believe less possible than believing fitzhugh slashed his own wrists and let himself bleed to death eve waited a beat then left the office peabody waited until theyd stepped out onto the sky walk that ribboned the building i dont know whether you were planting seeds or digging for worms both eve looked through the glass of the tube she could see roarkes office building shooting tall and polished ebony among the other spears at least he had no connection with this case she didnt have to worry about uncovering something hed done or someone hed known too well she knew both the victim and the suspect and foxx didnt mention her slipping by to discuss work last night so youve bumped foxx from witness to suspect eve watched a man in a tailored robe squawk bad temperedly into a palm link as he glided by until we prove conclusively it was suicide foxx is the prime hell the only suspect he had the means it was his knife he had the opportunity they were alone in the apartment he had the motive money now we know he has a history of depression a record of violence and a jealous streak can i ask you something peabody waited for eves nod you didnt care for fitzhugh on a professional or a personal level i hated his fucking guts so what eve stepped off the skywalk and onto the street level where shed been lucky enough to find a parking spot she spied a glida grill smoking soy dogs and potato rings and made a beeline through the heavy pedestrian traffic you think ive got to like the corpse give me a couple of dogs and a scoop of potatoes two tubes of pepsi diet for me peabody interrupted and rolled her eyes over eves long lean form some of us have to worry about weight diet dog diet pep the woman running the cart had a dingy cz stud in the center of her top lip and a tattoo of the subway system on her chest the a line veered off and disappeared under the loose gauze covering her breasts reg dog reg pep hot potatoes cash or credit eve shoved the limp cardboard holding the food at peabody and dug for her tokens whats the damage the woman poked a grimy purpletipped finger at her console sent it beeping twentyfive shit you blink and dogs go up eve poured credits into the womans outstretched hand grabbed a couple of waferthin napkins she worked her way back plopped down on the bench circling the fountain in front of the law building the panhandler beside her looked hopeful eve tapped her badge he grinned tapped the beggars license hung around his neck resigned she dug out a five credit chip passed it over find someplace else to hustle she ordered him or ill run that license and see if its up to date he said something uncomplimentary about her line of work but he pocketed the credit and moved on giving room to peabody leanore doesnt like arthur foxx peabody swallowed gamely diet dogs were invariably grainy she doesnt a highclass lawyer doesnt give that many answers unless she wants to she fed us that foxx was jealous that they argued eve held out the scoop of greasy potatoes after a brief internal struggle peabody dug in she wanted us to have that data still isnt much theres nothing in fitzhughs records that implicates foxx his diary his appointment book his link logs none of the data i scanned points the finger then again none of it indicates a suicidal bent either contemplatively eve sucked on her tube of pepsi watched new york lumber by with all its noise and sweat well have to talk to foxx again ive got court again this afternoon i want you to go back to cop central get the doortodoor reports nag the me for the final autopsy i dont know what the hangup is there but i want the results by end of shift i should be out of court by three well do another walkthrough of fitzhughs apartment and see why he omitted bastwicks little visit peabody juggled food and duly programmed the duties into her day log what i asked before about you not liking fitzhugh i just wondered if it was harder to push all the buttons when you had bad feelings about the subject cops dont have personal feelings then she sighed bullshit you put those feelings aside and push the buttons thats the job and if i happen to think a man like fitzhugh deserved to end up bathing in his own blood it doesnt mean i wont do whats necessary to find out how he got there peabody nodded a lot of other cops would just file it selftermination end of transmission im not other cops and neither are you peabody she glanced over mildly interested at the explosive crash as two taxis collided pedestrian and street traffic barely hitched as smoke billowed duraglass pinged and two furious drivers popped like corks out of their ruined vehicles eve nibbled away at her lunch as the two men pushed shoved and shouted imaginative obscenities she imagined they were obscenities anyway since no english was exchanged she looked up but didnt spot one of the hovering traffic copters with a thin smile she balled up the cardboard rolled up the empty tube passed them to peabody dump these in the recycler will you then come back and give me a hand breaking up those two idiots sir one of them just pulled out a bat should i call for backup nope eve rubbed her hands together in anticipation as she rose i can handle it o o eves shoulder was still smarting when she walked out of court a couple of hours later she imagined the cab drivers would have been released by now which wasnt going to happen to the child killer eve had just testified against she thought with satisfaction shed be in high security lockup for the next fifty years minimum there was some satisfaction in that eve rolled her bruised shoulder the cabbie really hadnt been swinging at her she thought hed been trying to crack his opponents head open and shed just gotten in the way still it wasnt going to hurt her feelings that both of them would have their licenses suspended for three months she climbed into her car and favoring her shoulder put the vehicle on auto to cop central overhead a tourist tram blatted out the standard spiel about the scales of justice well she mused sometimes they balanced if only for a short time her link beeped dallas dr morris the medical examiner had heavylidded hawk eyes in a vivid shade of green a squaredoff chin that was generously stubbled and a slickedback mane of charcoal hair eve liked him though she was often frustrated by his lack of stellar speed she appreciated his thoroughness have you finished the report on fitzhugh i have a problem i dont need a problem i need the report can you transmit it to my office link im on my way there no lieutenant youre on your way here i have something i need to show you i dont have time to come by the morgue make time he suggested and ended the transmission eve ground her teeth once scientists were so damned frustrating she thought as she redirected her unit o o from the outside the lower manhattan city morgue resembled one of the beehivestructured office buildings that surrounded it it blended that had been the point of the redesign nobody liked to think of death to have it spoil their appetite as they scooted out of work at lunchtime to grab a bite at a corner deli images of bodies tagged and bagged on refrigerated slabs tended to put you off your pasta salad eve remembered the first time shed stepped through the black steel doors in the rear of the building shed been a rookie in uniform shoulder to shoulder with two dozen other rookies in uniforms unlike several of her comrades shed seen death up close and personal before but shed never seen it displayed dissected analyzed there was a gallery above one of the autopsy labs and there students rookies and journalists or novelists with the proper credentials could witness firsthand the intricate workings of forensic pathology individual monitors in each seat offered closeup views to those with the stomach for it most of them didnt come back for a return trip many who left were carried out eve had walked out on her own steam and shed been back countless times since but she never looked forward to the visits her target this time wasnt what was referred to as the theater but lab c where morris conducted most of his work eve passed down the white tiled corridor with its pea green floors she could smell death there no matter what was used to eradicate it the sulky stink of it slid through cracks around doorways and it tainted the air with the grinning reminder of mortality medical science had eradicated plagues a host of diseases and conditions extending life expectancy to an average of one hundred fifty years cosmetic technology had insured that a human being could live attractively for his century and a half you could die without wrinkles without age spots without aches and pains and disintegrating bones but you were still going to die sooner or later for many who came here that day was sooner she stopped in front of the door at lab c held her badge up to the security camera and gave her name and id number to the speaker her palm print was analyzed and cleared the door slid open it was a small room windowless and depressing lined with equipment beeping with computers some of the tools ranged neat as a surgeons tray on the counters were barbaric enough to make the weak shudder saws lasers the glinting blades of scalpels hoses in the center of the room was a table with gutters on the side to catch fluids and run them into sterilized airtight containers for further analysis on the table was fitzhugh his naked body bearing the scars of the recent insult of a standard y cut morris was sitting on a rolling stool in front of a monitor face pushed close to the screen he wore a white lab coat that fluttered to the floor it was one of his few affectations the coat that flapped and swirled like a highwaymans cape whenever he walked down the corridors his slickedback hair was snugged into a long ponytail eve knew since hed called her in directly rather than passing her off to one of his techs that it was something unusual dr morris hmm lieutenant he began without turning around never seen anything like it not in thirty years of exploring the dead he swung around with a flutter of his lab coat beneath it he wore stovepipe pants and a tshirt in loud clashing colors youre looking well lieutenant he gave her one of his quick charming smiles and her lips curved up in response youre looking pretty good yourself you lost the beard he reached up rubbed a hand over his stubbly chin hed sported a precise goatee until recently didnt suit me but christ i hate to shave how was the honeymoon automatically she tucked her hands in her pockets it was good ive got a pretty full plate right now morris what do you have to show me you couldnt show me on screen some things take personal attention he rode his stool over to the autopsy table until he pulled up with a slight squeal of wheels at fitzhughs head what do you see she glanced down a dead guy morris nodded as if pleased what we would call a normal everyday dead guy who expired due to excessive blood loss possibly selfinflicted possibly she leaped on the word from the surface suicide is the logical conclusion there were no drugs in his system very little alcohol he shows no offensive nor defensive wounds or bruising the blood settlement was consistent with his position in the tub he did not drown the angle of the wrist wounds he bumped closer picked up one of fitzhughs limp beautifully manicured hands where on the wrist the carved wounds resembled some intricate ancient language they are also very consistent with selfinfliction a righthanded man reclining slightly he demonstrated holding an imaginary blade very quick very precise slashes to the wrist severing the artery though shed already studied the wounds herself and photographs of them she stepped closer looked again why couldnt someone have come up from behind him leaned over slashed down at that same angle its not beyond the realm of possibility but if that were the case id expect to see some defensive wounds if someone snuck into your bath and sliced your wrist youd be inclined to become annoyed quarrelsome he beamed a smile i dont think youd just settle back in the tub and bleed to death so youre going with selftermination not so fast i was prepared to he tugged on his bottom lip let it snap back into place i ran the standard brain analysis required with any selftermination or suspected selftermination thats the puzzle here the real puzzle he scooted his stool over to his workstation gestured over his shoulder for her to follow this is his brain he said tapping a finger on the organ floating in clear liquid and attached to wire thin cables that fed into the mainframe of his computer abby normal i beg your pardon morris chuckled shook his head obviously you dont make time to watch enough classic videos thats from a takeoff on the frankenstein myth what im saying is this brain is abnormal he had brain damage damage well it seems an extreme word for what ive found here on the screen he swiveled around tapped some keys a closeup view of fitzhughs brain flashed on again on the surface completely as expected but we show the cross section he tapped again and the brain was sliced neatly in half so much went on in this small mass morris murmured thoughts ideas music desires poetry anger hate people speak of the heart lieutenant but its the brain that holds all the magic and mystery of the human species it elevates us separates us defines us as individuals and the secrets of it well its doubtful well ever know them all see here eve leaned closer trying to see what he indicated with the tap of a finger on the screen it looks like a brain to me unattractive but necessary not to worry i nearly missed it myself for this imaging he went on while the monitor whirled with color and shapes the tissue appears in blues pale to dark the bone white blood vessels are red as you can see there are no clots or tumors that would indicate neurological disorders in the making enhance quadrant b sections thirtyfive to forty thirty percent the screen jumped and a section of the image enlarged losing patience eve started to shrug then leaned in what is that it looks like what a smudge it does doesnt it he beamed again staring at the screen where a faint shadow no bigger than a flyspeck marred the brain almost like a fingerprint a childs oily finger but when you enhance again he did so with a few brief commands popping the image closer its more of a tiny burn how would you get a burn inside your brain exactly obviously fascinated morris swiveled toward the brain in question ive never seen anything like that tiny pinprick mark it wasnt caused by a hemorrhage a small stroke or an aneurism ive run all the standard brain imaging programs and can find no known neurological cause for it but its there indeed it is it could be nothing no more than a faint abnormality that caused the occasional vague headache or dizziness it certainly wouldnt be fatal but it is curious ive sent for all of fitzhughs medical records to see if there were any tests run or any data on this burn could it cause depression anxiety i dont know it flaws the left frontal lobe of the right cerebral hemisphere current medical opinion is that certain aspects such as personality are localized in this specific cerebral area so it does appear in the section of the brain that we now believe receives and deploys suggestions and ideas he moved his shoulders however i cant document that this flaw contributed to death the fact is dallas at the moment im baffled but fascinated i wont be releasing your case until i find some answers o o a burn in the brain eve mused as she uncoded the locks on fitzhughs condo shed come alone wanting the emptiness the silence to give her own brain time to work until she had cleared the scene foxx would have other living quarters she retraced her steps upstairs studied the grisly bath again a burn in the brain she thought again drugs seemed the most logical answer if they hadnt showed on tox it could be it was a new type of drug one that had yet to be registered she walked into the relaxation room there was nothing there but the expensive toys of a wealthy man who enjoyed his leisure time couldnt sleep she mused came in to relax had a brandy stretched out in the chair watched some screen her lips pursed as she picked up the vr goggles beside the chair took a quick trip didnt want to use the chamber for it just kicked back curious she slipped on the goggles ordered the last scene played she was popped into a swaying white boat on a cool green river birds soared overhead a fish bulleted up flashed silver and dove again on the banks of the river were wildflowers and tall shielding trees she felt herself floating let her hand dip into the water to trail a quiet wake it was nearly sunset and the sky was going pink and purple in the west she could hear the low hum of bees the cheerful chirp of crickets the boat rocked like a cradle stifling a yawn she pulled the goggles off again a harmless sedative scene she decided and set the goggles down nothing that would have induced a sudden urge to slash ones wrists but the water might have prompted the urge for a hot bath so hed taken one and if foxx had crept in had been quiet enough quick enough he could have done it it was all she had eve decided and took out her communicator to order a second interview with arthur foxx chapter six eve studied the reports on the knockondoors from uniforms most of them were what shed expected fitzhugh and foxx were quiet kept to themselves yet friendly with their neighbors in the building but she latched on to the statement of the droid on doorman duty that placed foxx at leaving the building at twentytwo thirty and returning at twentythree hundred hours he didnt mention he went out did he peabody not a word about a little jaunt in the evening on his own no he didnt mention it have we got the security discs logged yet from the lobby and elevator cameras i loaded them in theyre under fitzhugh tenfiftyone on your unit lets take a look eve booted her machine leaned back in her chair peabody scanned the monitor over her shoulder and resisted mentioning that both of them were now officially off duty it was exciting after all working side by side with the top homicide detective at cop central dallas would sneer at that peabody thought but it was true shed been following the career of eve dallas for years and there was no one she admired or wished more to emulate the biggest shock of peabodys life was that somehow over the course of a few short months they had come to be friends as well stop eve sat up straight as the transmission froze she studied the classy blonde entering the building at twentytwo fifteen well well theres our leanore slipping by she had the time fairly close ten fifteen yeah shes on the mark eve ran her tongue around her teeth what do you think peabody business or pleasure well shes dressed for business peabody cocked her head and allowed a faint trail of envy to curl up her spine at leanores spiffy threepiece suit shes carrying a briefcase a briefcase and a bottle of wine enhance quadrant d thirty to thirtyfive an expensive bottle of wine eve murmured when the screen popped and displayed the label clearly roarkes got some of that little number in the wine cellar i think it goes for about two hundred a bottle wow a glass eve corrected amused when peabody goggled something doesnt fit resume normal size and speed shift to elevator camera hmm yeah yeah shes primping eve murmured watching as leanore took a gold compact out of her embossed briefcase powdered her nose freshened her lipstick as the elevator climbed and lookie there just flipped open the top three buttons of her blouse getting ready for a man peabody said and shrugged when eve slanted a look at her id guess id guess too together they watched leanore stride down the foyer on the thirtyeighth floor and buzz herself into fitzhughs apartment eve increased the time delay until foxx strode out fifteen minutes later doesnt look happy does he no peabody narrowed her eyes id say he looks ticked off she lifted her brows when foxx kicked bad temperedly at the elevator door very ticked off they waited for the drama to resume leanore left twentytwo minutes later color high on her cheeks eyes glittering she jabbed a finger at the elevator hitched her briefcase on her shoulder a short time after foxx returned carrying a small parcel she didnt stay twenty or thirty minutes but more than fortyfive what went on inside that apartment that night eve wondered and just what did foxx bring back with him contact the law offices i want leanore in here for questioning ive got foxx at ninethirty get her in here at the same time well team play them you want me to interrogate eve disengaged her machine rolled her shoulders its a good place to start well meet here at eightthirty no

office of his he had like the un or something in there all these off country guys wild anyway they put me through to the inner sanctum because i was a pal of yours and i talked to him so mavis chirped on over eves heaved sigh i told him what was up and coming and he said hed stop around after the meeting or summit or whatever he was into looks like its all settled eve watched her fantasy involving a whirlpool a glass of wine and a fat slab of steak go up in smoke too tops hey is that peabody hey peabody you come too well party see you soon right mavis eve caught her seconds before she disengaged where the hell are you oh didnt i say the studios at eight avenue b street level just beat on the door somebodyll let you in gotta go she shouted as something that might have been music boomed theyre tuning up catch ya eve blew out a breath scooped her hair out of her eyes and glanced over her shoulder well peabody want to go to a recording session get your ears fried eat bad food and get drunk on bad brew peabody didnt have to think twice as a matter of fact lieutenant id love to o o it took a lot of banging on a gray steel door that looked as though it had been on the wrong end of a battering ram somewhere along the line the rain from that morning had turned into steam that smelled unpleasantly of street oil and the recycling units that never seemed to be in full repair in that part of town with more resignation than energy eve watched two chemiheads make deals under the dirty light of a streetlamp neither of them so much as blinked at peabodys uniform eve turned when one of the powder junkies took a hit less than five feet away damn it thats just too arrogant bust him resigned peabody headed over the chemihead focused swore and swallowing the paper his powder had been cupped in swung around to run he skidded on the wet pavement and banged face first into the lamppost by the time peabody reached him he was flat on his back and bleeding profusely from the nose hes out cold she called to eve idiot call it in get a cruiser over here to haul him into the tank you want the collar peabody considered then shook her head not worth it the beat cop can take it she pulled out her communicator gave the location as she walked back to eve the dealers still across the street she commented hes got air blades but i could try to chase him down i sense a lack of enthusiasm eve narrowed her eyes scanned the dealer hulking across the street air blades steaming hey asshole she called out you see this uniform here she jerked a thumb at peabody take your business someplace else or ill tell her to bump her weapon up to level three and watch you piss your pants cunt he shouted back and whizzed off on his blades youve got a real way with community relations dallas yeah its a gift eve turned back prepared to beat on the door again and found herself facing a female of massive proportions she was easily six five with shoulders wide as a highway they rose out of a sleeveless leather vest and rippled with muscles and tattoos beneath she wore a unisuit snug as skin and the color of a healing bruise she sported a copper nose ring and closecropped hair fashioned into tight glossy black curls fucking drug pushers she said in a voice like a cannon boom stink up the neighborhood you maviss cop thats right and i brought my cop with me the woman sized peabody up out of milky blue eyes solid mavis says youre right im big mary eve angled her head yes you are it took about ten seconds then big marys moonsized face creased in a knifeedged grin come on in jess is just heating up by way of welcome she took eves arm and lifted her up and into the short hallway come on dallass cop peabody with a cautious glance peabody kept warily out of big marys reach pea body yeah you aint much bigger than a pea roaring at her own joke big mary carted eve into a padded elevator waited for the door to close they were cocooned together tight as fish in a pan as mary directed the unit to take them up one level jess he says to take you up to control you got money it was hard to maintain dignity of any kind when eves nose was pressed in marys armpit what for we got food coming you gotta plunk in your share for the eats all right is roarke here yet aint seen no roarke mavis says you cant miss him cause he is fine and prime the padded door opened and eve let out the breath shed been holding even as she sucked in air her ears were assaulted maviss high wild voice was screeching to the accompaniment of blistering noise shes got a groove going only deep affection for mavis prevented eve from leaping back into the soundproofing apparently ill get your drinks jess he brought the brew mary hulked off leaving eve and peabody in a glasswalled control booth that curved in a semicircle a half level above a studio where mavis was singing her heart and lungs out with a grin eve moved closer to the glass the better to see mavis had scooped up her hair so that it spewed in a purple fountain out of a multicolored band she was wearing modified overalls the black leather straps running up the center of her bare breasts the rest of the material was a shimmering kaleidoscope that started at the midriff and ended barely south of the crotch she danced to the beat on a fashionable pair of slides that left the feet bare and propped them onto fourinch stilts eve had no doubt that maviss lover had designed the costume for her she spotted leonardo in a corner of the studio glowing like a sunbeam at mavis and wearing a bodyskimming jumpsuit that made him look like an elegant grizzly what a pair she murmured and hooked her thumbs in the back pockets of her battered jeans she turned her head to speak to peabody but noted her companions attention was riveted to the left and the look on peabodys face eve noted with some curiosity managed to combine shock admiration and lust following peabodys distracted gaze eve had her first view of jess barrow he was beautiful a painting in motion with a long shining mane of hair the color of polished oak his eyes were nearly silver thickly lashed intensely focused as he worked the controls of an elaborate console his complexion was flawless tanned to bronze set off by rounded cheekbones and a strong chin his mouth was full and firm and his hands as they flew over the controls were as finely sculptured as marble roll up your tongue peabody eve suggested before you step on it god holy god hes better in person dont you just want to bite him not particularly but you go ahead catching herself peabody flushed to the roots of her hair she shifted on her sturdy legs this was she reminded herself her superior i admire his talent peabody youre admiring his chest its a pretty good one so i cant hold it against you i wish he would she murmured then cleared her throat as big mary stomped back with two dark brown bottles jess gets this brew from his family down south its fine since it was also unmarked and unlabeled eve prepared to sacrifice a few layers of stomach lining she was pleasantly surprised when the liquid slid mellowly down her throat it is fine thanks you add to the kitty you can have more im supposed to go down to wait for roarke i hear hes got money to roll in how come youre not wearing some flash you linked up with a rich man eve decided not to mention the babyfistsized diamond resting between her breasts under her shirt my underwears solid gold it chafes some but it makes me feel secure after another brief processing delay mary hooted with laughter slapped eve on the back hard enough to bop her head into the glass then headed off in her rockbreaking stride we ought to sign her up eve muttered she wouldnt need a weapon or body armor the music built to an earscorching crescendo then cut off as if severed with a knife below mavis let out a squeal and launched herself into leonardos open arms that was a nice take sugar jesss voice flowed out like top cream and drifted lazily with a southern drawl you take ten and rest that golden throat for me maviss idea of resting her throat was to let out another scream then wave desperately at eve dallas youre here wasnt that mag im coming up dont go anywhere she scrambled through a door on her trendy stilts so this is dallas jess pushed away from his console his body was trim and showed off to advantage in jeans as battered as eves and a simple cotton shirt that would retail for a beat cops monthly paycheck he wore a diamond stud in his ear that glinted as he crossed the booth and a braided gold chain around his wrist that slid fluidly as he held out one of those beautiful hands mavis is brimming over with stories about her cop mavis brims over habitually its part of her charm that it is im jess and im delighted to meet you at last with his hand still cupped over eves he turned that slow heartthudding smile onto peabody and it seems we have two cops for the price of one i im a huge fan peabody managed and fought against the nervous stutter i have all of your discs audio and video ive seen you in concert music buffs are always welcome he released eves hand to take hers why dont i show you my favorite toy he suggested leading her toward the console before eve could follow mavis burst in what did you think did you like it i wrote it jess orchestrated it but i wrote it he thinks it could hit im really proud of you you sounded great eve returned maviss enthusiastic embrace and grinned at leonardo over her shoulder how does it feel to be hooked up with a rising music legend shes wonderful he leaned in to give eve a onearmed squeeze you look terrific i noticed on some news clips that you wore a number of my designs im grateful im grateful eve said and meant it leonardo was a talented and emerging genius of clothing design i didnt look like roarkes ragpicking cousin you always look like yourself leonardo corrected but he narrowed his eyes and flipped his fingers through her untidy hair you need some work here if you dont have it styled every few weeks it loses shape i was going to trim it up some i just no no he shook his head solemnly but his eyes twinkled at her the days of you hacking at it yourself are over you call trina have her do you well have to drag her again mavis grinned at everything shell keep making excuses and start clipping at it with kitchen shears when it gets in her eyes she giggled when leonardo shuddered well get roarke to hound her id be delighted to he stepped out of the elevator walked straight to eve and framing her face in his hands kissed her what am i hounding you about nothing have a drink she passed him her bottle instead of drinking he kissed mavis in greeting i appreciate the invitation this is quite a setup isnt it mag the sound systems ace of the line and jess works all kinds of magic with the console hes got like six million instruments programmed in he can play them all too he can do anything the night he came into the d and d changed my life it was like a miracle mavis youre the miracle smoothly jess led peabody back toward the group she was flushed and glassyeyed eve could see the pulse in her throat pounding to its own rhythm down girl she muttered but peabody only rolled her eyes you met dallas and peabody right and this is roarke mavis bounced on her stilts my closest friends its a genuine pleasure jess offered one of his finely boned hands to roarke i admire your success in the business world and your taste in women thank you i tend to be careful with both roarke scanned the area inclined his head your studios impressive i love showing it off its been in the planning stages for some time mavis is actually the first artist to use it other than myself marys going to order food why dont i show you my prize creation before i put mavis back to work he led the way back to the console sat at it like a captain at the helm the instruments are programmed in of course i can call up any number of combinations and vary pitch and speed its accessed for voice command but i rarely use that distracts me from the music he slid controls and had a simple backbeat playing recorded vocals he tapped his fingers over buttons and maviss voice punched out surprisingly gritty and rich a monitor displayed the sounds with washing of colors and shapes i use that for computer analysis musicologists he flashed a charming selfdeprecating smile we cant help ourselves but thats another story she sounds good eve commented pleased and shell sound better overdubbing maviss voice split layered over itself in close harmony layers and fill jesss hands danced over the controls drawing out guitars brass the jingle of a tambourine the searing wail of a sax cool it down everything slowed mellowed heat it up went into double time blasted thats all very basic as is having her duet with recording artists of the past youll have to hear her version of hard days night with the beatles i can also code in any sound with a smile flirting around his mouth he spun a dial and skimmed his fingers over the keys eves voice whispered out down girl the words melded into maviss vocal repeating echoing drifting how did you do that eve demanded im miked he explained and hooked into the console now that i have your voice on program i can have your voice replace maviss he skimmed the controls again and eve winced when she heard herself singing dont do that she ordered and laughing jess switched it back sorry i cant resist playing want to hear yourself croon peabody no then she gnawed her lip well maybe lets see something smoky understated and classic he worked for a moment then sat back peabodys eyes rounded when she heard herself quietly torching through ive got you under my skin is that one of your songs she asked i dont recognize it jess chuckled no its before my time youve got a strong voice officer peabody good breath control want to quit your day job and join the party she flushed and shook her head jess cut out the vocals tuned the console to a bluesy instrumental i worked with an engineer who designed some autotronics for disneyuniverse it took nearly three years to complete this he patted the console like a wellloved child now that i have the prototype and a working unit im hoping to manufacture more she works on remote too i can be anywhere and link up run the board i got specs on a smaller portable unit and ive been working on a mood enhancer he seemed to catch himself shook his head i get carried away my agents starting to complain that im spending more time working on electronics than recording foods here big mary bellowed well then jess smiled scanned his audience lets dig in youve got to keep your energy level up mavis im starving she grabbed leonardos hand and headed for the door below mary was carting bags and boxes into the studio go help yourselves jess told them ive got a little fiddling to do ill be right along what do you think eve murmured to roarke as they headed down trailed by peabody i think hes looking for an investor eve sighed nodded yeah that was my take im sorry its not a problem hes got an interesting product i had peabody run a make on him nothings come up but i dont like to think of him using you or mavis thats yet to be seen he turned her into his arms as they stepped into the studio ran his hands over her hips i missed you i miss spending large quantities of time with you she felt the heat kindle between her thighs hotter lustier than the moment called for her breasts tingled with it i missed you too why dont we figure out how to cut the evening short go home and fuck like rabbits he was hard as iron as he leaned down to nip at her ear he found himself struggling not to tug at her clothes good thought christ i want you the hell with where they were roarke thought and dragged her head back by the hair to plunder her mouth at the console at the controls jess watched them and smiled another few minutes he mused and they could very well be on the floor mindlessly mating better not with deft fingers he skimmed buttons changed the program more than satisfied he rose and started downstairs o o two hours later driving home through the dark streets that ran with colors from flashing billboards eve pushed her cruiser past the limits of the law need was a low throbbing beat between her thighs an itch desperate to be scratched youre breaking the law lieutenant roarke said mildly he was rock hard again like a teenager cruising on hormones the woman who prided herself on never abusing her badge muttered bending it roarke reached over cupped her breast bend it more oh jesus she could already imagine what hed feel like inside her so she punched the accelerator and shot like a bullet down park a glidecart operator flipped up her middle finger as eve screamed around a curb and headed east cursing lightly eve switched on her duty light popped up the red and blue globe and had it flashing i cant believe im doing this i never do this roarke slid his hand down to her thigh do you know what im going to do to you she gave a hoarse laugh swallowed hard dont tell me for gods sake ill kill us her hands were glued to the wheel and trembling her body vibrating like a string already plucked her breath was already hitching clouds slipped past the moon and freed its light hit the remote for the gate she panted hit the remote im not slowing down he coded it quickly the iron gate eased majestically open and she burst through with inches to spare excellent job stop the car just a minute just a minute she rocketed up the drive flying past the gorgeous trees and musical fountains stop the car he demanded again and pressed his hand to her crotch she came instantly violently barely managing to keep from steering into an oak gasping for air she pulled the vehicle to a stop fishtailing and ending in a drunken diagonal across the drive she flew at him they tore at clothes fighting to find each other in the narrow confines of the car she bit his shoulder yanked his trousers open he was cursing she was laughing when he dragged her out of the car they fell on the grass in a tangle of limbs and twisted clothing hurry up hurry up it was all she could manage through the unbearable pressure his mouth was on her breast through her torn shirt teeth scraping she pulled at his trousers dug her fingers into his hips his breathing was fast rough the raw need clawing through him as urgently as her nails clawed at his back he could feel his blood roaring a tidal wave through his veins his hands bruised her as he rocked her legs back drove deep inside her she screamed a wild savage sound of pleasure her nails raking his back her teeth fixing on his shoulder she could feel him pulsing inside her filling her with each desperate thrust the punch of the orgasm was painful and did nothing to lessen the monstrous need she was wet hot her muscles vising over him like teeth with each pump of hips he couldnt stop couldnt think and plunged again and again like a stud covering a mare in heat he couldnt see her through the red haze that clouded his vision he could only feel her racing with him pistoning her hips her voice buzzed in his ears all whimpers and moans and gasps each sound beat in his blood like a primal chant it shattered without warning beyond his control his body simply peaked like an engine on maximum power battered into hers then erupted the hot wave of release swamped him swallowed him drowned him it was the only time since hed first touched her that he didnt know if she had followed him over the edge he collapsed rolled weakly away to try to find air for his overtaxed lungs in the glowing moonlight they sprawled on the grass sweaty halfdressed shuddering like the lone survivors of a particularly vicious war with a groan she rolled over on her stomach let the grass cool her burning cheeks christ what was that under other circumstances id call it sex but he managed to open his eyes i dont have a word for it did i bite you a few aches were making themselves known as his body recovered he twisted his head glanced at his shoulder and saw the imprint of her teeth someone did i think it was probably you he watched a star fall shooting silver from sky to earth it had been much like that he thought like plunging helplessly to oblivion are you okay i dont know i have to think about it her head was still spinning were on the lawn she said slowly our clothes are torn im pretty sure i have the imprint of your fingers dented into my butt i did my best he murmured she snickered first then chuckled then broke into fits of giddy hiccupping laughter jesus roarke jesus christ look at us in a minute i think im still partially blind but he was grinning as he shifted she was still shaking with laughter her hair stuck up at odd angles her eyes were glassy and there were grass stains as well as bruises on her pretty ass you dont look much like a cop lieutenant she rolled to sit up as he had angled her head you dont look much like a rich guy roarke she tugged on his sleeve it was all that was left of his shirt but its an interesting look how are you going to explain that to summerset ill simply tell him my wife is an animal she snorted hes already decided that for himself blowing out a breath she looked toward the house lights glimmered on the lower level to welcome them home how are we going to get into the house well he found what was left of her shirt tied it around her breasts and made her giggle helplessly they managed to tug on ruined slacks then sat looking at each other i cant carry you to the car he told her i was hoping youd carry me we have to get up first okay neither of them moved the laughter started again continued as they grabbed onto each other like drunks and staggered to their feet leave the car he decided uhhuh they limped off weaving clothes shoes leave them too good plan snickering like children breaking curfew they stumbled up the steps shushing each other as they fell through the door roarke shocked tones rushing feet i knew it eve muttered dourly i just knew it summerset rushed out of the shadows his normally set face alive with shock and worry he saw tattered clothes bruised skin wild eyes was there an accident roarke straightened up kept his arm around eves shoulders as much for balance as support no it was on purpose go to bed summerset eve glanced over her shoulder as she and roarke helped each other up the stairs summerset stood at the base gaping the picture pleased her so much she snickered all the way to the bedroom they fell into bed exactly as they were and slept like babies chapter seven at shortly before eight the next morning a bit sore and fuzzybrained eve sat at her desk in her home office she considered it more of a sanctuary than an office really the apartment roarke had built for her in his home its design was similar to the apartment where she had lived when shed met him which shed been reluctant to give up hed provided it so that she could have her own space her own things even after all the time shed lived there she rarely slept in their bed when he was away instead she curled into the relaxation chair and dozed the nightmares came less often now but crept back at odd moments she could work here when it was convenient lock the doors if she wanted privacy and as it had a fully operational kitchen she often chose her autochef over summerset when she was alone in the house with the sun streaming through the view wall at her back she reviewed her caseload juggled legwork she knew she didnt have the luxury of focusing exclusively on the fitzhugh case particularly since it was earmarked a probable suicide if she didnt turn up hard evidence in the next day or two shed have no choice but to lower its priority at eight sharp there was a brisk knock on the door come on in peabody ill never get used to this place peabody said as she walked inside its like something out of an old video you should get summerset to take you on a tour eve said absently im pretty sure there are rooms ive never seen theres coffee eve gestured toward the kitchen alcove and continued to frown at her logbook peabody wandered off scanning the entertainment units lining the wall wondering what it would be like to be able to afford any amusement available music art video holograms vr meditation chambers games play a set of tennis with the latest wimbeldon champ dance with a hologram of fred astaire or take a virtual trip to the pleasure palaces on regis iii daydreaming a bit she turned into the kitchen the autochef was already programmed for coffee so she ordered two carried the steaming mugs back into the office she waited patiently while eve continued to mutter peabody sipped her coffee god oh god its real blinking in shock she cupped both hands reverently around the mug this coffee is real yeah you get spoiled i can hardly stomach the slop down at cop central anymore eve glanced up caught peabodys dazed expression and grinned it hadnt been so long before that shed had a similar reaction to roarkes coffee and to roarke pretty great huh ive never had real coffee before as if sipping liquid gold and with the depletion of the rain forests and plantations it was equally dear peabody drank slowly its amazing youve got a half hour to od on it while we work out the days strategy i can have more peabody closed her eyes and just inhaled the scent youre a god dallas with a snort eve reached for her beeping link dallas she began then her face lit with a grin feeney hows married life kid its tolerable pretty early in the day for you electronic detectives isnt it got a hot one working a scramble at the chiefs office some joker hacked into his mainframe and nearly fried the whole system they got in her eyes widened in surprise she wasnt sure even feeney with his magic touch could break the security on the chief of police and securitys system looks that way tangled shit all to hell and back im unknotting it he said cheerfully thought id check in see whats what since i havent heard from you i hit the ground running you dont know any other speed you primary on fitzhugh thats right something i should know no smart moneys that he iced himself and nobody around heres too sorry that oil slick loved squeezing cops on the stand funny though second big suicide in a month eves interest spiked second yeah oh thats right you were off honeymooning and making cows eyes he wiggled his bushy red eyebrows senator in east washington a couple weeks ago jumped out the window of the capitol building politicians and lawyers theyre crazy anyway yeah could you get me the data on it when you have the chance transfer it to my office unit what you going to keep a scrapbook just interested the feeling was back in her gut ill pick up the tab next time were in the eatery no problem as soon as i get this system unknotted ill feed it to you dont be a stranger he told her and signed off peabody continued to take miserly sips of coffee you think theres a connection between fitzhugh and the senator who took the dive lawyers and politicians eve murmured and autotronic engineers what eve shook her head i dont know disengage she ordered her unit then swung her bag over her shoulder lets go peabody struggled not to pout about the lack of another cup of coffee two suicides in two different cities in a month isnt such a weird thing she began lengthening her stride to catch up with eve three there was a kid on olympus who hanged himself while we were there mathias drew i want to see if you can find a connection anything that ties them together people places habits education hobbies she rushed down the stairs gearing up i dont know the politicians name i didnt pay attention to the reports on the east washington suicide busily peabody tugged out her personal palm computer and began searching for data mathias was in his early twenties autotronics engineer he worked for roarke shit she had a bad feeling she was going to be forced to drag roarke into her work once again if you run into a snag ask feeney he can pop the data handcuffed and drunk faster than either of us eve wrenched open the door scowled when she didnt see her car at the top of the drive goddamn summerset ive told him to leave my car when i park it i think he did peabody flipped on her sunshades pointed its blocking the drive see oh yeah eve cleared her throat the car was just as shed left it and fluttering in the mild breeze were a few torn articles of clothing dont ask she muttered and started to hoof it down the drive i wasnt going to peabodys voice was smooth as silk speculations more interesting shut up peabody shutting up lieutenant with a smirk peabody climbed in the car and swallowed a laugh when eve swung the vehicle around and cruised down the drive o o arthur foxx was sweating it was subtle just a faint sheen over his top lip but eve found it satisfying she hadnt been surprised to discovered his chosen representative was an associate of fitzhughs a young eager beaver in a pricey suit with trendy medallions decorating the slim lapels my client is understandably upset the lawyer folded his youthful face into somber lines the memorial service for mr fitzhugh is scheduled for one pm this afternoon youve chosen an inappropriate time for this interview death chooses the time mr ridgeway and its usually inappropriate interview with authur foxx re fitzhugh case number three oh oh nine oneasd conducted by dallas lieutenant eve date august time oh nine thirtysix will you state your name for the record arthur foxx mr foxx you are aware that this interview is being recorded i am you have exercised your right to counsel and understand your additional rights and responsibilities thats correct mr foxx you gave an earlier statement regarding your activities on the night of mr fitzhughs death do you wish to view a replay of that statement its not necessary i told you what happened i dont know what else you expect me to tell you to begin tell me where you were between twentytwo thirty and twentythree hundred on the night of the incident ive already told you we had dinner we watched a comedy we went to bed and caught a bit of the late news you remained at home all evening thats what ive said yes mr foxx thats what youve said on record but thats not what you did lieutenant my client is here voluntarily i see no save it she suggested you left the building at approximately ten thirty pm and returned some thirty minutes later where did you go i foxx tugged at the silver string of his tie i stepped out for a few minutes id forgotten youd forgotten my mind was confused i was in shock his tie made wispy sounds as his fingers worked over it i didnt remember something as unimportant as taking a quick walk but you remember now where did you go just for a walk around the block a few times you returned with a parcel what was in it she saw the moment he realized the security cameras had nailed him his gaze shifted past her and the fingers on his tie became busier i stopped into a picked up a few things veggiesmokes i have the urge for one occasionally its a simple matter to check with the and determine exactly what you purchased some tranqs he spit out i wanted to tranq out for the night i wanted a smoke theres no law against it no but there is a law against giving false statements in a police investigation lieutenant dallas the lawyers voice was still smooth but a bit frayed around the edges with annoyance it gave eve the clue that foxx had been no more forthcoming with his representative than he had with the police the fact that mr foxx left the premises for a short time is hardly germane to your investigation and discovering a loved ones body is a more than reasonable excuse for neglecting to remember a minor detail one minor detail maybe you didnt mention mr foxx that you and mr fitzhugh had a visitor on the evening of his death leanore is hardly a visitor foxx said stiffly she is was fitzs partner i believe they had some business to discuss which is another reason i went for a walk i wanted to give them a few moments of privacy to discuss the case he took a shallow breath i generally found that more convenient for everyone i see so now your statement is that you left the apartment in order to provide your spouse and his partner with privacy why didnt you mention ms bastwicks visit in your earlier statement i didnt think of it you didnt think of it you stated that you ate dinner watched a comedy and went to bed but you neglected to add in these other events what other events have you neglected to tell me mr foxx i have nothing more to say why were you angry when you left the building mr foxx did it annoy you to have a beautiful woman a woman with whom mr fitzhugh works closely drop by your home so late in the evening lieutenant you have no right to imply she barely spared the lawyer a glance im not implying counselor im asking in a very straightforward manner if mr foxx was angry and jealous when he stormed out of his building i did not storm i walked foxx fisted a hand on the table and i had absolutely no reason to be angry or jealous of leanore however often she chose to throw herself at fitz he was completely disinterested in her on that level ms bastwick threw herself at mr fitzhugh eve lifted her brows that must have ticked you off arthur knowing that your spouse had no sexual preference between women or men knowing they were together hours every day during the work week having her come by flaunt herself in front of him in your own home no wonder you were angry id have wanted to deck her he thought it was amusing foxx blurted out he was actually flattered to have someone so much younger and so attractive playing for him he laughed when i complained about her he laughed at you eve knew how to play the game sympathy dripped in her voice that must have infuriated you it did didnt it it ate at you didnt it arthur imagining them together him touching her and laughing at you i could have murdered her foxx exploded with it batting away his lawyers restraining hands as fury spurted color into his face she thought she could lure him away from me make him want her she didnt give a damn that we were married that we were committed to each other all she wanted to do was win fucking lawyer you dont care much for lawyers do you his breath was shuddering he caught it let it shudder out until it was even again no as a rule i dont i didnt think of fitz as a lawyer i thought of him as my spouse and if id been disposed to committing murder that night or any other lieutenant i would have murdered leanore he unfisted his hands folded them together now i have nothing more to say gauging it to be enough for the time being eve terminated the interview rose well be talking again mr foxx id like to know when youre going to release fitzs body he said getting stiffly to his feet ive decided not to postpone the service today though it feels unseemly to go on with it with his body still being held thats the decision of the medical examiner his tests are still incomplete isnt it enough that hes dead foxxs voice trembled isnt it enough that he killed himself without you dragging it out pulling out the small and sordid personal details of our lives no she walked to the door released the code no its not she hesitated decided to take a stab in the dark i imagine mr fitzhugh was very shocked and very upset by the recent suicide of senator pearly foxx only jerked his head in a formal nod he was shocked certainly though they barely knew each other then a muscle jerked in his cheek if youre implying that fitz took his own life because he was influenced by pearly its ridiculous they had no more than a slight acquaintance they rarely communicated i see thank you for your time she ushered them out glanced down the corridor to the adjoining interview room leanore should certainly be inside by now waiting taking her time eve strolled down the corridor to a vending unit contemplated her choices jingled loose credits in her pocket she settled on a chewy bar and a half tube of pepsi the unit delivered the goods droned out the standard request to recycle and offered the consumer a mild warning on sugar intake mind your own business eve suggested leaning back against the wall she lingered over her snack dumped the trash into the recycle chute then walked leisurely down the hall shed estimated the twentyminute wait would steam leanore she was right on target the woman was pacing like a cat elegant legs eating up the worn flooring with quick steps the minute eve opened the door she whirled lieutenant dallas my time is extremely valuable even if yours is not depends on how you look at it eve said easily i dont get to log in billable hours at two k a pop peabody cleared her throat for the record lieutenant eve dallas has entered interview room c to conduct the remainder of the proceedings the subject has been informed of all rights and has chosen selfrepresentation during this interview all data has been logged in record fine eve sat indicated the chair across from her whenever youve finished prowling ms bastwick we can get started i was ready to begin this procedure at the appropriate time leanore sat crossed her satiny legs with you lieutenant not your subordinate hear that peabody youre my subordinate duly recorded sir peabody said dryly though i consider it insulting and unnecessary leanore brushed at the cuffs of her trim black suit im attending fitzs memorial in a few hours you wouldnt be here being unnecessarily insulted if you hadnt lied in your previous statement leanores eyes went glacial i assume you can substantiate that accusation lieutenant you stated for the record that you had gone to the deceaseds residence last evening on a professional matter that you remained discussing a case for twenty to thirty minutes more or less leanore said her voice frosty around the edges tell me ms bastwick do you always take a bottle of vintage wine to a business meeting and groom yourself for said meeting in the elevator like a prom queen theres no law against good grooming lieutenant dallas her gaze flicked dismissively over eves untidy hair down to her battered boots you might try it yourself aw now youve hurt my feelings you polished yourself up flicked open the top three buttons of your blouse and brought along a bottle of wine sounds like seduction time to me leanore eve shifted closer nearly winked come on were all girls we know the drill leanore took her time studied a minute chip in her manicure she remained icy unlike foxx the woman didnt break a sweat i dropped by that evening to consult with fitz on a professional matter we had a brief meeting and i left you were alone with him during that time thats right arthur got into one of his snits and went out one of his snits it was typical of him there was a sneer in her voice now light and disdainful he was outrageously jealous of me certain i was trying to lure fitz away from him and were you a slow feline smile curved leanores lips really lieutenant if id put any effort into it dont you think i would have succeeded id say you put effort into it and not succeeding would have really burned you leanore lifted a shoulder ill admit i was giving it some consideration fitz was wasting himself on arthur fitz and i had a great deal in common and i found him very attractive i was very fond of him did you act on your attraction and your fondness that evening you could say i made it clear that i was open to a more intimate relationship with him he wasnt immediately receptive but it was only a matter of time she moved her shoulders a quick confident movement arthur would have known that her eyes went cold again and thats why i believe he killed fitz o o quite a piece of work isnt she eve muttered when the interview was completed doesnt see anything wrong with trying to lure a man into adultery break apart a longstanding relationship more shes convinced there isnt a man in the world who could resist her she sighed heavily bitch are you going to charge her peabody wondered for being a bitch with a small smile eve shook her head i could try to nail her on the false statement and she and her legal pals would brush it off like lint not worth the time we cant place her at the scene at time of death or hang any kind of motive on her and i cant see that selfabsorbed bimbo sneaking up on a two hundred fifty pound man and slashing his wrists she wouldnt have wanted to get all that blood on her nifty suit so youre back to foxx he was jealous he was pissed he inherits all the toys eve rose paced to the door and back and weve got nothing she pressed her fingers to her eyes ive got to go with what he said when he lost it during interview hed have killed leanore not fitzhugh im going to review the data on the two previous suicides i havent got much yet peabody began as she followed eve out of the interview room there wasnt time theres time now and feeneys probably come through get me what youve got then get me more eve demanded and swung into her office engage she ordered the computer as she plopped down in front of it play new communications roarkes face swam onto the screen i assume youre out fighting crime im on my way to london a little glitch that requires personal attention i dont imagine it will take long i should be back by eight which will give us plenty of time to fly out to new los angeles for the premiere shit i forgot on screen his image smiled im sure youve conveniently forgotten the engagement so consider this a gentle reminder take care of yourself lieutenant flying to california to spend the evening rubbing elbows with puffedup video types eating the glossy little vegetables people out there considered food tolerating reporters sticking recorders in her face and asking lame questions was not her idea of an entertaining evening the second communication was from commander whitney ordering her to prepare a statement for the media on several ongoing cases hot damn she thought sourly more headlines then the data from feeney flashed on screen eve rolled her shoulders hunkered down and got to work at two she walked into the village bistro her shirt was sticking to her back as the temperature control on her unit had once again died an unnatural death the air inside the tony restaurant was ocean breeze cool soft loving zephyrs flitted through teasing the feathery palms which grew in huge white china pots glass tables were arranged on two levels cleverly situated near a small black water lagoon or in front of a wideview screen of a white sand beach servers wore short uniforms in tropical hues and threaded their way through the tables with offerings of colorful drinks and artistically arranged dishes the maitre d was a droid dressed in a flowing white jumpsuit and programmed with a snooty french accent he took one look at eves worn jeans and limp shirt and wrinkled his prominent nose madam i am afraid we have no tables available you would perhaps prefer the delicatessen on the next block north yeah i would because his attitude annoyed her she stuck her badge in his face but im eating here i dont give a shit if that puts your chips in a twist pal wheres dr miras table put that away he hissed looking everywhere at once and fluttering his hands do you wish my customers to lose their appetites theyll really lose them if i take my weapon out which is what ill do if you dont show me dr miras table and see that ive got a glass of iced fizzy water in the next twenty seconds got that program his lips clamped together and he nodded stiffbacked he led the way up a swing of faux stone steps to the second level and then onto an alcove fashioned to resemble an ocean terrace eve mira rose immediately from her pretty table and took both of eves hands you look wonderful to eves faint surprise mira kissed her cheek rested happy i guess i am after a brief hesitation eve leaned forward and touched her lips to miras cheek in turn the droid had already snapped to a server dr miras companion wishes a fizzy water iced eve added curling her lip at the maitre d thank you armand miras soft blue eyes twinkled well order shortly eve took another quick scan of the restaurant the diners in their summer pastels and pricey cottons she shifted on her padded chair we could have met in your office i wanted to take you to lunch this is one of my favorite spots the droids an asshole well perhaps armand is a bit overprogrammed but the food is wonderful you should try the clams maurice you wont regret it she settled back when eves water was served tell me how was your honeymoon eve gulped down half the water and felt human again tell me how long i can expect people to ask me that question mira laughed she was a pretty woman with soft sable hair swept back from a quietly attractive face she wore one of her habitually elegant suits this one in pale yellow she appeared polished and tidy she was one of the leading behavioral psychiatrists in the country and was often consulted by the police about the most vicious crimes though eve was unaware of it miras feelings toward her were strong and deeply maternal it embarrasses you well you know honeymoon sex personal eve rolled her eyes stupid i guess im just not used it to being married to roarke to the whole business you love each other and make each other happy theres no need to get used to it only to enjoy it youre sleeping well mostly and because mira knew her deepest and darkest secrets eve dropped her guard i still have nightmares but not as often the memories come and go none of its as bad now that ive dealt with it have you dealt with it my father raped me abused me beat me eve said flatly i killed him i was eight years old i survived whoever i was before i was found in that alley doesnt matter now im eve dallas im a good cop ive made myself good there would be more mira thought traumas such as the one eve had lived through cast echoes that never completely faded you still put the cop first i am a cop first yes mira smiled a little i suppose you always will be why dont we order then you can tell me why you called chapter eight eve chose miras recommendation of clams then treated herself to some of the real yeast bread set in a silver basket on the table as she ate she gave mira a profile of fitzhugh and the details of his death youd like me to tell you if he was capable of taking his own life disposed to it emotionally psychologically eve cocked a brow thats the plan unfortunately i cant do that i can tell you that everyone is capable of it given the right circumstances and emotional state i dont believe that eve said so firmly so decisively that mira smiled youre a strong woman eve now youve made yourself strong rational toughminded youre a survivor but you remember despair helplessness hopelessness eve did too well too clearly she shifted in her chair fitzhugh wasnt a helpless man the surface can hide a great deal of turmoil dr mira held up a hand before eve could interrupt again but i agree with you given your profile of him his background his lifestyle i wouldnt tag him as a likely candidate for suicide certainly not one of such an abrupt and impulsive nature it was abrupt eve agreed i dealt with him in court right before this happened he was as smug and arrogant and full of his own sense of importance as ever im sure thats true i can only say that some of us many of us confronted with some crisis some personal upheaval of the heart or mind choose to end it rather than live through it or change it you and i cant know what fitzhugh might have found himself confronted with on the night of his death that isnt a hell of a lot of help eve muttered okay let me give you two more briskly with a cops dispassion she related the other suicides pattern what did they have in common mira tossed back the lawyer the politician and the tech a blip in the brain maybe tapping her fingers on the cloth eve frowned ive got some chains to pull to get all the data but it could be the motive the reason behind it all might be physiological rather than psychological if theres a connection ive got to find it youre veering out of my field but if you find data linking the three cases id be happy to do a workup eve smiled i was counting on it i dont have a lot of time the fitzhugh case cant stay a priority for much longer if i cant nail something down soon and use it to convince the commander to keep the file open ill have to move on but for now eve reeanna slipped up to the table looking stunning in an ankleskimming robe of bleeding rainbow colors well how nice i was lunching with an associate and thought i recognized you reeanna eve worked up a smile she didnt mind looking like a street hawker next to the glamorous redhead but she did mind having her consult lunch interrupted dr mira reeanna ott dr ott gracious mira offered a hand ive heard of your work and admired it thank you and ill say the same its an honor to meet one of the top psychiatrists in the country ive scanned a number of your papers and found them fascinating you flatter me wont you sit down join us for some dessert id love to reeanna flicked a questioning glance at eve if im not interrupting official business we seem to be finished with that part of the program eve looked up at the waiter summoned by a discreet flick of miras finger just coffee house brand black ill have the same mira said and a dish of the blueberry trifle im weak so am i reeanna beamed at the waiter as though he would personally prepare her selection a double latte and a slice of chocolate sin im so tired of processed food she confided to mira i intend to gorge myself while im in new york and how long will you be in town it depends a great deal on roarke she smiled at eve and how long he finds it useful to have me here i have a feeling hell be shipping both william and me off to olympus within a few weeks the olympus resorts quite an undertaking mira commented all the blips ive seen on the news and entertainment channels have been fascinating hed like to have it up and fully operational by next spring reeanna ran her hand up and down the trio of gold links she wore around her neck well see roarke usually gets what he wants wouldnt you agree eve he didnt get where he is by taking no for an answer no indeed you were just on the resort did he give you a tour of the autotronics arcade briefly eves lips quirked a little we had a lot of ground to cover in a short time reeannas smile was slow and sly i imagine you did but i hope you tried a few of the programs that are in place williams so proud of those games and you did mention youd seen the hologram room in the presidential suite of the hotel i did made use of it several times very impressive most of thats williams doing the design but i will take partial credit we plan to utilize that new system to enhance the treatment of addicts and certain psychoses she shifted as their coffee and dessert was served that might be of interest to you dr mira it certainly would it sounds fascinating it is wickedly expensive right now but we hope to refine and bring the cost down but for olympus roarke wanted the best and hes getting it such as the lisa droid yeah eve remembered the stunning female droid with the sultry voice ive seen her shell be in pr and customer service a very superior model that took months to perfect her intelligence chips are unmatched by anything on the market shell have decision making and personality capabilities well beyond the current available units william and i she broke off chuckled at herself listen to me i just cant get away from work its fascinating mira dipped delicately into her trifle your study of brain patterns and their genetic thrust on personality and their application to electronics is compelling even to a duginattheroots psychiatrist such as myself she hesitated glanced at eve as a matter of fact your expertise might lend a new angle on a particular case eve and i were discussing oh reeanna forked up some chocolate and all but hummed over it hypothetical mira spread her hands well aware of the official ban of layman consults naturally eve drummed her fingers on the table again she preferred miras take but weighing the options decided to expand apparent selftermination no known motive no known predisposition no chemical inducement no family history behavioral patterns up to point of termination normal no substantiated signs of depression or personality fluctuations subject is a sixtytwoyearold male professional highend education successful financially solvent bisexual with longterm samesex marriage physical disabilities none clean health card reeannas eyes narrowed in concentration either over the profile or the dessert she was slowly spooning into her mouth any psychological defects treatment no interesting id love to see the brain wave pattern available currently classified hmm reeanna sipped her latte contemplatively without any known physical or psychiatric abnormalities no chemical addictions or usage id lean toward a brain blip possible tumor yet i assume none showed up in autopsy eve thought of the pinprick but shook her head not a tumor no there are cases of predisposition that slide through genetic scanning and evaluation the brain is a complicated organ and still baffles even the most elaborate technology if i could see his family history well to take a wild guess id say your man had a genetic time bomb that went undetected through normal analysis hed reached the point in his life where the fuse ran short eve cocked a brow so he just blew in a manner of speaking reeanna leaned forward were all coded in eve in the womb what we are who we are not just the color of our eyes our build our skin tones but our personalities our tastes our intellect and our emotional scale the genetic code is stamped on us at the moment of conception it can be altered to a certain extent but the basis of what we are remains nothing can change it we are what were born eve thought of a filthy room a blinking red light and a young girl curled into a corner with a bloody knife precisely reeannas smile beamed out you dont take into account environment free will the basic human drive to better oneself mira objected to consider us merely physical creatures without heart soul and a range of choices to be made over a lifetime lowers us to the level of animals and so we are reeanna said with a sweep of her fork i understand your viewpoint as a therapist dr mira but mine as a physiologist runs down a different lane so to speak the decisions we make throughout our life what we do how we live and what we become were printed on our brains while we swam in the womb your subject eve was fated to take his life at that time in that place and in the manner he chose circumstances might have altered it but the results would have been the same eventually it was in essence his destiny destiny eve thought had it been hers to be raped and abused by her own father to become less than human to fight her way through that abyss mira shook her head slowly i cant agree a child born in poverty on the edge of budapest taken from the mother at birth and raised in privilege with love and care in paris would reflect that upbringing that education the emotional nest she insisted and the basic human drive to better oneself cant be discounted i agree to a point reeanna qualified but the stamp of the genetic code that which predisposes us to achievement failure good or evil if you will overrides all else even with the most loving and nurturing of backgrounds monsters breed and in the toilets of the universe goodness even greatness survives we are what we are the rest is window dressing if i subscribe to your theory eve said slowly the subject in question was fated to take his life no circumstances no twists or turns of environment would have prevented it precisely the predisposition was there lurking likely an event set it off but it may have been a minor thing something easily passed off in another brain pattern research still under way at the bowers institute has complied strong evidence of genetic brain patterns and their unassailable influence on behavior i can get you discs on the subject if you like ill leave the head studies to you and dr mira eve shoved her coffee aside ive got to get back to cop central i appreciate the time dr mira she said as she rose and the theories reeanna id love to discuss them further any time reeanna lifted a hand and shook eves warmly do give my best to roarke i will eve shifted slightly on her feet when mira rose to kiss her cheek ill be in touch i hope you will and not just when youve a case to discuss tell mavis hello for me when you see her sure hitching her bag on her shoulder eve swung her way out pausing briefly to sneer at the maitre d a fascinating woman reeanna slid her tongue in one long slow lick over the back of her spoon controlled a little angry underneath straight focused and unused and vaguely uncomfortable with casual displays of affection she laughed lightly at miras lifted brow sorry professional pitfall it drives william mad i didnt mean any offense im sure you didnt miras lips curved and her eyes warmed with understanding i often find myself doing the same and youre right eve is a very fascinating woman quite selfmade which im afraid might unbalance your genetic printing theory really obviously intrigued reeanna leaned forward you know her well as well as possible eve is a contained individual youre very fond of her reeanna commented with a nod i hope you wont take it the wrong way if i say she wasnt at all what i expected when i learned roarke was to marry that he was to marry at all was a surprise but i imagined his spouse as a woman of polish and sophistication a homicide detective who wears her shoulder harness as another woman might an heirloom necklace wasnt my conception of roarkes choice yet they look right together suited one might even say she added with a smile destined that i can agree with now tell me dr mira what is your opinion of dna harvesting oh well now happily mira settled down for a lively busmans holiday o o at her desk unit eve juggled the data shed compiled on fitzhugh mathias and pearly she could find no link no common ground the only real correlation between the three was the fact that none of them had exhibited any suicidal tendencies before the fact probability the subject cases are related eve demanded working probability five point two percent in other words zip eve blew out a breath scowling automatically when an airbus rumbled by rattling her stingy window probability of homicide in the matter of fitzhugh using currently known data with currently known data probability of homicide is eight point three percent give it up dallas she told herself in a mutter let it go deliberately she swiveled in her chair watching the air traffic clog the sky outside her window predestination fate genetic imprint if she were to believe in any of that what was the point of her job or her life for that matter if there was no choice no changing why struggle to save lives or stand for the dead when the struggle failed if it was all physiologically coded had she simply followed the pattern by coming to new york fighting her way out of the dark to make something decent out of herself and had it been a smear on that code that had blocked out those early years of her life that continued to shadow bits and pieces of it even now and could that code kick in at any given moment and make her a reflection of the monster who had been her father she knew nothing of her other blood kin her mother was a blank if she had siblings aunts uncles or grandparents they were all lost in that dark void in her memory she had no one to base her genetic code on but the man who had beaten and raped her throughout childhood until in terror and pain she had struck back and killed blood on her hands at eight years of age is that why shed become a cop was she constantly trying to wash away that blood with rules and law and what some still called justice sir dallas peabody laid a hand on eves shoulder and jumped when eve jolted sorry are you all right no eve pressed her fingers to her eyes the discussion over dessert had troubled her more than shed realized just a headache ive got some departmentalissue painkillers no eve was afraid of drugs even officially sanctioned doses itll back off im running out of ideas on the fitzhugh case feeney fed me all known data on the kid on olympus i cant find any correlation between him and fitzhugh or the senator ive got nothing but piddly shit to hang on leanore and arthur i can request truth detection but i wont get it im not going to be able to keep it open more than another twentyfour hours you still think theyre connected i want them to be connected and thats a different thing i havent exactly given you an impressive lift off with your first assignment as my permanent aide being your permanent aide is the best thing that ever happened to me peabody flushed a little id be grateful if we got stuck shoveling through inactives for the next six months youd still be training me eve leaned back in her chair youre easily satisfied peabody peabody shifted her gaze until her eyes met eves no sir im not when i dont get the best i get real cranky eve laughed dragged a hand through her hair you sucking up officer no sir if i was sucking up id make some personal observation such as marriage obviously agrees with you lieutenant youve never looked lovelier peabody smiled a little when eve snorted thats how youd know i was sucking up so noted eve considered a moment then cocked her head didnt you tell me your family are freeagers peabody didnt roll her eyes but she wanted to yes sir cops dont usually spring from freeagers artists farmers the occasional scientist lots of craft workers i didnt like weaving mats can you if held at laser point so what your family pissed you off and you decided to break the mold go into a field dramatically removed from pacifism no sir puzzled at the line of questioning peabody shrugged my familys great were still pretty tight theyre not going to understand what i do or want to do but they never tried to block me i just wanted to be a cop the same way my brother wanted to be a carpenter and my sister a farmer one of the strongest tenets of freeageism is selfexpression but you dont fit the genetic code eve muttered and drummed her fingers on her desk you dont fit heredity and environment gene patterns they all should have influenced you differently the bad guys wished i had been peabody said soberly but im here keeping our city safe if you get an urge to weave a mat youll be the first to know eves unit beeped twice signaling incoming data additional autopsy report on the kid eve gestured for peabody to come closer list any abnormal brain pattern she ordered microscopic abnormality right cerebral hemisphere frontal lobe left quadrant unexplained further research and testing under way well well i think we just caught a break display visual of frontal lobe and abnormality the cross section of the brain popped on screen there a quick surge of excitement churned in her belly as eve tapped the screen that shadow pinprick see it barely peabody leaned closer until she was all but cheek to cheek with eve looks like a flaw on the display no a flaw in the brain increase quadrant six twenty percent the picture shifted and the section with the shadow filled the screen more of a burn than a hole isnt it eve said half to herself hardly there but what kind of damage what kind of influence would it have on behavior personality decision making i pretty well dumped my required abnormal physiology at the academy peabody moved her sturdy shoulders i did better in psych better yet in tactics this is over my head mine too eve admitted but its a link our first one computer cross section of brain abnormality fitzhugh file one two eight seven one split screen with current display the screen jittered went to fuzzy gray eve swore smacked it with the heel of her hand and bumped out a shaky image blurred across the center son of a bitch son of a bitch this cheap shit we have to use around here its a wonder we can close a case on jaywalking download all data you bastard on disc maybe if you sent this unit into maintenance peabody suggested and received a snarl it was supposed to be overhauled while i was away the fuckers in maintenance have their fingers up their butts im going to run this through one of roarkes units she caught peabodys lifted brow and tapped her foot as she waited for the wheezy machine to download you got a problem with that officer no sir peabody tucked her tongue in her cheek and decided against mentioning the series of codes eve was about to break no problem here fine get to work on the red tape and get me the brain scan of the senator for comparison peabodys smug little smile fell away you want me to bump heads with east washington your heads hard enough to handle it eve ejected the disc and pocketed it call me when you get it the minute you get it yes sir if we get a link there were going to need an expert analyst yeah eve thought of reeanna i might just have one get moving peabody moving lieutenant chapter nine eve wasnt one for breaking rules yet she found herself standing outside the locked door of roarkes private room it was disconcerting to realize that after a decade of going by the book she could find it so easy to circumvent procedure do the ends justify the means she wondered and are the means really so out of line maybe the equipment in the room beyond was unregistered and undetectable to compuguard and therefore illegal but it was also top of the line the pathetic electronics budgeted to the police and security department had been antiquated nearly before it was installed and homicides slice of the budget pie was stingy and stale she tapped her fingers on her pocket where the disc rested and shifted her feet the hell with it she decided she could be a lawabiding cop and walk away or she could be a smart one she placed her hand on the security screen dallas lieutenant eve the locks disengaged with a quiet snick and opened into roarkes huge data center the long curve of windows which were shielded against sun and flybys kept the room in shadows she ordered lights secured the door and walked over to face the wide ushaped console roarke had programmed her palm and voice print into the system months before but shed never used the equipment alone even now that they were married she felt like an intruder she made herself sit snugged the chair into the console unit one engage she heard the silky hum of highlevel equipment responding and nearly sighed her disc slid in smoothly and within seconds had been decoded and read by the civilian unit and so much for our elaborate security at nypsd she muttered wall screen on full display data fitzhugh file hone two eight seven one split screen with mathias file sthree oh nine one two data flowed like water onto the huge wall screen facing the console in her admiration eve forgot to feel guilty she leaned forward scanning birth dates credit ratings purchasing habits political affiliations strangers she said to herself you couldnt have had less in common then her lips pursed as she noted correlations on a section of purchasing habits well you both liked games lots of online time lots of entertainment and interactive programs then she sighed along with about seventy percent of the population computer split screen display brain scan both loaded files with an almost seamless segue eve was studying the images increase and highlight unexplained abnormalities the same she mused eyes narrowed here the two men were the same like brothers twins in the womb the burn shadow was precisely the same size and shape in precisely the same location computer analyze abnormality and identify working incomplete data searching medical files please wait for analysis thats what they all say she pushed away from the console to pace while the computer juggled its brain when the door opened she spun around on her heel and very nearly flushed when roarke walked in hello lieutenant hi she dipped her hands in her pockets i ah had some trouble with my unit at cop central i needed this analysis so i i can put a hold on it if you need the room no need for that her obvious discomfort amused him he strolled to her leaned down and kissed her lightly and no need for you to fumble through an explanation as to why youre using the equipment digging for secrets no not the way you mean the fact that he was grinning at her increased the embarrassment level i needed something a little more competent than the tin cans we have at cop central and i figured youd be gone for a couple more hours i got an early transport back need some help with this no i dont know maybe stop grinning at me was i his grin only widened as he slid his arms around her and tucked his hands in the back pockets of her jeans how was your lunch with dr mira she scowled do you know everything i try actually i had a quick meeting with william and he mentioned that reeanna had run into you and the doctor business or pleasure both i guess her brows lifted as his hands got busy on her butt im on duty roarke your hands are currently rubbing the ass of a working cop that only makes it more exciting he shifted to nibble her neck want to break a few laws i already am but she turned her head instinctively to give him better access then what are a few more he murmured and slid his hand out of her pocket and around her body to cup her breast i love the feel of you his mouth was trailing along her jawline toward her mouth when the computer beeped analysis complete display or audio display eve ordered and wiggled free damn roarke sighed i was so close what the hell is this hands fisted on her hips eve scanned the display on the view screen its gibberish fucking gibberish resigned roarke sat on the edge of the console and studied the display himself its technical medical terms primarily a bit out of my realm a burn electronic in origin does that make sense i dont know thoughtfully she tugged on her ear does it make sense for a couple of dead guys to have an electric burn hole in the frontal lobe of their brains some fumbling with the equipment during autopsy roarke suggested no slowly she shook her head not on two of them examined by different mes in different morgues and theyre not surface flaws theyre inside the brain microscopic pinpricks whats the relationship between the two men none absolutely none she hesitated then shrugged he was already involved in a peripheral manner why not drag him into the center one of the men is yours she told him the autotronics engineer from the olympus resort mathias roarke pushed off the console his halfamused halfintrigued expression going dark why are you investigating a suicide on olympus im not officially its a hunch thats all the other brain your fancy equipments analyzing is fitzhughs and if peabody can untangle the red tape ill plug in senator pearlys and you expect to find this microscopic burn in the senators brain youre a quick study roarke ive always admired that about you why because its annoying to have to explain everything step by step his eyes narrowed eve all right she held up her hands let them fall fitzhugh just didnt strike me as the type to do himself i couldnt close the case until id explored all the options ive been running out of options i might have put it to bed anyway but i kept thinking about that kid hanging himself she began to pace restlessly no predisposition there either no obvious motive no known enemies he just has himself a snack and makes a noose then i heard about the senator that makes three suicides without logical explanations now for people like fitzhugh and the senator with their kind of financial base theres counseling at the snap of a finger or in cases of terminal illness physical or emotional voluntary selftermination facilities but they took themselves out in bloody and painful ways doesnt fit roarke nodded go on and the me on fitzhugh came up with this unexplained abnormality i wanted to see if on the off chance the kid had anything like it she gestured to the screen he does now i need to know what put it there roarke shifted his eyes back to the screen genetic flaw possibly but the computer says unlikely at least its never come across anything like it before through heredity mutation or outside causes she moved behind the console scrolled the screen see there in the projection of possible mental affects behavioral alterations pattern unknown a lot of help that is she rubbed her eyes thought it through but that says to me that the subject could and likely would behave out of pattern suicide would be out of pattern for these two men true enough roarke agreed leaning back against the console he crossed his legs at the ankles but so would dancing naked in church or kicking elderly matrons off a sky walk why did they both choose selftermination thats the question isnt it but this gives me enough once i figure out how to spin it to whitney to keep both cases open download data to disc print hard copy she ordered then turned to roarke ive got a few minutes now his brow quirked a habitual gesture she secretly adored do you which laws did you have in mind to break several actually he glanced at his watch as she stepped forward to unbutton his elegant linen shirt we have a premiere in california tonight her fingers stopped her face fell tonight but i think we have time for a few misdemeanors first with a laugh he scooped her off her feet and laid her back on the console o o eve was tugging on a floorlength sirenred sheath and complaining bitterly about the impossibility of wearing so much as a scrap of underwear under the clinging material when her communicator beeped naked to the waist with the flimsy bodice hanging to her knees she pounced peabody sir several expressions passed over peabodys face before it went carefully blank thats a lovely dress lieutenant are you premiering a new style baffled eve looked down then rolled her eyes shit youve seen my tits before but she set the communicator down and struggled the bodice into place and may i say sir theyre quite lovely sucking up peabody you bet eve stifled a chuckle and sat on the edge of the sofa in the dressing room report yes sir i ah noting that peabodys eyes had shifted and glazed over eve glanced over her shoulder roarke had just walked into the room damp from his shower tiny beads of water glistening on his bare chest a white towel barely hitched at his hips stay out of view will you roarke before my aide goes brain dead he looked toward the communicator screen grinned peabody hello hi even over the unit her swallow was audible nice to see you i mean how are you very well and you what roarke eve heaved a sigh give peabody a break will you or ill have to block video you dont have to do that lieutenant voice rusty peabody deflated as roarke slipped out of view jesus she said under her breath and grinned foolishly at eve settle your hormones peabody and report settling sir she cleared her throat ive untangled most of the bureaucratic tape lieutenant just a couple more snags at this juncture we should have the requested data by oh nine hundred but we have to go to east washington to view it i was afraid of that all right peabody well catch the shuttle at oh eight hundred dont be foolish roarke said from behind her while he critically studied the lines of the dinner jacket he held take my transport its police business no reason to squeeze yourselves into a tuna can traveling in comfort doesnt make it less official in any case ive some business i can see to in east washington myself ill take you he leaned over eves shoulder smiled at peabody ill have a car sent for you seventy fortyfive is that convenient sure she wasnt even disappointed that he was now wearing a shirt great listen roarke sorry peabody he cut eve off smoothly were running a bit late here see you in the morning reaching over he manually disengaged the communicator you know it really pisses me off when you do that kind of thing i know roarke said equably thats why its irresistible o o ive spent half my life on one sort of transport or another since i met you eve grumbled as she settled into her seat in roarkes private jet star still cranky he observed and signaled the flight attendant my wife needs another dose of coffee and ill join her right away sir she slipped into the galley with silent efficiency you really get a bang out of saying that dont you my wife i do yes roarke tipped her face up with a fingertip and kissed the shallow dent in her chin you didnt sleep enough he murmured rubbing his thumb under her eye you so rarely turn off that busy brain of yours he flicked a glance up at the flight attendant as she set steaming coffee on the table in front of them thank you karen well take off as soon as officer peabody arrives ill inform the pilot sir enjoy your flight you dont really have to go to east washington do you i could have handled it from new york he shrugged lifted his coffee personal attention always has more impact and i have the added benefit of watching you work i dont want you involved in this you never do he lifted her cup handed it to her with an easy smile however lieutenant im involved with you and therefore you cant shut me out you mean you wont be shut out precisely ah heres the redoubtable peabody now she came aboard pressed and polished but spoiling the effect with her jaw hanging open as she swiveled her head right and left in an attempt to see everything at once the cabin was as plush and sumptuous as a fivestar hotel with deep cushy seats and gleaming tables the glint of crystal holding flowers so fresh they gleamed with dew stop gaping peabody you look like a trout nearly finished lieutenant dont mind her peabody she woke up surly roarke rose disconcerting peabody until she realized he was offering her a seat would you care for coffee well ah sure thanks ill fetch it and leave you two to discuss your work dallas this is ultra its just roarke eve muttered into her coffee yeah like i said ultra eve glanced up as he came in with more coffee dark and gorgeous and just a bit wicked she thought yeah she supposed ultra was the word all right well strap in peabody and enjoy the ride the takeoff was smooth and the trip was short providing peabody with just enough time to fill eve in on the details they were to report to the office of the chief of security for government employees all data would be viewed in house and nothing could be transferred or transported fucking politics eve complained as they jumped into a cab who are they protecting for christs sake the mans dead standard cya procedure and there are always plenty of asses to cover in east washington fat asses eve eyed peabody consideringly been to east washington before once when i was a kid peabody moved her shoulders with my family the freeagers staged a silent protest against artificial insemination of cattle eve didnt bother to muffle a snort youre full of surprises peabody since you havent been here in a while you may want to take in the scenery check out the memorials she gestured as they whizzed by the lincoln memorial and its throng of tourists and street hawkers ive seen plenty of videos peabody began but eve lifted her brows check out the scenery peabody consider it an order sir with what on another face might have been considered a pout peabody turned her head eve nipped a card recorder out of her bag and tucked it under her shirt she doubted security was so tight it would involve x rays or a strip search and if it did shed simply claim she always carried her spare on her person eve flipped a glance at the driver but the droid had her eyes bland and on the road not a bad town for sightseeing eve commented as they veered onto the vehicle bypass of the white house where the old mansion could just be seen through reinforced gates and steel bunkers peabody swiveled her head looked dead into eves eyes you can trust me lieutenant i thought you knew that its not a matter of trust because she heard the hurt in peabodys voice eve spoke gently its a matter of not being willing to put anyones ass but my own in a sling if were partners were not partners eve inclined her head and there was authority in her tone now yet youre my aide and youre in training as your superior i decide how far your butt sticks out in the wind yes sir peabody said stiffly and made eve sigh dont get your briefs in a twist peabody therell come a time when ill let you take your lumps with the commander and believe me hes got a hell of a punch the cab pulled over to the curb outside the gates of the security building eve shoved credits through the safety slot climbed out and approached the view screen she placed her palm on the plate slipped her badge into the identification slot and waited for peabody to mirror the procedure dallas lieutenant eve and aide appointment with chief dudley one moment for verification authorization confirmed please place all weapons in holding bin warning it is a federal offense to bring any weapons into the facility any individual entering with a weapon in his or her possession will be detained eve slipped her police issue out of her holster then with some regret bent down to take her clinch piece out of her boot at peabodys bland look she shrugged i started carrying a spare after my experience with casto a clinch piece might have saved me some grief yeah peabody dumped her standardissue stunner in the bin i wish youd blasted the son of a bitch eve opened her mouth closed it again peabody had been careful not to mention the illegals detective whod charmed her bedded her and used her while hed killed for profit look eve said after a moment im sorry about the way things went down there if you want to vent about it sometime im not much of a venter peabody cleared her throat thanks anyway well hell be stretching those long legs of his in lockup into the next century peabodys mouth curved grimly there is that you are cleared to enter please step through the gate proceed to the autotram on the green line for transport to second level clearing jesus youd think we were going to see the president instead of some suitandtie cop eve walked through the gate that efficiently shut and bolted behind them she and peabody settled down on the stiff plastic seats of the tram with a mechanical hum it sped them through bunkers and into a steelwalled passageway that angled down until they were ordered to step out into an anteroom filled with harsh artificial light and walls of view screens lieutenant dallas officer the man who approached wore the smoke gray uniform of government security with the rank of corporal his blond hair was buzz cut so close his pale white scalp peeked through his thin face was equally pale the skin tone of a man who spent his time indoors and underground his uniform shirt bulged under hefty mountains of biceps leave your bags with me please no electronic or recording devices are permitted beyond this point you are under surveillance and will remain so until you leave the facility understood understood corporal eve handed him her bag then peabodys and pocketed the receipts he gave her some place youve got here were proud of it this way lieutenant after depositing the bags in a bombsafe lockup he led them to an elevator programmed it for section three level a the doors closed without a sound the car ran with barely a trace of movement eve wanted to ask how much the taxpayers had paid for the luxury but decided the corporal wouldnt appreciate the irony she was certain of it when they were deposited in a wide lobby decorated with foam scoop chairs and potted trees the carpet was thick and undoubtedly wired for motion detection the console at which three clerks busily worked was equipped with a full range of computers monitors and communications systems the pipedin music was beyond soothing and edging toward mind dulling the clerks werent droids but they were so stiff and polished so radically conservative in dress that she thought theyd have been better off as automatons mavis she thought with deep affection would have been appalled at the lack of style reconfirmation of palm prints please the corporal requested and obediently eve and peabody laid their right hands flat on the plate sergeant hobbs will escort you from here the sergeant tucked neatly into her uniform stepped from behind the console she opened another reinforced door and led the way down a silent corridor at the last checkpoint there was a final screen for weapons then they were keycoded into the chiefs office here was a sweeping view of the city eve supposed after one glance at dudley that he considered it his city his desk was as wide as a lake and one wall flashed with screens spotchecking various areas of the building and grounds on another were photos and holograms of dudley with heads of state royalty ambassadors his communications center rivaled the control room at nasa two but the man himself cast the rest in shadow he was enormous easily six seven and a beefy two seventy his wide rawboned face was weathered and tanned with his brilliantly white hair cropped short on hands as big as virginia hams he wore two rings one was the symbol of military rank the other was a thick gold wedding band he stood poker straight and studied eve out of eyes the color and texture of onyx for peabody he never spared a glance lieutenant youre inquiring into the death of senator pearly so much for amenities eve thought and answered in kind thats affirmative chief dudley im investigating the possibility that the senators death is connected to another case on which i am primary your cooperation in this matter is duly noted and appreciated i find the possibility of a connection slim to none however after reviewing your record with nypsd i found no objection to allowing you to view the senators file even a slim possibility bears investigating chief dudley i agree and i admire thoroughness then might i ask if you knew the senator personally i did and though i did not agree with his politics i considered him a dedicated public servant and a man with a strong moral base one who would take his own life dudleys eyes flickered for a moment no lieutenant i would say not which is why youre here the senator has left behind a family in the area of family the senator and i were in harmony therefore his apparent suicide does not fit the man dudley touched a control on his desk inclined his head to the view wall on screen one his personal file on screen two his financial records screen three his political file youll have one hour to review data this office will be under electronic surveillance simply request sergeant hobbs when youve completed your hour eves opinion of dudley was a little hum in her throat as he left the office hes making it easy for us if he didnt particularly like pearly id say he respected him okay peabody lets get to work she scanned the screens as her cops eyes had already scanned the room she was nearly certain shed spotted all the security cameras and recorders and taking a chance on a very uncomfortable detention shifted so that her body was partially blocked by peabodys she pulled the diamond roarke had given her from under her shirt ran it idly along its chain and with her free hand slid the small recorder out kept it pressed just at her throat as she aimed it at the screens a clean life she said aloud no criminal record whatsoever parents married still living still based in carmel his father did military time ranked colonel served during the urban wars mother an mt with time off as professional parent thats a pretty solid upbringing peabody kept her eyes on the screen and off the recorder solid education too graduate of princeton with postgrad work at the world learning center on space station freedom that was right at its conception and only the top students could get in married at thirty just before his first run for office adjusted population advocate requisite one child male she shifted her gaze to another screen his politics are dead center liberal party butted heads with your old friend deblass over the repeal of the gun ban and the morality bill deblass was pushing i have a feeling i would have liked the senator eve turned slightly scroll personal data to medical history the screen flipped and the technical terms made her eyes want to cross shed have them translated later she thought if she managed to get out of the facility with the recorder looked like a healthy specimen physical and mental records show no abnormality tonsils treated in childhood a broken tibia in his twenties as a result of a sport injury sight correction standard in middle forties a permanent sterilization procedure during the same period this is interesting peabody continued to scan the political screen he was endorsing a bill that would require all legal representatives and technicians to be rescreened every five years at their own expense that wouldnt sit too well with the legal community or with fitzhugh eve murmured looks like he was after the electronic empire too tougher testing requirements for new devices new licensing laws that wouldnt have made him mister popularity either autopsy report she demanded then narrowed her eyes when it flashed on screen she skimmed through the jargon shook her head boy was he a mess when they scraped him up didnt leave them a hell of a lot to work with brain scan and dissection nothing she said after a moment no report here of an abnormality or flaw display she demanded and stepped closer to the screen to study the visual herself cross section side view enhance what do you see peabody unattractive gray matter too damaged for transplant enhance right hemisphere frontal lobe jesus what a fucking mess he made out of himself you just cant see cant be sure she stared until her eyes burned was that a shadow or was it simply part of the trauma caused when a human skull smashed brutally into concrete i dont know peabody she had all she needed and she slid the recorder under her shirt again but i do know that theres no motive or predisposition for selfdestruct in this data and that makes three lets get the hell out of this place she decided it gives me the creeps im with you all the way on that one o o they got tubes of pepsi and what passed for a hash sandwich at a glidecart on the corner of pennsylvania avenue and security row eve was just about to hail a transport back to the airport when a sleek black limo glided to the curb the rear window slid down and roarke smiled out at them would you ladies like a lift wow was all peabody could manage as she scanned the car from bumper to bumper it was a gleaming antique a luxury from another era and as romantic and tempting as sin dont encourage him peabody when eve started to climb in roarke took her hand and tumbled her into his lap hey mortified she jabbed with her elbow i love to fluster her when shes on duty roarke said wrestling eve back onto his lap and how was your day peabody peabody grinned delighted to see her lieutenant flushed and cursing it just got better if this thing has a privacy screen i can leave you two alone i said not to encourage him didnt i this time her elbow had better aim and eve managed to slide off onto the seat idiot she muttered at roarke she dotes on me so he sighed settled back its almost smothering if youve finished your police business can i offer you a tour of the city no eve said before peabody could open her mouth straight back to new york no detours shes a real party animal too peabody said soberly then neatly folded her hands and watched the city stream by chapter ten before eve left for home she perfected a detailed report on the similarities in the alleged suicides and why her suspicions that the senators death was due to the same as yet unknown causes she transferred her findings to the commanders unit with a flag to his home link unless his wife was hosting one of her ubiquitous dinner parties she knew whitney would review the report before morning with that hope she took the sky glide from homicide to the electronic detective division she found feeney at his desk his stubby fingers holding delicate tools microglasses turning his eyes to saucers as he stripped down a miniboard you doing repair and maintenance these days she eased a hip on the edge of his desk careful not to jar his rhythm shed expected no more than the grunt she received in response and waited while he transferred a sliver of something onto a clear dish somebodys having fun and games he muttered managed to get a virus of some kind right into the chiefs unit memorys been boosted the gcc compromised she glanced at the silver sliver and imagined that was the gcc computers werent her forte got a line on it not yet with tiny tweezers he lifted the sliver studied it through his glasses but i will i found the virus dosed it thats first priority this poor little bastards dead though when i autopsy it well see she had to smile it was so like feeney to think of his components and chips in human terms he replaced the sliver sealed the dish then tugged off his glasses his eyes shrank blinked refocused and there he was dallas thought rumpled wrinkled and baggy just as she liked him best hed made her a cop giving her the kind of inthefield training she could never have learned through discs or vr and though hed transferred from homicide to captain in edd she continued to depend on him so she began did you miss me were you gone he grinned at her reached a hand into a bowl for some candied almonds did you like your fancy honeymoon yeah i did she took a nut herself it had been a long time since lunch even with a body at the end of it i appreciate the data you dug up for me no problem a lot of fuss for selfterminations maybe his office was larger than hers due to his rank and his love of space his boasted a view screen which as usual was tuned to a classic film channel just now indiana jones was being lowered into a pit of asps its got a few interesting aspects though want to share thats why im here shed copied the data shed taken from the senators file and took the disc from her pocket ive got a brain dissection on here but the pictures a little rough can you clean it up boost it some can bears shit in the reforested park he took the disc swiveled to his unit and loaded it moments later he was scowling over the image pitiful imaging what did you do use a portable to record off screen it would be better if we didnt get into that he turned his head studied her with that same scowl you teetering on a line dallas my balance is good lets hope so preferring to work manually he slid out a keyboard his workingmans fingers danced over keys and controls like a master harpists over strings he jerked a shoulder when she leaned close dont crowd me kid i need to see under his expertise the picture was clearing contrasts sharpening she struggled for patience as he fine tuned diddled humming to himself as he worked behind her all hell was breaking loose between harrison ford and the snakes thats about the best we can do on this unit you want more i have to take it into master he flicked a glance up at her you gotta log on for master technically she knew hed bypass regulations for her and risk an interview with iad lets go with this for now you see that feeney she tapped a finger against the screen just under the tiny shadow i see a hell of a lot of trauma this brain must have been bashed good and proper but this she could just make it out ive seen this before on two other scans im no neurologist but id guess its not supposed to be there no she straightened its not supposed to be there o o she got home late and was met by summerset at the door there are two gentlemen to see you lieutenant with a quick jolt she thought of the data shed commandeered are they wearing uniforms summersets pursed mouth pruned further hardly ive put them in the front parlor they insisted on waiting though you had not indicated when you would arrive and roarke is detained at the office okay ill handle it she wanted a huge plate of anything edible a hot bath and some thinking time instead she wound her way down to the parlor and found leonardo and jess barrow relief came first then annoyance summerset the creep knew leonardo and could have told her who was waiting to see her dallas leonardos moonsized face creased into a grin when he spotted her he swept across the room a giant in a magenta skin suit overbloused with emerald gauze no wonder mavis adored him he caught eve up in a bone crushing hug then narrowed his eyes you havent dealt with your hair yet ill call trina myself oh well intimidated eve raked her fingers through her short messy cap of hair i dont really have time right now to you have to make time for personal appearance not only are you an important public figure in your own right but youre roarkes wife she was a cop damn it suspects and victims didnt give a rats ass about her hairdo right as soon as youre neglecting your treatments he accused her simply rolling over her excuses like a big smooth boulder down a bumpy slope your eyes are strained and your brows need shaping yeah but trina will be in touch to set up a session now then he propelled her across the room all but dumped her into a chair relax he ordered put your feet up youve had a long day can i get you anything no really im some wine inspired he beamed gave her shoulder a quick rub ill see to it and dont worry jess and i wont keep you long no use arguing with a born nurturer jess commented as leonardo moved off to order the wine for eve nice to see you lieutenant arent you going to tell me ive lost weight or gained it or need a facial but she blew out a breath and leaned back it did feel incredibly good to sit in a chair that wasnt designed to torture the ass okay lets have it something must be up for you to tolerate summerset insulting you until i got home actually he just looked appalled and closed us in here i do think hes going to run a room scan after were gone to be sure we didnt lift any of the knickknacks jess sat down crosslegged on the cushion at her feet his silver eyes were smiling his voice smooth as bavarian cream great knickknacks by the way we like them if youd wanted the tour you should have said so before leonardo set me down im going to stay here awhile looking at you will do just fine i hope you dont mind me saying youre the most attractive cop ive ever rubbed shoulders with have we rubbed shoulders jess her brows lifted disappearing under her bangs i hadnt noticed he chuckled patted her knee with one of his beautiful hands i would love that tour sometime or other but right now we have a favor to ask got a traffic blot you need fixing his lovely face beamed well now that you mention it leonardo carried the crystal glass filled with pale gold wine across the room himself dont tease her jess eve accepted the glass glanced up at leonardo hes not teasing me hes flirting with me he likes to live dangerously jess let out an appealingly musical laugh caught happily married women are the safest to flirt with he spread his hands as she sipped considered him no harm no foul he picked up her hand ran a fingertip along the intricate carving on her wedding ring the last man who messed with me is doing life in lockup eve said casually thats after i beat the crap out of him oops chuckling jess released her hand maybe id better let leonardo ask for the favor its for mavis leonardo said and his eyes became warm and liquid as he spoke her name jess thinks the demo disc is ready music and entertainment is a tough field you know crowded competitive and mavis has her heart set on making it after what happened with pandora he shuddered delicately well after what happened before and mavis being arrested fired from the blue squirrel going through all of that its been rough on her i know the guilt set in again for her part in it its behind her now thanks to you though eve shook her head leonardo insisted you believed her you worked for her you saved her now im going to ask you for something else because i know you love her as much as i do eves eyes narrowed youre boxing me in very neatly arent you he didnt bother to suppress the smile i hope so its my idea jess interrupted leonardo had to be nudged some to approach you with it he didnt want to take advantage of your friendship or your position my position as a cop no jess smiled reading her reaction perfectly as roarkes wife oh she didnt care for that he thought amused this was a woman who wanted to stand firm on her own your husband has a great deal of influence dallas i know what roarke has it wasnt precisely true she didnt have a clue as to the full extent of his holdings and operations she didnt want to what do you want from him just a party leonardo said quickly a what a party for mavis a splashy one jess put in grinning a busting one an event leonardo shot jess a warning look a stage so to speak where mavis can mingle with people perform i havent mentioned the idea to her in case you objected but we thought if roarke could invite there was obvious embarrassment now as she only stared at him well he knows so many people people who buy performance discs go to clubs look for entertainment not embarrassed in the least jess smiled winningly maybe we should get you some more wine instead she set the barely touched glass aside you want him to give a party wary of a trap she scanned both faces thats it more or less hope sprang in leonardos chest wed like to run the demo during it have mavis give a live performance as well i know its an expense im more than willing to pay it wont be the money that concerns him eve considered tapped her fingers on the arm of the chair ill talk to him about it and get back to you i guess you want it soon as soon as possible ill get back to you she repeated then rose thank you dallas leonardo bent in several places to kiss her cheek well get out of your way shes going to be a huge hit jess predicted she just needs a liftoff he took a disc out of his pocket this is a copy of the demo he told her a specially doctored copy he thought just for the lieutenant give it a try see what weve come up with she smiled at it thinking of mavis i will o o upstairs alone eve programmed the autochef and came up with a steaming plate of pasta and what was certainly fresh sauce from gardengrown tomatoes and herbs it never ceased to amaze her what roarke had access to she wolfed it down while she ran a bath as an afterthought she tossed in some of the foaming salts hed bought her in paris she thought they smelled like her honeymoon rich and romantic she sank into a tub the size of a small lake and sighed greedily blank the mind before thinking she decided and popped open the control panel in the wall shed already loaded the demo in the bedroom unit and switched it to play on the recessed screen in the bathroom she settled back into hot frothy water a second glass of vintage wine in her hand and shook her head what the hell was she doing here eve dallas a cop whod come up the hard way a nameless kid found in an alley abandoned and abused with a murder on her hands blocked from her memory even a year before that memory had been patchy and her life had been one of work survival and more work standing for the dead was her business and she was good at her job that had been enough shed made it enough until roarke the glitter of the ring on her finger continued to puzzle her he loved her he wanted her he the competent successful and enigmatic roarke even needed her that was the biggest puzzle of all and maybe since she couldnt seem to solve it she would eventually learn to simply accept it she brought the wine to her lips sank a little lower into the water and hit the remote instantly color and sound exploded into the room in defense she lowered the volume before her eardrums burst then mavis swirled across the screen as exotic as a sprite potent as straight whiskey her voice was a screech but it was appealing nonetheless and it suited her as well as the music jess had designed to showcase the vocals it was hot ruthless and raw very much mavis but as eve soaked it in she realized that the sound and the show had more polish oh there had always been flash and sparkle when it came to maviss work but now there was a thin sheen of gloss she had lacked before production values she supposed orchestration and someone who has the eye to recognize a rough diamond and the talent and willingness to help buff it up eves opinion of jess took a step up maybe hed looked like a cocky boy showing off on his complicated console but he obviously knew how to make it work more he understood mavis eve realized he appreciated her for what she was and what she wanted to do and hed found a way for her to do it well eve chuckled to herself and lifted her glass in toast to her friend it looked like they were going to have a party at that o o in his studio downtown jess reviewed the demo he sincerely hoped that eve was watching the disc if she did her mind would be open wide open to dreams he wished he knew what they would be where they would take her then he could see what she would see he could document relive but his research hadnt yet allowed him to find the path into the dreams one day he thought one day o o eves dreams took her back into the dark into the dread they were jumbled then shockingly clear then scattered again like leaves in the wind it was terrifying she dreamed of roarke and that was soothing watching an explosive sunset with him in mexico making reckless love in the dark bubbling water of a lagoon hearing his voice in her ear when he was inside her urging her to let go just let go then it was her father holding her down and she was a child helpless hurting frightened please dont the smell of him was there candy over liquor too sweet too strong she was gagging on it and weeping and his hand was over her mouth to stifle her screams when he raped her our personalities are programmed at conception reeannas voice floated in cool and sure we are what we are made our choices are already set at birth and she was a child in a terrible room a cold room that smelled of garbage and urine and death and there was blood on her hands someone was holding her pinning her arms and she fought like a wild thing like a terrified desperate child would fight dont dont dont ssh eve its a dream roarke gathered her closer rocked while the clammy sweat on her skin soaked into his shirt and broke his heart youre safe i killed you youre dead stay dead wake up now he pressed his lips to her temple struggling to find the right way to soothe her if hed had the power he would have gone back in time and cheerfully murdered what haunted her wake up darling its roarke no ones going to hurt you hes gone he murmured when she stopped fighting him and began to shudder hes never coming back im all right it humiliated her always to be caught in the grip of a nightmare im okay now im not he continued to hold her stroking until her tremors eased it was a bad one she kept her eyes shut tried to concentrate on the scent of him clean and male remind me not to go to bed after gorging on spiced spaghetti she realized he was fully dressed and the bedroom lights were on low you havent been to bed i just got in he eased her back to study her face and brushed a drying tear from her cheek youre still pale it tore at him and his voice was edgy why the hell wont you take a soother at least i dont like them as usual the nightmare had left her with the dull throb of a headache knowing he would see it if he looked too closely she shifted away i havent had one in a while weeks really calmer now she rubbed her tired eyes that one was all jumbled up strange maybe it was the wine and maybe its stress you will work until you collapse she angled her head glanced at the watch on his wrist and whos just coming in from the office at two am she smiled wanting to erase the worry from his eyes buy any small planets lately no just a few minor satellites he rose stripped off his shirt then lifted a brow when he caught the considering look she gave his bare chest youre too tired i dont have to be you could do all the work laughing he sat to take off his shoes thank you very much but why dont we wait until you have the energy to participate christ thats so married but she slid down in the bed exhausted the headache was just on the edge of her brain cannily waiting to strike when he slipped into bed beside her she rested her tender head on his shoulder im glad youre home so am i he brushed his lips over her hair youll sleep now yeah it soothed her to feel the rhythm of his heart under the palm of her hand she only felt slightly ashamed of needing it there needing him there do you think were programmed at conception what i wonder she was drifting into that twilight sleep already and her voice was thick and slow is it just the luck of the draw the gene pool what slips in with egg and sperm is that it what does that make us roarke you and me survivors he said but he knew she was asleep we survived he lay awake a long time listening to her breathe watching the stars when he was certain she slept without scars he let himself follow o o she was awakened at seven by a communique from commander whitneys office shed been expecting the summons she had two hours to prep for the facetoface report it didnt surprise her that roarke was already up dressed and sipping coffee while he scanned the stock reports on his monitor she grunted at him her usual morning greeting and took coffee into the shower with her he was on the link when she came back his broker she imagined from the bits and pieces of conversation she caught she snagged a muffin intending to stuff it into her mouth as she dressed but roarke grabbed her hand pulled her down on the sofa ill get back to you by noon he told his broker then ended transmission whats your hurry he asked eve ive got to meet whitney in an hour and a half and convince him theres a link between three unrelated victims talk him into letting me pursue the matter and to accept data i accessed illegally then im due in court again to testify so that a lowlife pimp who ran an unlicensed stable of minors and beat one of them to death with his hands goes into a cage and stays there he kissed her lightly just another day at the office have some strawberries she had a weakness for them and plucked one out of the bowl we dont have any you know thing scheduled for tonight do we no what did you have in mind i was thinking we could just hang she moved her shoulders unless im in interview being kicked because of breaching government security you should have let me do it for you he grinned at her a little time and i could have accessed the data from here she closed her eyes dont tell me that i really dont want to know that what do you say to watching some old videos eating popcorn and necking on the sofa i say thank you god its a date then he topped off their coffee maybe well even manage to have dinner together this case or these cases are troubling you i cant get a hook a focal point theres no why theres no how other than fitzhughs spouse and his associate no ones been even one step out of line and theyre both just idiots she moved her shoulders its not homicide when its selftermination but it feels like homicide she huffed out a disgusted breath and if thats all ive got to convince whitney im going to be dragging my ass out of his office after he stomps it you trust your instincts he strikes me as a man whos smart enough to trust them as well well soon see if they arrest you darling ill wait for you ha ha summerset said you had visitors last night roarke added as she rose to go to the closet oh shit i forgot dumping the robe on the floor she pawed naked through her clothes it was a process roarke never failed to enjoy she found a shirt of plain blue cotton shrugged it on i had a couple of guys over for a quick orgy after work did you take pictures she chuckled and found some jeans remembered court and switched to tailored slacks it was leonardo and jess theyre looking for a favor from you roarke watched as eve started to pull on the slacks remembered underwear and yanked open a drawer ohoh will it hurt i dont think so and actually im kind of for it they were thinking you could throw a party for mavis here let her perform the demo disc is done i watched it myself last night and its really good it would give her a chance to like premiere it before they start hawking it all right we could probably do it in a week or two ill check my schedule half dressed she turned to him just like that why not its not a problem she pouted a little i figured id have to persuade you anticipation lit wickedly in his eyes would you like to she fastened her slacks kept her face bland well i really appreciate it and since youre being so accommodating i guess this is a good time to hit you with part two idly he poured more coffee flicked a glance at the monitor as the off planet agriculture reports began to scroll hed recently bought a minifarm on space station delta whats part two well jess has worked out this one number he ran it by me last night she looked at roarke making it up as she went along its a duet really impressive and we thought if for the party the live portion of the performance you could do it with mavis he blinked lost all interest in crops do what with mavis perform it actually it was my idea she continued nearly losing it when he paled youve got a nice voice in the shower anyway the irish comes out i mentioned it and jess thought it was fabulous he managed to shut his mouth but it wasnt easy slowly he reached over to disengage the monitor eve really it would be great leonardo has a terrific design for your costume for my thoroughly shaken roarke got to his feet you want me to wear a costume and sing a duet with mavis in public it would mean so much to her just think of the press we could get press now he blanched christ jesus eve its really a sexy number testing them both she walked over began to toy with the buttons of his shirt as she looked hopefully up into his eyes it could put her right over the top eve im fond of her really i am i just dont think youre so important she trailed her finger down the center of his chest so influential and so gorgeous it was just a little too thick he narrowed his eyes caught the laughter in hers youre putting me on her laughter burst out you bought it oh you should have seen your face she pressed a hand to her belly yelping when he yanked her ear i would have talked you into it i dont think so not at all sure of himself he turned away started to reach for his coffee again i could have youd have done it if id played it right all but doubled over with laughter she threw her arms around him hugged herself to his back oh i love you he went very still as emotion delivered a hard bruising punch to his heart shaken he turned gripped her arms what the laughter died out of her face he looked stunned and his eyes were dark and fierce what is it you never say it swamped he dragged her close and buried his face in her hair you never say it he repeated she could do nothing but hold on rocked by the emotions pulsing from him where had this come from she wondered where had he hidden it yes i do sure i do not like that he hadnt known how much hed needed to hear her say it just like that not without prompting without thinking about it first she opened her mouth to deny it then closed it again it was true and it was foolish cowardly im sorry its hard for me i do love you she said quietly sometimes it scares me because youre the first and the only he held her there until he was sure he could speak then eased her back looked into her eyes youve changed my life become my life he touched his lips to hers let the kiss deepen slowly silkily i need you she linked her arms around his neck pressed close show me now chapter eleven eve started off to work humming her body felt soft and strong her mind rested she took it as an omen when her vehicle purred to life on the first attempt and the temperature control hung at a pleasant seventytwo degrees she felt ready to face her commander and convince him she had a case to pursue then she got to fifth and fortyseventh and hit the jam street traffic was stopped air traffic was circling like vultures and no one was paying any heed to the noise pollution laws the horns shouts curses catcalls screamed out and echoed the minute she stopped her temperature control gleefully pumped up to ninetyfive eve slammed out of her car and joined the melee the glidecart hawkers were taking advantage of the moment slipping and sliding through the pack and doing a monster business on frozen fruit sticks and coffee she didnt bother to flash her badge and remind any of them they werent allowed the vend off the curbs instead she snagged a vendor bought a tube of pepsi and asked what the hell was going on freeagers eyes shifting for more customers he slid her credits into his safe slot protest on conspicuous consumption hundreds of em stretched across fifth like a pretty ribbon singing want a wheat muffin to go with that fresh no gonna be here awhile he warned and stepped onto his cart to glide through standing traffic son of a bitch eve scanned the scene she was blocked in on all sides by furious commuters her ears were ringing and heat was pumping out of her car like a furnace she slammed back in beat on the control panel with her fist and managed to knock the temperature down to a brisk sixty overhead a tourist blimp trundled by full of gawkers with no faith whatsoever in her vehicle eve rammed it into vertical lift and hit her official warning siren the siren wheezed on no match for the cacophony of noise but she managed a shaky lift her wheels missed the roof of the car in front of her by at least an inch as her vehicle coughed and choked its way into the air next stop recycling heap i swear it she muttered and she punched at her communicator peabody what the fuck is going on here sir peabody popped on screen eyes bland mouth sober i believe youve encountered the jam incited by the protest on fifth that wasnt scheduled i know damn well it wasnt on the boards for this morning they cant have a permit freeagers dont believe in permits sir she cleared her throat when eve snarled i believe if you head west youll have better luck on seventh traffic is heavy there but its moving if you check your dash monitor yeah like thats going to work in this piece of shit call maintenance and tell them theyre meat then contact the commander explain that i may be a few minutes late for the meeting as she spoke she wrestled with the car which tended to dip and cause both pedestrians and other drivers to stare up in terror if i dont fall on someone i should be there in twenty minutes she avoided barely the edge of a billboard hologram touting the delights of private air travel she and the jet star headed in opposite directions with varying degrees of success she nicked the curb as she set down on seventh and couldnt blame the suit and tie pumping up his air skates for flipping her the bird but shed missed him hadnt she she was just indulging in a sigh of relief when her communicator shrilled any unit any unit twelve seventeen roof of tattler building seventh and fortysecond respond immediately unidentified female considered armed twelve seventeen eve thought selftermination threat what the hell was this dispatch dallas lieutenant eve responding eta five minutes she beat her siren into life and hit vertical again the tattler building home of the nations most popular tabloid was shiny and new the buildings on its former site had been razed in the thirties for the urban beautification program which was a euphemism for the decay of infrastructure and construction that had plagued new york during the period it speared up in silvery steel bulletshaped and was ringed by circling skywalks and glides with a freshair restaurant spilling out from its base eve double parked grabbed her field kit and pushed her way through the crowd gathered on the sidewalk she flipped her badge at the security guard and watched relief drown his face thank christ shes up there holding everybody off with antimugging spray got bill dead in the eyes when he tried to grab her who is she eve demanded as he hustled his way toward the interior elevator banks cerise devane she owns the fucking place devane eve knew her vaguely cerise devane ceo of tattler enterprises was one of the privileged and influential people who sauntered in roarkes circles cerise devane is on the roof threatening to jump what is this some sort of insane publicity stunt to bump up their circulation looks real to me he puffed out his cheeks shes buck ass naked too thats all i know the guard claimed as the elevator shot upward her assistant made the call frank rabbit you can get more out of him if hes conscious by now guy keeled right over when she went out on the ledge thats what i heard you call for psych somebody did we got the company shrink up there now and a specialist in selftermination is on the way fire department too and air rescue everythings backed up bad traffic jam on fifth tell me about it the doors opened onto the roof and eve stepped out into a brisk cooling wind that hadnt been able to find its way through the towering walls of buildings to the valley of the streets she took a quick scan cerises office was built onto the roof or more accurately into it slanted walls of treated glass formed a peak and would afford the ceo a three hundred sixty degree view of the city and people she loved to dish up in her paper through the glass eve could see the artwork decor and equipment designed for a topflight office and on the lshaped lounging sofa a man was stretched out with a compress on his forehead if thats rabbit tell him to pull himself together and get out here to fill me in and get anyone who isnt essential off this roof clear that crowd off the streets if she goes off we dont need her squashing bystanders i just dont have the man power the guard began get rabbit out here she repeated and called cop central peabody ive got a situation i heard what do you need get down here send a crowd dispersal unit to move those people off the street bring me all available data on cerise devane see if feeney can put a freeze on her links home personal and portable for the last twentyfour hours make it snappy done peabody responded and broke transmission she turned as the guard all but carried a young man across to her rabbits company tie was loose his stylishly shaped hair was mussed and matted his hands neatly manicured shook tell me exactly what happened she snapped make it fast and make it clear you can fall apart when im finished with you she just just walked out of the office his voice hitched and dipped and he sagged weakly against the supporting arm of the guard she looked so happy she was almost dancing she shed taken off her clothes shed taken them off eve cocked a brow at the moment rabbit seemed more shocked by his bosss sudden whim for exhibitionism than the possibility of her death what led up to it i dont know i swear i have no idea shed wanted me to come in early about eight she was upset over one of the lawsuits were always getting sued she was smoking and gulping coffee and pacing then she sent me out to light a fire under legal and said she was going to take a few minutes to relax and level out he stopped covered his face with his hands fifteen minutes later she walked out smiling and and nude i was so stunned i just sat there just sat there his teeth began to chatter ive never even seen her without her shoes being nakeds not her big problem now eve pointed out did she speak to you say anything i well i was so stunned you see i said something something like ms devane what are you doing is something wrong and she just laughed she said it was perfect she had it all figured out now and everything was wonderful she was going to sit out on the ledge awhile before she jumped i thought she was joking and i was nervous so i laughed a little his eyes were stricken i laughed and then i saw her go to the edge of the roof jesus she just popped over the side i thought shed jumped and i ran out and over there she was sitting on the ledge swinging her legs and humming i asked her please to come back up before she lost her balance she just laughed spritzed a little of the spray at me and told me shed just found her balance and to go away like a good boy she get any calls make any no he wiped his mouth any transmissions would have gone through my unit shes going to jump i tell you she leaned over while i was watching nearly went over then and she said what a nice trip it was going to be shes going to jump well see about that stay available eve turned away the company shrink was easy enough to spot he was dressed in a kneelength white smock and black pipestem pants his comforting gray hair was twisted into a neat queue and he was leaning over the edge of the roof his posture transmitting anxiety even as eve started toward him she swore she heard the whirl of flybys then cursed the media again as she spotted the first air van channel naturally she mused nadine furst was always first out of the gate the shrink straightened smoothed down his smock for the cameras eve decided she was going to detest him doctor she held up her badge and noticed the undisguised excitement in his eyes all eve could think was a company the size and strength of tattler could afford better lieutenant i believe im making some progress with the subject shes still on the ledge isnt she eve pointed out and brushed past him to lean over cerise more company sleek and pretty skin the color of blushing rose petals her welltoned legs swinging merrily cerise looked up her hair was jet black its carefully groomed waves blowing in the breeze she had a foxy intelligent face and sharp green eyes just now those eyes were soft and dreamy why its eve isnt it eve dallas the new bride lovely wedding by the way really the social event of the year we moved thousands of units with our coverage good for you you know i had research and data search busting butt to try to get the honeymoon itinerary i dont think anybody but roarke could have managed a full media blackout she wagged her ringer playfully and her perky breasts swayed you could have shared just a little the publics dying to know she giggled at that shifted and nearly overbalanced were all dying to know whoops not yet too much fun dont want to rush it straightening she waved at the air vans usually i hate the damn visual media cant think why just now i love everybody she shouted the last tossing her arms wide thats nice cerise why dont you come back up for a minute ill give you some data on the honeymoon exclusive cerise smiled slyly uhuhuh the refusal was playful again almost a giggle why dont you come down and join me you can go with me im telling you its the ultimate now ms devane the shrink began all of us have moments of despair i understand im with you i hear your sorrow oh stuff it cerise brushed him back with a gesture im talking to eve come on down sweetie but not too close she shook the spray and giggled come on and join the party lieutenant i dont recommend that you shut up and go wait for my aide eve told him as she swung a leg over the steel safety wall lowered herself over the edge the wind didnt seem quite so pleasant when she was dangling seventy stories over the street nudged on a steel ledge barely two feet wide here it buffeted and swirled aided by the backwash from the air vans it plucked at the clothes and slapped the skin she ordered her heart to stop jumping and pressed her back to the building isnt it beautiful cerise sighed id love to have some wine now wouldnt you no a big flute of champagne roarkes reserve fortyseven would go down smooth right now i think weve got a case at home lets go open one cerise laughed turned her head and smiled hugely and it was the smile eve realized as her heart lurched again shed seen on the face of a young man hanging from a homemade noose im already drunk on happiness if youre happy why are you sitting naked on a ledge considering taking the last leap thats what makes me happy i dont know why you dont understand cerise lifted her face to the sky closed her eyes eve risked shifting a few inches closer i dont know why everyone doesnt understand its so beautiful its so thrilling its everything cerise you go off this ledge its nothing its over no no no she opened her eyes again and they were glazed its just the beginning dont you see oh were all so blind whatevers wrong can be fixed i know carefully eve laid a hand on cerises she didnt grip didnt want to risk it survivings what counts you can change things make things better but you have to survive to do it do you know how much work that is and whats the point when theres so much pleasure just waiting i feel so good dont chuckling cerise aimed the spray at eves face dont spoil it now im having such a nice time you have people who are worried about you you have family cerise who love you eve strained to remember was there a child a spouse parents if you do this youll hurt them only until they understand the times coming when everyone will understand its going to be better then beautiful then she looked dreamily into eves eyes that beaming and terrifying smile on her lips come with me she grabbed eves hand clutched its going to be wonderful you only have to let go sweat snaked a line down eves back the womans grip was like a vise and a struggle for freedom could doom them both she forced herself not to resist to ignore the twisting wind and the hum of the air vans documenting every movement i dont want to die cerise she said calmly and neither do you selftermination is for cowards no its for explorers but suit yourself cerise patted eves hand released it and gave a long trilling laugh to the wind oh god im so happy she said and throwing her arms wide leaned forward into space instinctively eve grabbed she nearly lost her perch as her fingertips brushed the trim line of cerises hip she banged onto her side fought the roll forward as wind and space pulled at her gravity worked fast mercilessly eve stared down into that wildly smiling face until it was only a blur jesus god oh jesus god dizzy with reaction she pushed herself up leaned her head back shut her eyes screams and shouts rained on her and the air displaced by the media van coming in for a closeup struck her cheeks lieutenant dallas the voice was like a bee buzzing in her ears and eve simply shook her head on the roof peabody stared down and fought against the nausea rising into her throat all she could see now was that eve was pressed on the ledge white as a sheet and one careful move would send her after the woman shed tried to save taking a deep breath peabody trained her voice to sharp professional tones lieutenant dallas youre needed here i require your recorder for a full report i hear you eve said wearily keeping her eyes straight ahead she reached behind to grip the edge of the roof as a hand locked over hers she got to her feet turning her back to the fall she looked dead into peabodys eyes read the fear the last time i thought about jumping i was eight though her legs shook a bit she swung back onto the roof i wont go that way jesus dallas forgetting herself for a moment peabody gave eve a hard hug you scared the hell out of me i thought she was going to pull you off so did i she didnt get a grip here peabody the press is having a field day sorry peabody pulled back coloring a bit sorry no problem eve looked over to where the shrink was standing at the edge one hand to his heart in a pose for the busy cameras asshole she muttered she dug her hands into her pockets she needed a minute just another minute to settle i couldnt stop her peabody i couldnt find the right button to push sometimes there isnt one there was one that switched her onto this eve said quietly there had to be one to switch her off im sorry dallas you knew her not really just one of the people who walk past a corner of your life she pushed it away had to push it away death however it came always left responsibilities lets see what we can do here did you tag feeney affirmative he locked on her links from edd and said he would head over personally i downloaded data on the subject didnt take time to scan it they walked toward the office through the glass rabbit could be seen sitting with his head between his knees do me a favor peabody pass that limp rag off to a uniform for a formal statement i dont want to deal with him right now i want her office secured lets see if we can figure out what the hell she was doing that set her off peabody marched in had rabbit up and out with a uniform in seconds with wicked efficiency she cleared the room sealed the outer doors its all ours sir havent i told you not to call me sir yes sir peabody said with a smile she hoped would lift the heavy mood theres a smartass lurking under that uniform eve blew out a breath recorder on peabody already on okay here she is shes in early pissed off rabbit says she was hyped about some litigation get data on that as she spoke eve wandered the room absorbing details sculptures mostly mythological figures in bronze very stylized deep blue carpet to match the sky the desk in rose tones with a mirror gloss office equipment sleek and modern and tinted that same flowery shade a huge copper urn exploded with exotic blooms and eve noticed a pair of potted trees she crossed to the computer took her master pass out of her field kit and called for the last use report last use am call for file number legal custler v tattler enterprises thatd be the lawsuit she was pissed about eve concluded jibes with rabbits earlier statement she glanced down at a marble ashtray loaded with a half dozen cigarette butts using tweezers she picked one up examined it caribbean tobacco web filter pricey bag these you think they might be laced with something she was laced with something her eyes were wrong she wouldnt forget them eve knew for a long long time we can hope theres enough left of her for a tox report take a sample of those coffee dregs too but eve didnt think they would find what she was looking for in the tobacco or the coffee there had been no chemical trace in any of the other suicides her eyes were wrong eve repeated and her smile ive seen that smile before peabody a couple of times now as she tucked the evidence bags away peabody glanced up you think this is connected with the others i think cerise devane was a successful ambitious woman and well go through procedure but im willing to lay odds we wont find a motive for selftermination she sends rabbit out eve continued pacing the office annoyed by the constant hum she glanced up scowled at the air van still hovering see if you can find the privacy shields im tired of those jerks a pleasure peabody hunted up the control panel i thought i saw nadine furst in one of them the way she was leaning out it was a good thing she was wearing a harness she might have ended up as the lead on her own newscast at least shell get it right eve said half to herself and nodded when the privacy shields slid into place and closed off the glass good lights she ordered and brought the brightness back up she wanted to relax level herself off for the rest of the day eve poked into a cold box found soft drinks fruit wine one of the wine bottles had been opened and resealed but there was no glass to indicate cerise had started drinking early and it wasnt a couple of belts that had put that look in her eyes eve mused in the adjoining bath complete with whirlpool personal sauna and mood enhancer tube she found a cupboard filled with soothers and tranqs and legalized lifters a big believer in chemical assistance our cerise she commented take them in for testing jesus shes got her own pharmacy the mood tubes set on concentration mode and the last use was yesterday morning she didnt take a spin this morning so what does she do to relax eve stepped into an adjoining room which was a small sitting room she noted complete with full entertainment unit sleep chair serving droid a lovely sagegreen suit was neatly folded on a small table matching shoes stood on the floor under it jewelry a heavy linked gold chain complicated twists of earrings a slim bracelet watchrecorder had been slipped tidily in a glass bowl she undressed in here why what was the point some people relax better without the confines of clothes peabody said then flushed when eve cast a considering glance over her shoulder ive heard yeah maybe but it doesnt suit her she was a real puttogether woman her assistant told me hed never even seen her without shoes and suddenly shes a closet nudist i dont think so her gaze landed on the vr goggles on the arm of the sleep chair maybe she took a trip after all eve murmured shes frazzled wants to smooth the edges so she comes in here stretches out programs something and takes a little ride eve sat picked up the goggles vr goggles she mused fitzhugh and mathias had taken trips before death as well im going to see where she went and when ah if i appear to have any suicidal urges after im done or decide i can relax better without the confines of my clothes youre ordered to knock me cold without hesitation sir eve cocked a brow but youre not expected to enjoy it ill hate every minute of it peabody promised and folded her hands with a weak laugh eve slipped the goggles on display log she ordered bullseye she went vr at this morning dallas if thats the case maybe you shouldnt do this we can take it in and test it under controlled conditions youre my control peabody if i look too happy to live shortly zap me replay last run program eve ordered and settled back jesus she hissed it out as two young studs walked toward her dressed only in strips of glossy black leather studded with silver they were oiled muscled and fully aroused her environment was now a white room mostly bed and there was satin under her naked body gauze draped overhead to filter the candlelight from a soaring chandelier of glittery crystal music something low and pagan throbbed on the air she was draped over a mountain of feather pillows and as she started to shift the first young god straddled her hey listen pal for your pleasure only mistress he crooned and rubbed her breasts with scented oil this is a bad idea she thought as little involuntary shivers of pleasure centered in her gut oil was slicked over her stomach her thighs down her legs to her toes she could understand how the current situation could make a woman strip and smile but not how it could drive her to suicide stick it out she ordered herself and turned her mind to something else she thought of the report she needed to give her commander of unexplained shadows on the brain teeth closed delicately over her nipple a tongue slid wetly over the captured point she arched in reaction but the hand she shot out in protest slipped off a taut oilslicked shoulder then the second stud knelt between her legs and went to work on her with his mouth she came before she could stop herself a small pop of release panting she ripped the goggles off and found peabody gaping at her it wasnt a walk on a quiet beach eve managed i could see that what was it exactly a couple of mostly naked guys and a big satin bed eve blew out a breath set the goggles down whod have thought she relaxed with sex fantasies ah lieutenant sir as your aide i believe its my responsibility to test that unit for evidence control eve tucked her tongue in her cheek peabody i couldnt let you take that kind of risk im a cop sir risk is my life eve rose held out the goggles as peabodys eyes lit bag it officer deflated peabody dumped the goggles into a seal hell were they good looking peabody they were gods she stepped back into the office proper gave it one more scan im going to order in sweepers but i dont think theyll find anything ill take the disc you downloaded into central contact next of kin though the media will already have this all over the fucking airwaves she hitched up her field kit i dont feel at all suicidal im relieved to hear it lieutenant still eve frowned at the goggles how long was i riding that five minutes nearly twenty peabody gave a sour smile time flies when youre having sex i wasnt having sex guilt had her worrying her wedding ring exactly if thered been something in that program i should have felt it so that looks like a dead end have it analyzed anyway will do you wait for feeney maybe hell find something interesting on her link logs im going to go grovel to the commander when you finish here deliver the bags to the lab then report to my office eve started for the door tossed a look over her shoulder and peabody no playing with the evidence spoilsport she muttered when eve was out of earshot chapter twelve commander whitney sat behind his massive wellorganized desk and listened he appreciated the fact that his lieutenant delivered a clean and concise report and he admired that she could omit certain details without a flicker a good cop had to stand cool under fire eve dallas he was pleased to know was ice you had the autopsy data on fitzhugh analyzed outside the department yes sir she didnt blink the analysis required more sophisticated equipment than nypsd currently has access to and you had access to this more sophisticated equipment i was able to gain access and run the analysis he asked quirking a brow computer science is not your strong suit dallas she looked him dead in the eye ive been working on improving my skills in that area commander he doubted that sincerely subsequently you gained entry to the files at the government security center and there confidential reports fell into your hands thats correct i dont wish to reveal my source your source he repeated are you telling me you have a weasel at gsc there are weasels everywhere eve said coolly that might fly he murmured or you might find yourself facing a subcommittee back in east washington eves stomach shimmied but her voice stayed steady im prepared for that youd better be whitney sat back steepled his hands tapped his fingertips against his chin the case on the olympus resort you also accessed data there thats quite a bit out of your jurisdiction lieutenant i was on scene during that incident and i reported my findings to interspace authorities who then took over the disposition of the matter whitney added im authorized to request data when an outside case relates to one of mine commander thats yet to be substantiated the datas necessary for me to substantiate the connection that would hold dallas if there was a homicide i believe there are four of them including cerise devane dallas ive just viewed the recording of that incident i saw a cop and a jumper on a ledge the cop attempting to talk the subject in and the subject choosing the leap she was not pushed she was not coerced she was not threatened in any way its my professional opinion that she was coerced how i dont know and for the first time frustration leaked through but im sure dead sure that if they had enough of her brain to scrape up off the street for analysis theyd find that same burn on the frontal lobe i know it commander i just dont know how its getting there she waited a beat or being put there his eyes flickered are you theorizing that someone is influencing certain individuals to selftermination through some sort of brain implant i cant find any genetic link among the subjects no social group education sphere or religious affiliation they didnt grow up in the same town they didnt drink the same water attend the same health clubs or centers but they all had the same flaw in the brain thats beyond coincidence commander it was caused and if by being caused it coerced those people to end their lives then its murder and its mine youre walking a thin wire dallas whitney said after a moment the dead have families and the families want this put away your continued investigation extends the grieving process im sorry for that its also raising questions from the tower he added referring to the chief of police and security im willing to present my report to chief tibble if directed but she hoped she wouldnt be ill stand on my record commander im not a rookie playing terrier with a dead case even experienced cops overfocus make mistakes then let me make them she shook her head before he could speak i was on that ledge today commander i looked at her face into her eyes when she went off and i know he folded his hands on the edge of the desk administration was always a struggle in compromise he had other cases and he needed her on them the budget was thin and there was never enough time or man power i can give you a week no more if you dont have the right answers by then you close the files she drew a breath and the chief ill speak with him personally get me something dallas or be prepared to move on thank you sir dismissed he said then added when she reached the door oh and dallas if youre going to go outside the official sphere for research watch your step and give my best to your husband she colored slightly hed pinned her source and they both knew it she mumbled something and escaped dodged that stun stream she thought and dragged a hand through her hair then with an oath she dashed toward the nearest down glide she was going to be late for court she was approaching the end of her shift when she made it back to her office and found peabody settled at the desk a cup of coffee in her hand eve leaned against the doorjamb comfortable officer peabody jerked sloshed a little coffee cleared her throat i didnt know your eta apparently something wrong with your unit ah no no sir i thought it more efficient to enter the new data directly into yours thats a good story peabody you stick with it eve walked to her autochef and programmed coffee for herself it was roarkes blend rather than the poison served in the bull pen area which explained peabody cozying up at her superiors desk what new data captain feeney pulled all communications on devanes links doesnt appear to be anything that relates but its all here we have her personal datebook with all appointments and the most current data from her last health exam she have any problems there not a one she was a tobacco addict registered and took regular anticancer injections she had no sign of disease physical emotional or mental tended toward stress and overwork which was counteracted with soothers and tranqs she was cohabitating happily by all reports her partner is currently off planet you have the name of next of kin her son from a previous partnership yeah i contacted him hes based at the tattler offices in new la hes coming in eve angled her head comfortable peabody yes sir oh sorry she got up quickly from behind the desk and resettled in the ratty chair beside it your meeting with the commander weve got a week eve said briskly as she sat lets make the most of it mes report on devane not yet available eve turned to her link lets see if we can give him a little shove o o by the time she got home she was staggering shed missed dinner which she thought was just as well since shed ended the day at the morgue viewing what was left of cerise devane even the stomach of a veteran cop could turn and she would get nothing there nothing at all she doubted even roarkes equipment could reconstruct enough of devane to be of any help she walked in nearly tripped over the cat who was stretched at the threshold and drummed up the energy to bend down and lift him he studied her annoyance gleaming in his bicolored eyes you wouldnt get kicked pal if you draped your fat ass somewhere else lieutenant she shifted the cat looked over at summerset who as usual had appeared out of nowhere yeah im late she snapped give me a demerit he didnt add his normal withering remark he had seen the clips on the news channel and he had watched her on the ledge he had seen her face youll want dinner no i dont she wanted bed and headed for the stairs lieutenant he waited for her badtempered oath waited until shed turned her head to scowl at him a woman who steps out on a ledge is either very brave or very stupid the scowl turned into a sneer i dont have to ask what category you put me in no you dont he watched her climb up and thought her courage was terrifying the bedroom was empty she told herself shed run a house scan for roarkes location in just a minute then fell facedown on the bed galahad wiggled out of the crook of her arm and climbed onto her butt to circle and knead his way to comfort roarke found her there minutes later sprawled out in exhaustion a sausageshaped cat guarding her flank he simply studied her for a while he too had seen the news clips they had paralyzed him dried the saliva in his mouth and turned his bowels to water he knew how often she faced death others and her own and told himself he accepted it but that morning he had watched helpless while shed teetered on the brink hed looked into her eyes seen the grit and the fear and he had suffered now she was here home a woman with more bone and muscle than curves with hair that badly needed tending and boots worn out at the heels he walked over sat on the edge of the bed and laid a hand over the one curled loosely on the spread im just getting my second wind she murmured i can see that well go dancing in a minute she managed a chuckle can you move that boulder off my butt obligingly roarke picked up galahad smoothed the ruffled fur youve had quite a day lieutenant the medias been full of you she rolled over but kept her eyes shut a minute longer im glad i missed it you know about cerise then yes i had channel on while i was preparing for my first meeting this morning i caught it all live she heard the strain in his voice and opened her eyes sorry youll say you were doing your job he set the cat aside and brushed the hair back from eves cheek but it was above and beyond eve she could have taken you with her i wasnt ready to go she cupped a hand over the one he held to her cheek i had a flash when i was up there memory flash of when i was a kid standing at the window of some filthy flop hed booked us into i thought about jumping then just getting it the hell over with i wasnt ready to go im still not galahad climbed out of roarkes lap and stretched his bulk over eves belly it made roarke smile looks like we both intend to keep you here for a while what have you eaten today she pursed her lips is this a quiz nothing to speak of he decided foods not high on my list right now ive just come from the morgue contact with concrete after seventystory flights does unattractive things to flesh and bone i dont imagine there was enough to scan for comparison with the others despite the grisly image she grinned sat up and gave him a quick loud kiss youre cued up roarke thats one of the things i like best about you i thought it was my body thats right up on the list she told him as he rose and went over to the recessed autochef no there isnt going to be enough but there has to be a connection you see it dont you he waited until the protein drink hed ordered came through cerise was an intelligent sensible and driven woman she was often selfish continually vain and could be an enormous pain in the ass he came back to the bed held out the glass she wasnt the type to jump off the roof of her own building and let the visual media scoop her own organization ill add that to my data she frowned at the creamy mintcolored drink in her hand what is this nutrition drink it he tipped it up to her lips all she took the first sip out of selfdefense decided it wasnt altogether hideous and gulped it down there feel better now yes did whitney give you room to pursue ive got a week and he knows ive been using your facilities hes pretending he doesnt she set the glass aside started to stretch back out then remembered we were supposed to watch videos eat popcorn and neck you stood me up he tugged on her hair ill have to divorce you god youre strict suddenly nervous she rubbed her hands together while youre in that mode i guess id better come clean oh were you out necking with someone else not exactly i beg your pardon you want a drink weve got some wine up here dont we she started to get off the bed but she wasnt at all surprised to have his hand snake out and grip her arm clarify im going to i just think it might go down better with some wine okay she tried a smile but knew it fell far short of charming when he met it with a long steely stare his grip loosened enough for her to scoot up and hurry over to the bedroom cold box she took her time pouring it and kept her distance as she began peabody and i were doing the first sweep of devanes office and quarters she has a relaxation room im aware of that sure you are she took a sip first to fortify her for confession before she crossed back anyway i noticed she had vr goggles on the arm of her sleep chair mathias had been on vr before he hanged himself fitzhugh liked to use vr its a slim link but i figured it was better than no link over ninety percent of the population of this country has at least one vr per household roarke pointed out eyes still narrowed on her face yeah but you have to start somewhere this is a brain flaw vr links to the brain as well as the senses it occurred to me that if there was a defect intentional or accidental in the goggles it might have caused the suicidal urge he nodded slowly all right i follow that so i tried her set wait he held up a hand you suspected the goggles were a contributor to her death so you merrily put them on yourself are you out of your mind peabody was there as control with orders to stun me if necessary well then disgusted he flung up a hand thats just fine thats perfectly reasonable then shed knock you unconscious before you jumped off the roof there you are she sat down beside him handed him his glass i checked the last use log shed gone vr minutes before she walked out and onto that ledge i was sure i was going to find something in whatever program shed been on she paused to scratch the back of her neck you know i figured it would be some relaxation program maybe a meditation run your standard sea cruise or a country meadow i take it it wasnt no it wasnt it was ah a fantasy run you know a sexual fantasy intrigued now he folded his legs under him cocked his head his mouth remained sober his irish blue eyes bland was it really he took a casual sip of wine before setting the glass aside and consisted of well there were these guys plural just two she could feel the heat rising up to her throat and detested it it was an official investigation were you naked jesus roarke i believe its a perfectly reasonable question maybe for a minute okay it was the program and i had to test the program and it wasnt my fault these guys were all over me and i aborted it before well almost before she stumbled to a guilty halt and saw with shock that he was grinning at her you think its funny bunching her fist she punched him in the shoulder ive been feeling like slime all day and you think its funny before what he asked nipping the glass out of her hand before she could upend it over his head he set it down beside his own you aborted the program almost before what precisely her eyes went to slits they were great im getting a copy of the program for my personal use i wont need you anymore because ive got a couple of love slaves wanna bet he pushed her back on the bed wrestled with her and managed to get her shirt over her head cut it out i dont want you my love slaves keep me satisfied she flipped him nearly had him pinned when his mouth closed over her breast and his hand slid neatly down to cup her over the thin wool snug at her crotch heat speared through her like lightning damn it she gasped out a breath im just pretending to enjoy this okay he tugged the slacks over her hips then skimmed his fingertips over her she was already wet luring him in his teeth closed over her nipple tugged just as he nudged her to peak it wasnt a gentle pop this time the orgasm came in one hard fast wave that swamped her drowned her then tossed her helplessly over the next crest she moaned out his name it was always his name but when she reached for him he cuffed her wrists drew her arms over her head no his own breathing was uneven and thick as he stared down at her just take it take me he slipped inside her slowly inch by inch watching her eyes go blind and dark as he moved clamping down on the urge to ravish to answer the sudden wild pistoning of her hips he let her drive herself over the next edge and when she was limp and her breathing in tatters he shifted to long steady strokes take more he murmured swallowing her groans holding her captive hands mouth loins and more her system was overloaded scrambled like her pulse her body was under siege her sex so sensitized the wild pleasure was akin to pain and still he moved slowly lazily i cant she managed and her head whipsawed even as her hips arched for more its too much let go eve he was holding onto control by his fingernails once more he didnt let himself fall until she did o o her head was still spinning when she managed to push herself up on her elbows amazingly they were both still half dressed and on top of the spread from the corner of the bed galahad sat watching her with feline disgust or maybe it was envy roarke had rolled over on his back and had what could only be interpreted as a smug smile on his lips i guess that flexed your testosterone his smile spread wider she jabbed a finger into his ribs if that was to punish me you missed the target now he opened his eyes and they were filled with warm amusement darling eve did you really think id consider your little adventure some sort of virtual adultery she pouted a little however ridiculous it was she was miffed that he wasnt at all jealous maybe with a long sigh he sat up set his hands on her shoulders you can indulge in fantasy professionally or personally im not your keeper it doesnt bother you not in the least he gave her a friendly kiss then caught her chin firmly in his hand try it in the flesh even once and ill have to kill you her pupils widened and foolishly her heart gave a pleased little leap oh well thats fair thats fact he said simply now that we have that straightened out you should get some sleep im not tired anymore she tugged her slacks back over her hips and made him sigh again i suppose that means you want to work if i could use your system just for a couple of hours i could get a jump on my legwork tomorrow resigned he pulled on his own slacks lets go then thanks she tucked her hand in his companionably as they walked toward the private elevator roarke you wouldnt really kill me would you oh yes i would smiling easily he nudged her into the car but given our relationship i would trouble to do so quickly and with as little pain as possible she shot him a glance then ill have to say same goes naturally east wing third level he ordered and gave her hand a companionable squeeze i wouldnt have it any other way chapter thirteen for the next few days eve beat her head against the wall of every dead end when she needed a change of pace to clear her mind she beat peabodys head against the wall she hounded feeney to eke out whatever free time he could to find her something anything she gritted her teeth when other cases landed on her desk and she worked overtime when the lab boys dragged their feet she hopped on their backs and rode them mercilessly it got to the point that the lab began to dodge her communications to combat that she hauled peabody down to the lab for a little facetoface persuasion dont try to sell me that sos about backup dickie dickie berenski privately known as dickhead looked pained as chief lab tech he should have been able to delegate a half dozen drones to ward off a personal confrontation with an irate detective but every one of them had deserted him heads would roll he thought and sighed what do you mean sos same old shit dickie its always sos with you he scowled but decided to make the acronym his own listen dallas i got you the breakdown on all the over the counters didnt i flagged them personally as a favor favor my ass i bribed you with box seats for the arena ball playoffs his face went prim i assumed that was a gift and im not bribing you again she jabbed a finger into his puny chest whats the deal with the vr goggles why havent i got your report because i havent found anything to report its a hot program dallas his eyebrows did a little suggestive dance but it was clean no defects so are all the other options on that unit clean and up to code better than he added his voice whining faintly we should have so good i had sheila take the whole unit apart and put it back together damn fine equipment top of the line higher than top the technologys off the scale but thats to be expected its a roarke product its a she broke off struggling not to show her surprise or distress at this new tidbit of information which plant manufactures it hell sheilas got that data off planet im pretty sure cheaper labor and that baby was right off the ship hasnt been on the open market more than a month her stomach had clutched and tightened further but its not defective nope its a real honey ive already put in for one of my own he wiggled his brows hopefully of course you could probably get me a unit at cost you get me the report now every single detail and release the unit to me and ill think about it its sheilas flex day he whined his mouth stretching down in a search for pity shell have the report finished up and on your desk by noon tomorrow now dickie a good cop knew her quarrys weaknesses and ill see about making you a gift of your own unit well in that case hang for ten cheery now he hurried over to a computer bank tucked in one of the cubbyholes in the labs beehive dallas one of those units probably goes for two thousand base peabody stared after dickie in disgust you overbribed him i want that report eve imagined that roarke had a case of the units somewhere for promotional giveaways giveaways she thought with a sick roll in her stomach to politicians employees prominent citizens im down to three days and nothing i wont be able to waltz whitney toward an extension she looked back over as dickie pushed out of the cubicle sheila had it almost nailed down he offered a sealed disc and a hard copy look at this this is a compugraft of the vr pattern for the last program sheilas highlighted a couple of blips what do you mean blips eve snatched the page and studied what appeared to be a series of lightning bolts and swirls cant say for certain probably the subliminal relaxation or in this case substimulation option some of the newer units are offering several extended subliminal packages you can see these shadow the program slide in every few seconds suggestions she felt her energy surge you mean the program was fitted with subliminal suggestions to the user common enough practice its been used for habit breaking sexual enhancement mind expanding and so on for decades my old man quit tobacco on subliminals fifty years ago what about planting urges such as selftermination look subs give you little nudges toward hunger consumer goods or aid in habit breaking that kind of direct suggestion he tugged at his lip shook his head youd have to go deeper and id say it would take a long series of sessions to make the suggestion stick on a normal brain survival instincts too strong he shook his head again convinced we played those programs over and over particularly the sexual fantasy sequences eve thought ran them on test subjects into the droid for analysis we got nobody jumping off the roof in fact we got no unusual reaction from anyone or out of the droid its just a top flight thats it i want a full analysis on the subliminal shadows hed already anticipated that i need to keep the unit then sheilas started on it as you can see but it takes time youve got to run the program back out the overt vr expunge the subliminals then it takes compu time to test analyze and report a good subliminal and i guarantee this ones an ace is subtle chasing down its pattern isnt like reading a truth analysis how much time two days a day and a half if we get lucky get lucky she suggested and passed the hard copy to peabody o o eve tried not to worry about the fact that the vr was one of roarkes toys or what the consequences could be if it was indeed found to be part of the coercion subliminal shadows that could be the connection shed been searching for the next step was to tag the vr units that had been in fitzhughs mathiass and pearlys possession at time of death with peabody keeping pace she hustled down the sidewalk her vehicle was still in maintenance eve didnt think it worth the incredible headache of requisitioning a sub for a threeblock hike autumns coming huh curious that eve seemed oblivious to the freshening in the air the balmy scent on the eastward breeze peabody paused to take a deep breath you can smell it what are you doing eve demanded are you crazy suck in enough of new york and youll have to spend a day in detox you get past the transport fumes and the body odor and its wonderful they might just pass that new fresh air bill this election eve spared her aide a glance your freeagers showing peabody nothing wrong with environmental concerns if it wasnt for the tree huggers wed all be wearing filter masks and sunshades year round peabody looked longingly at a people glide but matched her pace to eves longlegged stride not to put a damper on things lieutenant but youre going to have to do a major tap dance to access those vr units sop would be for them to have been returned to the deceaseds estates by this time ill get them and i want this kept quiet on a needtoknow basis only until i sort it out understood she waited a moment id imagine roarke has so many tentacles out there it would be impossible to know whos doing exactly what at any given time its a conflict of interest and we both know it im putting your ass on the line with this sorry to disagree sir but im in charge of my own ass its only on the line if i put it there so noted and appreciated then you can also note that im a big fan of arena ball as well sir eve stopped took a long look then laughed one ticket or two two i could get lucky they exchanged grins just as a shrill siren split the air oh hell oh shit five minutes either way and wed have slipped by this eve drew her weapon and spun on her heel the alarm pealed from the credit exchange center directly in front of her what fool hits a cec two blocks from cop central clear the street peabody she ordered then cover the back exit the first order was almost unnecessary as pedestrians were already scattering trampling each other over glides and skywalks in a rush for cover eve whipped out her communicator gave the standard order for backup before she dived through the automatic doors the lobby was a mass of confusion her only advantage was that me wave of people were rushing out as she rushed in and they offered some cover like most cecs the lobby area was small windowless banked with high counters for personal privacy only one of the personal service counters was manned by a human the other three by droids who had gone into automatic shutdown once the panic button had been pushed the lone human was a female probably midtwenties with closely cropped black hair a tidy conservative white jumpsuit and an expression of utter terror on her face as she was held through the security port by the throat the man who gripped her was busy squeezing off her air and waving what was certainly a homemade explosive with his free hand ill kill her ill fucking stuff it down her throat the threat didnt worry eve nearly as much as the calm deliberate manner in which it was delivered she discounted chemicals and a professional status from the appearance of his threadbare jeans and shirt the tired unshaven face she concluded she had one of the citys desperately poor on her hands she hasnt done anything to you with the first mad rush already out the door eve approached slowly shes not responsible why dont you let her go everyones done something to me everyones part of the system he yanked pulling the hapless clerk a little farther through the security port she was wedged now to the shoulders and turning faintly blue keep back he said quietly ive got nothing to lose and nowhere to go youre choking her snuff her and youve got no shield ease up a little whats your name names dont count for shit but he did loosen his grip enough to have the young clerk wheeze in a desperate breath moneys what matters i walk out with a bag of credits nobody gets hurt hell theyll just make more it doesnt work that way cautious eve took another three steps keeping her eyes on his you know youre not going to get out of here by now the streets blocked the security units are deployed jesus pal the areas lousy with cops any time of the day or night you couldve picked better than this out of the corner of her eye she saw peabody slide through the rear access and take up her position neither of them could risk firing while he had the clerk and the explosive in his hands if you drop that thing even sweat too much it could blow then everybody dies here then well all die here it doesnt matter anymore let the clerk go shes a civilian shes just trying to make a living so was i she saw it in his eyes just an instant too late the utter despair in a blink he tossed the handheld boomer high and right eves life flashed obscenely before her eyes as she sprinted forward and made the dive she missed by a fingertip even as she braced for the insult of the blast the crudely made ball rolled into a corner bobbled then settled quietly dud the wouldbe thief let out a weak laugh doesnt it just figure then as eve popped to her feet he charged she didnt have time to aim much less fire her weapon he hit her like a battering ram driving her back hard into one of the selfservice counters the explosion came now inside her head as her hip slammed painfully into the edge sheer luck had her holding onto her weapon as stars burst in her head she hoped the crack she heard was the cheap laminate giving and not bone he had her gripped in a pathetically loverlike embrace that was surprisingly effective it blocked her weapon and pinned against the counter so she was forced to shift her body weight rather than pivot they hit the floor and this time she was unlucky enough to land first so that his thin panicfueled body dropped heavily on hers her elbow cracked on the tile her knee jarred and twisted viciously with more enthusiasm than finesse she rammed the side of her weapon against his temple the move proved to be as effective as a stun his eyes rolled up white before she shoved him aside and got to her knees panting fighting back the nausea that was a result of taking some bony part of his body in the stomach she blew the hair out of her eyes peabody was also on her knees the boomer in one hand her weapon in the other i couldnt get a clear shot i went for the boomer first thought you could take him fine thats just dandy she hurt everywhere and now her pulse began to hammer at the sight of her aide clutching a bomb dont move not moving barely breathing ill call the goddamn bomb disposal unit get a safe box in here now i was just about peabody broke off went pale as death oh hell dallas its heating up dump it dump it now take cover swiping out one handed eve dragged the unconscious man with her behind the counter draped herself over him then locked her arms over the back of her head the explosion blasted the air fumed out a fist of heat and had god knew what raining down on her the auto fire control system whirled into action spewing sprays of icy water shrilling out a new alarm warning employees and customers to vacate the building in a calm and orderly manner she sent up a quick thanks to whoever was listening that she felt no bright pain and that all her body parts appeared to be attached coughing against the thick wash of smoke she crawled out from behind what was left of the counter peabody christ she hacked wiped her stinging eyes and kept crawling over the wet now filthy floor something hot burned the heel of her hand made her swear again come on peabody where the hell are you here the answer was weak followed by a fit of throaty coughing im okay i think they met on hands and knees through the curtain of smoke and water and eyed each others blackened faces casually eve reached out and rapped peabody several times on the side of the head your hair was on fire she said mildly oh thanks hows the asshole still unconscious eve sat back on her heels and took a quick selfinventory she didnt see any blood which was no small relief most of her clothes were still there which hardly mattered since they were ruined you know peabody i think roarke owns this building then hes probably going to be pissed smoke and water damage is a bitch youre telling me lets call it a goddamn day the credit cops can handle this im giving a party tonight yeah mouth twisted peabody tugged on the torn sleeve of her uniform im looking forward to it then she swayed squinted dallas how many pairs of eyes did you have when we came in here one just one shit now youve got two i think one of us has a problem with this peabody pitched forward into eves arms there wasnt time to clean up after shed hauled peabody out of the wreckage and dumped her on the medical technicians she had a report to relay to the officer in charge of the security team then she fed the same data to the bomb disposal unit between reports she harassed the mts about peabodys condition and blocked their attempts to treat her to an injury scan roarke was already dressed for the evening when she rushed in the door he cut off his conversation with tokyo on his palm link shifted away from the team of florists currently arranging pink and white hibiscus in the foyer what the hell happened to you dont ask she raced past him and hit the stairs at a dead run she was out of what was left of her shirt by the time he came into the bedroom closed the door i will ask the bomb wasnt a dud after all unwilling to sit down and smear whatever was on her slacks onto the furniture she balanced on one foot and fought off a boot roarke took a deep breath the bomb well a homemade boomer very unreliable she pried off the second boot then began to peel off her torn and blackened slacks guy hits a cec two blocks from cop central idiot she dumped the tatters on the floor swung around to head to the bath only to come up short when roarke took her arm name of god he turned her to get a closer look at the purpling bruise that spread over her hip it was bigger than his spread hand her right knee was raw and there were more bruises blooming on her arms and shoulders youre a mess eve you should see the other guy well at least hell get three square and a roof for a few years courtesy of the state ive got to get cleaned up he didnt release her only shifted his gaze to hers i dont suppose you bothered to let the mts work on you those butchers she smiled im fine just sore i can get a quick treatment tomorrow youll be lucky if you can walk by tomorrow come on roarke but she winced and hobbled and he pulled her into the bath sit be quiet we dont have time for this she sat rolled her eyes its going to take me a couple hours to get the stink and soot off christ those boomers smell she turned her head to sniff at her shoulder and grimaced sulfur then she eyed him warily whats that he approached with a thick pad soaked in something pink the best we can do at the moment stop wiggling he laid the pad over her injured knee holding it in place and ignoring her curses that stings christ are you crazy im beginning to think so with his free hand he caught her chin carefully examined her blackened face at the risk of repeating myself youre a mess hold that pad in place he squeezed lightly on her chin i mean it okay okay she huffed out a breath and kept the pad over her knee as he walked back to a wall cabinet the sting was easing she didnt want to admit that the ripe ache in her knee was backing off whats in this stuff this and that itll ease the swelling and numb the injury for a few hours he came back with a small tube of liquid drink it uhuh no drugs very calmly he laid a hand on her shoulder eve if youre not in pain at the moment its due to adrenaline youre going to hurt and hurt big time very shortly i know what it feels like to be bruised and battered all over now drink it ill be fine i dont want she gasped when he pinched her nose drew her head back and poured the liquid down her throat bastard she managed choking and batting at him thats a good girl now into the shower he walked to the glassenclosed tube and ordered the spray at half force and a soothing eightysix degrees ill get you for that i dont know how i dont know when but ill do it she limped into the shower still muttering son of a bitch pours drugs down my throat treats me like a goddamn imbecile the moan of relief came involuntarily as the soft water slid over her abused body he watched her smiling as she braced both hands against the wall and ducked her head under the spray youll want to wear something loose and floor length try the blue ankle sweep leonardo designed for you oh go to hell i can dress myself why dont you stop staring at me and go order some of your minions around darling theyre our minions now she bit off a chuckle and rapped her hand against the shower panel to access the link recessed there brightmore health center she ordered fifth floor admissions she waited for the connection and managed to soap up her hair onehanded this is lieutenant eve dallas you have my aide officer delia peabody i want status she listened to the standard line for approximately five seconds before she cut off the charge nurse then find out and find out now i want her full status and believe me you dont want me coming down there to get it o o it took her an hour a relatively painless hour she was forced to admit whatever roarke had made her drink didnt leave her with that helpless floaty feeling she detested instead she felt alert and only slightly giddy it might have been the drug that made her admit at least to herself that hed been right about the dress it slid weightlessly over her skin concealing the bruises stylishly with its high neck long tapering sleeves and draping skirt she added the diamond hed given her as a symbolic apology for swearing at him even though hed deserved it with less resentment than usual she fussed with her face struggled with her hair the result she decided as she gave herself a study in the triple mirrors in the closet wasnt half bad she supposed she looked as close to elegant as she was ever going to get when she walked onto the roof terrace where the performance session of the party was to take place roarkes quick smile agreed with her there she is he murmured and walked over to take both of her hands bringing them to his lips i dont think im talking to you all right he lowered his head and mindful of bruises kissed her lightly feel better maybe she sighed and didnt bother to tug her hands away i guess ill have to tolerate you since youre doing all this for mavis were doing it for mavis i havent done anything you married me he pointed out hows peabody i heard you calling the health center from the shower mild concussion bumps and bruises she was a little shocky but shes stabilized she went after the boomer remembering that moment eve blew out a slow breath it started to heat up right in her hand no way i could get to her she closed her eyes shook her head scared the hell out of me i thought id find pieces of her everywhere shes tough and smart and shes learning from the best eve opened her eyes narrowed them flattery isnt going to make me forgive you for drugging me ill find something else that will she surprised him by reaching up framing his face with her hands were going to talk about that ace anytime lieutenant but she didnt smile her eyes only went more intense theres another thing we have to talk about its serious i can see that concerned he glanced around at the bustling caterers the wait staff already lined up for their final briefing summerset can handle the last of this we can use the library its bad timing i know but it cant be helped she took his hand an instinctive gesture of support as they headed out of the room and down the wide corridor toward the library inside he closed the door ordered lights then poured drinks mineral water for eve youll have to forgo alcohol for a few hours he told her the painkiller doesnt mix well with it i think i can restrain myself tell me okay she set the glass aside without drinking pushed both hands through her hair youve got a new vr unit on the market i do he sat on the arm of a leather sofa took out a cigarette and lighted it it hit a month six weeks ago depending on region weve improved a number of the options and programs with subliminals he blew out smoke thoughtfully it wasnt difficult to read her he thought when you understood her she was worried stressed and the soothing power of the drug couldnt overtake her in that area naturally several of the option packages include a variety of subliminals theyre very popular still watching her he nodded i take it cerise had one of the new units and was using it before she jumped yeah the lab hasnt yet been able to identify the subliminal may turn out to be nothing but you dont think so he finished something triggered her something triggered all of them im working on confiscating the vr units owned by the other subjects if it turns out they all owned that new model the investigations going to circle around your company on you i had a sudden urge to encourage selftermination i know you had nothing to do with it she said quickly and fiercely im going to do everything i can to keep you out of it i want eve he interrupted quietly shifted to crush out his cigarette you dont have to explain yourself to me he reached in his pocket took out his memo card and tapped in a code the r and d on that model was done in two locations in chicago and on travis ii manufacturing was handled by one of my subsidiaries again on travis ii the distribution and shipping on and off planet by fleet the packaging through trillium marketing by top drawer here in new york i can have all the data sent to your office unit if thats most convenient im sorry stop he tucked the card away and rose there are literally hundreds perhaps thousands of employees in these companies i can certainly get you a list for whatever good that would do then he paused reached down and rubbed a thumb over the diamond she wore you should know i personally worked on and approved the design initialed the schematics the units been in development for more than a year and i spotchecked every stage at one time or another through that period my hands are all over it shed been sure of that afraid of that it could come to nothing dickhead claims my theory of subliminal coercion to selftermination is over the edge of unlikely into the impossible roarke smiled a little how can one trust a man called dickhead eve you used the unit yourself yeah which also put a big wrench in my pet theory all i got out of it was an orgasm she couldnt quite bring off a smile herself i want to be wrong roarke i want to be wrong and close these cases as voluntary selfterminations but if im not well deal with it first thing tomorrow ill look into it myself she started to shake her head but he took her hand eve i know the drill you dont i know my people at least the department heads in each stage you and i have worked together before i dont like it thats a pity he toyed with the diamond between her breasts again i believe i do chapter fourteen roarke sure knows how to dish a party mavis stuffed a deviled quail egg in her mouth and chattered over it everybody and i mean everybodys here did you see roger keene hes like top hound at be there records and lilah monroe shes tearing them up with her new audience participation show on broadway maybe leonardo can charm her into using him for new costume design and theres take a breath mavis eve advised as her friend babbled and continually pushed canapes into her mouth adjust the speed im so nervous with her hands momentarily free mavis pressed them to her stomach bare but for an artistic rendering of a ripe red orchid i cant level you know when im this hyped ive just gotta eat and talk and eat and talk and throw up if you dont slow down eve warned she scanned the room and had to admit that mavis was right roarke knew how to dish up a party the room glittered and so did the people even the food seemed to be glossy and polished almost too ornamental to eat though you couldnt prove that by mavis since the weather had cooperated the roof was open inviting in the fresh breeze and showers of starlight one wall was filled with a view screen and mavis whirled and pranced over it her music sizzling out into the room roarke had been canny enough to keep the volume muted im never going to be able to pay you back for this come on mavis no i mean it after sending leonardo a beaming smile and an exaggerated air kiss she turned back to eve you and me dallas we go back awhile hell if you hadnt busted me id probably still be picking pockets and running the grift eve chose an interestinglooking blot on a cracker for herself thats digging deep mavis maybe but it doesnt change the facts i did a lot to straighten myself out and change direction im kind of proud of it remaking ourselves eve thought it could happen it did happen she glanced over to where reeanna and william were chatting with mira and her spouse you should be im proud of you but what im talking about is this i want to get it out okay before i get up there and try to blow the diamonds off the ears of this group mavis cleared her throat and promptly forgot the little speech shed prepared hell with it i know you and i really love you like really love you dallas christ mavis dont start getting me all weepy roarkes already drugged me unashamed mavis swiped her hand under her nose youd have done this for me if you knew how when eve blinked and frowned mavis found her sentiment turning to amusement shit dallas you wouldnt have the first clue how to order up anything more complicated than soy dogs and veggie hash roarkes hands are all over this bash my hands are all over it roarkes words echoed in eves mind and made her shudder yeah they are you asked him to do it and he did it for you determined to let nothing shadow the evening eve shook off the dread she shook her head he did it for you mavis slowly maviss lips curved and her eyes got misty again yeah i guess he did youve got a fucking prince dallas a fucking prince ive got to go throw up now be right back sure with a half laugh eve grabbed some fizzy water from a passing tray and headed for roarke excuse me one minute she said and tugged him away from a group of people youre a fucking prince she told him why thank you i think he slid an arm around her waist gently put his other hand over hers that held the stem of her glass he surprised her by moving her into a very smooth dance you have to use your imagination with maviss style he decided but this one could almost be considered romantic eve lifted a brow and tuned in to maviss voice rising over clashing brass yeah its a real oldfashioned sentimental tune im a lousy dancer you wouldnt be if you didnt try to lead i decided since you werent going to sit down and rest that battered body of yours you could lean on me awhile he smiled down at her youre starting to limp again just a bit but you do look almost relaxed the knees a little stiff eve admitted but i am pretty relaxed i guess it was listening to mavis babble shes throwing up now lovely its just nerves thanks she went with impulse and gave him one of her rare public kisses youre welcome for for making sure were not eating soy dogs and veggie hash my pleasure he drew her closer keeping his arms easy believe me its my pleasure well peabody wears basic black and a mild concussion well he noted what jerking back eve followed his gaze and spotted her aide just coming through the wide double doors and snagging a flute off a tray she should be flat on her back eve muttered and pulled away from roarke excuse me while i go put her there she stalked across the room eyes narrowing as peabody tried out a toothy smile some party lieutenant thanks for the invite what the hell are you doing out of bed its just a bump on the head and all they were doing was poking at me i wasnt going to let a little thing like an explosion keep me from doing a party at roarkes are you on meds just a couple of regulation pain blockers and her face fell when eve snatched the champagne out of her hand i was just going to hold it really hold this eve suggested and shoved her water into peabodys hand i ought to cart your butt right back to the health center you didnt go peabody muttered then lifted her chin and im off duty on personal time you cant order me back however much she sympathized and admired determination eve held firm no liquor she snapped out no dancing but i hauled you out of that building today and i can haul you out of here by the way peabody eve added you could lose a few pounds so my mothers always telling me peabody huffed out a breath no liquor no dancing now if youve finished with the restrictions im going to go talk to somebody who doesnt know me fine oh peabody peabody turned scowling yes sir you did good today i wont have to think twice about going through the door with you as eve walked away peabody gaped after her it had been simply even casually said but it was the finest professional compliment shed ever been given o o socializing wasnt eves favorite pastime but she did her best she even resigned herself to dancing when she couldnt slide her way out of it so she found herself being steered it was the way she thought about dancing around the floor by jess your pal william jess began more roarkes pal i dont know him well anyhow he had some interesting input on designing an interactive to go with this disc bring the audience into the music into mavis brow lifted eve glanced back to the screen mavis was swiveling her barely covered hips and shrieking about burning up in the fire of love while red and gold flames spurted around her you actually think people would want to go in there he chuckled let his voice cruise deeper south sugar theyll trample each other to get in and pay big for the chance and if they do she said turning back to him you get a nice fat percentage thats standard on development deals like this check with your man hell tell you mavis made her choice she softened noting that several guests were absorbed in the screen show id say she made a good one we both did i think weve got a hit he told her and when we give them a taste of the show live and in the flesh well if the roof wasnt already off wed blow it off youre not nervous she looked at him confident eyes cocky mouth no youre not nervous ive been playing for my supper for too many years its a job he smiled at her walked his fingers casually up her back you dont get nervous tracking killers revved right psyched but not nervous depends she thought of what she was tracking now and her stomach fluttered no youre steel i could see that the first time i looked at you you dont give you dont back off you dont flinch it makes your brain well your makeup so to speak a fascination what drives eve dallas justice revenge duty morality id say its a very unique combination of all of those fueled by a conflict of confidence and selfdoubt youve got a strong sense of whats right and youre constantly questioning who you are she wasnt sure she liked the turn of the conversation what are you a musician or a shrink creative people study other people and music is a science as much as an art an emotion as much as a science his silvery eyes stayed on hers as he guided her smoothly around other couples when i design a series of notes i want it to affect people i have to understand even study human nature if im to get the right reaction how will this make them behave make them think make them feel eve spared an absent smile as william and reeanna danced by absorbed in each other i thought it was for entertainment thats the surface just the surface his eyes were excited gleaming with it as he spoke any music hack can run a theme through a computer and come out with a competent tune the music business has gotten more and more ordinary and predictable because of technology brows lifted eve glanced toward the screen and mavis id have to say i dont hear anything ordinary or predictable here exactly ive put in time studying how tones notes and rhythms affect people and i know what buttons to push mavis is a treasure shes so open so malleable he smiled when eves eyes hardened i meant that as a compliment not that shes weak but shes a risk taker a woman whos willing to strip herself down and become a vessel for the message the message is depends on the mind of the audience the hopes and dreams i wonder about your dreams dallas so do i she thought but she met his gaze blandly id rather stick with reality dreams are deceptive no no theyre revealing the mind and the unconscious mind in particular is a canvas we paint on it constantly art and music can add such colors such style medical science has understood that for decades and uses it to treat and study certain conditions both psychological and physiological she angled her head was there another message here you sound more like a scientist than a musician now ive blended one day youll be able to pick a song personally designed for your own brain waves the mood enhancement capabilities will be endless and intimate thats the key intimacy she sensed he was making a pitch and stopped dancing i wouldnt think it would be cost effective and research into technology designed to analyze and coordinate with individual brain waves is illegal for good reason its dangerous not at all he disagreed its liberating new processes any sort of real progress usually starts out as illegal as for the cost it would be high initially then come down as the design was adjusted for mass production whats a brain but a computer after all you have a computer analyze a computer what could be simpler he glanced over at the screen thats the intro for the last number ive got to check my equipment before my cue he leaned in kissed her cheek lightly wish us luck yeah luck she murmured but her stomach was knotted what was a brain but a computer computers analyzing computers individualized programs designed for personal brain wave patterns if it was possible would it be possible to add suggestive programs linked directly with the users brain she shook her head roarke would never have approved it he wouldnt have taken such a foolish risk but she made her way through the crowd to him laid a hand on his arm i need to ask you a question she said quietly have any of your companies been doing underthetable research on designing vr for personal brain wave patterns thats illegal lieutenant roarke no there was a time when i would have ventured into any number of not essentially legal areas in business that wouldnt have been one of them and no he added anticipating her that vr model is universally not individually designed only the programs can be personalized by the user what youre talking about is cost prohibitive logistically tangled and simply too damn much trouble okay thats what i figured her muscles relaxed but can it be done he paused a moment then lifted his shoulder i have no idea youd have to have the individuals cooperation or access to a brain scan that also involves personal approval and consent and then i have no idea he repeated if i can get feeney alone she swiveled her head trying to find the electronics detective in the whirling crowd take the evening off lieutenant roarke slipped an arm around her mavis is about to get her spotlight okay she forced herself to push the worry to the back of her mind as jess settled at his console and gave an introductory riff tomorrow she promised herself and led the applause as mavis spun onto the floor then the worry was gone melted away by the blast of maviss energy and her own wild pleasure as lights music and showmanship combined in a dizzy kaleidoscope shes good isnt she she was unaware shed gripped roarkes arm like a mother with a child in the school play different weird but good shes all of that the clashing edge of notes sound effects and vocals would never be his music of choice but he found himself grinning shes caught the crowd you can relax im relaxed he laughed and hugged her closer if you were wearing buttons youd pop them he didnt mind the fact that he had to put his mouth on her ear for her to hear him and since he was there anyway he added an inventive suggestion for after the party what she went hot all over i believe that particular act is illegal in this state ill check my code book and get back to you cut it out she hunched up her shoulder in reaction as his teeth and tongue got busy on her earlobe i want you lust prickled over his skin like a rash instant itchy immediate right now you cant be serious she began but she found he was fiercely when his mouth closed over hers in a wild and urgent kiss blood thudded her pulse to vibrant life and the muscles in her thighs went limp get ahold of yourself she managed to ease back a half inch and was breathless shocked and very near blushing not everyones attention was focused on mavis were in the middle of an event here a public one then lets leave he was hard as rock painfully ready there was a wolf inside him poised to lunge there are a lot of private rooms in this house she would have laughed if she hadnt felt the need vibrating from him get a grip roarke this is maviss big moment were not running off into a closet like a couple of randy teenagers yes we are half blind he pulled her through the crowd and out of it while she babbled in stunned protest this is nuts what are you a pleasure droid you can damn well hold yourself in check for a couple of hours the hell with it he yanked open the closest door and shoved her inside what was indeed a closet now goddamn it her back rapped up against the wall and before she could so much as gasp he pulled up her skirts and drove himself into her she was dry unprepared shocked ravaged was all she could think as she bit down on her lip to keep from crying out he was rough careless and sent the bruises singing as he rammed her over and over into the wall even as she shoved at him he pounded into her his hands hiking up her hips digging in and ripping a startled cry of pain from her throat she could have stopped him her training was thorough but training had dissolved into sheer feminine distress she couldnt see his face wasnt sure shed recognize it if she could roarke it was shock bone deep that quavered in her voice youre hurting me he muttered something a language she didnt understand and had never heard so she stopped struggling gripped his shoulders and shut her eyes to what was happening to both of them still he plowed into her hands digging into her hips to keep her open for him his breath whistling in her ear he took her brutally and with none of the finesse or control that was such an innate part of him he couldnt stop even as part of his brain stepped back appalled at what he was doing he simply couldnt stop the need was like a cancer eating at him and he had to sate it to survive there was a voice somewhere in his head greedy and gasping harder faster more it drove him pushed him until with one final vicious thrust he emptied she held on it was that or slide to the floor he was shuddering like a man with a fever and she didnt know whether to soothe him or belt him goddamn it roarke but when he pressed a hand to the wall to keep balance as he swayed she lost any sense of insult in worry hey what is it how much have you had to drink anyway come on lean on me no with the violent need met his mind cleared and remorse was a hot weight in his belly he shook off the dizziness and eased himself back good god eve good god im sorry im so sorry okay its okay he was sheet white shed never seen him look even remotely ill and was terrified i should get summerset somebody youve got to lie down stop it he very carefully nudged away her stroking hands and stepped back until they were no longer touching how could she bear to have him touch her for christs sake i raped you i just raped you no she said it firmly hoping the tone of her voice would be as effective as a slap you did not i know what rape is what you did wasnt rape even if it was a little overenthusiastic i hurt you when she reached out he held up his hands to stop her goddamn it eve youre bruised from head to foot and i shoved you against the wall in some fucking closet and used you used you like a okay she stepped forward but he shook his head dont back away from me roarke thats what will hurt dont do that i need a minute he rubbed his hands over his face he still felt lightheaded and queasy and worse slightly out of himself christ i need a drink which brings me back to my question how much have you had not enough im not drunk eve he dropped his hands and looked around a closet was all he could think for gods pity a closet i dont know what happened what came over me im sorry i can see that but she still couldnt see the whole picture you kept saying something weird like liomsa his eyes darkened its gaelic mine it means i havent used gaelic in not since i was a boy my father used it often when he was on a drunk he hesitated then he reached out to graze his fingertips over her cheek i was so rough with you so careless im not one of your crystal vases roarke i can take it not like that he thought of the whimpers and protests of the alley whores that had come through the thin walls and haunted him when his father had bedded them never like that i never thought of you i didnt care and theres no excuse she didnt want him humble it unnerved her well youre too busy beating yourself up for me to bother so lets go back he touched her arm before she could open the door eve i dont know what happened literally one minute we were standing there listening to mavis and the next it was overpowering vicious like my life depended on having you not just sex but survival i couldnt control it thats not excusing what wait she leaned back against the door a moment struggled to separate woman from cop wife from detective youre not exaggerating no it was like a fist around my throat he managed a very weak smile well perhaps thats the wrong portion of the anatomy theres nothing i can say or do to eject the guilt a minute will you and think her eyes were cold now hard as agate a sudden and irresistible urge more a compulsion one you a very controlled man couldnt control you just pounded yourself into me with all the finesse of a sweaty celibate breaking fast with a rented sex droid he winced at that felt the tear of guilt im all too aware of that and its not your style roarke youve got moves i cant keep up with all of them but theyre all slick practiced you may get rough but never mean and as one whos made love with you in about every way thats anatomically possible i can certify that youre never selfish well he wasnt quite certain how to react you humble me it wasnt you she murmured i beg to differ it wasnt what youve made yourself into she corrected and thats what counts you snapped off something inside you snapped off or on that son of a bitch her breath shuddered out as she met roarkes eyes and in them she saw the dawning of understanding that son of a bitch has something he was telling me while we were dancing he was fucking bragging and i didnt get it but he just had to give a little demonstration and thats whats going to hang him this time roarkes grip on her arm was firm youre talking about jess barrow about brain scans and suggestions mind control music should affect how people behave how they think how they feel he said that to me minutes before the performance began cocky bastard roarke remembered the shock in her eyes when hed thrown her against the wall and driven himself into her like a battering ram if youre right his voice was cool now too cool i want a moment alone with him its police business she began but he stepped slightly closer and his eyes were cold and determined youll give me a moment alone with him or ill find a way to take it either way ill have it all right she laid a hand over his not to ease his grip but in solidarity all right but youll wait your turn i have to be sure ill wait he agreed but the man would pay roarke promised himself for wedging even one instant of fear and distrust into their relationship ill let the performance wind up first she decided ill interview him unofficially in my office downstairs with peabody as control dont make a move on him roarke i mean that he opened the door let her slip out i said id wait the music was still going strong and it hit them with a high gritty pitch yards before they reached the doorway but she had only to step in and through the crowd before jesss eyes shifted from his controls and met hers his smile was quick cocky amused and she was sure find peabody and ask her to go down to my office and set up for a prelim interview she stepped in front of roarke willed his gaze to move to hers please were not talking about just a personal insult here were talking about murder let me do my job roarke turned without a word the moment she lost him in the crowd she worked her way through to summerset i want you to watch roarke i beg your pardon listen to me her fingers dug through his neat jacket and into bone its important he could be in trouble i dont want you to let him out of your sight until at least an hour after the performance if anything happens to him ill fry your ass understood not in the least but he did understand her urgency very well he spoke with dignity crossed the room with grace but his nerves were shattered confident that summerset would watch roarke like a mother hawk she wound her way through the audience again until she stood on the front edge of the group she applauded with the rest schooled herself to flash a supportive smile as mavis wound up for the encore and when the next round of applause rang out she slipped toward jess and skirted the controls quite a triumph she murmured i told you shes a treasure there was a wicked gleam in his eyes as he smiled up at her you and roarke missed a couple of numbers some personal business she said levelly i really need to talk to you jess about your music glad to nothing i like better now if you dont mind lets go someplace a little more private sure he shut down his console locked on the code its your party damn right it is she murmured and led the way chapter fifteen she chose the elevator wanting to move quickly and privately she programmed it for the short vertical glide then the horizontal shift from wing to wing ive got to tell you you and roarke have a fantastic place here just ultra mag oh itll do until we find something bigger she said it dryly and refused to let his laughter grate on her nerves tell me jess did you decide to work with mavis seriously before or after you knew the connection with roarke i told you mavis is one in a million only had to see her a couple of times doing a short gig down at the down and dirty to know wed meld well the grin flashed charming a choirboy holding a frog under his robe it sure didnt hurt a thing that she had a contact like roarke on her side but she had to have the goods but you knew about the connection before he moved a shoulder id heard about it thats why i went down to see her that kind of club isnt my usual venue but she flashed for me if i can move her into some hot gigs then if roarke or someone of his ilk lets say is interested in investing in a coming act it smooths everybody youre smooth jess she stepped out of the car when the doors slid open real smooth like i said ive been shaking gigs since i was a kid i think i got it down he looked around the corridor as she led the way old art the real thing he noted pricey wood carpet some craftsman had worn his fingers weaving a century before this was money he thought the kind that built empires at the doorway of her office she turned i dont know how much hes got she said reading him perfectly and i dont really care the smile still in place he lifted a brow lowered his gaze to the fat tearshaped diamond lying against the bodice of soft midnight silk but you aint wearing paste and rags sugar i have and i might again and jess she flicked off the coded lock dont call me sugar eve glided in nodded to a puzzled but attentive peabody have a seat she told jess and moved directly to her desk nice milieu well hi sweetie he couldnt for the life of him remember her name but he beamed at peabody as if they were old dear friends did you catch the act most of it he dropped into a chair so what do you think i thought it was great you and mavis really put on a show she risked a smile not at all sure what eve wanted from her im ready to buy the first disc thats what i like to hear can a guy get a drink in here he asked eve i like to stay dry before a performance and im more than ready to get wet no problem what would you like that champagne looked good peabody there should be a bottle in the kitchen pour our guest here a glass of wine will you and why dont you get us some coffee she leaned back and considered technically she should record from this point but she wanted a leadin before she went on log someone like you who designs music and the atmosphere surrounding it has to be as much technician as artist right thats what you were explaining to me before the performance thats the way the business shakes down now has for a lot of years he flicked one of his beautiful hands braceleted with gold im lucky ive got an aptitude for both and an interest the days of plucking out a tune on the piano or playing a riff on a guitar have gone the way of fossil fuel almost extinct whered you get your tech training id have to say its way above run of the mill he shot a fresh smile as peabody came back with the drinks he was comfortable relaxed and assumed he was in the middle of a kind of job interview on the job mostly a lot of latenight hacking but i did a stretch of home ed with mit she already knew some of the data from peabodys make but she wanted to lull him impressive youve made a name for yourself both in performance and design isnt that right peabody yeah ive got all your discs and im looking forward to something new its been a while i heard that somewhere eve picked up the ball peabody was unaware shed tossed have a dry spell jess not at all i wanted to take my time perfecting the new equipment putting together just the right elements when i hit with the new stuff its going to be something no ones ever seen or heard before and mavis is like a springboard in a manner of speaking she was a lucky break shell showcase some of the material that wasnt right for me and ive individualized some pieces to match her i figure on doing some of my own sessions in a few months after everythings in place he toasted her sipped exactly you ever design soundtracks for vr now and again its not a bad gig if the programs interesting and i bet you know how to lay down subliminals he paused then sipped again subliminals thats straight tech but youre a damn good tech arent you jess good enough to know computers in and out and brains a brains just a computer isnt it isnt that what you told me sure his focus was all for eve so that he didnt notice that peabody had come to attention and youre into mood enhancements which lead to mood shifts behavioral and emotional patterns brain wave patterns she took a recorder out of her desk placed it in plain sight lets talk about that what the hell is this he set down his glass scooted to the edge of his seat whats the deal the deal is im going to advise you of your rights then were going to have a chat officer peabody engage backup recording and log on please i didnt agree to a fucking interview he got to his feet eve got to hers thats all right we can make it obligatory and take you to cop central there might be a wait i havent booked an interview room but you wont mind spending a few hours in lockup slowly he sat again you turn cop fast dallas no i dont i stay cop always dallas lieutenant eve she began for the recorder and fed in time and place before reciting the revised miranda do you understand your rights and options jess yeah i get it but i dont know what the hell this is about im going to make that very clear for you you are being questioned in the matters of the unresolved deaths of drew mathias s t fitzhugh senator george pearly and cerise devane who he looked convincingly baffled devane isnt that the woman who jumped off the tattler building what am i supposed to have to do with suicide i didnt even know her you were unaware that cerise devane was ceo and majority stockholder of tattler enterprises no i guess i knew who she was but i imagine you found yourself in the tattler from time to time during your career sure theyre always digging for dirt theyve tossed some my way its just part of the business fear had backed off and left him mildly irritated look the lady jumped i was downtown in session when she took the leap ive got witnesses mavis for one i know you werent there jess i was at least i know you werent there in the flesh his sculpted mouth curled into a sneer what am i a goddamn ghost do you know or have you ever had contact with an autotronics tech by the name of drew mathias never heard of him mathias also did a pass through mit so have thousands i opted for inhome i never even set foot on campus and never had any contact with other students sure i did over the link email laser fax whatever he shrugged his shoulders drummed his fingers over the top of the handtooled boot hed cocked on his knee i dont remember any autotronics tech by that name she decided to change tacks how much work have you done on individualized subliminals i dont know what youre talking about you dont understand the term i know what it means this time his shrug was jerky and as far as i know its never been done so i dont know what youre asking me eve took a chance she looked over at her aide do you know what im asking him peabody i think its clear enough lieutenant she was struggling through the mud of confusion youd like to know how much work the interview subject has done on individualized subliminals perhaps the interview subject should be reminded that it is not currently illegal to research or have an interest in this area only development and implementation are against current state federal and international laws very good peabody does that help clear things up for you jess the byplay had given him enough time to settle sure im interested in the area lots of people are its a little out of your field isnt it youre just a musician not a licensed scientist it was exactly the right button his sat up in his chair his eyes flashing once im fully certified in musicology music isnt just a bunch of notes strung together sweetheart its life its memory songs trigger specific and often predictable emotional reactions musics an expression of emotion desires and here i thought it was just a nice way to pass the time entertainment is only a slice of the pie the celts went to war with bagpipes they were as much a weapon to them as a broadax warring natives in africa psyched themselves up with drums slaves survived on their spirituals and men have been seducing women to music for centuries music plays the mind which brings us back to the question when did you decide to take it a step further and tie in to individual brain patterns did you just stumble across it sort of blind luck while you were noodling out a tune he gave a short laugh you really think what i do is just a slide dont you just sit down punch in some notes and go its work its hard demanding work and youre damned proud of your work arent you come on jess you wanted to tell me earlier eve rose came around the desk to sit on the front edge youve been dying to tell me to tell someone what good is it what satisfaction is there in creating something so amazing then having to keep it to yourself he picked up his glass again ran his fingers down the long slim stem this isnt exactly the way id pictured this he took a sip considered the consequences and the rewards mavis says you can be flexible its not just code books and procedure with you oh i can be flexible jess when its warranted talk to me well lets just say that if hypothetically i had worked out a technique for individualized subs mood enhancements on a personal brain pattern it could be big people like roarke and you with your contacts and financial base your influence lets say could work around a few antiquated laws and make a big pile revolutionize the personal entertainment and enhancement industry while you were at it is this a business offer hypothetically he said and gestured with his glass roarke industries has the r and d the facilities the man power and the credits to take something like this and run with it and a smart cop seems to me could find a way to bend the law just enough to make it go down smooth gosh lieutenant peabody said with a smile that didnt touch her eyes sounds like you and roarke are the perfect couple hypothetically and mavis as the conduit eve murmured hey mavis is chilled she got what she wanted after tonight shes going to cruise and you figure that evens out using her to get to roarke he moved a shoulder again backs gotta be scratched honey i gave hers a real full treatment the wicked amusement flashed into his eyes again did you enjoy the informal demonstration of my hypothetical system not certain even her training could keep the fury off her face she turned slipped back behind the desk demonstration the night you and roarke came by the studio to watch the session seemed to me you two were pretty eager to leave to be alone his smile sharpened at the corners a little honeymoon revisited she kept her hands behind the desk a moment until she could unclutch her fists she glanced over toward the door of roarkes connecting office and saw with a jolt that the monitoring light blinked green over it he was watching she realized that was not only illegal but dangerous under the circumstances she flicked her eyes back to jess she couldnt afford to break rhythm it seems youre unusually interested in my sex life i told you you fascinate me dallas youve got a mind its fucking steel with all these dark spaces burned into it i wonder what would happen if you opened those spaces and sex is a master key he leaned forward eyes locked on hers what do you dream dallas she remembered the dreams the sick horror of them the night shed watched the disc of mavis the disc hed given her her hands trembled once before she could control them you son of a bitch she rose slowly planted her hands on the desk you like giving demonstrations asshole is that what mathias was to you a demonstration i told you i dont know who that is maybe you needed an autotron tech to perfect your system then you tried it out on him you had his brain waves so you programmed them in did you program in him tying his own noose and slipping it around his neck or did you leave the method up to him you just veered way out of orbit and pearly whats the connection there political statement were you looking ahead youre a real visionary hed have tossed his weight against legalizing your new toy why not use it on him hold it hold it he got to his feet youre talking about murder christ youre trying to wrap me up with murder then fitzhugh did you need a couple more demonstrations jess or did you just get a taste for it powerful isnt it being able to kill without getting your hands bloody i never killed anyone you cant wrap this on me devane was a bonus with the media right there you got to watch i bet you really love to watch dont you jess i bet you got hot watching like you got hot thinking about where youd push roarke tonight with your goddamn toy thats whats rocking you isnt it furious he leaned on the desk his smile wasnt charming now but feral you want to sting me because i wired into your man you should be thanking me i bet the two of you fucked like wild minks her hand was in a fist her fist slamming into his jaw before her brain registered the act he went down like a stone face first arms splayed and sent her link flying goddamn it breath hitching she uncurled her fist clutched it again goddamn it peabodys voice came cool and calm through the buzzing in her ears let the backup record show that subject physically threatened the lieutenant during questioning as a result subject lost his balance and struck his head on the desk he appears to be momentarily stunned while eve could do no more than stare at her peabody rose stepped over and dragged jess up by the collar of his shirt she held him there a moment as if considering his condition his knees sagged his eyes rolled back white thats affirmative she stated then dumped him into a chair lieutenant dallas i believe your recorder has been damaged with a brush of her hand peabody tipped eves coffee onto the unit effectively frying its chips mine is in working order and will be sufficient for reporting this interview are you injured no eve shut her eyes snapped her control back into place no im fine thank you the interview breaks at oh one thirtythree subject jess barrow will be transported to the brightmore health center for examination and treatment and there be detained until nine hundred hours when this interview will continue at cop central officer peabody please arrange for transport subject is to be held for questioning charges pending yes sir peabody glanced over as the door to roarkes office slid open it only took one look at his face to realize that there might be trouble lieutenant she began careful to keep the recorder turned away im getting interference on my communicator and your link may have been damaged when the subject knocked it to the floor permission to use another room to send for the mts go ahead eve said and sighed as she watched roarke come in and peabody stride out you had no business monitoring this interview she began i beg to differ i had every business he glanced down at the chair as jess moaned and shifted hes coming around id like my moment with him now listen roarke he cut her off with one swift iceedged stare now eve leave us alone that was the trouble between them she decided both of them were so used to giving orders that neither of them took orders well but she remembered the stricken look in his eyes when hed backed away from her they had both been used she thought but roarke had been victimized youve got five minutes thats it and im going to warn you right now the record shows hes relatively undamaged if there are marks on him its going to swing back on me and compromise my case against him his lips twitched in a bare flicker of a smile as he took her arm and led her to the door lieutenant give me some credit im a civilized man he shut the door in her face locked it and he thought he knew how to cause great discomfort to the human body without leaving so much as a dent he walked over hauled jess out of the chair and shook him until his eyes blinked into focus awake now are you roarke said softly and aware sweat pooled cold at the base of jesss spine he was looking into the face of murder and he knew it i want a lawyer youre not dealing with the cops now youre dealing with me at least for the next five minutes and you have no rights or privileges here jess swallowed struggled for a show of cool you cant lay a hand on me if you do itll slap right back on your wife roarkes lips curved and struck a fresh fist of terror in jesss gut im going to show you just how mistaken you are in that his eyes never left jesss face as he reached down grabbed onto his penis and twisted it was some satisfaction to see every drop of blood drain out of the mans face and watch his mouth work like a guppys as it gasped for air with his thumb he pressed gently on jesss windpipe and cut off even that thin passage of air until the silver eyes bulged hell isnt it to be led around by the cock he gave one last jerk of the wrist before letting jess collapse into the chair and curl up like a shrimp now lets talk he said pleasantly enough about private matters out in the corridor eve paced up and down glancing every few seconds at the thick door she knew very well if roarke had implemented the soundproofing jess could be shrieking his lungs out and she wouldnt hear if he killed him good god if he killed him how was she going to handle it she stopped appalled and pressed a hand to her stomach how could she even consider it she was duty bound to protect the bastard there were rules whatever her personal feelings there were rules she marched to the door coded in and hissed out a breath as her code was denied son of a bitch goddamn it roarke he knew her too well with little hope she raced down the corridor into his office and tried the connecting door entrance denied she streaked to the monitor cued up the security camera for her office and found hed locked her out of that as well god almighty he is killing him she rushed the door again beat on it uselessly with her fist moments later like magic the locks slicked back and the door slid quietly open she went through at a dead run and saw roarke calmly sitting at her desk smoking her heart pounded as she looked down at jess he was pale as death his pupils the size of pinpricks but he was breathing in fact he was wheezing out air like a faulty temperature control hes unmarked roarke picked up the brandy hed poured himself and i believe hes begun to see the error of his ways eve leaned down peered closely into jesss eyes and watched him cringe back into the chair like a kicked dog the sound he made was barely human what the hell did you do to him he doubted eve or the nypsd would approve of the tricks hed picked up in his more shadowy travels much less than he deserved she straightened and now took a long hard look at roarke he looked like a man about to entertain late night guests or chair an important business meeting his suit was unwrinkled his hair unmussed his hands perfectly steady but his eyes she noted were just on the down side of wild christ youre scary carefully he set his brandy down ill never hurt you again roarke she pushed back the urge to go to him close her arms around him it wasnt what the moment called for she decided or what he wanted this cant be personal yes he drew in smoke blew it out slowly it can and is lieutenant peabody stepped in her face bland the mts are here with your permission ill accompany the suspect to the health center ill go sir peabody slid a glance toward roarke hed yet to take his eyes off eve she noted and those eyes looked more than a little dangerous if youll excuse me i believe you have more pressing matters here i can handle this you still have a number of guests in the house including the press im sure youd prefer this matter remain quiet until its disposition all right ill contact central from here make the necessary arrangements prepare for second phase interview tomorrow nine hundred hours im looking forward to it peabody glanced over at jess lifted a brow he must have hit his head pretty hard still looks dazed skins clammy she offered roarke a wide smile i know just how that feels roarke laughed feeling more of the tension drain away no peabody in this case i dont believe you do he got up walked to her and framing her square face with his elegant hands kissed her youre beautiful he murmured before turning to eve ill see to the rest of our guests take your time as he walked out peabody touched her fingertips to her lips pleasure had radiated down to her toes and out through the reinforced tips of her boots oh wow im beautiful dallas i owe you peabody i think i just got paid she stepped back to the door here come the mts well get our boy out of here tell mavis she was absolutely ultra mavis eve pressed her fingers to her eyes how was she going to tell mavis if i were you dallas id give her tonight to glow you can tell her about this later shell be fine in here she called gesturing we got us what looks like a mild concussion chapter sixteen getting a warrant for search and seizure at two in the morning was a tricky business she lacked the straightforward data to cop an automatic clearance and needed a judge judges tended to be cranky about calls in the middle of the night and trying to explain why she needed clearance for a sweep and scan of a music console currently on her own premises was a dicey job this being the case eve tolerated the clipped angry lecture from her judge of choice i understand that your honor but this cant wait until a decent hour in the morning i have a strong suspicion that the console in question is linked to the deaths of four people its designer and operator is currently being detained and i cannot expect his immediate cooperation youre telling me music kills lieutenant the judge snorted i could have told you that the crap theyre pumping out these days could murder an elephant in my day we had music springsteen live cult killers that was music yes sir she rolled her eyes shed had to pick a classic music buff i really need that warrant your honor captain feeney is available to begin the initial scan the operator had admitted to using the console illegally on the record i need more to tie it to the cases in question you ask me those music consoles should be banned and burned this is piddly shit here lieutenant not if the evidence bears out my belief that this console and its operator are linked to the death of senator pearly and others there was a pause a wheeze thats a big leap no pun intended yes sir i need the warrant to bridge the gap ill send it through but you better have something lieutenant and it better be solid thank you sorry to have disturbed the link clicked in her ear forcefully your sleep she finished then picked up her communicator and tagged feeney hey dallas his face was flushed with fun wide with a grin where ya been kid partys just breaking up you missed mavis doing a set with a hologram of the rolling stones you know how i feel about jagger yeah hes like a father to you dont take off feeney ive got a job for you job its two am and my wifes feeling you know he winked sloppily interested sorry put the glands on hold roarke will arrange to have your wife taken home ill be up in ten take a dose of soberup if you need it it could be a long night soberup his face fell into its usual morose lines ive been working all night to get drunk whats this about ten minutes she repeated and cut him off she took the time to change out of the party dress and discovered bruises she hadnt been aware of throbbing fresh she took a quick moment to slap a coat of numbing cream where she could reach and winced her way into a shirt and trousers still she was true to her word and walked onto the roof terrace ten minutes later roarke had been at work here she noted and had cleared out lingering guests if there were any stragglers he was dealing with them elsewhere giving her a clear stage feeney sat alone on a chair beside a decimated buffet spread glumly eating pate you sure know how to put me out of a party mood dallas the wife was so dazzled to get a limo ride home she forgot she was going to jump me and mavis was looking all over for you i think she was a little hurt you didnt hang around to congratulate her ill make it up to her her portalink hummed signaling an incoming transmission she read the display hit print out heres our warrant warrant he reached for a truffle and popped it in his mouth for what eve shifted gestured toward the console for that ready to work your magic feeney swallowed the truffle looked toward the console the light some would have called love gleamed in his eyes you want me to play with that hot damn he was up almost bounding toward the equipment and running reverent hands over it she heard him mumbling something about tx high velocity sound trips and mirror merging capabilities the warrant clears me to override his lock off code it does feeney its serious youre telling me he lifted his hands rubbing fingertips together like an oldworld safe cracker about to hit the big time this baby is one serious mother the designs inspired the payloads off the scale its very likely responsible for four deaths eve interrupted she walked over to join him let me bring you up to date within twenty minutes using the portable kit out of his car feeney was at work eve couldnt understand what he was muttering about and he didnt take it kindly when she leaned over his shoulder that gave her time to pace then to call in for a report on jesss status she had just finished ordering peabody to turn duty over to a uniform guard and go home to get some sleep when roarke came in i gave your regrets to our guests he told her and helped himself to another brandy i explained that youd been called to duty suddenly i had much sympathy on living with a cop i tried to tell you it was a bad deal he only smiled but the smile didnt quite reach his eyes it placated mavis shes hoping youll get in touch tomorrow i will ill need to explain things did she ask about barrow i told her he was indisposed rather abruptly he didnt touch her he wanted to but he wasnt quite ready youre hurting eve i can see it you pinch my nose again and ill flatten you feeney and i have a lot of work here and i have to be sharp im not fragile roarke the message was in her eyes asking him to put it aside get used to it not yet he put down his brandy slipped his hands into his pockets i could help there he said inclining his head toward feeney its police business youre not authorized to touch that unit when he only shifted his eyes back to hers with some of the old humor in them she let out a huge sigh its up to feeney she snapped he outranks me and if he wants your fingers in his pie its his deal i dont want to know about it ive got reports to put together she started out irritation in every body line eve when she stopped and scowled over her shoulder at him he shook his head nothing he lifted his shoulders feeling helpless nothing he said again put it to bed goddamn it youre pissing me off she stalked out nearly making him smile i love you too he murmured then wandered toward feeney what have we here brings tears to my eyes i swear it its beautiful brilliant i tell you the guys a genius certified come here and take a look at this image board just look at it roarke slipped off his jacket hunkered down and went to work o o she never went to bed for once eve buried her prejudice and took her sanctioned dose of uppers the alert all cleared the drag of fatigue and most of the cobwebs from her brain she used the shower off her office broke down and wrapped an ice bandage over her sore knee and told herself shed deal with the bruises later it was six am when she went back to the roof terrace the console had been methodically taken apart wires boards chips discs drives panels were arranged over the gleaming floor in what she could only assume were organized piles in his elegant silk shirt and tailored slacks roarke sat crosslegged among them diligently entering data in a logbook hed tied his hair back she noted to keep it from falling over his face and that face was intense focused the dark blue eyes ridiculously alert for the hour ive got that he muttered to feeney running the components now ive seen something like this before something close its calibrating he held the logbook out and under the kick panel of the console have a look a hand shot out grabbed the logbook yeah this could do it it could fucking do it suck my dick irishmen have such a way with words at eves dry tone feeneys head popped up his hair stuck straight up as if hed shocked himself while fiddling with the electronics his eyes were bright and wild hey dallas i think we just nailed it what took you so long what a kidder feeneys head disappeared again eve exchanged a long sober study with roarke good morning lieutenant youre not here she said as she walked past him i dont see you here what have you got feeney got a lot of options on this baby he began and popped up again to settle in the molded chair of the console lotsa doodads and they are impressive but the one we had to dig deep to find under layers of some pretty hunky security is the honey he ran his hands over the console again stroking fingers over the smooth surface that now topped empty guts the designer would have made a hell of an edetective most of the guys under me cant do what he can creativity see he wagged a finger at her its not just formulas and boards creativity turns the corner into an open field this guys walked that field he fucking owns it and this is what hed call his crowning glory he offered the logbook knowing shed scowl over the codes and components so it took some art to get down to that he had it locked under his private pass his voice pattern his palm print some layers of fail safe too nearly blew ourselves up about an hour ago right roarke roarke rose and tucked his hands in his pockets i never doubted you for an instant captain like hell in tune with his man feeney grinned if you werent saying your prayers boyo i was saying mine still i cant think of many others id be pleased to be blown to hell with the feelings nearly mutual if you two have finished your little male bonding dance would you care to explain what the hell im supposed to be looking at here its a scanner the most intricate ive seen outside of testing testing it was a procedure every cop dreaded and one every cop faced whenever they were forced to set their weapon on maximum for termination even though every member of nypsds brain pattern is on record a scans taken during testing search for damage flaws any abnormalities that might have contributed to the use of maximum force that scans compared with the last taken then the subject is taken on a couple of vr rides that use the data downloaded from the scan nasty business feeney had only faced it once and hoped never to go through the process again and hes managed to duplicate or simulate that process eve asked id say hes improved on it on a couple of levels feeney gestured toward the stack of discs thats a lot of brain wave patterns shouldnt be too difficult to compare them with the victims and identify her pattern would be on one she thought her mind on disc tidy she said half to herself brilliant really and potentially deadly our boys got some spiffy twists on mood sets theyre all tied into musical patterns you know notes and chords he picks the tune see then enhances what youd call the tone of it to pump along the targets reaction their state of mind say their unconscious impulses so he uses it to get into their head deep the subconscious got a lot of medical technology im not real familiar with but id say thats about it heavy into sexual urges feeney added thats our boys specialty ive got a little more breakdown to do but id say he could program the brain pattern set the mood enhance and give the target mind a nice hefty push off a ledge she demanded thats tricky dallas where im at here is enhancement suggestive shit sure if somebody was leaning toward the ledge thinking about going over this might give them that last nudge but to coerce a mind to act in a manner completely adverse completely out of character id have to back off on that for now they jumped choked and bled to death she reminded him impatiently maybe weve all got suicidal urges buried in the subconscious and this just brings them to the surface you need mira for that not me ill keep digging he smiled hopefully after breakfast she forced down impatience after breakfast i appreciate the long night feeney and the quick work but i needed the best and you got it the guy you decided to link yourself up with isnt half bad either as a tech id make a decent eman out of him if hed give up the drudgery of his lifestyle my first offer of the day roarke smiled you know where the kitchen is feeney youre welcome to the autochef or you can ask summerset to arrange for the meal of your choice around here that means real eggs he stretched kinks out popped joints you want me to tell him breakfast for three you get started roarke suggested well be down shortly he waited until feeney had sauntered out whistling at the thought of eggs benedict and blueberry pancakes you havent much time i know i have enough if you have something to say i do it was rare for him to feel awkward hed almost forgotten the sensation until it swamped him what feeney just pointed out to you about his opinion on the capabilities here the fact that its unlikely for the subject to be influenced to act out of character to do something abhorrent she saw immediately where he was going and wanted to curse roarke ill finish this ive been the man who took you last night ive lived in that skin and it hasnt been so long ago that ive forgotten him i turned him into something else because i wanted to and i could money helped and a certain need for polish but hes still there hes still part of me i was reminded of that rather violently last night do you want me to hate you for it to blame you for it no i want you to understand it and me i came from the kind of man who hurt you last night so did i that stopped him had emotion swimming back into his eyes christ eve and it scares me it wakes me up in the middle of the night the wondering just whats inside me i live with it every single day i knew where you came from when i took you on and i dont care i know youve done things broken laws lived outside them but im here she huffed out a breath shifted her feet i love you okay thats it now im hungry and ive got a full day ahead of me so im going down before feeney cleans us out of eggs he stepped in front of her before she could storm out one more minute he framed her face with his hands lowered his mouth to hers and turned her scowl into a sigh with a kiss so tender it made her throat ache and her toes curl well she managed when he eased back thats better i guess much better he linked his fingers with hers and because he had used it when hed hurt her he balanced that out by using it now a ghra huh a line appeared between her brows is that gaelic again yes he brought their joined fingers to his lips love my love its got a nice ring it does yes he sighed a little it had been a long time since hed let himself hear the music of it it shouldnt make you sad she murmured it doesnt just thoughtful he gave her hand a friendly squeeze id love to buy you breakfast lieutenant talked me into it comfortable she tightened her grip we got any crepes the trouble with chemicals eve thought as she set up for the next interview with jess barrow was that no matter how safe mild and helpful they claimed to be they always made her feel false she knew she wasnt naturally alert that underneath that surging induced energy her body was a mass of desperate fatigue she kept imagining her system wearing a huge clowns mask of enthusiasm over a gray exhausted face back in the saddle peabody eve asked as her aide walked into the whitewalled uncluttered room yes sir i briefed myself via your reports dropped by your office on the way here you have a message from the commander on hold and two from nadine furst i think she smells a story shell have to wait ill relay to the commander during our first break here know anything about baseball peabody i played short for two years at the academy golden glove well warm up when i toss you a ball you field it zing it back were going tinker to evers to chance here with feeney coming in before the end of the inning peabodys eyes lit hey didnt know you were a historian i have many hidden facets just field the ball peabody i want to dust this son of a bitch at the plate youve read the report you know the drill she signaled for the suspect to be brought in lets cook him if he lawyers up well have to juggle but im banking on him being too arrogant to go that route initially mostly i like cocky men i guess ill have to make an exception here and hes got such a pretty face eve added then moved aside as a uniform delivered her man hows it going jess feeling better today hed had time to regroup and time to stew i could hang you on undue force but im going to let it pass because before this is done youll be the top joke of your idiot department yep hes feeling better have a seat she stepped to the small table engaged the recording unit dallas lieutenant eve with peabody officer delia as aide the time is oh nine hundred september interview subject barrow jess file number sone nine three oh five would you please state your name for the record jess barrow you got that much right i have during our previous interview given you your rights and options under the law is that correct you gave me the drill sure for all the good it had done him he thought and shifted carefully in his seat his cock ached like a rotted tooth and you understand those rights and options as stated i got them then i get them now do you wish at this time to make use of your right to an attorney or representative i dont need anybody but myself all right then eve sat linked her fingers smiled lets get started in your previous statement you admitted to the design and use of equipment built for tampering with personal brain patterns and behavior i didnt admit to shit she kept smiling thats a matter of interpretation do you now deny that during a social gathering at my home last evening you utilized a program you have designed to make certain suggestions subliminally to the subject roarke hey if your husband took you off and tossed your skirts over your head its your business her smile never faltered it certainly is she needed to hang him here on this one point to hang him on the rest peabody perhaps jess is unaware of the penalty for giving false statement to a police official during interview that penalty peabody said smoothly carries a maximum term of five years in full lockup shall i replay the pertinent data from the initial interview lieutenant the subjects memory might be faulty due to the injury received while assaulting an officer assault my ass he snarled at peabody you think you can doubleteam me this way she struck me without provocation then let that bastard she married come in and he trailed off remembering the warning roarke had issued in a soft silky voice directly in his ear while the pain almost sweet in its intensity had radiated through his system you wish to make an official complaint eve asked no even now a light line of sweat beaded on his upper lip and made eve wonder just what roarke had done to him i was upset last night things got out of hand he took a steadying breath listen im a musician i take a lot of pride in my work in the art of it i like to think what i do influences people touches them my pride in that might have given you the wrong impression as to the scope of my work basically i dont know what all the fuss is about he smiled again with a good deal of his usual charm and spread his handsome hands those people you talked about last night i dont know them ive heard of some of them sure but i didnt know them personally or have anything to do with their decision to selfterminate im against it myself in my opinion lifes too short as it is this is all a misunderstanding and im willing to forget it eve leaned back in her chair sent a look toward her aide peabody hes willing to forget it thats generous of him lieutenant and not surprising under the circumstances a stretch for breaking the statute on personal privacy through electronics is stringent and of course theres the added charge of designing and implementing equipment designed for individual subliminals right there with the multiple counts youre looking at a tenyear minimum in the cages you cant begin to prove any of it any of it youve got no case here im giving you a chance to roll over here jess they go easier on you when you roll and as to the civil case that my husband and i are entitled to bring against you i will state here for the record that i will waive that right contingent on your admission of guilt on the criminal charges if that admission comes in the next thirty seconds think about it i dont have to think about anything because youve got nothing he leaned forward youre not the only one with people behind you what do you think will happen to your big bad career if i go to the press with this she said nothing just watched him then glanced at the time count on the recorder offer is rescinded eve nodded at the monitoring camera peabody please uncode the door for captain feeney when feeney walked in he was beaming he set a disc and file on the table and stuck out his hand to jess ive got to tell you your works the best ive ever seen its a real pleasure to meet you thanks jess shifted to audience mode shook hands warmly i love my work oh it shows feeney sat down made himself comfortable i havent enjoyed anything for years as much as i did taking that console apart another time another place it might have been comic the way jesss face underwent the transformation from obliging star to blank shock to ripe fury you fucked with my equipment took it apart you had no right laying a hand on it youre meat youre dead youre destroyed let the record show the subject is overwrought peabody recited blandly his threats against the person of captain feeney are accepted as emotional rather than literal well the first time anyway feeney said cheerfully you want to watch your step there friend put too much of that on record and we tend to get pissy now he leaned forward on his elbows lets talk shop you had some great security admirable took me a while to bypass but then ive been in the game as long as youve been breathing designing that personal brain scanner was some accomplishment so compact so delicate to the touch i gauged its range at two yards now thats damn good for that small and portable a unit you didnt get into my equipment jesss voice wavered youre bluffing you couldnt get down to the core well the three fail safes were tricky feeney admitted i spent nearly an hour on the second one but the last was really just padding i guess you never figured youd need anything at that level did you run the discs feeney eve asked him started on them youre on there dallas we dont have roarkes on file civilian you know but i found yours and peabodys peabody blinked mine im running comparison checks on the names you requested dallas he smiled broadly at jess again youve been busy collecting specimens thats a fine storage option you designed terrific data compression capabilities its going to break my heart to destroy that equipment you cant it was sincere pain and distress now his eyes swam with it ive put everything ive got into that not just money but time and thought and energy three years of my life almost straight through without a break i stepped back from my career to design it do you have any idea what i can accomplish with it eve picked up the ball why dont you tell us jess in your own words wed love to hear it chapter seventeen jess barrow started slowly in fits and starts speaking of his experiments and research his fascination with the influence of outside stimuli on the human brain the senses and the enhancement of the senses through technology what we can do for pleasure for punishment we havent even tapped the surface thats what i wanted to do he explained tap the surface and go under it dreams dallas needs fears fantasies all my life musics been whats moved me to everything hunger passion misery joy how much more intense would all that be if you could just get inside really use the mind to exploit and explore so you worked on it she prompted devoted yourself to it three years more really but three solid on the design experimentation perfecting every penny i had went into it ive got next to nothing left now thats why i needed backing why i needed you and mavis was your link to me and from me to roarke look he lifted his hands rubbed them over his face dropped them onto the table i like mavis and shes got a real spark yeah id have used her if she was bland as a droid but shes not i didnt do her any harm if anything i gave her a boost up her ego level was ditch low when we hooked up oh she was masking it pretty good but shed lost confidence in herself from what happened before i gave her confidence a jolt how he hesitated decided hed take a bigger fall by evading okay i gave her some subliminal nudges in the right direction she should be grateful he insisted and i worked with her straight stuff getting her shined up without taking away her natural edge you heard her yourself shes better than she ever was you experimented on her eve said and wanted to hang him for that alone without her knowledge or consent it wasnt like she was some droid rat christ id perfected the system he jabbed a finger at feeney you know its prime its beautiful feeney agreed doesnt make it legal shit genetic engineering was illegal in vitro work prostitution what did that get us weve come a long way but were still in the dark ages man this is a benefit this is a way to push the mind forward into dreams and make what we dream real not all of us want our dreams to be reality what gives you the right to make that choice for someone else okay he held up a hand maybe i got overenthusiastic a few times you get caught up but all i did with you was expand on what was there so i enhanced the lust bars that night in the studio what did it hurt another time i gave your memory a little push jiggled a few locks i wanted to be able to prove what could be done so when the time was right i could approach you and roarke with a business proposition and last night he trailed off knowing hed miscalculated badly there okay last night i went too far the tone was too dark i got carried away with it performing before a real audience again its like a drug it hypes you maybe i punched the power a little hard on him an honest mistake he tried that smile again look ive used it on myself dozens of times theres no harm nothing permanent just temporary mood enhancement and you pick the mood thats part of it with standard equipment you dont have as much control not nearly the depth of field with what ive developed you can turn it on and off like a light sexual need or satisfaction euphoria melancholy energy relaxation name it you got it a death wish no he shook his head quickly i dont play those games but its all a game to you isnt it you push the buttons and the people dance youre the electronic god youre missing the big picture he insisted do you know what people would pay for this kind of capability you can feel anything you want eve opened the file feeney had brought in she tossed photos out faceup what did they feel jess she pushed the morgue shots of four deaths at him what was the last thing you made them feel so that they killed themselves with smiles on their faces he went white as death itself eyes glazing before he managed to shut them no no way no doubling over he retched out his health center breakfast let the record show the suspect is momentarily indisposed peabody said dryly should i call for maintenance and a health aide lieutenant christ yes eve muttered as jess continued to heave well break this interview at oh ten fifteen dallas lieutenant eve record off great brain weak stomach feeney went to the dispenser in the corner and poured a cup of water here boy see if you can choke some of this down jesss eyes watered his stomach muscles were raw water sloshed in the cup so that feeney had to guide it to his mouth you cant hang that on me he managed you cant well see about that eve stepped aside so that the incoming aide could cart him off to the infirmary i need some air she muttered and walked out hold on dallas feeney hurried after her leaving peabody to direct maintenance and gather up the file we need to talk my office is closer she swore lightly as her knee throbbed the ice bandage was wearing off and needed to be replaced her hip was murderous took a beating with that cec hit yesterday didnt you feeney clucked sympathetically as she hobbled been looked over yet later ive been pressed for time lets give the creep an hour to get his stomach back in place then hit him again he hasnt cried lawyer yet but its coming wont matter a damn once we match those brain patterns to the victims thats the problem sit down he advised when they stepped into her office take a load off that leg its the knee and sittings making it stiffen up whats the problem she asked and headed for the coffee nothing matches he studied her mournfully when she turned not one match in the whole lot plenty as yet unidentified but ive got the prints on all victims no autopsy scan on devane but i got the one from her last physical theres no match dallas so she did sit heavily there was no need to ask if he was sure feeney was as thorough as a domestic droid searching for dust in corners okay hes got them someplace else did we get the warrant for his studio and quarters a teams going through it right now i havent gotten a report he could have a lock box some safe hole she shut her eyes shit feeney why would he keep them when he was done with them hes probably destroyed them hes arrogant but hes not stupid theyd hang him and hed know it the possibilitys high there then again he could have kept them as souvenirs it never fails to surprise me what people keep that guy last year that cut up his wife kept her eyes remember in a damn music box yeah i remember where had this headache come from she wondered and rubbed uselessly at her temples to erase it so maybe well get lucky if we dont weve got plenty now and a good shot of breaking him heres the thing dallas he sat on the edge of her desk reached into his pocket for his bag of candied almonds it doesnt feel right what do you mean it doesnt feel right weve got him cold weve got him cold all right but not on murder thoughtfully feeney chewed a coated nut i cant resolve myself to it the guy who designed that equipment is brilliant twisted some sure selfabsorbed the guy we just shook down is all of those things and you can add childish it is a game to him one he wants to make a big profit on but murder youre just in love with his console that i am he admitted without shame hes weak dallas and not just his stomach hows he going to make himself rich by killing people off she arched a brow i guess youve never heard of murder for hire that boy doesnt have the guts for it or the steel he ate another nut and wheres the motive did he pick those people out of a hat and theres this what hes got requires proximity to tap the subconscious you cant place him at any of the scenes he said something about remote capabilities yeah it had a fine one but it wouldnt command this option not that i can figure she sat back deflated youre not making my day here feeney just food for thought if hes got a hand in it hes got help or a more personal portable unit could it be adjusted into vr goggles the idea intrigued him made his hangdog eyes gleam cant say for sure itll take some time to work that out i hope youve got the time hes all ive got feeney if i cant crack him hes going to walk on the murders tucking him away for ten to twenty on what weve got doesnt do it for me she huffed out a breath hell go for a psych evaluation hell go for anything he thinks will buy him a shot maybe mira can pin him send him over after the break feeney suggested let her take him for a few hours and do yourself a favor go home and get some sleep you run on empty long enough you drop maybe i will ill set it up deal with whitney a couple hours off might clear my head i must be missing something o o for once summerset wasnt hovering eve snuck in the house like a thief limped her way upstairs she left a trail of clothes on her way to the bed and she sighed greedily when she fell on it ten minutes later she was on her back staring at the ceiling the aches were bad enough she thought grumpily but the stimulator shed taken hours before hadnt worn off it was passing leaving her lightheaded with fatigue while her system still bubbled like a brew sleep was not going to happen she found herself picking apart the pieces of the case putting them back together each time the puzzle formed differently until it was a blurred jumble of facts and theories at this rate she wouldnt be close to coherent when she met with mira she considered indulging in a long hot bath in lieu of sleep then inspired she popped up and grabbed a robe she took the elevator with the purpose of avoiding summerset and stepped up on the lower level into the garden path of the solarium a session in the lagoon pool she decided was just the ticket she dumped the robe padded naked to the dark water walled in genuine stone and framed with fragrant blooms when she dipped a toe she found it blissfully warm she sat on the first step and set the control panel for jets and bubbles as the water began to churn she started to program music with a quick grimace she decided she wasnt in the mood for tunes she simply floated at first grateful there was no one around to hear her whimpering as the pulsing water worked on her aches she let herself breathe floral perfume she let herself drift simple pleasures the conflict of fatigue and stimulation balanced out into relaxation drugs she decided were highly overrated water worked wonders turning over lazily she began to swim slowly at first while her muscles warmed and limbered then she put some kick into it hoping to work off the excess of the stimulant and revive herself with natural exercise when the timer clicked and the water calmed she continued with long steady strokes skimmed down to the glossy black bottom until she felt like an embryo in the womb then broke the surface with a loud satisfied groan you swim like a fish instinct had eve reaching for her side arm only to encounter her own naked ribs quickly she blinked the water out of her eyes and focused on reeanna its a cliche she walked to the edge of the pool but accurate she set her shoes aside sat and slid her legs into the water do you mind help yourself eve didnt consider herself fanatically modest but she dipped a little lower she hated being caught naked were you looking for roarke no actually ive just left him he and william are still at it upstairs in his office i was just leaving for a salon appointment she tugged at her gorgeous glossy red curls ive got to do something about this mop summerset mentioned you were down here so i thought id just drop in on you summerset eve smiled grimly hed spotted her after all i had a couple of hours personal time thought id take advantage of it and what a lovely spot to take it roarkes got such amazing class doesnt he yeah you could say so i really just wanted to stop for a moment to tell you how much i enjoyed last evening i barely got to speak to you such a crowd and then you were called away cops are lousy socializers eve commented and wondered how to get out and to her robe without feeling like an idiot reeanna reached down cupped water and let it pour out of her hand i hope it wasnt anything dreadful nobody died if thats what you mean then eve made herself smile she was lousy at socializing and she told herself to make a better effort actually i got a break in the case ive been working on we took a suspect into custody thats good reeanna tilted her head her eyes intrigued would that be the suicide matter we discussed before im not really free to say one way or the other at this time reeanna smiled cop talk well one way or the other ive been giving it quite a bit of thought your case or whatever youd call it would make a fascinating paper ive been so busy with tech i havent done any writing in some time i hope when you resolve the matter and its public record i can discuss it with you in some detail i can probably do that if and when she bent a little the woman was an expert after all and could be of some help as it happens the suspect is being evaluated by dr mira right about now do you ever do behavioral and personality evaluations i have certainly from a different angle than mira youd have to say were two sides of one coin our final diagnosis would often be the same but wed use a different process and a different viewpoint i might need two viewpoints before this ones over eve mused measuring reeanna you dont happen to have security clearance do you as it happens i do she continued to swing her legs lazily but her eyes were alert interested level four class b that just skims by if it comes up how would you feel about working for the city as a temporary consultant i can guarantee long hours lousy conditions and low pay who could resist that kind of offer reeanna laughed tossed back her hair actually id love the opportunity for some hands on again too long in labs working with machines william adores that you know but i need people i might just give you a call deciding it was more foolish to huddle in the water than to climb casually out eve stood you know where to reach me dear god eve what happened to you instantly reeanna was swinging her legs back rising youre black and blue hazards of the job she managed to snag one of the body towels stacked near the edge and started to wind it around her when reeanna tugged it away let me have a look at you you havent been treated her fingers probed at eves hip hey do you mind i certainly do impatient reeanna lifted her eyes oh be still not only am i female and have personal knowledge of the female body but ive got a medical degree what have you done for that knee its looks nasty ice bandage its better then id hate to have seen it when it wasnt why havent you been to a health center or at least an mt stop because i hate them and i havent had time well youve got time now i want you to lie down on that massage table ill get my emergency kit out of the car and deal with this look i appreciate it she had to raise her voice as reeanna was already striding away but theyre just bruises youll be lucky if you didnt chip a bone in that hip with this dark promise reeanna stepped into the elevator and the doors snapped shut oh thanks i feel heaps better now resigned eve toweled off put on her robe then reluctantly went to the padded table beneath an arbor of wildly blooming wisteria shed no more than settled when reeanna was back stalking over the tiles with a neat leather case in her hand the woman could move eve mused i thought you had a salon date i called switched times lie back well deal with that knee first you charge extra for house calls reeanna smiled a little as she opened her case eve took one glance inside turned her head away christ but she hated medicine this ones free we can consider it practice i havent worked on a human in nearly two years that inspires confidence eve closed her eyes as reeanna took out a miniscanner and examined her knee why havent you hmm well its not broken so thats something badly wrenched and inflamed why she dug into her case again roarkes part of the reason he made william and me an offer impossible to refuse the money was seductive and roarke knows which buttons to push eve hissed as something stingingly cold was pressed to her knee youre telling me he was aware i had a long personal interest in behavioral patterns and effects of stimulation the opportunity to create new technology working with virtually unlimited funds was too tempting to miss vanity couldnt resist the chance to be a part of something new and with roarke behind it undoubtedly successful closing her eyes had been a mistake eve realized she was starting to float the throbbing in her hip slowed she felt reeannas gentle fingers smoothing something cool and slick over it her shoulder received the same treatment the absence of pain was like a tranq and tugged her deeper he never seems to miss no not since ive known him ive got a meeting in a couple hours eve said thickly rest first reeanna removed the poultice from eves knee and was pleased to see the swelling had already gone down im going to put another deep healing poultice on this then an ice bandage to finish it off its still likely to be a bit stiff after prolonged use id advise you to baby it for the next couple of days sure baby it did you get all this last night rounding up your suspect no before he didnt give me any trouble little bastard her brows knit digging a line between them cant nail him though just cant nail it down im sure you will reeannas voice was soothing as she continued the treatment youre thorough and involved i saw you on one of the news channels going out on the ledge with cerise devane risking your life lost her yes i know efficiently reeanna coated the treated bruises with numbing cream it was horrible visually shocking more so for you id imagine youd have seen her face her eyes up close as she went off she was smiling yes i could see that she wanted to die did she she said it was beautiful the ultimate experience satisfied shed done all she could reeanna picked up another towel spread it over eve there are some who believe that death as the ultimate human experience no matter how advanced medicine and technology none of us escape it since were destined for it in any case why not see it as a goal rather than an obstacle its meant to be fought every bloody inch of the way not everyone has the energy or the need to fight some go gently she picked up eves limp hand automatically checking the pulse some go resistantly but all go somebody sent her that makes it murder that makes it mine reeanna tucked eves arm under the towel yes i suppose it does get some sleep ill tell summerset to wake you in time to make your meeting thanks really its nothing she touched eves shoulder between friends she studied eve a moment longer then glanced at her diamondstudded watch she was going to have to push to make her rescheduled salon date but there was just one minor detail to see to yet she repacked her kit left a tube of numbing cream on the table for eve and hurried out chapter eighteen eve paced the soft pretty carpet in dr miras office hands jammed in her pockets head lowered like a bull preparing for the charge i dont get it how can his profile not fit ive got him cold on the lesser charges the little pricks been playing with peoples brains reveling in it it isnt a matter of fitting eve its a matter of probabilities patient calm mira sat in her comfy bodymolding chair and sipped jasmine tea she needed it she mused the air was foaming with eves frustration and energy you have his confession and the evidence that he has been experimenting with individualized brain pattern influence and i quite agree he has a lot to answer for but as to coercion to selftermination i cant in any decisive manner corroborate your suspicions through my evaluation well thats just great she spun on her heel reeannas treatment and the hours nap had restored her if anything her color was high her eyes overbright without your corroboration whitneys not going to buy the package which means the pa wont buy it i cant adjust my report to suit you eve whos asking you to eve threw up her hands then dug them into her pockets what doesnt fit for christs sake the mans got a god complex any idiot before vision reconstruction surgery could spot i agree that his personality pattern leans toward an excess of ego and his temperament has a high caliber of the artiste under siege mira sighed i wish youd sit down youre making me tired eve dropped into a chair scowled there im sitting explain mira had to smile the sheer drive and unrelenting focus was admirable do you know eve i can never understand why impatience is so attractive on you and how with such a high volume of it you still manage to be thorough in your work im not here for analysis doctor i know i only wish i could convince you to agree to regular sessions but thats another subject for another time you have my report but to summarize my findings the subject is egocentric selfcongratulatory and one who habitually rationalizes his antisocial behavior as art hes also brilliant dr mira signed a little shook her head a truly fine mind he was nearly off the scale in the standard trislow and secour tests good for him eve muttered lets put his brain on disc and give him a few suggestions your reaction is understandable mira said mildly human nature is resistant to any sort of mind control addicts rationalize by deluding themselves that theyre in control she rolled her shoulders in any case the subject has an admirable even astonishing skill for visualization and logic hes also fully aware and smug if you will about those skills under the surface charm he is to use your unscientific term a prick but i cannot in good conscience label him a murderer im not worried about your conscience eve set her teeth hes able to design and operate equipment that is capable of influencing behavior in targeted individuals i have four dead bodies whose minds i believe no i know were influenced to selftermination and logically there should be a connection mira sat back reached over and programmed tea for eve but you dont have a sociopath in holding eve she passed eve a fragrant steaming cup they both knew she didnt want as there is of yet no clear motive for these deaths and if they were indeed coerced its my considered opinion that its a sociopath who is responsible so what separates him he likes people mira said simply and wants quite desperately to be liked and admired by them manipulative yes but he believes hes created a great boon to humankind one hell make a profit on certainly so maybe he just got carried away isnt that what he called his use of roarke the night before eve thought hed just gotten carried away and maybe he isnt as much in control of his equipment as he thinks thats possible from another angle jess enjoys his work he needs to be a party to the results of it his ego requires that he see experience at least a part of what hes caused he wasnt in the damn closet with us eve thought but was afraid she understood miras meaning the way jess had looked for her at her when theyd come back to the party the way hed smiled this isnt what i want to hear i know that listen to me mira set her cup aside this man is a child an emotionally stunted savant his vision and his music are more real to him certainly more important than people but he doesnt discount people overall i simply find no evidence that he would risk his freedom and his freedom of expression to kill eve sipped tea out of reflex rather than desire if he had a partner she speculated thinking of feeneys theory its possible he wouldnt be a man who would happily share his accomplishments still he has a great need for both adulation and financial success it might be possible if he found himself in need of assistance on some level of his design he entered into a partnership then why didnt he roll over eve shook her head hes a coward hed have rolled no way hed take the heat for this alone she sipped again letting her thoughts play out what if he were genetically imprinted toward sociopathic behavior hes intelligent canny enough to mask it but its simply part of his makeup branded at conception mira nearly sniffed i dont subscribe to that school upbringing environment education choices both moral and immoral form us into what we are we are not born monsters or saints but there are experts in the field who believe we are and she had one eve mused at her disposal mira read her easily enough and couldnt prevent the prick to her pride if you wish to consult with dr ott on this matter its your privilege im sure shed be thrilled eve wasnt sure whether to wince or smile mira very rarely sounded testy that wasnt meant as an insult to your skills doctor i need a hammer here you cant provide it let me tell you what i think about the branding at birth issue lieutenant its a copout plain and simple its a crutch i couldnt help setting fire to that building and burning hundreds of people alive i was born an arsonist i couldnt stop myself from battering that old woman to death for her handful of credits my mother was a thief it quite simply infuriated her to think of that ploy being used to blot out responsibility and on the other side to scar those who were defenseless against the monsters who bore them it excuses us from humanity she continued from morality from right and wrong we can say we were marked in the womb and never had a chance she angled her head you of all people should know better this isnt about me eve set her cup down with a snap it isnt about where i came from or what i made myself its about four people that im aware of who werent given a choice and someone has to answer for that one thing mira added as eve rose are you focused on this man because of personal insults to you and those you love or because of the dead you represent maybe its both eve admitted after a moment o o she didnt contact reeanna not yet she wanted a little time to let it stew in her mind and she was delayed by finding nadine furst in her office howd you get past desk security eve demanded oh i have my ways nadine swung her leg beamed a friendly smile and most of the cops around here know you and i have a history what do you want i wouldnt say no to a cup of coffee grudgingly eve turned to the autochef pumped up two cups make it fast nadine crime is rampant in our city and that keeps us both in business what did you get called out on last night dallas excuse me come on i was at the party mavis was terrific by the way first you and roarke take off she sipped delicately it didnt take a sharp reporter like me to get an inkling of what that was about she wiggled her brows chuckling when eve simply stared but your sex life isnt news at least on my beat we were running out of shrimp patties we ran down to the kitchen and made some up it would have been so embarrassing yeah yeah nadine waved that away and concentrated on her coffee even in the upper echelons of channel they rarely had access to such potent brew then i notice being the keen observer that i am that you sweep jess barrow off and out at the end of the set never came back either of you were having a mad illicit affair eve said dryly you may want to turn that over to the gossip desk and im boinking a onearmed sex droid you always were an explorer actually there was this unit once but i digress roarke in his usual charming fashion manages to move the lingering guests along herds the hangerson into the recreation center great hologram deck by the way and gives your regrets duty calls nadine angled her head funny nothing shows on my cop scanner that would have pulled our ace homicide detective out at that time of night not everything goes out on the scanner nadine and im just a soldier i go when and where im told sell it to someone else i know how tight you are with mavis nothing but top level would have pulled you away at her big moment she leaned forward wheres jess barrow dallas and what the hell has he done i dont have anything to give you nadine come on dallas you know me ill hold it down until i get the goahead whod he kill switch the channel eve advised then pulled out her communicator when it beeped display only no audio quickly she scanned the transmission from peabody manually requested a meeting including feeney in twenty minutes she set the communicator on the desk turned back to the autochef to see if there were any soy chips available she needed something to sop up the caffeine ive got work nadine eve continued when she discovered she had nothing but an irradiated egg sandwich in stock and nothing to bump up your ratings youre holding out on me i know youve got jess in custody ive got sources in holding annoyed eve turned back holding was innately ripe with leaks i cant help you are you charging him the charges are not for broadcast at this time damn it dallas im on the edge here eve snapped and it could go either way dont push me if and when im free to speak to the media on the matter youll be the first youll have to be satisfied with that you mean i have to be satisfied with nothing nadine rose youre got something big or you wouldnt be so snotty about it im only asking for a she broke off as mavis burst in jesus dallas jesus how could you arrest jess what are you doing mavis damn it she could visualize nadines reporters ears growing longer and sharper sit she demanded stabbing a finger at a chair then at nadine you out have a heart dallas nadine attached herself to mavis cant you see how upset she is let me get you some coffee mavis i said out and i mean it at her wits end eve rubbed her hands over her face take off nadine or ill put you on the blackout list as a threat it had punch the blackout list meant there wouldnt be a cop in the homicide division whod give nadine the right time much less a story lead okay fine but im not dropping this there were other ways to dig she thought and other tools to dig with she snatched up her bag gave eve one last bitter look then flounced out how could you mavis demanded dallas how could you do this to insure some level of privacy eve shut the door her headache had come full circle and was now gleefully throbbing behind her eyes mavis this is my job here your job her eyes were laser blue today and redrimmed from weeping it was touching the way they matched the cobalt streaks in her scarlet hair what about my career i finally get the break ive been waiting for working for and you toss my partner into a cage and for what her voice hitched because he came on to you and pissed roarke off what her mouth fell open worked silently before she could get her tongue around words where the hell did you get that i just got off the link with jess hes devastated i cant believe youd play this way dallas her eyes began to leak again i know roarkes premiere with you but weve got history at that moment with mavis noisily weeping into her hands eve could have cheerfully strangled jess barrow yeah weve got history and you should know i dont play that way i dont toss someone in a cage because i find them a personal annoyance would you sit down i dont need to sit she wailed it made eve wince as the sound acted as the dull point of an edgy knife on her brain well i do she dropped into a chair how much could she safely tell a civilian without crossing the line and how far over the line was she willing to go she looked at mavis again sighed as far as it took jess is the prime suspect in four deaths what what bend did you go around since last night jess wouldnt be quiet eve snapped i havent got him solid on that yet but im working on it i do however have him on other charges serious charges now if youd stop blubbering and sit the hell down ill tell you what i can you didnt even stay and watch my whole act mavis managed to fall into a chair but she didnt manage to stop blubbering oh mavis im sorry eve dragged a hand through her hair she was lousy with weepers i couldnt there was nothing i could do mavis jess is into mind control huh it was such a wild statement coming from the most grounded person she knew that mavis stopped crying long enough to sniffle and gape huh hes developed a program that accesses brain wave patterns and influences behavior and hes used it on me on roarke and on you on me no he didnt get genuine here dallas this is too frankenstein jess isnt a mad scientist hes a musician hes an engineer a musicologist and a prick eve took a deep breath then related as much as she felt was necessary as she spoke maviss tears dried up hardening her eyes her bottom lip quivered once then thinned he used me to get to you to get to roarke i was just a spring then once id bounced him to you he fucked with your mind this is not your fault stop it eve ordered when maviss eyes started to shimmer again i mean it im tired im pressed and my head is about to explode i dont need this soggy routine from you right now its not your fault you were used and so was i he was hoping for roarkes backing on his project it doesnt make me less of a cop or you less of a performer youre good and you got better he knew you could and thats why he used you hes too damn arrogant about his talent to have linked himself up with a dud he wanted somebody who could shine and you did mavis swiped a hand under her nose really it was that one word delivered with such shaky hope that made eve realize how far maviss ego had sunk yeah really you were great mavis thats solid okay she wiped at her eyes i guess my feelings got hurt when you didnt hang for the act leonardo said i was being silly you wouldnt have split if you hadnt had to split she took a long breath that lifted her thin shoulders then dropped them again then jess when he called he laid all this stuff on me i shouldnt have bought into it it doesnt matter well smooth out the rest later im pressed here mavis i dont have much time to wrap this up you think he killed people i have to find out she looked over at the knock on her door peabody stepped in hesitated sorry lieutenant should i wait outside no im going mavis sniffled rose sent eve a watery smile sorry about the flood and everything well mop it up ill talk to you when i can dont worry about this mavis nodded and her lowered lashes concealed the quick flare in her eyes she intended to do more than worry everything all right here lieutenant peabody asked when mavis left them alone actually peabody everythings fucked eve sat tried to drill holes in her temples with her fingers to release the pressure mira doesnt think our boy has the personality profile for murder ive insulted her because im going for another consultant nadine furst is sniffing too close to the center and ive just broken maviss heart and shattered her ego peabody waited a beat well other than that how are things cute but it did prod a reluctant smile damn give me a nice clear murder any day over this physiological crap those were the good old days all right peabody shifted to make room as feeney stepped in well the gangs all here lets get to work status eve asked feeney sweepers found more discs at the suspects studio so far no matches on victims he kept a log of his work uncomfortable feeney shifted jess had been very explicit in his speculations on results including the sexual nudge hed given eve and roarke he names names times ah suggestions theres no mention of any of the four dead ive been through his communications system no transmissions to or from any of the victims well thats dandy feeney shifted his feet again and his color fluctuated into a blush ive sealed the work log for your eyes only her brows knit why he ah talks about you a lot on a personal level he focused his eyes an inch over eves head again hes very explicit in his speculations yeah he made it clear he was overly interested in my head he isnt just interested in that part of your anatomy feeney puffed out his cheeks blew the air out he considered it would be an entertaining experiment to attempt to ah what influence your behavior toward him in a sexual manner eve let out a snort it wasnt just the words but feeneys stiffly formal delivery he figured he could use his toy to get me into the sack great we can lay another charge on him intent to sexually molest did he say anything about me peabody wanted to know and received a glare from eve thats sick officer just wondering were adding to his cage time eve continued but were not pinning him on the big one and miras profile is going to work against us lieutenant peabody sucked in her breath and took the chance have you considered that shes right thats hes not responsible yeah i have and that scares the hell out of me if shes right theres someone else out there with a brain toy and were not even close so we all better hope weve got our man safely locked away speaking of our man feeney broke in you better know hes lawyered himself i figured he would anybody we know leanore bastwick well hell small world she wants to make points off of you dallas feeney took out his bag of nuts offered them to peabody shes raring to go wants to set up a media conference word is she took him on pro bono just for the shot at you and the media coverage this will get once it hits she can take her shot we can block the press conference for twentyfour hours wed better solidify before then i pulled a thread loose peabody told her it might unravel more with some tugging mathias did indeed attend mit for two semesters unfortunately his term there was three years after jess did his athome degree but jess used his alumni status to access data from their files he also taught an eclass elective on musicology which the university uploaded into their library curriculum mathias took the course during his last semester eve felt a quick power surge thats something to tug on good work it connects finally and maybe weve been looking in the wrong place pearly was the first known victim what if hes the one who was connected with the others it could be as simple as their common interest in electronic games we looked there already so look again she told peabody and look deeper not all the clubs and loops are above ground if mathias was used to help develop the system he might have bragged about it those hobby hackers use all kinds of compunames can you find his eventually feeney agreed you can contact jack carter he was his roommate on olympus maybe he can give you a boost on them peabody contact devanes son see what you can shake out of him on this angle ill work on the fitzhugh angle she glanced at her watch ill make a stop first maybe i can cut through some of the layers she felt she was back to square one looking for the connection there had to be one and she was going to have to involve roarke to find it she called him from her car link well hello lieutenant how was your nap too short and too long ago how long are you going to be in midtown another few hours at any rate why im coming by now can you squeeze me in he smiled always its business she said and cut him off before she could smile back daring her autodrive she programmed destination then used her link again nadine nadine angled her head shot eve a cold look lieutenant nine am my office should i bring a lawyer bring your recorder ill give you a jump on tomorrows press conference re jess barrow what press conference the image and voice quality sharpened as nadine went immediately to private dragging headphones over her hair theres nothing on schedule there will be you want that jump and you want the official report from the primary be there at nine whats the catch senator pearly get me everything not the official data the quiet stuff his hobbies playgrounds his underground connections pearly was clean as a church choir you dont have to be dirty to play underground you just have to be curious and what makes you think i can get private data on a government official because youre you nadine feed the data to my home unit and ill see you at nine hundred hours youll beat the pack by two hours easy think of those ratings im thinking deal she snapped and signed off when eve was able to glide smoothly into the parking facility at roarkes midtown office she began to think more kindly toward vehicle maintenance her vip space was waiting locking its security shield the moment she shut down the elevator accepted her palm print and zoomed her up to the top floor in a quiet dignified ride shed never get used to it roarkes personal assistant beamed at her welcomed her home welcomed her in and escorted her through the plush outer offices down the streamlined corridor and into the elegant efficiency of roarkes private office but he wasnt alone sorry she struggled not to frown at reeanna and william im interrupting not at all roarke walked over kissed her lightly were just finishing up your husbands quite the slave driver william held out a hand to shake eves warmly if you hadnt come along reeanna and i would have to do without our dinner thats william reeanna laughed hes either thinking of electronics or his stomach or you can you join us he asked eve i thought wed try the french place on the skyline level cops never eat eve tried to adjust herself to the easy social tone but thanks you need regular fuel to help the healing process reeanna narrowed her eyes for a quick professional survey any pain not much i appreciate the personal service and i wonder if i could speak to you for a few minutes on an official matter if you have time after your meal of course curiosity flitted over her face could i ask what its about the possibility of doing a consult on a case im working on if youre agreeable id need to do it tomorrow early a consult on an actual human being im there reeannas weary of machines william put in shes been making noises for weeks about going back into private practice vr holograms autotronics she rolled her beautiful eyes i long for flesh and blood roarke has us set up on the thirtysecond level west wing i should be able to nudge william through a meal in an hour just meet me there thanks oh and roarke reeanna continued as she and william started toward the door wed love to have that personal take on the new unit as soon as you can manage it and she calls me a slave driver tonight before i leave wonderful later eve food reeanna im dreaming of coquille st jacques william was laughing as he pulled her out of the door i didnt mean to break up your meeting eve began you didnt and youve given me a breather before i have to dig into a mountain of status reports ive had all the data on that vr unit youre concerned about transmitted ive skimmed the surface but ive found nothing out of line so far thats something shed rest easier once she could eliminate that angle william would be able to spot any problem quicker he added but as he and ree were in on the development i didnt think youd care to pass it by him no lets keep it close reeanna was concerned about you so am i she gave me a goingover shes good yes she is still he tipped eves face back with a fingertip youve got a headache whats the point of illegal brain scans when you can already see into my head she closed her hand over his wrist before he could drop his arm i cant see into yours its annoying i know his lips curved as he pressed them to her brow i love you ridiculously i didnt come here for this she murmured when his arms wound around her take a minute anyway i need it he could feel the outline of the diamond around her neck one she had worn first reluctantly and now habitually thatll do it he eased her back pleased that shed held on another moment she so rarely held on whats on your mind lieutenant peabody dug up a thin connection between barrow and mathias i want to see if i can tighten it how much trouble would it be to access underground transmissions using mits online services as a starting point his eyes lighted i love a challenge he moved around the desk engaged his unit then slid open a hidden panel under it flicked a switch manually whats that her teeth went on edge is that a block system did you just tune out compuguard that would be illegal wouldnt it he said cheerfully he reached over his shoulder to pat her hand dont ask the question lieutenant if you dont want to hear the answer now what time period are you interested in particularly scowling she dug out her log read off the dates of mathiass attendance at mit im looking for mathias specifically i dont know what line names he used yet feeneys getting them oh i think i can find them for you why dont you see about ordering us a meal no reason to go hungry coquille st jacques she said dryly steak rare he slid out a keyboard and began to work manually chapter nineteen eve ate standing up breathing down roarkes neck when hed had enough of that he simply reached around and pinched her back off im just trying to see but she backed off youve been at it a half hour he imagined with the equipment available at cop central even feeney would have taken twice as long to get to that same point darling eve he said then sighed when she only frowned at him there are layers here lieutenant layers over layers thats why they call it underground ive located two of the coded names our young doomed autotonics ace used therell be more still it takes some doing to unscramble transmissions he turned the machine on auto so he could enjoy his own dinner its all just games isnt it eve shifted so she could see the screen run with figures and odd symbols as it worked just grownup kids playing games secret societies hell theyre just hightech clubhouses more or less most of us enjoy diversions eve games fantasies the anonymity of a computer mask so we can pretend were someone else for a time games she thought again maybe it all boiled down to games and she just hadnt looked closely enough at the rules and players whats wrong with being who you are its not enough for everyone and this sort of thing attracts the lonely and the egocentric and fanatics certainly eservices particularly underground ones provide the fanatic with an open forum he cocked a brow cut neatly into his steak they also provide a service educational for that matter informative intellectual and can be perfectly harmless entertainment theyre legal he reminded her even the underground ones arent closely regulated and that stems mainly from the fact that its nearly impossible to do so and cost prohibitive edd keeps a line on them to some extent look here he swung back tapped out a few keys and had a display sliding onto one of the wall screens see that its nothing more than a somewhat amusing diatribe about a new version of camelot a multiuser role playing program hologram optional he explained everyone wants to be king and there he gestured to another screen a very straightforward advertisement for a partner in erotica a sexual fantasy vr program dual remote controls mandatory he grinned at her knitted brow one of my companies manufactures it its quite popular i bet she didnt ask if hed tried it out himself some data she didnt need i dont get it you can rent a licensed companion probably cheaper than the cost of that program you get sex in the flesh why do you need this fantasy darling having control or abdicating it and you can run the program over and over with nearly unlimited variations its mood again and mind all fantasies are mood and mind even the fatal ones she said slowly isnt that what this is all about having control ultimate control over someone elses mood and mind they dont even know theyre playing the game thats the big kick youd need a huge ego and no conscience mira says jess doesnt fit ah thats a problem isnt it she flicked a look down at him you dont sound surprised hes what in my alley days in dublin we would have called a fug cross between a fuck and a pug lots of mouth and no balls i never met a fug who could draw blood without whining she cleaned the steak off her plate and set it aside it seems to me that killing in this manner is bloodless cowardly fuglike he grinned at that well put but fugs dont kill they just talk she hated that she was beginning to agree and had muscled her way down what looked like a dead end with jess barrow ive got to have more how much longer do you figure until im through you can keep yourself occupied with the data on the vr unit ill come back to it im going to go down to reeannas office i can just leave her a memo about jess if shes not back from dinner fine he didnt try to dissuade her she had to move he knew to take some action will you come back up when youre done or will i meet you at home i dont know he looked perfect there she thought sitting in his snazzy office manipulating controls maybe everyone wanted to be king she mused but roarke was content being roarke his gaze shifted to hers held yes lieutenant youre exactly what you want to be thats a pretty good deal most of the time and so are you what you want to be most of the time she murmured ill check in with feeney and peabody after i meet with reeanna see if anythings come loose thanks for dinner and the computime you can pay me back he took her hand rose i want very much to make love with you tonight you dont have to ask flustered she moved her shoulders we got married and everything lets say asking is part of the fantasy he moved in just a little touched his lips to hers just a whisper let me woo you tonight darling eve let me surprise you let me seduce you he laid a hand on her heart felt the hard thick beat of it there he murmured ive already started her knees were quivering thanks thats just what i need to keep my mind focused on my work two hours this time he lingered over the kiss then lets take something for ourselves ill try she stepped back while she was sure she still could walked quickly toward the door then she turned back just looked at him two hours she told him then you can finish what you started she heard him laugh as she closed the door and hurried toward the elevator thirtynine west she ordered then found herself smiling yes theyd take something for themselves she decided something jess and his nasty little toy had tried to steal from them then she stopped and her smile faded was that the problem here she wondered was she so focused on that on a kind of personal retribution that she was missing something bigger or smaller if mira was right and roarke with his fug theory was on the mark then she was off it was time she admitted to pull back a bit refocus it was a tech crime she mused but tech crimes still require the human element motive emotion greed hate jealousy and power which of those or which combination of those was at the core of this she could see both greed and a hunger for power in jess but would he kill for them steely minded she replayed his reaction to the morgue shots in her mind would a man who had caused that to happen had directed it to happen react with such violent distress when faced with the results not impossible she decided but it didnt fit her image of the hand on the button he enjoyed seeing the results of his work she remembered he liked to snicker over them and note them down in his log did he have another log one the sweepers missed shed have to take a trip through his studio herself deep in thought she stepped out on thirtynine scanned the shielded glass walls of a lab it was quiet here security in full swing as indicated by the cameras in full view the warning red beep of motion detectors if there were any drones still at work they were behind closed doors she placed her palm on a plate received verification answered the request for voice print by giving her name then requested the location of reeannas office you are cleared for top level dallas lieutenant eve proceed left through breezeway then right at termination dr otts office is five meters beyond this point it will not be necessary to repeat this procedure to gain entry you are cleared she wondered if roarke or reeanna had cleared her through and followed the directions the breezeway impressed her offering a full view of the city on all sides she could look between her own feet and see the life bustling on the street below the music piped in was energetic and made her think sourly of some musicologists idea of fueling drones with enthusiasm for their work wasnt that just one more kind of mind control she passed a door bearing an imprint that identified it as williams a game master she thought it might be helpful to get his input pick his brain jiggle a few hypotheses out of him she knocked watched his recorder light beep red for locked im sorry william shaffer is not currently in his office please leave your name and any message he will respond as soon as possible its dallas look william if youve got a couple minutes when you finish dinner ive got something id like to run by you im going to drop by reeannas office now ill leave a memo if shes not there ill be in the building or at home later if youve got time to talk to me as she turned away she glanced at her watch how long did it take to eat for gods sake you picked up food put it in your mouth chewed and swallowed she found reeannas office knocked she hesitated for less than five seconds when the recorder light beeped green then slid the door open if reeanna didnt want her inside shed have kept it locked eve decided and indulged herself in a thorough study it looked like reeanna she decided polished to a bright sheen underlying sexual tones in the slashes of fiery red in the laser art against cool white walls the desk faced the window to provide reeanna with a constant view of the busy sky traffic the sitting area was plush with a deeply cushioned bodyform lounger that still held the imprint of its last occupant reeannas curves were impressive even in silhouette the clear plasticide table was hard as stone and was intricately carved with diamond patterns that caught and refracted the light from an archedneck lamp with a rosetoned shade eve picked up the vr goggles laid on it saw they were indeed roarkes latest model and set them down again they still made her uncomfortable turning away she studied the workstation across the room nothing soft or feminine about that area she noted it was all business slick white counter muscle flexing equipment even now hard at work she heard the low hum of a computer on auto frowned at the symbols flickering on the monitor they looked similar to what shed tried to decipher from roarkes screen but then computer codes all looked the same to her curious she walked over to the desk but nothing interesting had been left out to examine a silver pen a pair of pretty gold earrings a hologram of william wearing a flight suit and grinning youthfully a short printout again in that baffling computer code eve sat on the edge of the desk she didnt want to fit her wiry build into the imprint left by reeannas pulling out her communicator she tagged peabody anything devanes son is willing to cooperate hes aware of the interest she had in games particularly role playing it wasnt an interest he shared but he claims he knows one of her usual partners he dated her for a short time ive got her name she lives right here in new york i have the data should i transmit i think you can handle an interview solo arrange a meet bring her in only if she refuses to cooperate report back yes sir peabodys voice remained sober but her eyes lighted with the assignment im on my way satisfied eve tried for feeney hit his frequency occupied recording she had to settle for leaving a request for contact the door opened reeanna stopped her rush inside when she spotted eve at her desk oh eve i didnt expect you quite yet times part of my problem i see she smiled let the door shut i suppose roarke cleared you in i guess he did problem no no reeanna waved her hand im distracted i suppose william went on endlessly about some glitches hes concerned about i left him brooding over his creme brulee she flicked a glance toward her humming computer the work never stops around here r and ds a twentyfour seven proposition she smiled like police work i imagine well i didnt take time for brandy would you like some no thanks on duty coffee then reeanna moved over to a counter requested a snifter of brandy a cup of black coffee youll have to excuse my lack of focus were a little behind schedule today roarke needed data on the new vr model and he wanted it from conception to implementation that was yours i didnt realize that until he mentioned it just now oh williams mostly though i had a small part now she handed eve the coffee then took her brandy around the desk to sit what can i do for you im hoping youll agree to that consult the subject is currently in custody now lawyered but i dont think well be blocked there i need a profile angling from your particular area of expertise genetic branding reeanna tapped her fingers interesting what are the charges im not free to discuss that until i have your agreement and clear the session with my commander once thats done id like the testing scheduled for seven hundred seven am reeanna winced ouch and here im a night owl rather than a lark you want me up and running at that hour give me some incentive she smiled a little i can assume youve already had mira test your subject and the results werent to your liking second opinions arent unusual it was a defensive answer she felt defensive and eve realized she felt guilty no but dr miras reports are sterling and theyre very rarely questioned you want him badly i want the truth badly to find it i have to separate theory and lies and deceptions she pushed off the desk look i thought you were interested in doing this sort of thing i am very but i like to know what im dealing with id need the subjects brain scan ive got it in evidence really her eyes gleamed catlike its also important to have all available data on his biological parents are they known we accessed that data for dr miras test itll be available to you reeanna leaned back swirling her brandy it must be murder her lips twitched at eves expression after all thats your field the study of the taking of lives you could put it that way how do you put it the investigation of the takers yes yes but in order to do so you study the dead and death itself how it happened what caused it what transpired in those last moments between the taker and the victim fascinating what kind of personality is required to study death routinely day after day year after year as a vocation does it scar you eve or harden you it pisses you off she said shortly and i dont have time to philosophize sorry bad habit reeanna let out a sigh william tells me i analyze everything to death she smiled not that its a crime that sort of murder and i am interested in assisting you call your commander she invited ill wait and see if clearance is forthcoming then we can go over details i appreciate it eve removed her communicator turned away and requested display only it took longer and was she felt less effective the coding through of information and request how could you add your instincts your determination to a display but she did her best and waited what the hell are you trying to do dallas override mira i want another opinion commander its well within procedure im pursuing all angles if im unable to convince the pa to charge jess with coercion to selfterminate i dont want the lesser charges to slide i need verification of intent to harm it was pushing it and she knew it eve waited with a knotted stomach while whitney mulled over his decision just give me the opening she thought he needs his ears pinned back he needs to pay youre cleared to proceed on my authorization lieutenant this better not be a waste of budget we both know miras report will weigh heavily understood and appreciated dr otts report will give barrows lawyer a headache if nothing else im currently working on detailing connection between suspect and victims results will be available by nine hundred hours be damn sure of it my butt is now swinging with yours whitney out eve let out a long quiet breath shed bought a little more time and that was all she admitted to herself she was after with time she could dig deeper if roarke and feeney couldnt pull out data there was no one off or on planet who could jess would pay but murder would go unavenged she closed her eyes a moment and that was where she stood avenging the dead she opened her eyes again wanting to align herself before she relayed the details to reeanna thats when she saw it in black and white there on the computer monitor mathias drew logged as autophile mathias drew logged as banger mathias drew logged as holodick her heartbeat jerked but her hand was steady as a rock as she switched her communicator from off to open signaling to peabody and feeney on code one backup required respond immediately to transmission source she pocketed the card turned the commander okayed the consult reluctantly im going to need results reeanna youll get them reeanna sipped her brandy then shifted her gaze to the sleek little unit on her desk your heart rate just spiked eve and your adrenaline level rose dramatically she angled her head oh dear she murmured and lifted her sparkling hand it held an official nypsd stunner thats a problem several floors above roarke scanned the new data on mathias hummed over it now we re getting somewhere he thought he switched back to auto and tuned in to the data on the new vr unit wasnt it odd he thought and interesting that some of the components on jess barrows magic console so closely mirrored the components of his new unit then he swore softly when his interoffice link buzzed i dont want interruptions im sorry sir theres a mavis freestone here she claims youll see her he switched the second computer to auto blocked both audio and video let her in caro and you can log out for the day i wont need you anymore thank you ill bring her back directly roarke frowned to himself idly picked up the vr unit reeanna had left him to try out a few adjustments he mused improved for the next release it was loaded with subliminal options and could explain the coincidence of similarity still he didnt care for it he began to consider a possible leak in his r and d division he wondered just what william had come up with as alterations for the second manufacturing run and tucked a disc into his alternate unit it wouldnt hurt to run the data while he saw just what mavis had on her mind his machine beeped acceptance began to upload as his door opened mavis whirled in like a freak storm its my fault all my fault and i dont know what to do roarke came around the desk took maviss hands and sent an understanding look at his baffled assistant go on home ill deal with this oh and leave the security open for my wife please sit down mavis he steered her to a chair take a breath reading her accurately he patted her head and dont cry whats all your fault jess he used me to get to you dallas said it wasnt my fault but ive thought about it and it is she gave one long heroic sniffle ive got this she held up a disc and this is i dont know maybe evidence you take it okay he nipped the disc out of her hand as she waved wildly why havent you given it to eve i would i was going to i thought she was here i dont think im supposed to have it i didnt even tell leonardo about it im a terrible person she finished hysterical women had come his way before roarke slipped the disc into his pocket walked over and ordered a tall soother of the milder variety here drink this what sort of evidence do you think this is mavis i dunno you dont hate me do you darling i adore you drink it down really she gulped obediently i really like you roarke and not just because youre rolling in credits or anything its good that you are cause poor sucks right it does indeed but either way you make her so happy she doesnt even know how happy because shes never been you know yes three slow quiet breaths now ready one okay she took them very seriously her eyes on his youre good at this calming people down i bet she doesnt let you do it for her much no she doesnt or she doesnt know it when i do he smiled we know her dont we mavis we love her im so sorry tears came but they were soothing and soft i figured it out after i ran the disc i gave you at least i figured out some of it its a copy of the lay down from my video i ran it off on the sly i wanted it for posterity you know but theres a memo after it she looked down at her hands this is the first time i played it the first time i heard it all he gave a copy to dallas but he made notes after this version about she broke off lifted suddenly dry eyes i want you to hurt him for this i want you to hurt him really bad play it from where ive cued it roarke said nothing but he rose and slid the disc into his entertainment unit the screen filled with light with music then the volume and intensity lowered as a background for jesss voice im not sure what the results will be one day ill find the key to tapping in at the source for now i can only speculate the suggestion is to the memory the reenactment of trauma somethings at the core of those shadows on dallass mind something fascinating what will she dream tonight after playing the disc how long will it be before i can seduce her to share it all with me what secrets does she hide its such fun to wonder im just waiting for the chance to tap into roarkes darker side oh he has one so close to the surface you can almost see it thinking of them together with just the animal in control gives me such a rush i cant think of two more fascinating subjects for this project god bless mavis for opening the door within six months ill know these two so well anticipate their reactions so clearly ill be able to lead them right where i want them then theres no limit fame fortune adulation ill be the goddamn father of virtual pleasure roarke remained silent as the disc ran out he didnt remove it certain his fingers would crush it like powder ive already hurt him he said at length but not enough not nearly enough he turned to mavis shed risen and stood small as a fairy her slipshouldered dress of pink gauze somehow valiant you arent responsible for this roarke told her maybe thats true i have to work that out but i know he wouldnt have gotten that close to her or you without me will that help keep him in a cage i think hell hear the lock turn and wait a long time before he hears it open again youll leave it with me yeah ill get out of your hair now youre always welcome here her mouth quirked if it wasnt for dallas youd have run like hell in the opposite direction the first time you saw me he came to her kissed her firmly on that crooked mouth that would have been my mistake and my loss ill call a car for you you dont have to a car will be waiting for you at the front entrance she rubbed a hand under her nose one of those mag limos absolutely he walked her to the door closed it thoughtfully behind her the disc would be enough he hoped to drive another nail in jess but it still didnt point to murder he went back ordered both of his machines to display on screen sitting behind his desk he picked up the vr goggles and studied the data o o eve lowered her gaze to the stunner from her angle she couldnt be sure which setting was clicked a sudden move she knew could result in anything from mild discomfort and partial paralysis to death its illegal for a civilian to own or operate that weapon she said coolly i dont believe thats particularly relevant under the circumstances take yours out eve slowly and by the fingertips then set it on the desk i dont want to hurt you reeanna added when eve made no move to obey i never have not really but ill do whatevers necessary keeping her eyes on reeannas eve reached slowly for her side arm and dont think about trying to use it i dont have this on max but it is on a very high setting you wont have use of your extremities for days and though the possible brain damage isnt necessarily permanent it is very inconvenient eve knew very well what the stunner could do and she took out her weapon carefully laid it on the corner of the desk youll have to kill me reeanna but youll have to do it face to face in person it wont be like the others im going to try to avoid that a short painless even enjoyable session on vr and we can adjust your memory and direct your target youre well aimed at jess eve why dont we just keep it that way why did you kill those four people reeanna they killed themselves eve you were right there when cerise devane jumped off that building one has to believe what one sees with ones own eyes she sighed or most do youre not most are you why did you kill them i merely encouraged them to end their lives in a certain manner at a certain time and why reeanna shrugged her lovely shoulders why because i could she smiled beautifully and gave her bell tinkle of a laugh chapter twenty it wouldnt take long eve calculated for peabody or feeney to home in on her signal she just needed time and she had a feeling reeanna would provide it some egos like some people fed on regular admiration reeanna fit on both levels did you work with jess that amateur reeanna tossed her hair at the idea hes a piano player not that he doesnt have a certain talent for basic engineering but he lacks vision and guts she added with a slow feline smile women are so much more courageous and more vicious than men all in all dont you agree no i think courage and viciousness have no gender well disappointed reeanna pursed her lips briefly in any case i corresponded with him briefly a couple of years ago we exchanged ideas theories the anonymity of underground eservices are handy i enjoyed his pontificating and was able to flatter him into sharing some of his technical progress but i was well ahead of him frankly i never thought hed get as far as he apparently has simple mood expanding i imagine with some direct suggestion she cocked her head close enough you went farther oh leagues why dont you sit down eve wed both be more comfortable im comfortable on my feet as you like but a few steps back if you dont mind she gestured with the stunner i wouldnt want you to try for your weapon id have to use this and id hate to lose such a good audience eve took a step back she thought of roarke several floors above he wouldnt come down to seek her out at least she didnt have that concern if anything hed call down if he locked onto something so he was safe and she could stall youre a medical doctor eve pointed out a psychiatrist youve spent years studying to help the human condition why take lives reeanna when youre trained to save them branded at conception perhaps she smiled oh you dont like that theory youd have used it to push your case but you dont like it you dont know where you came from or from what she saw eves eyes flicker and nodded pleased ive studied all available data on eve dallas as soon as i learned roarke was involved with you im very attached to roarke once toyed with the idea of making our alltoobrief liaison into something more permanent he dumped you the smile froze as the insult hit target thats beneath you such a petty female hit no he didnt we simply drifted in opposite directions i had intended to drift back lets say eventually so i was intrigued when he took such an avid interest in a cop of all things not his usual taste certainly not his usual style but you are interesting more so after i accessed data on you she made herself comfortable on the arm of the relaxation chair the weapon stayed aimed and steady the young abused child found in a dallas alley broken battered confused no memory of how shed gotten there whod beat her raped her abandoned her a blank i found that fascinating no past no parents no hint of what made her im going to enjoy studying you you wont get your hands in my head oh but i will youll even suggest it yourself once you take a trip or two on the unit ive made just for you i really hate that im going to have to see to it that you forget everything we discuss here you have such a keen mind such a strong energy but it will give us a chance to work together as fond as i am of william hes so shortsighted how involved is he he has no idea the first test i ran on the doctored unit was on william quite a success and it made things so much easier i could direct him to adjust each unit i wanted hes quicker more adept electronically than i he actually helped me refine the design and personalize the one i sent to senator pearly why another test he was very vocal about the misuse of subliminals he enjoyed games as im sure youve discovered but he continually pushed for regulations censorship if you ask me he stuck his nose into pornography consenting adult dual controls commercial advertising and its use of suggestion all manner of things i thought of him as my sacrificial lamb how did you gain access to his brain pattern william hes very clever it took him several weeks of intense work but he managed to hack through security she angled her head enjoying the moment at the top level of nypsd as well he injected a virus there just to keep your edd men occupied and thats where you accessed my pattern indeed it is he has a soft heart my william it would pain him horribly to know he had a vital part in coercion but you used him you made him part of it and it doesnt pain you at all no it doesnt william made it all possible and if not him there would have been another he loves you you can see it oh please it made her laugh hes a puppy all men are when it comes to an attractive female form they simply sit up and beg thats amusing occasionally irritating and always useful intrigued she touched her tongue to her top lip dont tell me you havent used your basic female advantage on roarke we dont use each other youre missing a simple advantage but reeanna flicked it away the esteemed dr mira would label me a sociopath with violent tendencies and a driving need for control a pathological liar with an unhealthy even dangerous fascination with death eve waited a beat and would you agree with that analysis dr ott yes indeed my mother selfterminated when i was six my father never got over it he turned me over to my grandparents and wandered off to heal i dont believe he ever did but i saw my mothers face after shed taken the lethal handful of pills she looked quite beautiful and very happy so why shouldnt death taken be an enjoyable experience try it eve suggested and see then she smiled ill help you one day perhaps after ive completed my study were laboratory rats then not toys not games but experiments droids for dissecting yes young drew i regretted that because he was young and had potential id consulted with him rashly i see now when william and i were working on the olympus resort he fell in love with me so young i was flattered and williams very tolerant of outside distractions he just knew too much so you sent him a modified unit and told him to hang himself basically it wouldnt have been necessary but he didnt want to let the relationship die it meant he had to before he lost that glaze infatuation puts over a mans eyes and looked too closely you stripped your victims eve added the final humiliation no reeanna appeared shocked and insulted by the idea not at all basic symbolism were born naked and naked we die we complete the circle drew died happy they all did no suffering no pain at all joy in fact im not a monster eve im a scientist no youre a monster reeanna and these days society puts their monsters in a cage and keeps them there you wont be happy in a cage it wont happen jess will pay youll fight to put him there after my report tomorrow and if you cant make the coercion charges stick youll always believe he was responsible and when there are others ill be very select very careful and ill see to it that each subject selfterminates well out of your range you wont be bothered by it again you arranged for two in my range a sickness churned in her stomach to get my attention in part i did want to watch you at work watch you closely step by step just to see if you were as good as reported you detested fitzhugh and i thought why not do my new friend eve a little favor he was a pompous ass an irritant to society and a very poor game player i wanted his death to be bloody he preferred blood games you know i never met him in person but matched with him in cyberspace now and again a poor loser he had family eve managed like pearly mathias and cerise devane oh life goes on she waved a dismissing hand all will adjust thats human nature and as for cerise she was no more maternal than an alley cat it was all ambition with her she bored me senseless the most entertainment she ever provided was dying on camera what a smile they all smiled that was my little joke and my gift to them the final suggestion die its so beautiful its amusing and so joyful die and experience the pleasure they died experiencing the pleasure they died with a frozen smile and a burn on the brain reeannas brows drew together what do you mean a burn where the hell was her backup how much longer could she stall you didnt know about that your little experiment has a slight defect reeanna it burns a hole in the frontal lobe leaves what we could call a shadow or a fingerprint your fingerprint thats nothing but she worried her lip as she considered it the intensity of the subliminal could cause that i suppose it has to get in firmly to bypass the instinctive resistance the kneejerk survival instinct well have to work on that see what can be adjusted annoyance shadowed her eyes william will have to do better i dont like flaws your experiments full of them you have to control william to continue how many times have you used the system on him reeanna would continued use expand that burn i wonder what kind of damage it could cause it can be fixed she tapped the fingers of her free hand on her thigh distracted hell fix it ill do a new scan on him study the flaw if he has one repair it oh hell have one eve stepped closer judging the distance the risk they all had one and if you cant repair williams youll probably have to terminate him you couldnt risk that flaw becoming larger causing uncontrolled behavior could you no no ill look into this immediately tonight it may already be too late reeannas eyes snapped back adjustments can be made will be made i havent come this far accomplished this much to accept any sort of failure and yet to succeed fully youll have to control me and i wont make it easy i already have your brain pattern reeanna reminded her ive already implemented your program its going to be very easy ill surprise you eve promised and roarke you cant manufacture without him and hell find out do you expect to control him as well that will be a particular pleasure i did have to adjust the time schedule id hoped to enjoy him first a little trip you might say down memory lane roarkes so creative in bed we havent taken time to compare those notes but im sure youll agree it put eves teeth on edge but she spoke coolly using your toy for sexual gratification dr ott how unscientific and what fun im not the master william is but i do enjoy a good creative game and thats how you met all your victims so far through the loops and the underground games can be relaxing and entertaining and both william and i agreed that processing input from players would help us develop more creative options for the new vr she fluffed at her hair not that anyone had in mind what i was creating her gaze shifted to the monitor frowned over the data being transmitted from roarkes office he was processing the vr specs now she noted but youve already got roarke digging not just on young drew but on the unit itself i wasnt happy about that but there are always ways around inconveniences her smile tilted up at the comers roarke isnt as necessary as you believe who do you suppose will own all of this if something happened to him she laughed again pure delight as eve stared blankly why you will darling it will all be yours in your control and therefore mine dont worry i wont let you stay a widow long well find someone for you ill choose him personally terror froze her blood iced her muscles closed frigidly around her heart you made a unit for him just completed this afternoon i wonder if hes tested it yet roarke is so efficient and so personally interested in all of his holdings she shot a stream at eves feet anticipating her dont ill just stun you and this will take longer ill kill you with my own hands eve forced air in and out of her lungs ordered herself to think i swear it o o in his office roarke frowned over the data hed converted missing something he thought what am i missing he rubbed the strain out of his eyes sat back he needed a break he decided clear the mind rest the eyes picking up the vr unit on his desk he turned it over in his hands o o you wont chance it if you do and i stun you youll never get to him in time theres always the hope you can stop it save him her smile spread again derisively you see i understand you eve perfectly do you eve asked and instead of lunging forward leaped back lights out she shouted snatching for her weapon as the room pitched into darkness she felt the slight sting as reeannas aim wavered skimmed her shoulder then she was down blocked by the desk and gritting her teeth against the pain shed rolled fast but not well and had come down hard on her bad knee im better at this than you eve said calmly but the fingers in her right hand tingled and shook forcing her to switch the weapon to her left youre the amateur here ditch the weapon and i might not kill you kill me reeannas voice was a hiss youve got too much cop programmed into you maximum force only when all other methods fail near the door eve told herself holding her breath training her ears to the right of it theres no one here but you and me whos to know too much conscience dont forget i know you ive been in your head you wouldnt be able to live with it moving closer to the door thats it keep going just a little more try to get out you bitch and ill drop you like a piece of spoiled meat maybe youre right maybe ill just cripple you weapon gripped eve bellied around the desk the door opened but instead of reeanna rushing out william started in reeanna what are you doing in the dark even as eve leaped to her feet reeannas finger twitched on the weapon sending williams nervous system jittering oh william for gods sake it was disgust rather than distress as he started to topple reeanna ducked under him and threw herself at eve her nails scraped viciously across eves breasts as both women crashed to the floor she knew where to aim shed tended every bump and bruise on eves body and now battered at them twisted jabbed a knee rammed against that tender hip a balled fist slammed into the wrenched knee blind with pain eve shot out an elbow heard the satisfactory crunch of cartilage as it connected with reeannas nose reeanna screamed a high female sound and dug in with her teeth bitch sinking to the same level eve grabbed a handful of hair and yanked then slightly ashamed of the lapse she jammed her weapon under reeannas chin breathe too hard and ill put you out lights on she was panting bloody her body singing with pain she hoped there would be satisfaction later at seeing her opponents beautiful face bruised smeared with blood that continued to stream out of her broken nose but for now there was too much fear im putting you out anyway no you wont reeannas voice was steely calm and her lips curved into a wide brilliant smile i will she said and twisted the wrist of the weapon hand eve pinned until the point rested against the side of her neck i hate cages and smiling she fired jesus jesus christ she scrambled up while reeannas body still shuddered shoved william over snatched out his pocket link he was breathing but she didnt much give a damn she started to run answer me you answer me she shouted at the link as she fumbled it on roarke she ordered main office answer me goddamn it then she bit back a scream as the transmission refused to go through line currently in use please wait or retry momentarily bypass you son of a bitch how do you bypass with this thing she increased her pace to a limping gallop not even aware she was weeping footsteps pounded toward her in the breezeway but she didnt even pause dallas holy god back there she raced past feeney barely heard his frantic questions through the roaring sea of terror in her head back there peabody with me hurry she hit the elevator pounded on the call control hurry hurry dallas whats happened peabody touched her shoulder was jerked off youre bleeding lieutenant whats the status roarke oh god oh god please tears were streaming scalding her blinding her panic sweat flooded out of her pores soaking her skin shes killing him shes going to kill him in reaction peabody pulled her weapon as they rushed through the opening doors of the elevator top floor east wing eve shouted now now now she all but threw the link at peabody get this fucker to bypass its damaged its been dropped or something whos got roarke reeanna shes dead dead as moses but shes killing him she couldnt breathe couldnt her lungs wouldnt hold air well stop him whatever she told him to do to himself well stop him she turned wild eyes on peabody shes not taking him well stop him peabody was through the doors with her before they fully opened eve was still faster even injured she gained speed through terror she wrenched at the door cursed security and slammed her hand down on the palm plate she all but ran over him as he stepped to the threshold roarke she burrowed into him would have climbed inside him if she could oh god youre all right youre alive whats happened to you he tightened his grip on her as she shuddered but she was jerking back grabbing his face in her hands staring into his eyes look at me did you use it did you test the vr unit no eve peabody drop if he moves wrong call the mts were taking him in for a brain scan the hell you are but go ahead and call them peabody shes going to the health center this time if i have to knock her unconscious eve stepped back fighting for breath as she carefully measured him she couldnt feel her legs wondered why she could still stand upright you didnt use it i said i didnt he pushed a hand through his hair its aimed at me this time is it i should have seen it he turned away glanced over his shoulder as eve lifted her weapon oh put that damn thing down im not suicidal im pissed she slipped it right by me it just started to click five minutes ago mindoc mind doctor he elaborated thats the name she used in her game playing shes still using it still playing mathias had dozens of transmissions to her in the year before he died and i took a close look at the data report on the unit the one they just gave me and the stats from the files they hadnt buried those deeply enough she knew youd find it thats why she eve broke off sucked in air that she could hear whistle eerily in her swimming head thats why she personalized a unit for you i might have gotten around to testing it if i hadnt been interrupted he thought of mavis nearly smiled i doubt ree put much effort into altering data she knew i trusted her and william it wasnt william not voluntarily he only nodded looked at her ruined shirt the bright red splashes did she bloody you its mostly hers she hoped she didnt want to be taken in eve blew out a breath shes dead roarke selfterminated i couldnt stop her maybe i didnt want to she told me the unit your unit her breath was wheezing again hitching skipping i thought i didnt think id be in time i couldnt make the link work and i couldnt get here she didnt hear peabody close the door to give her privacy she didnt care about privacy she only continued to stare blind now and shudder i couldnt she said again i stalled her all that time i was stalling her building my case and you could have been eve he came to her gathered her close im not and you did get here i wont leave you he pressed his lips to her hair when she buried her face against his shoulder its over now she knew shed replay that endless run the panic and the helpless grief a thousand times in her dreams its not therell be a full investigation not just of reeanna but of your company the people who worked with her on the project i can stand it he tipped her head back the companys clean i promise i wont cause you any official embarrassment lieutenant by being arrested she took the handkerchief he pressed into her hand blew her nose be hell for my career being married to a con
