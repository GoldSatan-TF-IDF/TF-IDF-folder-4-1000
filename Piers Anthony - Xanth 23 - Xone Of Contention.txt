this is a work of fiction all the characters and events portrayed in this novel are either fictitious or are used fictitiously xone of contention lemon edsel struggled with the program but it just wouldnt jell the problem really was in the software which was unusually unintelligible how could he make it seem easy and user friendly when its programmers had evidently labored decades to make it difficult and hostile this was of course how he earned his living designing software to make other software seem nice but in this case he needed to tweak a default in the computer operating system and access to the key level was barred that was the fundamental bone ol contention damn you macrohard he swore softly just once couldnt you give a person a break im not trying to steal doors irom you just to put a special function on the keypad enter key so grundy golem can work independent of the mouse there are folk who don t like being chained to the mouse you know this isnt dizzy world would it hurt you so bad to let someone have it his own way for a change but of course he knew the answer yes it would truly pain the company to let a user ever hae it his own way macrohard never wanted anyone to forget ior half an instant exactly who was the master and who was the least important person in the universe it couldn t stop third party programmers like edsel from trying to alleviate things but it could and did make sure that they were unable to make any significant improvements so the bone became a whole zone of contention piers anthony there had to be a way around this block he had all the rest of it figured outif he could just use this one key if he could only get in there to redefine it without macrohard catching on he almost thought he had a glimmer of a way but he couldnt quite grasp it he was up against a deadline and this one aspect balked him maddeningly this wasnt like his problem with the printer hich doors refused to allow to use its two paper trays both had to have paper but only one could be drawn from so that he could not have one tray feeding paper while he refilled the other cycling through without delaying his work that had been a real aggravation when he had changed to doors its deliberate crippling of the useful features of his printer that he had always used before but what could he do doors had become just about the only game in town and it slammed shut on any fingers it chose he had survived that aggravation but he had not been under a deadline then maybe if he took a break got his mind off it for an hour the way would come to him sometimes it was like that you had to take the pressure off the gate before you could unlatch it he remembered his frustration the first time he needed to format a floppy disk and doors didnt even list formatting as an option their help feature did tell where to find it but neglected to clarify that a right mouse click was necessary instead of the left one to get the proper menu macrohard was a genius at providing the necessary function but effectively disabling it by the selective omission of a key detail so that most users could not get the benefit of it truly fine sadism so he had wasted precious time before finally finding it by chance that was too often the only way as with evolution time and chance and that could be wearing on the psyche while the anonymous doors programmers surely laughed their nerdly heads off they evidently loved making working folk waste time energy and patience edsel got up and walked to the garage there was his pride the lemon motorcycle he had had it for years and it was a great old machine just a little off its feed right now but some tinkering with the carburetor should fix that he laid out his tools and got to work he always felt better when with his fine machine the nerviest thing he had ever done was to put it up as his stake in a bet with his friend dug but it had been important because he had won that bet and gotten pia the bet had been that dug who had hated computer games would like companions of xanth the x ne of contfntion motorcycle against the girl not only had dug liked the game he had come out of it with a new girlfriend kiin now his wife so his old girlfriend pia was freed to be with edsel a winwin situation for the home team or was it now it was seven years later and his marriage to pia was in trouble somehow they seemed to fight more than they made love sometimes they did both together he was beginning to wonder whether they had made a mistake dug and kim hadnt their marriage was solid and harmonious which was odd because kim really wasnt lovely she wasnt nearly as pretty as pia and not half as sexy she also talked too much but somehow she seemed just right for dug she clearly adored him and he adored her edsel wasnt sure there had ever been a hard word between them in contrast to the way it was between edsel and pia edsel had asked dug about that once how he had discovered kim and how they managed to get along so well the answer had been perplexing sure kim didnt seem like much but then she kissed me that was it that was it and when theres a problem she kisses me again when we have a problem pia wont kiss me at all shes like that dug had agreed that had reminded edsel how pia had once been dugs girlfriend and he didnt care to dwell on that he took down the carburetor but the problem didnt seem to be there it was clean and clear maybe in the gasoline line that could get more complicated edsel he jumped yes dear he replied hoping this was not going to be another scene she looked and sounded furious talk about a zone of contention dont yes dear me what are you doing here why havent you finished that cuss companion program yet you know you shouldnt be goofing off here when we have a deadline cant you finish anything i just got a call from kim asking if she can tell the buyer its in the mail ill have to tell her no because my idiotic husband cares more for his junkcycle than for his job he didnt try to explain it wouldnt do any good when she was like this but he did need to get back to the companions program piers anthony he looked at his watch three hours had passed he had gotten lost in the lemon and his thoughts and spent way more time than he could afford pia had a right to be angry he reassembled things as rapidly as ieasible and washed his hands he went to hnd pia hoping to explain but she was on the phone giving kim an earful it was an irony of the situation that the two women got along great maybe that was because pia was glad kim was taking up dugs attention and kim was glad that pia wasnt taking his attention so he went to the office and put the companions program on his computer running through its routine he was rather proud of it overall a little figure obviously fashioned of wood and rag appeared hi im grundy golem your companion of the moment speak basic c and other computer languages but you dont need to worry about that ill translate everything to your tongue please check in your name gender age status and whatever a checkoff sheet appeared edsel typed m his name and checked male married this part was optional but it added to the effect thats great edsel grundy said what do you want to know click your cursor on one of these words or select it by touching alt and the first letter and touch keypad enter the figure held up a sign listing a number of popular programs edsel clicked on macrohard doors excess good grundy said now before we get into this edsel i must tell you that ou dont need to have me as your guide his voice come through the system speakers this was a multimedia program you can choose any of these others by selecting or clicking on them several pictures appeared one of them was pia it had amused them all to have her be the model for their own program she looked great because a program figure didnt put on weight the way a living one did edsel clicked pia her picture came to life she was wearing a dark blue jacket and skirt and had small golden earrings representing pluto the p planet very well edsel she said dulcetly now how can i help you with excess do you know anything about spreadsheets or databases she smiled she had a nice smile in fact she had a nice everything in appearance he clicked no well they are both ways of storing and using information she said would you like me to walk you through the basics xont of contfntion this time he clicked no though she had a lovely walk she faced him putting on a cute smile of perplexity whut would you like edsel just type it in and ill do my best he typed disrobe if you wish she opened her jacket and drew it off revealing a tight wellfilled sweater she put her hands on its base and began to draw it up showing a sheer blouse beneath then she paused catching on heyits supposed to be the program im helping you with edsel not your sex life he smiled he had always liked that part that was as close as the companion pia ever came to quarreling and farther on in the program she would remove the sweater if asked and later the sheer blouse too but it took precise management to get her to remove her bra or skirt and that only after the user had demonstrated some competence in excess her figure was worth the effort though to date they had had only three complaints about that feature and dozens of notes of appreciation and the program had sold well one mothers letter had been choice thank you so much for teaching my thirteen year old son to operate excess i dont know how you did it but he learned it readily when he used your companions guide after getting nowhere elsewhere he even runs through the guide for refreshers every so often and his friends are learning too they all say yours is the best obviously mother herself had not caught on to the secret lure and junior wasnt telling modern teens were not stupid about software of the feminine kind or about the attitudes of parents edsel canned the program it was the update for the discuss word processor he was working on now popularly known as cuss the latest revision of cuss word was even more complicated and balky than usual and really needed a good tutorial program for example it wouldnt let a file it made end in anything butdoc as if it were a cartoon rabbit on pain of horrendous filetrashing threats only by chance had he discovered that he could get around that by putting his proposed file names in quotes his tutorial clarified that and other dirty little secrets if he could just make it work he had to differentiate the two enter keys so that the companions guide could have its own okay key for special effects but he still couldnt figure out how to free it from macrohards malign grip dog in the manger if macro didnt want to use it nobody could that familiar bone of contention again pifcks anthoni maybe there would be inspiration on the gigagnd or the mundane mega mesh that enclosed the world he clicked the mode m site and was on his way thats rightgo hide m the grid the way you alwas do pia said sourly behind him oh go buy another box ot chocolates the way you always do he retorted he would rather make loe to her than fight her anytime but often there wasnt much choice she disappeared and he forged on into the grid it was always this way she had a sharp tongue and he inevitably responded their marriage was on the rocks and with it maybe their business it it werent for dug and kirn companions might have foundered already kim was gregarious so she was the saleswoman phoning clients emaihng them paying personal calls bringing in the orders that were their life blood dug handled the shipping and handling often delivering the larger orders personally for he was a handsome man who always made a good impression pia handled the accounts and edsel of course struggled with the programs he had let them down this time by trying for too much and now he didnt have a finished program for them to deliver he was the weak link and he hated that he was the lemon this time now he was cruising the gigagnd meandering through the mesh looking for inspiration maybe he could yet figure it out so that he could complete the program and they could deliver it late he whistled in the way he had smiling his tongue against the roof of his mouth it was easier than doing it purselipped and fewer people knew how to do it a double adantage as far as he was concerned he liked being different in inconsequential ways he became aware that he had drifted into strange territory there was a sign this is the oxone entry to the magic mesh requires the right spell penalty for abuse is a bunion edsel laughed this was a joke or a challenge he liked challenges almost as much as he liked jokes pia had been a challenge so it seemed that someone had set up a mesh leaf ilh a trick mode of entry and he would see if he could get m what would be the key he tried the usual run ot code words and signals but the didn t work then his left big toe began to hurt it felt like a bunion he put oice into his whistle wondering whether this could be coincidence how could a mesh leal give a person a bunion what kind of xone ol contention was this xom contention the sign changed spell accepted you are now in the oxone for assistance in navigating the magic mesh see breanna of the black wave spell accepted what was it talking aboutj ohit must be a joke the sign changing automatically after a moment encouraging him to hit on this leaf so okay he could play this game where was this black wave gal he walked down the hall and noticed two things first his bunion was gone and second what was he doing walking down a hall this was an address on the mundane mega mesh ot the gigagnd he was gamg at his computer screen and interfacing with mouse and keyboard yet he wasnt he was now walking down a hall there were booths along it each with a picture of a person and a name the colors were somehow brighter and clearer than those in his office and the air seemed fresher and here was the name breanna under the face of a cute black girl who looked to be about sixteen she must be the one so he lifted his knuckle and knocked on the picture it came to life ouch you hit me startled edsel apologized sorry i didnt mean to she looked at him what do you mean didnt mean to she de manded with cute severity you rapped me on the noggin with your knuckle ii thought it was just a picture i was knocking on the door you knowhitting the site i never thought it would be literal she stared at him youre mundane he was taken aback i confess i am you arenv of course not not any more now im xanthian in real life i mean this is just my magic mesh leaf how did you get into the o xone there was a sign saying something about a spell and a penalty and m foot began to hurt and i whistledand then i was here so i did what it said and looked you up breanna seemed mollified okay lets start at the top im breanna of the black wave my talent is to see m blackness who are you and whats yoursr im edsel ofot mundama and i guess my talent is to cruise the gigagnd or to make droll jokes but i neer found thisthis magic mesh before of course not its barred to most mundanes the picture considered it ucn a picture just her head and shoulders animate but flat like a tv image yet her eyes looked at him and she was responsive to his words you must have found a glitch a spell that wasnt programmed what exactly did you do well whistled like this he made a voiced whistle the picture wavered and became three dimensional breannas lips pursed thats magic all right it just enhanced my sight you mean your site she smiled that too maybe i mean suddenly i see you rounded instead of flat am the same to you yes but youre still just a head and shoulders i cant see your rounded portions though id like to she flashed another smile appreciating the implied humorous compliment for sure thais all there is of me in the leaf i mean how could the real me be here i dont know the real me seems to be here though that seems impossible for sure well have to patch that glitch but you dont seem bad for a mundane well i hope im not bad even if my marriage is patchy he hadnt meant to say that he was a little unsettled too bad youre not in xanlh marriages are forever there know my friend dug went to xanth and met kim there and they hae a happy marriage breannas eyes widened you know dug and kim mundane sure im in business with them i was the one who first put dug onto xanth the xanth game i mean i didnt know hed actually cross over yeah he was in the companions game i wish i could have been a companion oh why werent you i was too young then only nine anyway the black wave had just come into xanth then we didnt know our way around sherlock went with dug and found a good place by ogre chobee for us to settle in so i guess i cant complain but it sure sounds like tun it sure does he agreed well if im ever in xanth you can be my companion and show me around he felt a trace ot guilt as he or contention spoke because he was flirting with this cute girl and as a married man he shouldnt can thats great only i cant get into xanth he said with regret dug and kim go there only when invited there was some kind of trial something about a big bird i think roxanne roc breanna agreed she won shes just about the most important bird in xanth now except for the simurgh thats another great moment of history i missed bleep id sure like to be in on a great moment well i did get to go to jennys wedding then her picture paused orienting on him with wild surmise saymaybe we can do each other some good maybe you can visit xanth and i can be your companion and show you around and maybe that will be a great adventure and accomplish something nice like patching up your marriage edsel realized that breanna was a creature of dreams but her enthusiasm was contagious id like that but i dont see how i just got this wonderful wild notion here we are talking in the interface if we could stretch it a little farther and exchange places then maybe youd be in xanth and id be in mundama i wouldnt mind visiting it though t sure wouldnt want to stay then she reconsidered well maybe not you and me changing places exactly maybe i could switch with your wile and you could switch with my boyfriend justin justin justin tree he used to be a treewell he was a man first then a tree then we met and now were betrothed but we cant marry because im too young we cant even smooch much because im not supposed to know the adult conspiracy i hate that i mean whats the point in making him convert early to a young manhe took some youth elixir if we cant do anything its driving me crazy i think know the feeling edsel said though he hardly understood all of what she was saying so maybe if justin and i could switch with you folk and get into mundama for a while where theres not much enforcement of the conspiracy we could at least go from necking to petting and you folk could do whatever you wanted in xanth and our marriage wouldnt be in trouble because marriages never are this was surely sheer foolishness but it was wickedly tempting id do it if there were a way pifrs anthoni im thinking there could be a way with the right connection if nobody objected she cocked her head do you think sixteen is too young he knew what was on her mind i was sixteen when i got together with pia and she was fifteen a girl can be pretty mature at fifteen and moreso thereafter for sure she agreed happily and justms not young at all hes about ninety nine i think he thought he had misheard nineteen ninety nine she said carelully but he was a tree most of that time i told you but now hes been youthened to nineteen so hell be twenty one when im eighteen we think thats about right but hes got these grandfathery reservations about things you know about touching girls i figure if i can just get him safely alone for a week or so i can bash down those barriers she glanced at him again do you think so uh that depends if oh right you cant see the rest of me well its proportional especially when take off my clothes she did have adult notions as pia had had at that age then if hes got the body of a nineteen year old male and youre sixteen and proportional you should be able to handle him in about three minutes she laughed yeah thats what i figure when i get the chance anyway heres how physical travel between xanth and mundania is difficult unless you have a special pass oh i mean you can do it but youre liable to come out in some other time or place and be lost but exchanging bodiesi think thats feasible exchanging bodies he asked somewhat blankly youre a bit slow on the uptake arent you she remarked without rancor if switch with your wife and you switch with justin then the two of you would be in xanth youd be in our bodies but youd still be you and you could do what you wanted to so could we oh yes that could be interesting in tact as he considered it it seemed more than interesting if he could embrace breanna knowing it was really pia so he wasnt being unlaithful x his thought trailed into an ellipsis with a potentially infinite number of dots some of them were white dots like pia some were brown like breanna so lets see about it well need some magic to handle it but i think i know whom to check with ill have to go out of the oxone a moment though xoi or conttmlon what does the o stand for other i think because un neither here nor there its the interface between xanth and mundania a halfway zone im on duty because i remember some about mundania so can help folk like you though we havent been set up long and youre the first and youre not even a character a what a character xanth folk come here to the oxone and pretend to be mundanes and i guess mundanes try to pretend to be xanthians mostly in their xxone and maybe soon they can meet halfway when we get it organized scans working on it who sean baldwin hes mundane but hes with willow whos xanthian shes a winged elf actually sometimes he has to stay in mundania and she has to stay in xanth so they cant be together all the time so they want a connection and maybe this will be it breanna tended to provide more information than he could assimilate immediately but it did help some he returned to basics this business of exchanging bodiesim still not sure exactly how that works yeah i guess you ought to try it maybe you should step into a picture do what just walk on down to one of the scenes and think yourself into it and youll get a sample thats part of what the oxone is all about sampling the other side itll give you a feel for it though its really illusion illusion she frowned you are slow here in the oxone the magics not complete and illusions cheap so we use it a lot ive got to go check with nimby so you take a break in a picture and well meet here again when were both done okay uh okay he agreed the picture lost animation it was just a picture again instead of a video he turned and walked on down the hall looking at the other pictures the were of various fantasy scenes each painted on a large leaf one was a fanc castle with a moat around it and fruit trees beside it labeled castle roogna another was a monstrous gulf labeled gap chasm another was a group of centaurs that made him pause the males were muscuuu in their human aspects with large bows slung across their backs while the females wereextremely well endowed they wore no clothing on their bodies not even halters fascinating but he wasnt ready to tackle anything like that so he moved on until he came to a scene oi a deep quiet forest there was a squirrel in the foreground ordinary except ior one thing it had wings a flying squirrel of course that should do but how did he gel into that body even in illusion there didnt seem to be any instructions breanna had assumed he knew how forgetting how slow he was about such things think himself into it as she had suggested i am a squirrel he said tentatively nothing happened a winged squirrel still nothing he stared into the picture pondering did he need to humwhistle to invoke the magic he tried that and the picture seemed to shimmer and expand but he still wasnt in it the winged squirrel was still there with a dark trail wending into the background then irrelevantly he remembered a song it was about a young man who faced a difficult trip through a forest yet he anticipated it with joy he began to hum it thinking the words though the path is long and dark rocky steep and narrowthough the wood is dark and cold this brings me no sorrow because in that woodland lived his darling loved one edsel was married but he still liked romantic situations he pictured pia in that wood as lovely as she had been at sixteen then he was in the scene the forest was suddenly huge around him he took a step faltered and spread his wings for balance he was the flying squirrel could he really fly it seemed worth a try he faced in the direction of a glade spread his wings ran on his hind feet flappedand was airborne he pumped his wings frantically trying to maintain balance while gaining elevation but overdid it and stalled out he dropped landing on his tail no damage done fortunately but his clumsy effort had attracted attention suddenly a monstrous shape was entering the glade it was a firebreathing dragon edsel panicked he got all four feet under him folded his wings and scooted for the nearest underbrush a jet of flame passed over his head and he realized that the dragon had expected him to take flight so had aimed high but because he was really a landbound creature he had stayed on landand maybe saved himself a frying however the dragon wasnt through it was reorienting and this time it wouldnt miss brush would not protect him from that flamethrower xonf of contention edsel scrambled for the nearest tree getting behind it just as the flame set the brush on fire how could he escape he peered up the trunk of the tree the top seemed worlds away and he didnt trust his claws to hold on for all that he was a squirrel the dragon could toast him long before he got out of range he heard the ground shaking is it tramped toward the tree he would have to make a break for it on the ground maybe il he ran toward the dragon that would surprise it and he could get by it and beyond it before it could turn around then maybe he could find a hole in the ground or something a giant foot crashed down on one side of the tree edsel turned to the other sideand there was the dragons awful snoot he was trapped before he even got started i want out of here he cried and there he was back in the hall standing before the picture which now showed a dragon crouching by a tree his heart was pounding that had been one close escape if this was illusion he wasnt sure he would care to try the reality hed better tell breanna the deal was off he walked down the hall toward her leaf then bothered by something he turned back to the picture the dragon was now looking around evidently having lost the squirrel that was what edsel had wanted to know that the squirrel had escaped he had not led it into a frying or chomping he turned away again relieved as he approached the leaf it came to life oh there you are breannas face said did you enjoy yourself not exactly he said abashed i thought maybe youd try the one with the mermaids in the pool i hear they can be very friendly with human visitors i didnt see that one he said with real regret he could have entered a scene with friendly mermaids he had heard it said that a mermaid had all the good parts of a woman and none of the bad parts as if there were any bad parts or maybe the one showing the faun nymph retreat naturally im not supposed to know how they celebrate all day being underage but i have a suspicion youd find it interesting more than a suspicion he was sure he really should have checked out all the pictures before choosing one no i got into one with a flying squirrel that one i hope you watched out for the dragon pihrs anthony i did run afoul of the dragon it almost got me a couple of those fire jets just missed me yeah its enchanted to just barely miss each time to make it seem realistic even if the dragon scored on you it couldnt hurt you because its illusion a score that didnt work would ruin the effect but a near miss can be scary yes so he had been taken in by illusion when there was no danger that gave him new respect for illusion sokay i checked with chlorine and she says its fine except that i cant go to mundania you cant but thats not fine because you wanted to visit there with justm toyou know she shook her head no its okay really because im getting something better ill get to be your companion in xanth and maybe if theres some slack time like camping overnight if i try to stretch the adult conspiracy a little i wont even notice edsel said quickly or tell its your business nobody elses yeah she said gratefully chlorine understands too she used to be plain before things changed chlorine where i come from we put that in water you arent where you come from she said with half a smile youll meet nimby and chlorine tomorrow but theres more theyre going to visit mundania by switching bodies with you theyll need companions too to show them around because mundania can be just as dangerous as xanth for strangers so can you dig up a reliable pair of mundane companions mundane companions i suppose we could ask dug and kim great bring them here this time tomorrow and your wife and ill bring nimby and chlorine and justin and we can work it all out this should be a great adventure just like that but of course dug and kim had had experience in xanth so should have good advice what pia would think of this he wasnt sure but it was worth a try ill do that he said great breanna repeated see you tomorrow her picture reverted bemused edsel faced the oxone exit and walked as he came to the marked portal he saw it was a wall he did his humwhistle and suddenly he was out he could tell because he was looking at a monitor xonf or con ntion screen with a cursor blinking in front of him the hall with pictures was gone he exited the mesh and then the gigagnd he had some talking to do to several people first pia she was every bit as understanding as usual have you been doing drugs no he said patiently this is a mesh interface and maybe a chance for us to get into xanth for a visit the way dug and kim do just because theyre crazy enough to believe in fantasy is no reason we have to she retorted how could you fall for such a line of crap pia please i thought it would be good for our relationship to have a break a vacation in a magic land maybe we could mend fences or something as if you even care she said witheringly i do care iim sorry that things are going wrong maybe theyre going right did you ever think of that going right he asked blankly maybe it was a mistake us getting married maybe now were finally catching on maybe were getting ready to set things right i dont understand but he feared he did she softened ed some marriages arent meant to be i think we should consider divorce he was stunned she had said the d word he had thought she was going to recommend counseling dont want that but maybe its best to recognize the situation and take appropriate action there should be less pain that way she was serious she must have considered this pretty carefully and that knocked his world for a loop but what could he do he decided to go for double or nothing how about this lets make a deal you give this fantasy visit an honest try and if it doesnt work then illill not oppose a divorce if thats what you want she eyed him appraisingly you wont fight it i wont fight it though i dont want it id rather make love than war anytime but ill go along with it if thats the way you feel she nodded deal she extended her hand deal he agreed shaking her hand edsel called dug immediately dug and kim lived within a mile and the two couples often visited each other socially as well as for business reasons piers anthony kim answered the phone yes she inquired politely she had a nice voice edsel wecould we come over now theres something we need to discuss of course ill tell dug her tone indicated that she realized that this was not routine dug wheeled out the lemon and pia climbed on behind him putting her arms around his waist he had always liked riding with her feeling her thighs against his hips her bosom against his back her body wasnt quite as good as it had been but still appealed to him he wondered how he had changed to turn her off or whether she just had a short romantic attention span he started the machine and the engine came alive it skipped a little then settled down he still hadnt fixed the problem but it was marginal rather than serious so far he guided the lemon out into traffic two things he loved the motorcycle and his wife now the one was weakening and so was the other but the game wasnt over maybe he could save both you should have dumped this junk long ago pia muttered for a decent car but thought you liked my bike he protested times change painful truth her feeling had changed for the motorcycle and for the man if only he knew why actually he feared he did know why because pia was as shallow as she was lovely perhaps incapable of a meaningful longterm relationship she had always used her looks to get by and never developed a serious unselfish commitment to anything yet he remained smitten what he truly wanted was perhaps not even theoretically achievable the looks of pia as she had been at age sixteen and the character of kim or at least pias present appearance and an uplifting long term goal something she truly beheed in that didnt directly benefit herself they pulled into dug and kirns drive and parked pia got off but didnt go to the house she was waiting on edsel not from courtesy so much as an indication that this was his stupid notion to present to the other couple kim opened the door she was tall and lean in jeans and her lace was garden variety but she had a contagious enthusiasm for things she had short curly light brown hair and blue eyes edsel wondered for the xonfc of contention nth time what dug saw in her for dug had always been just as fascinated by sexy women as edsel was she had been a string bean at sixteen and remained one at twenty three pia in contrast had lustrous long dark brown hair sexy green eyes a cute heart shaped face and a figure that remained not tar short of great there simply was no comparison between them yet dug plainly doted on kim ever since she kissed him he said as if that made sense edsel paused to let pia enter first she was in a formfitting light sweater and a snug short skirt and her walk was a delight to behold no mystery what he saw in her dug met them inside sit down he said kim says its important edsel sat on the living room couch pia did not join him she chose an individual chair across the room crossing her legs that left edsel with mixed feelings he would have preferred to have her sit beside him but he had always been wowed by her legs especially from this angle she well knew her power over him but didnt look at him dug took another chair facing edsel rather than pia dug had once been pias boyfriend but he had treated her like a sister ever since kim came into his life edsel suspected that that bothered pia on some level though she wanted nothing romantic to do with dug the men she dumped werent supposed to do as well as dug had kim was left to join edsel on the couch she folded her legs beneath her and faced him expectantly how to start suddenly this seemed complicated ii found a new leaf on the mesh an interface with xanth called the oxone theyve set up the oxone already kim cried delighted wonderful now we can talk with xanth folk without having to go there whos there a black girl called breanna she breanna of the black wave of course shes ideal shes from mundama originally great girl uh yes she and i talked and decided to work an exchange so pia and i could visit xanth and two other folk could visit mundania an exchange kim asked picking right up on it it was easy to talk when she was the other party yes we would take the bodies of two people in xanth and they would take our bodies so there would be no actual physical crossing hut wed seem to be in each others worlds piers anthony fascinating kirn said enthusiastically that will make it much easier to visit xanth it gets complicated to do it physically though with illusion it can seem real how true yes but the thing is that well need guides because companions kirn said of course xanth is dangerous for unaccompanied strangers even when its all in a game and i guess mundania would he just as bad for xanthians she glanced at dug worse dug agreed on cue edsel envied their camaraderie they got along so well pia in contrast was staring vaguely at the ceiling bored not trying to help at all she was letting the world know that she didnt care one way or the other so if you go to xanth youll need good companions kim said and the ones who take your bodies will need good mundane companions dug and i will be glad to do it edsel was starting to catch on to what dug saw in her kim had not only anticipated his awkward request but agreed to it as if it were the most natural thing in the world thanks he said much relieved breanna and someone called justin will be our guides in xanth but i was concerned about imposing on you no problem at all kim said glancing again at dug who nodded were glad to help with anything connected to xanth this is such a great breakthrough we thought itd be another year before they got the oxone set up who is coming here someone called edsel scratched in his memory nimble i think and connne he remembered the name meant something like a pool cleaner but couldnt quite recover it though breanna had spoken it several times kim shook her head we dont know them but we dont have to well get acquainted soon enough so theyll look just like you two but their minds will be from xanth yes i agreed to have us all come in to the oxone tomorrow at noon so we could meet and work out the details thats great kim said you have worked it out perfectly impulsively she leaned across and planted a firm kiss on his mouth the world seemed to turn over edsel was floating on the elevated side of a ferris wheel high among pink clouds dizzy but happy suddenly the rest ot the mystery evaporated and he knew what dug meant that was the best kiss he had ever experiencedand it wasnt even serious if she had wanted to seduce him she could have done it merelv xonf of contention by holding the kiss longer of course that was not her intent and everyone knew it but what a kiss the clouds dissipated and he became aware of friendly laughter not shared by pia i should have warned you dug was saying she kisses he thought edsel was merely surprised that was the least of it sorry kim said half mischievously its just that it was such a relief we thought you were going to discuss something awful like the two of you breaking up now pia met edsel s gaze then she spoke were considering it but first well try visiting xanth things got abruptly serious you are considering it kim asked and now there was no mischief or humor in her expression or tone edsel realized that she had not forgotten that pia had been dugs first girlfriend surely she didnt want pia on the loose again we hope that a change of venue will help edsel said quickly like a vacation second honeymoon pia opened her mouth and by her expression nothing sweet or sentimental was about to come out but dug intercepted it xanth will surely do it theres no place like it well be there tomorrow to meet the others in the oxone and this time he shot kim a look kim jumped up right and wed better get our work done today in case that takes some time sorry you folk must rush off so soon beautiful edsel thought they were a perfect team always working together in a moment he and pia were out of the house and mounting the motorcycle this had better be good pia muttered as they started off edsel didnt answer he didnt want to risk getting into a quarrel now lest she change her mind about the deal it was clear that xanth was his only hope that afternoon he tackled the cuss word companions program and this time found a way to finesse it so he could address the key he needed after that things fell together and he completed it in good order he copied it to a backup disk and took it to pia now you can tell them its in the mail he said she stared at the disk you got it youre sure im sure put in it on your system and sec she hesitated then she came to a decision wait piers anthony he waited uncertain what was on her mind she phoned kirn the discuss companions is ready tell dug well bring it to you in an hour and he can copy it and ship it before the day is out she hung up an hour edsel asked we can have it there in fifteen minutes she stood stepped into him and kissed him then she led him to the bedroom bemused he realized that she was truly pleased to have the program done so that they would not default on a deadline and maybe she was jealous of kirns kiss too pia never apologized she just changed her mind like the popular conception of the ideal woman she had one effective way to make everything right and he was not about to object whatever other problems they might have they had none in bed when pia was amenable he knew that this was merely a gesture of the moment and that nothing longterm had changed but it would be one phenomenal moment he was correct next day they coordinated by phone then got on the gigagnd edsel was on his system and pia on hers in the other room and dug and kirn on their two systems at their house they met at a private online site they maintained checking in follow me edsel said knowing that they would lock on to his name and be earned along with him he made his way to the magic mesh when he came to the warning sign he typed party of four edsel pia dug kirn then he did his voice whistle the sign shimmered welcome to the oxone then they were standing in the hall of pictures oh pia breathed amazed she tugged at her skirt as if not believing that it was real maybe it was illusion as was her body but it was tangible its the oxone all right kirn said they have done a nice job she checked her own clothing she had put on a skirt and blouse for this occasion and looked decent edsel led the way to breannas leaf this time he did not knock hitting was too literal here breanna he said the picture animated good youre here this time were set up for it come in the picture expanded as her image fuzzed out and became an entrance to a comfortable chamber they stepped inside the room seemed larger from inside in fact it was like a huge living room with easy chans aiound the edge lacing in they stood in the center uncertain whether to sit then horn a hall on the opposite side a man and a woman entered the man seemed to be of college age and the woman of high school age in tact she was breanna this time complete youre right edsel said sun eying her body its proportional breanna smiled youve been kissed recently edsel it shows so i guess its okay for me she walked up to him embraced him and reached her face up to kiss him it felt real not destabilizing in the way of kims kiss or sexy in the way of pias kiss but solid and pleasant he had never been kissed by a black girl before and was almost surprised to discover that it was just like any other kiss she was a very nice little package breanna stepped back this is justm she said indicating the young man he looked quite ordinary not at all like a tree this is pia edsel said and dug and kim i know breanna said we havent met before but they aie well known in xanth and we know of you kim said we got a report on jennys wedding and you were there for sure so are we ready to meet nimby and chlorine kims jaw dropped who those are the names edsel said quickly i guess garbled them breanna glanced at him sharply you dont know who they are i never heard of them before yesterday breanna smiled maybe thats just as well they are the ones youll be exchanging with they want to visit mundama in tact it turns out they set this up so they could do it set this up ah here they are now two more people entered the room the man was handsome to the point of looking princely while the woman was so stunningly hnely that it was hard to look directly at her nimby and chlorine breanna said edsel tore his gaze from chlorine uh this is thank you chlorine said smoothly we know now there pitrs anthony should be no misunderstanding so i will spctl it out nimby is a demon who normally assumes dragon ass form in xanth hut he can take any form he wants and give any form to his companion we will borrow your forms in mundama but we think that something else is better for you in xanth she glanced around the room edsel glanced too as he wasnt sure what she meant dug and kim both seemed awed as if they were seeing something miraculous or incredible what was their problem better he asked blankly this then breanna and nimby changed forms becoming exact likenesses of edsel and pia complete to their clothing edsel stared suspecting that this was a mirror effect but pia was standing beside him his head swiveled looking from one woman to the other they were identical he could not distinguish them it was evident that pia had a similar problem with him so you can be yourselves in xanth chlorine continued except that you will have to have magic talents because everyone in xanth does then she and nimby reverted to their original forms abating the confusion something else occurred to edsel piashes diabetic will she be the same in xanth chlorine turned to breanna diabetic its a problem handling sugar in the body breanna said she glanced at pia do you have to take shots yes chlorine glanced at nimby who nodded she turned back to face the others yes she will be the same edsel wasnt sure whether that was good or bad but it would be nice to seem to be themselves still he wasnt quite satisfied where was the catch why are you two acting as if you see ghosts he asked dug chlorine smiled and the room actually brightened i will answer that in a moment but you must agree to tell no one else edsel had a programmers mind he didnt like open ended processes how can we agree if we dont know what were agreeing to i will tell you and if you then agree you will letain the memory otherwise you will lose it he was really suspicious of this you can do that wipe memories when were not even here really xonf of contention nimby can you are m the oxone he looked at dug again dug recovered enough to speak he can do it he said youd better agree but nobody can do something like that now kim spoke nobody in mundania edsel shrugged okay tell us i am an ordinary girl chlorine said in my natural state i look like this she became rather plain with straggly hair and ragged clothing nimby changed me outside and inside making me beautiful healthy smart and nice when i met nimby he looked like this she paused the handsome young man became a weird dragon with diagonal stripes of pastel pink and bilious green his head was that of a stupid donkey he also smelled like an overripe swamp a dragon ass chlorine said but when i asked him to change he assumed a nicer form the princely man reappeared this isnt his real form either but i am satisfied with these two forms i like being a damsel with a dragon nimby is actually a crafted form of the demon x ih from whom all magic flows speak for him and guide him because my compass is small enough to concentrate on scenes and events that are for him like ants on a distant slope it is an effort for him to focus on them your friends recognized him and are properly amazed well im not edsel said stoutly you expect me to believe that this donkey prince is the source of all magic chlorine glanced again at nimby nodding nimby reached out with one hand toward edsel and pia the hand expanded becoming huge the fingers closed around the two of them pia screamed as they were lifted right out of the leaf and through the ceiling which fuzzed away they soared high above the landscape of xanth whose outline looked much like the state of florida or possibly italy korea or some other large peninsula the hand held them firmly but the arm trailed into a mere string as if they were being flown like a kite then the whole thing melted into swirling colors they became two birds flying toward a castle their wings beat in the air as if it were water they flew into a window into a chamber where a woman walked who had a tiny moon circling her head she glanced up seeing them as they joined its orbit but then they flew on back out the window and across the landscape to a great lake where they dived down into the water and became two flying fish touring a fabulous magical underwater plfrs a thont setting where mermaids and mermen verejust the beginning then back out to air to the coast which glistened like polished brass on to another castle and into that one and to a room where six people stood they landed resuming their natural forms they were back in the chamber with the others who was that woman pia asked chlorine knew whom she meant that was princess ida whose moon has all the folk who ever did eer will or ever might live on xanth shes very perceptive yes edsel said she saw us ever might pia asked like whom chlorine looked at nimby then answered like people xanth doesnt have room for yet like dol the son of magician grey and princess ivy whose talent is to turn inanimate things living but they already have three children so he must remain a might instead of an is i suppose that makes sense pia said dubiously there are also xanth waves from the future hidden on those moons chlorine said if they came to the xanth of today there would be amazing complications for sure breanna agreed and that brass coast edsel asked in the realm of dreams or the gourd there live the brassies chlorine said men and women made of brass they have set up a vacation resort in xanth proper near the gold coast where things are less precious it was a persuasive demonstration it might be illusion but it had seemed real okay edsel said we wont tell he looked at pia who nodded agreement but just the brief glimpses we sawwould it be all right to use some of them in our software i mean like maybe an animation of a xanth theme park with all the creatures of the land air sea tiny moons and magic i think folk would loe it even just in a computer game that would be all right chlorine said as long as there is no mention of nimby that reminded him no mention of nimby but why does anyone with this much power want to go to mundama in someone elscs body there are other demons chorine explained most are associated with what you call planets though their essence is not planetary but of contpntion demonic the demon x h felt no need of a lot of territory so took only a small segment of one globe leaving the rest to the demon e but now with increasing interaction between the denizens of xanth and earth he would like to explore that other region however he has no magic power in mundania and the demon e llf might do him mischief being resentful of his status among demons so he needs to do it privately this seems to be an opportunity edsel was satisfied it works for me he looked at pia you yes she agreed faintly not much impressed pia but this session evidently had good enough breanna said briskly lets take a week to set things up and meet here again when the four ol you will exchange and the four of us she glanced at justin dug and kimwill be your companions to keep you out of mischief well have to organize special tours so as to get the most out of it okay she looked around okay edsel said feeling exhilarated if a tour in magic xanth didnt change pias mind nothing would okay kim said of course chlorine said then the scene dissolved and the four of them from mundania were standing at the oxone exit edsel humwhistled and they were back on their linked computers back in mundania already it seemed dreary companion p ia had to admit that edsel had come up with something interesting she had been finding him increasingly boring and marriage itself boring but the magic land of xanth was interesting she had privately envied dug and kims ability to believe in it and to submerge themselves in mutual tantasy maybe that was what made them get along so well there was magic in their relationship pia herself hardly believed in magic but that demonstration m the oxone had satisfied her that there was something there maybe not magic but one hell of a good show like the etfects of a stage magician you could enjoy it even when you knew it was all trickery best ot all if it turned out disappointing it still committed edsel to dissolving the marriage without a fight that would make it much easier to recover her freedom edsel wasnt a bad sort really but if you took away that motorcycle and his software and his supposed humor very little was left she wanted excitement novelty fresh romance and end less indulgence dug had come to bore her years ago and edsel had seemed to be an escape from that hut edsel had turned out just about as boring while dug ironically had grown more interesting after he got together with kim maybe he had been about to turn ihe corner and she had left him at just the wrong time xonh op comhntlon but she would give this fantasy adventure a fair trial she wasn t sure why edsel thought it might change her opinion of their marriage but that was his problem she preferred to get free of him without suffering an ugly scene and this was the way share the adventure return go their separate ways it was a straightforward course and a good one now if only she could be as readily free of her diabetes she had long since learned to give herself insulin shots they really didnt hurt any more and twice a day was enough the blood sugar level checks were mere pinpricks a nuisance but again routine so apart from a certain caution about her diet she could mostly ignore it but she would rather be free of it foi one thing it was likely to complicate things if she ever decided to have children not that she expected to children were such demanding nuisances on the appointed day their business m temporary remission they sat at their computers again and connected via their modems to the mode m mesh the three others were so enthusiastic that pia found herself reluctantly carried along dug and kim swore that there was no better land than xanth as long as a person was careful about dragons and such edselhe seemed a bit much taken with that black girl whats hername with her lustrous waist length black hair green eyes and pert figure as if pia herself didn t have those same things except that her hair was brown well pias figure had filled out some in the past few years she had to use a corset when wearing a show dress she hated that but she loved chocolate and the two sort ot went together her malady also tended to add to her weight because she was constantly balancing sugar against insulin and it was easier to eat a bit of sugar than to cancel a shot she had just taken if she anticipated needing less insulin then she could cut down but life was full of ugly little surprises so she was fighting a losing battle ot bulge edsel hadnt commented but she could no longer bend him to her whim as readily as she once had and she figured this was why of course there was an age difference between the black girl and pia sixteen s twenty two and she remembered how well edsel had liked that age wait till time had its way with the girl then see how pert she remained but what was her concern that girl was otherwise committed and in a fantasy land and if edsel strayedwell that would make the divorce that much easier they reached the oxone interface and edsel whistled them in pia had to admit it was a nice effect the way it went d making them seem piers anthony to be standing in a hall they ought to learn the secret so they could incorporate it into the companions software it would sell a million assuming there still was a business after the divorce they walked down the hall and entered the girls chamber breannathat was her name of the black wave as if anyone could doubt her color but she seemed nice enough and theyd better get along because there really were dragons in xanth and pia had no idea how to avoid them justin was there as quiet as before then the gaudy dragon man and splashy damsel arrived the odd thing was that the room didnt seem at all crowded even with eight people some things we need to clarify the damsel said chlorinethat was her name like a chemical treatmentwas taking charge in her pushy manner as she had before we shall need to remain in touch in case it should prove necessary to end the exchange early so we must report to this oxone each day she glanced around but nobody disagreed and though nimby and i will not have magic in mundama the two of you will have talents in xanth we want you to have useful ones that will help you get along without being so strong as to attract undue attention so you edsel will have the ability to create solid illusionary creatures and you pia will be able to see one day into the future that should help you avoid problems as you will be able to change that future by changing your immediate actions she would have a magic talent this was becoming increasingly interesting she would have to experiment to be sure she know how to use it now lets make the exchange chlorine said as she spoke she and nimby changed form becoming exactly like pia and edsel take our hands they held hands then separated that was all so when do we change pia asked not really trying to mask her impatience with this ritual there was laughter which she didnt appreciate uh i think we are changed edsel murmured beside her were on the other side of the room she saw that they were facing dug and kim though she was not aware of turning around beside them were justin and breanna but were the same she protested im not sure feel better than i did somehow xone of contention we provided you with bodies in perfect health the other pia said except for your malady of course pia suppressed her irritation since this was really illusion they couldnt cure the incurable she checked her purse her insulin kit was still there so she was in her own body yet she did feel better she had a recent scratch on her left foot that itched it no longer did she had meant to wash her hair as it had started to feel grungy but had forgotten in the distraction of getting ready it now felt fine surely her imagination yet enough to make her wonder at the power of suggestion this way breanna said turning to the door opposite the one they had entered by edsel and justin followed so pia had to go too but she wasnt easy with this could this all be a fancy joke yet what was there to do except play along until it ended breanna turned her head back see you here tomorrow for checkin she called got it kim called back from the far doorway then they were on their way down a hall as they proceeded it gradually lost its square outline becoming rounded soon it resembled a natural cave tunnel what was the point to show off the morphing abilities of the program the tunnel opened into a regular cave there was a stream running through it and a sweetness wafted from the water pia sniffed trying to identify the tantalizing fragrance and felt distinctly strange dont breathe too much of that breanna warned its from a love spring definitely a joke but pia stifled her breathing she didnt know what the consequence of imbibing from a love spring would be but doubted she would care for it they came to a metallic or ceramic or plastic contraption with a glassy screen hi passion breanna said brightly these are edsel and pia mundane pia putz pia corrected her using her maiden name and my business associate edsel edsel glanced at her but did not challenge her statement she was choosing to be herself on this excursion not someones disenchanted wife piers anthony the screen printed and this is com passion breanna continued she is our interface connection to the oxone and her mouse terian a lovely sultry woman emerged from the shadow she nodded then faded back into obscurity looks human to me pia remarked tenan stepped forward again she shimmered and suddenly was a brown mouse eeeek pia screamed jumping back whats the matter with a mouse breanna asked it might run up my leg the mouse became the woman who retreated again pia realized that she had made a fool of herself she hoped she wasnt flushing rycuu tt u we fo ma jrme jffffttsr is we cant right now breanna said we have to go out and see xanth in a day passion breanna promised thank you so much for helping w v w v that was evidently the machines way of expressing appreciation they stepped out into daylight the sun was shining down on a thickly forested landscape a pleasant path led away from the cave first thing to remember breanna said when in doubt stay on the path its enchanted so that no harm can come to you on it and it goes where you want to go suppose a person needs to to do something private pia asked she wasnt sure how natural functions would be handled if they didnt take occasional breaks from the program her reallife body couldnt sit in front of a screen forever no matter how realistic the effects there are places along the path breanna said theres one now she indicated a side path want to see yes actually it was about time lor her afternoon shot okay breanna led the way down the offshoot while justin and edsel waited on the main path behind a barrier of bushes was an outhouse with a crescent moon painted on the door pia approached it and tried to open the door but her hand passed right through the wood its illusion breanna explained just walk through it x ne of comfcntiov pia tried it she passed through the wood and found herself in a surprisingly modern bathroom how much of this was illusion she felt the toilet seat sure enough it was a mere board with a hole in it under the illusion well that would do she took out her kit and pricked her finger checking her blood level of sugar then she prepared a shot she untucked her blouse and swabbed the fat of her hip she always injected in the same place and was almost immune to pain there the shot took only a moment then she tucked herself back together and put away the kit she should be okay until morning if she didnt overexert herself breanna didnt inquire she surely thought pia had been attending to different matters they returned to the main path where the men stood a ghost loomed up before them booo it cried pia stifled a scream and stepped back but breanna was unimpressed youre practicing your talent she said to make solid illusionary creatures edsel agreed justin reminded me we need to get a handle on our talents so we wont flounder when we need them the ghost hovered now properly harmless pia concealed her annoyance at being frightened i thought a ghost wasnt solid this one is edsel said i cant make a real ghost but this is a fake ghost go ahead touch it breanna reached out and caught hold of the ghosts substance sheet she said can you use such language in xanth edsel inquired innocently pia was disgusted him and his juvenile sense of humor justin looked blank but breanna almost let half a smile escape you can when its a bed sheet she yanked and the ghost lurched forward oooo it complained pia touched the sheet it was indeed solid she lifted it up and peeked under there was nothing it was just material shaped over air the sheet dissipated and the ghost was gone i like it edsel said you should check yours breanna told pia i thought she just did edsel said with that feigned innocence again will you stop that pia snapped did he do something justin asked perplexed you were a tree too long dear breanna said fondly anthony indubitably but first he implied that a word i said almost sounded bad though it wasnt she explained then he made a comment that was similar i dont understand pia realized that the man really had been out of touch loo long he was truly innocent about some things she liked that i was suggesting to pia that she should check her talent breanna said to justin edsel pretended that i was suggesting that she check her state ofof digestion digestion girls arent supposed to have digestion oh he remained blank you have a long row to hoe edsel said to breanna til get there the girl said now about that talent piathey work different ways mine is seeing in blaekness so it doesnt apply in daytime justin s is voice projection for a long time he needed it because didnt have a mouth show them justin as you wish a nearby tree said startled pia looked at the tree it had no mouth ohventriloquism not exactly breanna said watch his mouth i am speaking again the tree said justin s mouth was firmly closed pia nodded that is impressive but yours should be more useful breanna said because you should be able to see any trouble thats going to happen but all talents have limits and its best to understand them thoroughly what do you see in the future pia concentrated uncertain how this worked she closed her eyes then she saw a pretty shore with pleasant trees by blue water its just a scene she said trees and water do you see yourself no its as if im doing the looking okay theres a limit you dont see who whole scene just what your eyes see what happened before that nothing i can see its just the scene now its changing oh theres edsel what about justin and me i dont see either of you just edsel xonf of cotfnto can you hear anything no its silent justin spoke this would seem to be purely an ongoing visual talent perhaps seeing what she will be seeing exactly one day hence that is indeed limited but potentially quite useful perhaps breanna and i are walking behind you at the moment it is encouraging that there is no sign of mischief i suppose pia agreed she was somewhat disappointed she would have preferred a more versatile vision of the future sometimes simpleseeming talents turn out to have important aspects justin said you should continue your exploration im sure nimby would not have given you an inferior talent for sure breanna agreed pia continued to watch but all she saw was a dull travelogue as she and edsel walked along the shore maybe it would be interesting when they were there but with the sound turned off it was like watching a soundless movie she had done that once on an airplane flight because she hadnt wanted to get soaked several dollars to rent germladen earphones for two hours the movie had distracted frustrated and bored her something awful this felt like that perhaps if you attempt to change that future scene you would ascertain useful information justin suggested he had a vaguely archaic mode of speaking that made him sound much older than he was except that he was much older she remembered he had taken youth potion so he was after all in synch but why was young breanna so taken with the man how do i change my future she asked i should suppose that the mere decision to take a different course would be effective a persons future is naturally determined by his choices in the present all right ill do something else pia concentrated determined to do something else but the vision of the iuture did not change they pondered that but none of them could figure out how she could change her future if it refused to be changed i suspect we shall simply have to wait until we arrive at that point justin said then perhaps we can estimate how we might have changed it and what might be effective thereafter that seemed to cover it they walked on down the path we dont piers anthony have much oi an agenda breanna said we thought the first day youd lust want to see the local sights then tomorrow maybe we can visit castle roogna edsel perked up im not much on the geography of xanth but isnt castle roogna south of the gap chasm for sure chlorine arranged for a roc bird to carry us there it should be a nice trip thats tomorrow pia asked is castle roogna by the shore no its inland then why am i seeing the shore tomorrow that made the girl paused gee i dont know unless maybe we ask the roc to take us to the isle of view or something the what its an island named view very romantic prince dolph and princess electra got married there breanna smiled i hear it was quite an event because neither one of them knew how to signal the stork but they must have figured it out because the stork delivered twins i wonder if theres an isle of view ii edsel mused his tone indicating that this was supposed to be funny for the second time around pia figured it out isle of view i love you and i love you too romantic by definition she didnt want to go there with edsel he would get ideas so she would insist on the original tour to that castle she looked at the future again it hadnt changed they were still wandering along that stupid shore theres a sign edsel said looking ahead the sign said res plingboxingsocker an arrow indicated another side path thats probably not breanna began but edsel was already heading down it hes like that pia said with resignation impulsive to a fault breanna shrugged the side paths enchanted so it should be safe but these diversions arent always what you expect this is true justin remarked they followed edsel down the path they came to a region where several men women and children were lying on the ground they werent sleeping just lying you folk okay edsel asked of course the nearest man said we are restlmg xone of contention wrestling restling we are finding out who can laze around the longest the winner gets to do it again tomorrow as we said breanna murmured but edsel was already going on to the next this turned out to be a group of people making boxes as quickly as they could boxing have you seen enough pia asked in a moderately withering way the socker should be better he said moving on it wasnt people were hurling stinking used socks at each other the winner was evidently the one who could overcome the others with the intoxicating fumes several people were gasping on the ground and others had purple faces go ahead get in the contest ed pia suggested sweetly you could win hands down or maybe feet down he shot her a dark look you shouldnt try humor its not your forte but both breanna and justin seemed to be possessed of aspects of a smile they returned to the main path there at the juncture was a female form so luscious it seemed like a crime edsels gaze was immediately locked and so was justin pia exchanged a glance of annoyance with breanna men were so superficial hi edsel said approaching the figure lo the figure responded in a sultry manner that was all there was it was swathed in a togalike wrapping of scintillating cloth so that only the hourglass outline could be made out what can i do for you edsel asked eagerly he was such a fool about women the figure began unwinding the cloth soon the face would be exposed i thought i might ask one tiny little favor were not looking to do favors breanna said were a special party touring xanth so if its all the same to you by no means the figure said in dulcet tones it is very miscellaneous for me it is what edsel asked unlike altered contrary deviant different whatever she agreed crossly piers anthony the demoness metna justm exclaimed i have heard of you the demoness with a speech impediment the opening hood turned to him you have an obstruction with that a what problem breanna snapped no we dont have a problem with that but were not in the business of favors fortunately i wasnt asking you metna said exposing her lovely face i was asking these handsome gentlemen anything edsel breathed raptly not anything breanna said we have other business pia wondered why the girl was being so negative the strip tease was annoying but didnt seem to warrant such emphatic denial the demoness unwrapped some more her sculptured slender neck came into view and the first divine upper swell of her gently heaving bosom i thought if you were touring xanth anyway you could take along my darling ted ted edsel asked foolishly his mind evidently on that swell rather than her words my baby you have no idea what i went through to get him delivered but now demon ted is three and wants to explore xanth her rosepetal mouth quirked without his cadaver his what she unwound some more corpse carcass deceased embalmed bandaged mummy pia said before thinking his mummy whatever the demoness agreed crossly she unwound some more baring an unbelievable bosom barely covered by a translucent halter and proceeding down to a waist that was three sizes smaller than impossible sure anything edsel agreed his eyes spiralmg down in concert vvith the unraveling winding acquiescence justin agreed were in for it now breanna muttered darkly and of course his inseparable friend of the same age demomca metna continued as the winding bared her expanding hips why not edsel said whats wrong with three year olds pia asked breanna not that i care they re half demon breanna said tersely ted has a human xoh of contention father and demoness mother while monica has a demon father and human mother theyre cute but worse than any human children can be well let the menfolk take care of them theyre the ones who are slavering you ever see worse incompetence than a man with a baby r point made the job will fall to us for sure meanwhile metna was winding down to her splendid thighs that creature could irk me if she made the effort pia remarked and shes not even trying so you folk will keep good eyes on them and not let them get into any mischief the demoness asked as her long symmetrical legs appeared their juncture was covered by another trifle of haze yeah yeah edsel agreed pia wasnt sure but it almost seemed that his eyeballs were smoking excellent metna stepped out of the last winding just tor that ill show you my dont show them your panties breanna cried the demoness paused why not arent they of age they will earn the glimpse because it will freak them out and they wont be able to do the job metna considered you do have a prong a what pia asked again before she thought pin spur tine spike point whatever so ill just leave the little darlings the demoness gathered up the strewn winding dissolved into smoke and separated into two blobs the blobs dropped to the ground dissi pated and revealed two children im ted the boy said he wore a little frilly pink dress with matching feminine sandals his blond hair was tied with a red ribbon im monica the girl said she wore blue shorts and matching sneakers she had large brown eyes a turned up nose and short brown hair but they were indeed cute uh havent you gotten something confused pia asked them the children looked at each other then they laughed together and their clothing started to change soon he wore the shorts and she wore anthony the dress her hair also lengthened to support the red ribbon while his shortened edsel came out of his hae what happened he asked a demoness smoked your eyeballs breanna said now we have a chore oh yeah he agreed vaguely lets explore ted cried dashing off monica followed stay on the path breanna called after them monica paused looking back why because youre half human if a dragon chomps you youll feel it a dragon cant get you on the enchanted path the child made a cute moue awww okay at least they will listen to reason pia said for the moment well have watch closely though the girl glanced at pia sorry aboul this i tried to stop it but but the men were idiots pia said she liked breanna better as she got to know her she was just trying to do her job they followed the children hey theres a b ted said pointing its a rate monica agreed what are they talking about pia asked the bs make ihe people they sting emotional justin explained a brate would make a person scold others pia grimaced sorry i asked theres a joy stick ted said pointing to a little column beside the path no its a sad stick monica said indeed the stick did look droopy they rushed on losing interest while the human party tried to keep up where are we going pia asked breanna we thought youd like to see some of the routine sights of xanth like a tangle tree a dragon a centaursort of starting out easy that will do pia agreed arent some of those dangerous not as long as we stay on the enchanted path suppose those little demons run off it thats one reason i didnt want them along but probably theyll stay close otherwise metria wouldnt have left them she does care she has half a soul xof of contfntion half a soul demons dont have souls because they are souls breanna explained when you use your soul as a body it gets degraded and you lose its finer aspects so they dont have much conscience and they cant really love but metria got a taste of what souled life was like and got a hankering and finally married a mortal man and got half his soul its sort of a convention a demon who marries a mortal can have the better half then she has a conscience and can love in a halfdonkeyed way but what of the man can he get along with only half a soul oh sure it regenerates in mortals not right away i think it takes several months but in time it will be whole again it doesnt regenerate in demons but for one of them half a functioning soul is infinitely more than what theyre used to so they dont miss the rest what about the little demons theyre half human so i think they have whole souls the girl paused though ive heard of a demoness losing her soul when she had a mortal child the baby gets it so i guess im not sure maybe the offspring have quarter souls pia was curious maybe we can find out we can ask the children yeah breanna put two fingers to her mouth and whistled the children paused in their running we didnt do anything ted protested guiltily for sure i just want to ask you something they came back somewhat warily real people arent supposed to lie monica said im not lying breanna said but it seems that youve been into some mischief i should ask you about also oh no ted said only one question the first one monica agreed ill ask the second one pia said she had never thought of having children herself but was becoming intrigued awww they said together you are both half demons breanna said how much of a soul do you have which one ted asked theres a difference for sure monica said mimicking breanna okay how much does ted have a quarter soul the child responded half of mummys piers anthony and how much does monica have a half soul hall of mothers breanna pondered then brightened i get it youre each half human but ted has a human father and monica has a human mother so ted shared a hali soul and monica shared a whole soul nada nagas soul must have regenerated after she gave half to vore before the stork arrived vore pia asked my daddys prince demon vore monica said proudly d vore breanna murmured he has a notorious appetite so monica has twice the conscience ted does pia said the little girl scuffled her feet i cant help it you know you sure cant breanna agreed give me a hug you darling creature okay monica hugged her pia felt an unfamiliar twinge of envy not for the hug so much as the joy breanna evidently took in it she evidently liked children ugh ted said looking disgusted now its my turn pia said what mischief is making you two feel guilty ted turned to monica see you gave it away monica tried to resist but it was evident that her extra burden of conscience was too much we found something she said reluctantly what pia asked nothing important ted said pia looked at monica but fun the girl said that could be anything from a stink horn to a basilisk breanna muttered whats a stink horn pia asked ill get one ted cried and dashed off you dont ant it breanna said find out what they found what is it pia asked monica the girl slowly extended one hand in it was a small glistening object beware breanna murmured it could be something disgusting like a slime ball what is it pia repeated realizing that the warning was serious she knew that regular children could have fun with bugs and goop and these were half demon children surely worse a locket monica said grudgingly let me check it pia said the child handed it over pia inspected it it was ery light only halt an inch in diameter on a sikery chain she put her fingernail to the snap fastening caution breanna said yes is there something bad inside pia asked the child monica scuffled again trying to resist her conscience no pia opened it indeed it was empty so whats so special about it the fight against conscience intensified the child seemed ready to cry maybe some compromise breanna said dear why dont you want to tell us because youll take it and we wont have it but its not dangerous to you or us not the girl agreed suppose we make you a deal tell us about it and you can keep it okay monica agreed gladly holding out her hand pia gave her the locket its magic monica said it holds all of anything but its tiny pia protested ill show you the child grabbed a handful of dirt and poured it into the open locket the dirt went in and disappeared she picked up a stone that was triple the lockets diameter and crammed it inand it fitted how do you get the things out again if they have disappeared inside it pia asked you just wish them out the child explained and you can wish them in too so what you have already doesnt fall out when you want to add something you dont have to open it ted dashed back heres the stink horn he called holding out a hornlike object there was a terrible smell like a festering zombie whale with ballooning indigestion but breanna saved the day she grabbed the horn and shoved it into the locket then monica flipped the lid shut the smell dissipated awww ted said disappointed but well have the stink horn for when ve need it monica told him piers anthon he brightened yeah but keep the locket closed after this breanna said we dont want that horn falling into someones soup both children went into titillations of mirth they loved the idea ot such an accident i hope ve dont regret this deal breanna said but that locket is the kind of thing children can really have fun with it doesnt seem to weigh any more than it does empty it doesnt monica agreed cause its magic i told you she dashed off with ted intent on finding more choice items to collect the adults resumed their walk edsel and justm were waiting nearby having their own dialogue look maybe its not my business breanna said pausing artfully go ahead and ask pia said i heard irom edsel that you two are married but when you said we are associates pia agreed because our marriage is rocky and we want to get the feel ol separation in case we want to divorce divorce i havent heard that word sincesince i left mundania it doesnt happen in xanth oh what do couples do when they dont get along but they do get along i think theres magic when i marry justin it will be for ever and ever until we fade out how can you be sure of that i understand hes somewhat older than you maybe his interests are different hes about eighty three years older than me breanna agreed hes from another time and he knows all about trees and everything else i never heard of and hes diffident to the point of aggravation but i love him thats all that counts thats not all that counts then rcaliing that this sounded argumentative she added in mundania maybe thats the problemin mundania if you lived in xanth youd never break up even when the love is gone it doesnt go it doesnt matter how different you are once you love you stay that way if youre married i find this hard to believe no offense xonf of conilmion well youre mundane no offense pia laughed breannas attitude was refreshing she wasnt looking for a quarrel but she simply didnt take any guff from anyone am mundane she agreed and dont think edsel and i are going to make it we made a deal we visit xanth and if that doesnt change our minds then we divorce but i want to feel what it would be like to be single so we wont be acting married while were here want us just to be associates and we can date others if we want breanna shook her head thats weird i cant imagine wanting to be with anyone but justin my only problem is i cant make it with him already you cant technically im under the age of consent so im not supposed to know whats in the adult conspiracy but i came from mundania and i already knew that stuff before came to xanth so i dont think it shouid apply youre sixteen pia said thats old enough thats what i figure but justin is of the old school pia considered you love himand he loves you he does you can love at any age or love someone any age you just cant do much about it in xanth if youre the wrong age appreciate your frustration but you know i was fifteen when i got together with edsel and we did plenty about it then but nowthe wonder is gone i think we went too fast too young you mean youre siding with the conspiracy i wouldnt go as far as to say that but it does occur to me there might be some reason for it in some cases the girl pondered a moment when you were fifteenif you had honored the conspiracywould you be happy with him now good question i suspect things would me much the same assuming we were married so what would you have gained honoring the conspiracy in was pias turn to ponder nothing she concluded and lost a lot ol early fun so what do you figure i should do take him i cant all he does is kiss face to face pilrs anthoni what else to use archaic terms you re necking you need to get into petting petting necking is dboe the neck petting is below i know that but i cant get into it because ill bet the adult conspiracy otters a bit oi leeway m the inbetween age why dont you try it and see but what exactlyil he wont pia realized that ior all her professed knowledge the girl had been stifled m xanth and lacked actual experience she had the concept with out the practical mechanics dont a k him silly just do it do it get him alone maybe tonight take oft your shirt hold his hand hold his hand like so pia glanced around to make sure they were unobserved then took breannas hand and put it against pias clothed breast oho breanna smiled with wild surmise i guarantee he wont ignore you see how far the conspiracy will bend i think you will at least make some progress for sure breanna breathed raptly pia felt good too it was nice being reminded oi the joys of early discovery they came to the hrst of the planned tour exhibits a tangle tree from a distance the thing looked like a drooping live oak but closer in she saw that it actually had long hanging green tentacles you dont want to get close to such a tree justin said but theres a nice little path leading right to it pia said yes but observe justin picked up a small fallen branch and threw it at the tree the tentacles came to life they caught the branch wrapping around it and snapping it in two then they carried the pieces down to the trunk wheie a huge wooden onnce opened it chomped on a branchthen spat it out evidently disgusted the two children chortled together loving us frustration trees dont like to eat trees justin said the regard it as can mbalism i speak from experience you were a tangle tree pia asked horrified no mereh an ordinary tree he said sunlight and soil sufficed xot of contention until i met breanna but the birds and the bees kept me informed of the appetites of other tree species i dont think the birds and the bees informed you enough about flesh folk breanna said justin looked uneasy perhaps in two years yeah but the girl was plainl nettled pia could see that she had a legitimate complaint two years was an etermt to that age the resumed their walk along the path next we shall pass a dragons lair justin said dont step out of the enchanted section why should we want to edsel asked the dragons smart it will try to fool you edsel shrugged figuring he was foolproof that was part of what nettled pia about him when they reached the lair the dragon charged out snorting fire and smoke pia stepped back but breanna caught her elbow dont cross the line even on the far side it will hurdle that path and came after you but the nre cant touch you on the path now she saw that there was no smoke crossing the path it flattened out as if up against an invisible barrier and wafted over the top well above head height this was truly a protected section meanwhile the two children were making faces at the dragon realizing that no one was going to step out of the safe section the dragon snorted one last blast and retreated into its lair as disgusted as the tangle tree had been i am beginning to appreciate the enchanted path pia said folk who know the dangers can go where they want breanna said but visitors are restricted for their own safety the day was getting late perhaps we should camp and visit the centaurs tomonow justin suggested there is a suitable spot nearby they went to it it was a park like section marked by a colored line so that no one would accidentally step out of the safe area this is beautiful pia said she hated to admit it but this land ot xanth was beginning to get to her it was more interesting than mundania and it seemed quite real her body felt better than it had as if she had taken a pill to invigorate her rather than just a shot she had had some doubt that she had actually changed bodies with chlorine but was becoming reassured pifrs anthony yes we try to keep the facilities pristine justin said we want all travelers to be both safe and satisfied he paused will the two of you be sharing a nest nest pia asked confused justm gestured there was a large plush nest nestled in the triple fork of a spreading tree a roc bird helped you may be sure it is secure but we are expected to sleep in a nest she asked more amazed that dismayed justin looked perplexed there is a problem oh thats right i remember now breanna said they use beds in mundania i didnt think of that but its very comfortable and theres a canopy if you want privacy let me show you come on in she climbed up a vine ladder and disappeared into the nest pia shrugged and followed the ladder was flexible but firm she was conscious of the two men standing below as she reached head height but knew she had pretty good legs so didnt worry about it when she got to the rim of the nest she heaved herself over lost her grip and tumbled into the center of the nest fun no breanna asked she was sitting on the far slope of the depression you can even bounce she demonstrated and in a moment was bouncing high as if on a trampoline course you dont want to do that when theres a man watching might show your panties whats this business about panties pia asked you told that demoness not to show them and she listened they fry mens eyeballs the girl explained they freak out and cant do anything until the sight goes away thats interesting your tone makes it sound like thats a load of dragon manure exactly men dont freak out at such sights not in mundania you mean they really do breanna smiled i shouldnt but im a rebellious teen so ill show you watch this the girl climbed up the curving side of the nest and stood on the wide rim hey boys look at this she called then she turned bent over and hoisted her skirt showing her black panties she was mooning them xonf of contfntion there was no sound curious pia climbed the nest and peered over the rim justin and edsel were standing below motionless eyes bulging jaws slack they were indeed freaked out the two children were giggling thats showing em blackwave girl ted cried naughtily black is the color of my true loves the girl jammed a hand over his mouth before he could say a naughty word wait till we get older and ill be able to do that monica said seeming slightly jealous and ill be able to freak out ted agreed breanna did a forward roll into the nest that took her panties out of sight the two men returned to life justin stepped back as if catching his balance edsel sat down on the ground both looked dazed their eyes did seem to be somewhat hot you boys okay pia called i guess edsel said what happened you freaked out freaked out dont remember anything both children chortled then justin caught on someone must have exposed her underclothing not me pia said innocently go on about your business she turned back to the interior of the nest for the canopy just pull the cord breanna said she reached up caught a dangling vine and pulled a neat canopy of living branches and leaves descended making contact with the rim this was now a shrouded round chamber good when it rains too i believe this nest will do pia said are there any sheets or blankets you harvest them fresh from a blanket bush ill show you breanna scrambled back up the slope toward the ladder how is it that men are freaked out by panties when it doesnt happen in mundania pia asked as she followed its part of the magic there are lots of routine magical effects you get used to them what happens if a man sees a woman naked nothing special oh hes interested for sure but he doesnt freak out f mean nymphs go naked all the time and nobody thinks anything of it its just certain items of clothing that make the difference pitrs anthom they climbed down the ladder and touched ground is this logicalr pia inquired whats logic got to do with sex or magic that answered itself i dont believe you expressed a preference justin said as they passed him will the two of you be sharing a nest what the bleep might as well she said then realized that her bad word had been censored out even in her thoughts because she was in the presence ot someone below the correct age magic was everywhere they came to the blanket bush where they harvested two nice blankets there was a swirl ot smoke it formed into a handsome male figure a greeting lovely ladies he said bowing gallantly oh hi vore breanna said then to pia this is d vore monicas father he must be here to pick up the children indeed metna brought them i will return them we are obliged to be somewhat responsible now that we are half souled he looked at pia have t made your acquaintance luscious creature shes pia mundane breanna said i mean putz does nada know youre flirting with visitors im not flirting vore said quickly im eating eating pia asked devouring her with my eyes he explained that was a pun pia realized d voredevour the children are fine she said theyre around here somewhere they have a magic locket breanna added i will investigate he vanished those children really werent much trouble pia said we were lucky this time things couldve complicated in a hurry they dumped the blankets in two nests meanwhile vore had taken away the children and justin and edsel had harvested tour pies from a pie tree they sat down on large toadstools b a glass table dont tell me let me guess pia said observing the way the table shimmered its a water table of course breanna agreed and heres some milk she set down several milkweed pods sure enough the pies were good and the pods contained iresh milk xonf of contention breanna had chocolate milk i wouldnt want my color to fade she explained that reminded pia of something awkward i gather there isnt racism in xanth not as such but there s prejudice for example nobody much wants to associate with ombies i should think not pia agreed but they should zombies are people too and they serve xanth well it youre eer in trouble and you see a zombie ask it for help theyre kind hearted their hearts are rotten of course but soft pia wasn t certain whether the girl was joking so she played it low key rotten but kind she agreed justin and i will be taking over castle zombie when the zombie master retires breanna said justms going to be great breanna is already great justin said gallantly you dont know the half of it breanna murmured he looked at hei i dont understand you will were sharing a nest and a blanket tonight we are im not sure thats appropriate considering your my age would you want rne to huddle all by myself alone in the great wilderness of xanth ot course not but good so finish eating and well turn m justin looked nervous i suppose if we sleep on opposite sides ot the nest pia kept her mouth shut it was fun observing the interaction justin seemed like a very nice man but breanna was right he had archaic notions they finished their meal as dusk closed then they went to their nests you know poor justin really likes that girl edsel said as they settled down he told me that its all he can do to keep his hands oft her but shes too young so he stays clear sixteen is old enough i know that you know that but he doesn t know that he thinks a girls not a woman until shes eighteen its the adult conspiracy but i dont think its quite tight i told hei how to try to bend it bend it piers anthony as in the distinction between necking and petting im betting that pettings allowed at her age maybe so speaking of which how about forget it were estranged not until we finish in xanth and ou dont change your mind anyway we ve always fought but gotten along great at night he had a point still she wasnt sure sorry i dont feel like it he lay back disappointed edsel had his faults but he was a gentle man about sex there was silence then justms amazed voice carried across the nests breanna what are you doing just holding hands dear breanna he sounded shocked you shut up and kiss me handsome or shall i hold both your hands like this after that the sounds muffled out pia turned toward edsel no i feel like it he moved over immediately exactly what did you tell her he whispered just how to hold hands thats all like this she demonstrated with his hand hes done for he agreed appreciatively this is just like the old days for sure she agreed imitating breanna but remembei were still officially estranged tomorrow he agreed mundania c hlorme was nervous about this particular adventure because it was the first one where nimbythe demon x thwould not have his immense power ot magic but he wanted to explore mundama and this was the only feasible way because each demon was jealous ot its territory and prerogatives and had virtually absolute power within its domain the intrusion of any other demon would not be welcome so xanth was sneaking in to look around and if d e th caught on there would be awful mischief chlonne had begged nimby not to do it but he had insisted so now she would do her utmost to facilitate the visit and keep them both safe because she owed everything to nimby and his will was ultimately her will they walked to the exit door and paused see you here tomorrow for checkin breanna called cheerily got it the mundane woman kim called back then they turned forward and walked down the hall to the oxone interface exit they passed though thatand chlonne found herself sitting on a chair with her hands on a funny kind of board with a number of marked little squares staring at a screen resembling com pewters her hands looked wrong until she reminded herself that she was no longer m her own body she was now a mundane among mundanes she hoped she survived the experience piers anthom words appeared on it piastay where you are dug and i will be there soon kim but pia was in xanth then chlorine reoriented of courseshe was in pias body now and was to be called pia to protect her real identity and nimby would be called edsel because the demon e th surely kept an eye on the great global grid and would soon know if nimby and chlorine appeared on it they were here anonymously but nimby was in another room and she had to be sure he was all right she got up and found her way out the open door to the adjacent chamber there was edsel sitting somewhat blankly before his own screen nimby she murmured its chlorine he turned to look at her nodding he almost never spoke to others he could speak and elegantly but this required him to focus on minutia and he preferred not to bother that was why she had to speak a lot for both of them but that was all right it made her feel important nimby remember we have to be anonymous here in mundania so we must answer to the bodies we are in you are edsel and i am pia our companions arrived in another house and will join us soon all right he nodded she found it half a smidgen weird to be calling this stranger nimby but no weirder that it had been to see him change from dragon to manform the first time she sat in his lap and kissed him i love you nimby but from now on i will call you ed or edsel until we are back m xanth and i wont mention xanth because that might give us away we are ed and pia outside but inside we are ourselves he knew all this of course but it helped her to express it making sure there was no misunderstanding they looked around the room noting the distinctly mundane look of it then they explored the house there was a staircase leading to a second floor with two rooms with beds and one small room with odd ceramic or metallic objects that roughly resembled basins or a chair there was a muted rumble outside and a funny box on wheels rolled up they saw it out a window then doors in it opened and dug and kim got out on opposite sides oh in a moment and a half dug and kim were with them okay kim said you arc nimby and chlorine right yes chlorine said but we will answer to edsel and pia yes of course kim paused as if organizing her thoughts there are some things we need to get straight at the outset so we dont get into mischief for example both of you can speak and understand our language right yes good because usually xanthians cant understand mundanian right away but youre actually using mundane bodies so they must provide you with the language but how much else do they provide you with i mean do you know where everything is we found the bedrooms chlorine said but theres one room with odd objects i think you mean the bathroom youre going to have to get better acquainted with that and the kitchen kim paused maybe id better take you in and then dug can take nimby in only as you said wed better not call him that because yes call us pia and edsel we understand she knew why kim was hesitant despite the prior reassurance she knew nimbys nature and didnt want to insult him right okay pia come with me kim led the way upstairs they reentered the bathroom and kim closed the door now this is the sink you wash your hands here or a pair of socks or whatever same as in xanth turn this tap ior cold water and this one for hot she demonstrated sure enough soon cold water was streaming from one nozzle and hot water from the other i thought you didnt have magic in mundania chlorine said impressed we dont but we have technology sometimes its almost as good in xanth you just use spells to heat the water here we use electricity kim went to the big metallic depression this is the bathtub its taps work the same way you run the water first and mix it so you dont burn or freeze ill help you set it up the first time but why bother because you cant use a selfcleaning spell in mundania you have to take a bath or shower or equivalent thank you chlorine understood the principle of a bath though she preferred to swim in a magic cleansing pool this is the tough one kim said going to the funny ceramic object that looked vaguely like a chair she lifted the wooden seat and lo there was a basin below half filled with clear water this is the toilet its like the hole of an outhouse you sit on it and urinate or defecate pihks anthony into clean water chloiine asked horrified mundania is barbaric in some respects kim said smiling no illusion to cover the sight or smell then when you are done you turn this handle she turned it water surged into the basin and swirled around then sucked down and disappeared then slowly more water came until the bowl was half full again what happens to the water chlorine asked repelled it flows along a pipe undeiground into the sewer this is a kind of subterranean river that carries wastes away no need to be concerned about it just make sure to use only this or this purpose they returned downstairs and dug took nimby up for a similar demonstration chlorine feared he would be appalled for normally he simply banished all wastes magically or transformed them into toads but he had wanted to find out what mundania was like this was part of it then kim took the next step are you hungry i must explain that there are no pie trees here food is more complicated to obtain chlorine decided not to struggle with that learning process just yet nimedsel would like to see mundania the rest of it we can show you but i think its best to start simple there may be pitfalls just as there are in xanth kim paused outside ill just say the other place you understand yes well take you windowshopping at the mall and maybe see a movie i think that will be enough outside experience for today we must purchase windows at a mill kim laughed not exactly i mean well just mostly look at things and its not a mill a mall is a big enclosed shopping center youll see they went out to the box on wheels dug and nimby climbed into the front of it and kim and chlorine into the back there were surprisingly comfortable couches and they could see out windows all around the box came to life with a rumble and a quiver cool air washed through then it rolled backward onto the paed road paused and rolled rapidly forward this is a car kim explained our secondhand neptune station wagon just about the safest car we can afford it carries us where we want to go no its not magic its an application ol science but we like it chlorine stared out in wonder all around them other cars small and large were rolling similarly along the road most of the ones in the near side were going in one direction while most ol them on the other side were going the other direction every so often most of them stopped and sat still for no apparent reason then they started again it was almost beyond understanding they came to a plain where many of the boxes sat they found a spot and sat also they got out leaving the car behind but wont it wander away chlorine asked no its a machine and here in mundania machines do only what they are told it will wait here for us kim patted the neptune on the nose it wouldnt want to leave us anyway we get along well they walked into an unbelievably big building inside was a wide hall and a big garden and fountain even nimby was surprised your gardens are inside while your hard floors are outside kim smiled sometimes this is the mall its closed in so people can shop at the stores without getting rained on they walked along the hallway whose sides were filled with doors and big windows in each window was a display of things they looked this was windowshopping it turned out looking without taking the first window had shoes but why dont they leave them on the shoe trees until someone needs them chlorine asked there are no shoe trees here not the type you know shoes have to be made just as pies have to be baked and pillows sewn and stuffed and just about everything else mundania is stranger than we suspected chlorine murmured they came to a window with pictures ol cold confection eye scream chlorine said ice cream kim agreed would you like some now she was hungry enough yes they went into the store and kim asked the man for four cones these came with colored balls of eye scream set in the tops kim gave the man a greenish piece of paper and he gave her a few small coins ohmoney it had been mentioned somewhere along the way the eye scream was good chlorine made a mental note to come here for more next time they got hungry but she would have to see about the money because she didnt understand the numbers and pictures on it they came to another type of opening this one had a line ol people passing a booth and giving money to a girl locked in the booth she is under an enchantment chlorine asked doomed to stay there until a witch lets her out or a handsome dragonprince rescues her not exactly this is a theater this is where they show movies they show moves like dancing dug laughed i think wed better let them see the movie this one is a returning classic ston scary painting tale id love to see it again were just in time to catch the matinee but youve seen it ten times already kim protested so this will be the eleventh it gets better with each repetition it moes better with practice chlorine asked tn its fashion dug agreed he walked to the girl in the booth and gave her money and she gave him four little pieces of paper then the four of them walked into the theater a young man took dugs four papers tore them in half and gave him back four halves chlorine took it on iaith that this wanton destruction of what had been pretty papers made sense on some mundane level inside there were hundreds of scats jammed together about halt of them empty they found four together in the center and sat facing a huge white screen pictures will appear on that kim said sound will come from all around we will watch and listen and think about how it would be for us to be those people thats how we get into the story and remember it is a story its not happening and it never really happened but we can pretend a story chlorine agreed not sure she understood a play dug said done by illusion that made it comprehensible the curse fiends did plays and illusion was common in xanth then the light around them faded and a picture formed on the screen it was much bigger than life it showed men riding funny machines with two wheels along narrow dirt trails oh this is a preview kim said ignore it then one of the wheeled machines was zooming right at them filling the screen roaiing with sound chlorine cowered down but it disappeaied it was as kim had said just a picture a moving pictuie an xone of contention illusion she held nimby s hand he seemed to be fascinated by the effect watching the machines zoom across dirt and sail into the air as they rode over hills probably he liked the feeling of magic though dug and kim assured them that there was none well maybe there is in a sense dug said they take shots over and over and oer to get them right and they have equipment hidden beyond camera range so as to catch flying men before they crash into the ground but its mostly iakery real folk cant ride cycles that way and live nimby glanced at him chlorine wondered what he was thinking of she hoped it wasnt of riding zooming loud machines there were other frightening odd or incomprehensible preview pictures one featured a villain hauling the hero high with a pulley so that he dangled over a cauldron of acid nimby seemed fascinated by this too thats a geared block and tackle dug said helpfully it multiplies the pull see the villain can work it with one hand lifting the heros whole weight leverage is great stuff nimby nodded making a mental note chlorine thought it was the physics rather than the story that intrigued him but she wasnt sure nimby was interested in everything and he had an inhuman capacity for assimilating new information then print appeared on the screen now the movie is starting kim said there are the credits then the screen was filled with storm and rain as a couple rode in their wheeled boxtheir carthrough evidently unfamiliar terrain they had to take shelter in a private mansion run by a doctor sam sausage after that things became more conventional and chlorine began to enjoy the story others in the theater talked to the screen and helped things happen in response to their urgings it surely would have been a lesser story if they had not been acting to enhance it chlorine liked their attitude she made a mental note to try one of the dance steps it so carefully diagrammed it was just a jump to the left and other stylized motions such as placing the hands on the hips very nice she was glad they had seen this when the movie ended they made their way back outside where the day was unconscionably bright and warm they got in the car which was hot but then it cooled it rolled back toward the house somewhat unsteadily had it lost the way chlorine had understood that dug was in some way guiding it as one would a steed she glanced at himand was amazed piers anthony dug was not guiding it nimby was nimby was sitting in the drivers seat with his hands on the steering wheel dug was giving instructions from the other seat red light ahead depress brake pedal stop green light depress accelerator pedal the cai leaped ahead but nimby did seem to have it under control and soon the ride steadied he turned the wheel when dug said and the car turned at the same time in due course they reached the house chlorine realized that she should not have been surprised his powers of magic were greatly diminished but nimby had enormous powers of comprehension and he was here to learn about mundania so he was learning to travel the mundane way he would be learning other things as they went so as to understand the rules ot this land back inside the house they tackled the kitchen under kirns guidance chlorine succeeded in opening and heating a can of beans and spreading jam on slices of bread kirn did much of the rest but it was a start mundanian ways were distinctly strange but she was catching on to them in the evening kim showed them vvhat she called the teevee this was a box with a screen on front and pictures formed on it and sound came from it it was like a very small movie you can watch news sports sitcomsanything you want dug explained or you can ignore it chlorine found herself feeling increasingly vague and awkward when she tried to stand she fell back into her chair unbalanced pia kim said alarmed are you all right i dont know chlorine said im dizzy and i dont feel good the diabetes dug exclaimed we forgot about that she has to take insulin thats right kim said she should have had her shot before she ate can you handle it kim im not sure i know the principle but i never saw her do it then id better i used to help her way back when she first was diagnosed and was learning the dosages and technique he grabbed ior pias purse and rummaged in it for something then he approached chlorine your body has a problem a shot will take care of it im going to have to get rather personal but this is something you need to have and to know how to do lift up your skirt xont op contfcntion lift she asked vaguely this was not the kind of thing a man often asked a woman to do in company but nimby who understood that she now had the same problem he had given her xanth body nodded he knew she needed immediate help kim reached across and pulled chlorines skirt up high revealing her panties both dug and nimby saw but neither freaked out this was mundania chlorine remembered where things didnt work as they should ed you need to know this too dug said her medicine is in this ampoule he was doing something with a needle she takes it in the high thigh where it doesnt ordinarily show this much injected this way he brought the needle down pia dont move im sorry ill be clumsy so there will be some pain but it must be done you must trust me i do chlorine said because she knew of dug by reputation during his visits to xanth he was sincere and competent kim caught hold of chlorine helping her to not move like this dug said and jabbed the needle into her flesh chlorine jumped and tried to get away not in control of herself but kim held her down while dug depressed the needles plunger and the fluid went in he was right it did hurt then he pulled the needle out swab he said we need a swab should have used it before actually kim found something cool and damp and dabbed the stuck place the pain had been brief and not that bad chlorine just hadnt been ready for anything like this she pulled down her skirt thank you she said somewhat weakly she knew the awkward process had been necessary she had been feeling really odd after that they explained in detail what pia needed and when and how nimby was paying close attention and chlorine knew he understood he would see that it was done already she was feeling better the shot had indeed fixed her problem it had also shown her how much she and nimby needed the guidance of the companions without them this could have been quite serious things settled down and they watched the teevee and talked mundania was almost becoming familiar then dug and kim got ready to depart for their home was elsewhere tomorrow well show you how to ride the motorcycle dug said from the car piers anthony nimby perked up kim laughed yes like the ones in the movie preview only nobody in real life eer rides them like that ed would have a nt if his lemon were treated that way dug said he loves that machine beyond all else what beyond pia chlorine asked dug and kim exchanged a glance you might as well know dug said ed and pia are not getting along well so yes he may value the lemon beyond her their visit to xanth is to give them a break from routine life so as maybe to get a new slant on their relationship kim said we hope it works out theyre good friends and good people dug said just not wholly compatible xanth has a way of making things work out chlorine said especially romantically we know kim said we hope it works on them then dug started the motor and the neptune moved out this has been a considerable day chlorine said when they were alone mundama isnt as backward as i expected but on the whole i prefer xanth i mean the other place nimby nodded but of course he wasnt here to enjoy mundania but to explore it youre in a mundane body without magic so you will need to sleep too so lets get into bed they went upstairs and used the bathroom facilities it was worse for nimby than for chlorine because as a demon he had not had natural functions and in manform he had simply used magic to abate those he didnt care for now he had no way to escape them she had to help him with the details fortunately as a demon he also lacked a sense of privacy she did not say so but she rather liked having him dependent on her for help for a change he would need help only once in anything but there would be a number of things to learn then they got into the bed how are you feeling she asked by way of invitation nimby shrugged that left it up to her well im tired and overloaded by new experience she said but ive never made love without magic and never in someone elses body and never to a mundane man thais three to two in favor of doing it now so lets do it xone of contention so they did it it was surprisingly clumsy and somewhat messy but chlorine didnt mind she had wondered whether things would be as good without magic and now she knew they were not she wondered why mundanes even bothered to signal storks but this also meant she would really appreciate it when they returned to xanth now she had a basis for comparison are you sorry she asked him as they relaxed for sleep he squeezed her hand in negation she appreciated that too for all its negatives this experience was like a honeymoon talents e dsel woke in darkness he had not availed himself of the privy section before and now he needed to pia was sleeping beside him she being more sensible about such things had no problem what a delight she could be when she tried but he knew she was serious she still intended to divorce him when they returned to mundania and he would not be able to protest so he had to hope that something happened in xanth to make her change her mind because though his passion had faded somewhat in their years of marriage he still did love her she could be selfish and difficult and cutting but she could also be wonderful tonight had been an example she knew exactly how to please him and she was matchless when she tried he got up and crawled up the side of the nest to the ladder he was clothed they had dressed again after as neither one of them was quite used to the ways of xanth and wanted to be ready for surprises he climbed down and walked toward the privy this was just a pit covered by illusion but it served well enough he could see as there was a faint glow from the ground maybe of magical origin he liked the ambient magic of xanth he emerged irom the privy and paused had he heard something edsel a voice called from the night xom or contention here he said surprised who are you where arc you tin breanna here by the path come quickly he walked toward her she was standing just beyond the path in the darkness whats up i thought you were with justin i was she said but something came up you must come right away what came up there is danger you must lcae this place now come with me danger yes hurry this was confusing i thought this place was enchanted to be safe bad magic is coming she said urgently we must be well away before it gets here at dawn far away we must go without pia without justin justin is finding a safe place she said get pia he remained bothered are you sure i mean to sneak out in the night am sure quickly edsel we must go be very silent okay he returned to the nest pia he whispered touching her shoulder she was hard to wake it was her diabetes he thought when she went down it was for the count but he kept after her pia wake up we have to get out of here she stirred huh didnt i already take care of you this isnt sex wake up we have to go you go ill stay she pulled the blanket over her head it was a struggle but he finally got through to her she got herself together grabbed her purse and followed him out of the nest they descended the ladder and walked across to where breanna was waiting whats this pia asked we cant go outside the enchanted area we must breanna said danger but she says its coming here at dawn edsel said bad magic we have to clear the area before it gets here pia evidently didnt have the mental coherence to argue then lets get to where i can finish sleeping this way breanna said turning to follow a small side path small glowing fungus growing along the sides marked it piers anthony they followed edsel didnt like this but it was the job of the companions to keep the visitors safe and he had to trust their judgment they had been right about everything else the path wound deiously through the night edsel had no idea where they were going he wanted to ask but didnt want to be too obvious about his ignorance so he tried to lead into it by broaching a different subject how did it work out with justin justm is finding a sate place she said she had said that before no i mean last night you know holding hands we do hold hands she agreed not this way petting we pet pets the girl said they are nice something was wrong does this make sense to you he asked pia no dont think this is breanna uhoh but he had to find out breanna exactly what is this danger thats coming we have a right to know danger she said coming at dawn you must get far away you said that before edsel said before she agreed you must hurry before the danger comes at dawn edsel stopped walking and pia stopped with him were not going anywhere until you answer a question how did you hold hands with justm we do hold hands she agreed hurry show me how he said this way down this path hurry hold my hand he said he reached out to catch her hand his hand passed right through hers without touching she was illusion it s a spook pia said we ve been tricked for sure he agreed and you know she never said for sure she doesnt know about the hand holding shes just a programmed image responding to verbal cues i was a fool not to catch on sooner this was pias chance to say something suitably cutting but she passed it up lets get the bleep back to the safe area he noted with bemusement that she couldnt say a bad word in the presence of even a take underage person that adult conspiracy was literal minded xonfc of cont ntion they turned backbut the path was gone the lights had blinked out but it was more that that there was nothing but a thick tangle of bnars there i think ie heard of this edse said its a oneway path see its still there ahead of us sos the spook she said nervously edsel thought as rapidly and well as he could considenng that his mind telt numbed its a programmed spook an image with a few sentences keyed by our statements we cant go back maybe we should go forward you know pretend to be still taken in so the spook wont suspect until we have a chance to get away do it she agreed they faced the spook sorry about the delay edsel said lets go where were going we must go quickly the spook agreed before the danger comes at dawn yes we must go he said he took pias hand not tor any naughty purpose but because he knew how frightened she had to be and wanted to reassure her the real breanna and justin will discover were gone and come after us he whispered we just have to play along until then yes she agreed terrified they followed the spook down the glowing path edsel turned his head to peek behind them and saw that the path was disappearing as they went one way indeed this was an aspect of magic he would have preferred not to encounter even if they got free of the spook how could they ever make their way back through that jungle the were no longer protected from dragons or tangle trees the path continued interminably now edsel had time to consider other aspects why had this trap been set for them whoever had set it up had known something about them their names that they were visitors who could be fooled the names of their companions trom whom they were to be separated but who could be behind this or hal the path continued and so did the spook all they could do was follow but edsel kept his eyes open watching tor any escape or even a hint of what they were caught in on and on edsels legs were getting tired and pia was stumbling against him the spook had been right about wherever it was they were going being tar away piers amhoni the sky hegan to lighten dawn was coming that was a relief at least they would be able to see something other than the glowing path but that would not necessarily be good news it might merely clarify how bad the trouble was whats that pia asked squeezing his hand almost painfully tight edsel looked a jagged line was forming in the sky it widened and lengthened and light spilled out one end was overhead the other was touching the horizon the crack of dawn he exclaimed catching on at that the crack wedged all the way open and light poured across the land the spook faded out the path also faded they were left standing on a brushy plain ahead of them was a dark castle i think thats where we are headed edsel said pia shuddered i dont want to go there edsel looked around i see a streamand a boat i think we had better borrow that boat and get away irom here yes they tramped through the brush to the boat it was tied to a deserted cabin we must mark this place edsel said so we know where to return the boat he didnt want to think of himself as a thief he untied the boat and held it steady while pia got in there were two paddles lying along its bottom they took these and moved into the stream fortunately the current was away from the castle the stream carried them along they needed the paddles only to steer the boat soon it debouched into a lake the castle seemed to be on the edge of the lake so they paddled the other way theres an island pia said pointing maybe thats the best place to hide he said until justin and breanna come looking for us yes she seemed a trifle encouraged they paddled toward the island maybe the real deadline the spook had was to get us to that castle before the crack ot dawn he said the way she vanished and the path faded when the light came vampires she said but we delayed just enough to be behind schedule so we escaped they cant chase us in daylight so if justin and breanna come before then well be all right we were such fools we should hae known xonf of contention my fault i took her at her word i really thought it was breanna though i see now that she was obviously phony from the outset next time ill know better assuming they got out of this fix pias fear was evident in part by her lack of any cutting comments she lost inspiration when nervous the island looked lovely but edsel did not trust that he paddled around it looking for anything suspicious oh come on pia said impatiently i need to get steady so i can take my shot use the toilet clean up and get the bleep off my feet edsel didnt argue pia had to keep her shot schedule which included checking her blood sugar she had to have rest after exertion or she would get out of adjustment it could be dangerous to mess that up so he guided the boat to an inlet with a small beach and drove the prow ashore so it would be anchored pia stepped out first he caught a glimpse of her high thigh as she lifted her leg but didnt say anything he still liked such views though her legs were thicker than they had been as her foot touched the sand she paused then completed her motion then he got outand felt something like a mild electric shock as his shoe landed you felt it too pia asked yes static electricity must be then she moved off to the bushes to handle her business while he hauled the boat the rest of the way to the land there was a cluster of what looked like stalks of straw sticking out of the ground edsel had a notion so he picked one and bit on the end sure enough it was a strawberry we have breakfast he announced good im famished he sat on the beach and chewed on the straw he tried to conjure a solid illusion but nothing happened he tried again and nothing happened again alarmed he called to pia hows your magic talent doing i havent thought of it since yesterday when all it showed me was a walk along a wooded shore then she paused oh no i just realized that its this shore i thought it looked familiar but didnt place it before but that makes sense he said you couldnt change that view because it wasnt anything you were doing then that affected it it was the spook in the night if wed said no to it that would have changed our future piers anthony she emerged from the brush thats right sometimes you remind me what i saw in you his cleverness in figuring things out at least if they resembled computer programming in any way his mind worked in flow charts this leading to that that leading to the other and the whole process leading to a feasible process of software but i was a bit late figuring this one out he said ruefully feel better anyway she said stopping to kiss him briefly he liked that too she had friendly little ways of course they didnt mean anything they were just social manners have a straw he said handing her one she tried it strawberry then she looked as if she had just swallowed a pun and i just walked into that one i think i could almost get to like xanth if it werent for the abysmal jokes they are more my speed he agreed not for decent folk but about your talent what do you see for tomorrow she concentrated nothing its not working thats what was afraid of i think weve lost our talents lost ourhow could that happen cant be sure but my guess is that static electricity shock we got maybe this island steals talents thats crazy so is xanth she nodded point made she stretchedanother gesture he liked but ive got to rest why dont you keep a lookout for justin and breanna while i sleep then ill stand watch while you sleep okay the business of the talents bothered him but he wanted to figure it out better before scaring her with his dark conjectures she spied a pillow bush harvested several nice pillows and set them on the beach then she lay down on them closed her eyes and slept she could do that much more readily than he could in fact he had trouble sleeping in daylight even when he felt logy as he did now he tried again to make a solid illusion and failed again it definitely wasnt working so probably he was right this island stole talents that was why it was deserted regular xanth folk would know better than to set foot on it he found a suitable tree sat in the sand before it and leaned back against the trunk looking out across the water justin and breanna would have to come by water or air and either way this was the best way to xonf of co mention see them at the moment the lake was quiet and so was the sky there was just one puffy cloud relaxing in the sunlight evidently having nothing better to do at the moment idly he tried to figure out what the cloud resembled a mushroom a squashed bug a human face no none of those it was just a blob a face would have eyes and mouth and ears eyes there and there and ears to either side and a bulbous nose yes like that edsel blinked it nav a face but it hadnt been before it had been largely shapeless could it be with sudden excitement he focused on the cloud bug he thought with six legs and wings and antenna and huge bug eyes slowly the cloud shifted sprouting legs the ears became wings two antenna grew at one end and the human eyes became bulging bug eyes he was doing it but just to be sure he tried another form something that couldnt be confused for natural a geometric form a triangle the edges of the cloud fuzzed the outline changed it became a triangle i have a new talent he breathed the island didnt steal my talent it exchanged it he glanced at pia decorously asleep and it must have exchanged hers too then he had a sober second thought what good was shaping clouds sure it could be fun but it wouldnt feed him or get him unlost at least the solid illusions could have helped him scare off a monster so he wasnt better off but maybe pia had done better he would have her look for her new talent when she woke maybe it would be more useful than her original one had proved to be one would have thought that seeing one day into the future would be phenomenally useful but circumstances had nullified it maybe there was a lesson of life there if he could figure it out meanwhile he pondered the likely rules of changes of talents if the exchange happened when a person first touched the island which seemed likely considering that slight shock they had felt would it do it again if a person left the island and returned that seemed likely because the island couldnt be presumed to be intelligent it just had this property of switching talents with whoever touched it and if the first time switched out his original talent would a second time bring it back well there was a way to find out edsel got up and went to the boat he pushed it into the water then pifrs anthony stepped carefully into it he paddled it out a few strokes then reversed and came back in was that far enough he brought it close and stepped back onto the beach and felt the shock so he was right about that much he looked at the cloud which was trying to drift out of range he concentrated trying to form it into a square nothing happened he tried to make a solid illusion nothing happened he pondered so there had been an exchange but not a reversion so he must have a new talent essentially random he would have to figure it out so what could it be he had lucked out the first time idly watching the cloud now he had no idea but maybe his contemplation of the cloud hadnt been completely random maybe his new talent had guided him edsel wasnt much of a believer in lucky coincidences usually there were reasons for things whose logic could be discovered by the right sort of search this flowed to that which flowed to the other so maybe he should just let his mind drift and he would come across it he sat down and leaned back against the tree and the tree gave way he jumped up startled the tree had sunk a short distance into the ground how could that be it was solid it hadnt done that before unless his talent had done it edsel pondered then put his arms around the trunk and pushed down the trunk sank lower that was it he walked to a nearby boulder and put his hand on the top pressing down the stone sank interesting but what good was it he was not a pile driver and it couldnt be good for the tree could he reverse it he walked back to the tree put his arms around it and lifted nothing happened so this was a one way talent sorry tree he said i didnt mean to do it i didnt know my own strength then he walked to the boat lifted one foot to step into it and hesitated would he make it sink into the ground he decided not to risk it he nudged it onto the water not ever pushing down the water should keep it floating as long as it didnt touch ground he stepped in and it didnt sink so it was only when he pushed down with something other than his feet that the talent worked that was a relief xonf of contention he paddled out a stroke then back to shore he stepped out there was the tingle good he returned to the boulder and pressed down it didnt budge he looked up at the cloud trying to shape it into a perfect circle it ignored him and fled beyond the horizon he tried to make a solid illusion nothing okay he had a new talent what was it he returned to the tree and settled back against it noting its solidity the tree was now shorter than it had been but still tall enough to reach the lower sky so he hadnt done it too much harm his mind scanned the scene and the universe no notion of a talent came to him he tried guessing and got nowhere could he stir up a dust devil in the sand no could he turn the sun green no could he conjure a mint plant no could he make the sand slippery no could he make a protective shield around himself no could he become a super vacuum cleaner that sucked up everything no and he was getting a bit crazy suppose his new talent was something really specialized that couldnt be tested here and now like making the evil cloud fracto assume human form and walk on the ground in that case he would not be able to identify it now so he might as well assume that it was not of that type and keep looking could his talent apply to his mentai ability such as having a photographic memory that would be great but when he tried to remember what the scenery was like behind him without looking he couldnt so that wasnt it finally he gave it up he didnt know what his new talent was so he couldnt use it so it was useless to him so he would just fetch another talent he went to the boat but as he shoved it into the water his hand slipped and it drifted out of his reach bleep he swore he would have to splash after it he stepped in the waterand his foot found firm lodging had he landed on a rock just under the surface no his toot was on the water could it be he put his weight on it and set his other foot down it too landed on solidity he was walking on water now that could be a useful talent he wouldnt need the boat an more he could even maybe carry pia across a stream if she didnt weigh too much now so he would keep this one pihrs anthony he caught the boat and shoved it back to land then he stepped back on the beach himselfand felt the tingle oh no he had lost the new talent already walking on water had counted as leaving the island and so it had been exchanged bleep he tested it just to be sure his foot sank into the water what are you doing pia demanded behind him he jumped splashing himself worse i was trying to walk on water he said shamefacedly ive heard of arrogance but this is extreme i found out how to change talents i was just able to walk on water but i lost it he went on to explain she was interested i can learn my talent by just relaxing and checking what occurs to me maybe it worked for me more or less breanna told me about twins she knew named more and less morton and lester actually they have a joint talent to turn into humanoid crossbreeds more or less human like elves or ogres i hope we dont have that talent but you can try for others no need to egg me on she experimented nothing happened i cant think of anything she said gesturing with the blue egg in her hand well sometimes it just isnt obvious maybe we should just walk along the shore and see what occurs as i foresaw us doing yesterday she agreed she glanced at the egg what do i do with this where did you get it i didnt get it i she stared at it you conjured it he exclaimed you can conjure things maybe i can she agreed awed i did think of an egg you said dont egg me on he agreed she concentrated i want a pair of hiking boots she said nothing happened i want an ice cream sundae nothing try another egg edsel suggested but i dont want another egg a second egg appeared in her other hand this one was green thats it edsel said you conjure eggs thats all bleep there wasnt even any underage person nearby but now they were selfcensoring themselves xonk contention but if you step off the island you can exchange your talent for another im game she set down the eggs and he helped her get into the boat i think all you need to do is get your feet off the land he said you dont have to go anywhere she got out ol the boat as her foot touched the sand she paused i felt it its the exchange now to see what you have i hope its more useful she looked around she concentrated its not summoning eggs anyway right and mines not walking on water she laughed if you can walk on water i can walk on air she took sexeral exaggerated steps edsel stared she glanced down at him what are you staring at my legs that too he said iamtly well stop i dont then she looked at her feet they were half a foot above the ground you are walking on air he breathed get me down he caught her around the waist and hauled her toward the sand she seemed to have the buoyancy of a balloon and wasnt hard to bring down to the ground oh i felt the tingle she said because you left the islandand returned he said now you have a different talent just as well she muttered they walked along the shore as she had foreseen when they figured out an unwanted talent they took turns lifting each other off the ground and getting new talents actually after the first time edsel was worried about pias strength trying to haul him up so he tried jumping that did it too talents were flighty here in the isle of talents at this rate we wont be able to hang on to talents we like pia complained we need some way to anchor good ones they came to a sign confishv ialk to thl tlij hr whats the teller edsel asked heres something pia said she picked up a small disk from a pedestal beside the sign piers anthony maybe its the teller edsel said she held it up are you the teller yes the disk said startled she dropped it edsel picked it up how do you work i announce your talent edsel glanced at pia this could be useful then he addressed the teller again whats my talent there was a tingle in the hand holding the disk to turn things transparent so that only their ideas show ideasr but the disk was silent it seemed it didnt qualify its an nouncements pia took the disk whats my talent to become what is needed while it is needed when you know what is needed i dont understand but the disk was silent this is nevertheless better than nothing edsel said i suppose she agreed doubtfully but doesnt it seem rather well convenient that we should encounter this helpful sign and disk right when we needed them you mean like a path to a tangle tree yes good point lets put it back she set the disk back on its pedestal and they went on t dont think i like becoming what is needed pia said that might be a meal for a dragon or a sex object ior an ardent man she had the grace to laugh thats not a talent thats the state of being female then jump and change it then i wont know what my talent is any more urn he agreed maybe we do need that teller maybe so she agreed reluctantly but i teel as if im being herded yes lets take it until we get talents we want then leave it and the island yes pia leaped exchanging her talent but edsel wanted to enfy his he looked for something to turn transparent all he saw was the wooden pedestal they weic approaching so he focused on that xonfc of contention it became transparent inside was the wavering image of a tree its a tree pia said or it was it still has the idea of its nature thats sad and i suppose if i tried it on a person dont try it on me she cried alarmed what indeed would become of her if he turned her transparent these talents didnt seem to be reversible this one could be dangerous so he ended it by leaping pia picked up the teller whats my talent she asked to amplify noise i dont like that she leaped now whats my talent making paintings come to hie she considered maybe that will do she kept her feet on the ground and handed the disk to edsel whats my talent he asked waxing the moons green cheese edsel laughed then realized that the teller was serious in xanth the moon really did have green cheese on the side facing the ground on the side facing away he understood it was milk and honey because that was not polluted by the sights it saw thus a honeymoon was by definition to the tar side but how was he going to get to the moon to encase its cheese in wax so this did not seem useful he jumped whats my talent returning things to their original state now that seemed useful he tried another question where did this talent come from a boy named reuben who must have visited the island and exchanged his talent before he knew too bad for him lets get away from here with what weve got pia said tightly keeping our teel firmly on the ground edsel agreed he tucked the teller into his pocket in case of future need they strode back to the boat got carefully in and paddled it awa from the island edsel felt relief the island had seemed nice but eerie in its lack of people or creatures now he knew why they didnt want their talents involuntarily changed those who did want change would come only long enough to get a useful one then would flee never to return where are we going she asked as they pulled clear of the cove piers anthom he hadnt thought that tar ahead i guess we had better return the boat we dont seem to be finding much we want on the lake anyway then ve can look tor the enchanted path and our companions they should be looking for us so maybe well meet halfway she didnt argue which meant she was as worried as he was he did not want to get caught out at night but how they were going to plow through that tangle of briars to get back to the campsite he didnt know edsel felt something in his pocket i forgot to return the teller to its pedestal he said we cant go back now our talents will change she was right he would just have to keep the teller at least for now they took the boat back to where they had found it and tied it in place apparently no one had missed it which was another relief they walked across the plain i think the camp is that way edsel said pointing where the very thickest brambles are right so well have to be a bit indirect there seems to be thinner cover there to the side it turned out to be mixed field and forest rather pleasant but of course this was day it might be another matter by night they passed an apple pie tree and picked a ripe pie and sat down to eat it id better test my talent pia said but i dont see a painting to bring to life maybe you can draw one in the dirt he suggested half humorously yeah sure she said withermgly then she reconsidered the way things are literal here in xanth maybe that would work after all sure he cleared a place for her smoothing it over she found a stick and drew a crude picture of a rabbit with two huge long ears and a wiggly nose then she focused on it come to life she said the rabbit jumped out of the dirt and bounded away then it turned and hounded back looking at them it was lopsided with brown fur but definitely alive you did it edsel said you made a living creature see if yours works she said he nodded he spoke to the rabbit return to your natural state the rabbit hopped onto the cleared dirt and flattened into the drawing op contention oh you killed it that was an exaggeration but he didnt argue then bring it back to life i will she concentrated nothing happened you did focus the same way he asked yes its just not working now weird id better try mine again he looked around would it work on a fallen leaf he picked one up and focused nothing happened so he tried it on a dead stick nothing on a stone with no result our talents arent working pia said annoyed let me verify this he brought the teller from his pocket whats my talent summoning birds but thats not what i took from the island there was no answer the teller was not much of a conversationalist well summon a bird pia said somewhat acidly edsel looked into the sky there was no bird in sight he tried anyway bring me a bird there was a shuddering in the air a distant cloud vibrated a shape came zooming toward them it was a bird growing larger larger and huge huger and enormous enormouser it threatened to blot out the sky get rid of it pia cried covering he head with her hands i dont think thats my talent he said with more bravado than he felt the monstrous bird braked in air and they were almost blown away by its downdraft it landed before them it was bigger than both of them by far in fact it could have swallowed the two of them together it settled down rocked a few times and tucked its head under one wing now it most resembled a boulder twelve feet high its a roc edsel said catching on i summoned a roc a pet roc she agreed recovering a pet rock he exclaimed laughing then she caught the pun too i should have known thats the kind of bird youd summon still it was dauntingly big what say we just let it be he suggested slowly standing and backing off pitrs anthony agreed they sidled away the pet roc remained birdnapping apparently his talent had summoned it but did not require that it remain with him once they were well clear of the big bird he tried again this time specifying a small bird nothing happened his talent had fizzled let me try it pia said taking the teller from his hand whats my talent making things thicker or thinner she glanced at a nearby tree thinner she said touching the trunk with one finger the tree shook and shrank suddenly it was half the thickness it had been she went to another tree thicker nothing happened we seem to be blessed with one shot talents edsel said they change each time we use them fortunately we have the teller so we dont have to guess what the next one is thats the way it was on the island she said but we havent been jumping i guess the rule is different off the island but i dont like this we cant ever be sure of our talents if we didnt have the teller wed be mostly confused im mostly confused already she said but she made a quick smile edsel pondered give me the teller i want to see what i have and maybe keep it until i need it she handed him the teller but then changed her mind let me try it first i dont summon dangerous birds thats just the luck of the draw anyway it is what it is i just need to find out no i want to find out they were both tugging on the teller okay he said compromising lets both ask one two three whats my talent they asked together making a wish come true the teller said but thats only one talent pia said mine or his there was no answer the teller was good at that this is simple to resolve edsel said we can each make a wish and see which one is granted xonl of contention do we have to wish out loud i dont know lets try silent and if that doesnt work well try aloud they each concentrated edsels lemon motorcycle appeared parked before him he had gotten his wish he turned to piaand paused she had changed her clothing had become illfitting but she looked much better than she had she turned and saw him looking i wished for my sixteen year old figure back she said adjusting her apparel they had both gotten their wishes belatedly he realized what that meant you could have wished wed find our companions her eye caught the lemon and you could have wished for something useful i did wish ior something useful we can ride the bike instead of walking on what highway he studied the landscape with new misgiving it was bumpy and clogged with brush they could walk through it but the motorcycle would be constantly balked maybe theres a clearer area ahead he said lamely and maybe a gas station fuel how would he fill the tank he hadnt been thinking sensibly at all still pia had wasted her wish too he was about to say something cutting but looked again at her figure and stifled it she was stunning maybe something will turn up he said he went to the lemon checked it and iound it complete he got on it and cranked on the motor it roared into life but he had nowhere to go this wasnt an offtrail bike and in any event this terrain wasnt for any wheeled vehicle he killed the motor and got off but he couldnt just leave the lemon there so he took it by the handlebars and pushed it forward ll was heavy but he could handle it and the rolling weight wasnt bad on approximately level ground so have we used up our talents pia asked must have he took the teller whats my talent bringing statues to life but theres no statue here there was as usual no answer maybe you can make one pia suggested the way i drew my picture piers anthony good idea he parked the bike took out his pen knife lifted a stick and carved it into a crude man form come to life he said the iorm moved but it couldnt say anything because he hadn t carved a mouth he had wasted another talent my turn pia said taking the teller from his hand whats my talent glaring daggers its got you pegged edsel exclaimed she glared a dagger shot from her eye and just missed his ear he ducked alarmed and the other daggers missed by greater margins damn the literal nature of xanth he grabbed the teller whats my talent controlling the emotions of others make pia happy he cried you fool she laughed happily you just wasted another talent you should have saved for a mean monster she was right he had once again acted without thinking she couldnt be mad at him because he had made her happy but the damage was done he handed the teller to her find out yours and use it sensibly i will she onented on the disk whats my talent summoning a friend she smiled breanna a figure appeared m the distance pia is that you here pia called happily breanna hurried up followed by justin weve been looking all over for you we tried to follow your trail but there wasnt much are you all right i am now you know the way back to the enchanted path right for sure breanna paused piayou look terrific what happened i got my sixteen year old figure back im your age now and twice as sexy breanna agreed admiringly oh i wouldnt say that justin demurred why not edsel asked but the man averted his gaze embarrassed oh yes holding hands we are certainly glad to see you pia said cheerfully we were lost justin looked at the motorcycle what is that thing xone of contention thats my old lemon edsel said with mixed feelings i must say i never saw a lemon or any other fruit like that thats its brand name it was branded this wasn t getting far it s a mundane machine i got it for a wish but cant use it here in mundama it could carry two people rapidly a long way oh justin said clearly not understanding lets get moving toward safety pia said joyfully we can explain everything as we go yes breanna agreed and we must check in so the others know youre all right it has been a day but it will take time to get back to com passion s cave edsel said no we can do it now i have an ear she produced what looked like a human ear speak into this its connected to the o xone pia took the ear this is pia ed and i are okay the ear quivered so that she almost dropped it good so are we chlorines voice came that was it pia returned the ear they walked through the brush edsel pushed the lemon unwilling to give it up though he knew that soon he would have to they caught the two companions up on their recent adventures oh the isle of talents justin said i know of it though never knew its location but your talents shouldnt keep changing once you leave the isle we can use them only once edsel said then we have to ask the teller to identify the next one the what he showed justin the teller the man shied away thats a demon a what a demon they arent all like metna you know they can assume any form some specialize in specific mischief this one must be changing your talents as you invoke it changing our talents pia exclaimed her happiness somewhat tempered by outrage yes my guess ts that it masks your inherent talent drawing on its power to provide a temporary new one get nd of it and youll probably have your original talent back piers anthom gladly edsel said he dropped the disk to the ground it bounced back like a yoyo returning to his hand angry he threw it violently away it curved in air like a boomerang and returned he set it on the ground and put a rock on top of it but when he retreated it wiggled its way free and snapped back to stick to his sleeve suspect you can part with it only by gimg it to another person justm said edsel looked at pia they had been handing it back and forth they had never tried to dispose of it theres got to be another way edsel said there should be justm agreed probably you can return it to the place you found it thats often the way of such things the isle of talents pia said bleep her magic happiness was weathering nevertheless i believe we should return it there justm said breanna and i do not dare to set foot on it for obvious reason so you will have to do it yourself but we will help you in whatever way we can that made sense then lets head for the isle edsel said we know where it is i want to get this done and get out of here before dark not to worry breanna said my talent is to see in the dark i dont want to get near that dark castle pia said but theres no castle m this region pia exchanged a glance with edsel it disappeared when the crack of dawn came he explained it may reappear at night sounds interesting bieanna said but lets take care of the tcllei first maybe we can use the teller to help justm said if you care to run through several talents until a useful one turns up but why would it help us to get rid of it demons arent necessarily intelligent often they do what they do without thought so edsel tried running through talents and was in luck he got the ability to find the very best route to any obectie whats the best route to the boat he asked that isnt right justm said you did not define the boat any boat will do dear bieanna said lnot the censor ship x nf of comlntion for sure she agreed but hes already invoked it so well just have to see this way edsel said with certainty facing the thickest brush toward the boat in a small meander a small meander pia said but didnt protest because the talents did seem to work they turned and cut through the brush toward the place where the boat was as none of them cared to risk swimming in the lake they found a path and followed it that made pushing the lemon much easier but the path led straight to a tangle tree we should have known breanna said you cant trust wilderness paths but my talent indicates this is the best edsel said perplexed whats that caught in its tentacles pia asked breanna peered thats para she cried the duckfooted boat a what edsel asked we met it by the isle of women last year breanna said it was traveling between a pair of docks its really nice weve got to save it edsel appreciated the pun pair of docks paradox but what good is aa boat with feet youll see this is the boat your talent led you to and its much better than the other how can we rescue it perhaps we can arrange an exchange justm said edsel laughed how about my lemon for the boat we can try justm said doubtfully pia helped edsel move the lemon into position just beyond the range of the tangle trees tentacles then he stood to the side while she sat on it and smiled pretty girls made anything salable and she was excruci atmgly pretty now tangle tree edsel said how would you like to trade this for that he gestured to the lemon then to the tangled boat the tree considered edsel could tell by the way its tentacles twitched then it released the boat the boat promptly got its dozen or so feet under it and ran away from the tree para breanna cried the boat ran to her and she hugged its wooden prow im so glad we found you in time the boat was evidently glad too it curled its webbed feet and quivered piers anthony however justm said to it we feel that one favor deserves another we have rescued you will you transport us the boat slapped a foot against the ground and stood still that seemed to be agreement meanwhile edsel wheeled the lemon toward the tangle tree heres your bike he said sadly though im not sure what use you will have for it the tentacles shook retreat justin called the tree is angry edsel quickly backed off whats the problem we made a deal i think i understand justin said there may have been a misunderstanding the tree thought you meant pia oops pia had sat on the bike decorating it as he gestured to it the tree would not have had much experience with mundane marketing techniques but im not about to be going to go get gobbled by that monster pia protested then it appears we are reneging on the understanding justin said that is not good policy for sure breanna agreed weve got to work something out edsel had a notion suppose pia uses the teller to get a talent that will protect her from the tree so it cant eat her i dont want to stay forever in its tangles either pia protested still she took the teller whats my talent hearing anything close by she cocked her head i hear bugs talking to each other through their antennae she said but that wont help me whats my talent to be ineffably charming that wont help me either i wait justin said it might after all help if your talent is to be charming beyond the capacity of mere words to express perhaps you could charm the tree into accepting the machine pia considered would i have to get within its reach i regret that you probably would as the full measure of your charm is incapable of being verbalized no she could just let it look at her breanna said thats not words perhaps so justin agreed doubtfully well ill try it pia said just as dubious she stepped close to edsel and the lemon and struck a pose it was a charming pose tan xone of contimio gler she said dulcetly may i call you that i was just the decoration for the motorcycle not the offering it was a misunderstanding but you know that machine is as useful to you as the quack footed boat i mean you cant eat either one but theres nothing else in xanth like the lemon so maybe it would be a tourist attraction or something so maybe its a fair deal utter all doesnt that make sense to you she smiled winningly edsel stared pia had always been able to turn on the charm when she wanted to but this was moreso than she had ever been before it wasnt just that she was lovely in her sixteen year old perfect body there was an intangible aura about her that made her ultimately winsome and sweet justin and breanna felt it too he could see them watching as avidly as he was the magic was truly working she could charm tears from a stone the tangle tree was feeling it as well its tentacles were quivering their tips curling and uncurling and such a big strong handsome tree as you can surely afford to be generous pia continued she adjusted her pose to show more thigh edsel wasnt sure that was smart as it might just make the tree hungry but he didnt dare interfere you wouldnt want to gobble up poor little me would you the tentacles twisted in denial how could they do that awful thing because i know that deep down inside your cgetable heart youre really a nice creature she stepped forward and took hold of the end of a tentacle wont you make the deal and take the lemon and let me leave with my sincere appreciation she lifted the tentacle to her face and kissed it the whole tree quivered and turned vaguely pink edsel acted on cue and wheeled the lemon forward several tentacles reached out to take hold of it and edsel retreated oh thank you so much generous tree pia exclaimed and hugged the tentacle to her fair bosom the tree seemed ready to melt edsel felt much the same way pia was an utterly charming creature well byebye tangier pia said turning and walking slowly away her rear view was as compelling as her front view as she well knew the tree might not caie about her sex appeal howeer much edsel did but her charm was undimmished the tentacles were limp with appreciation i believe that does it justin said very nice performance pia the compliment vas obviously sincere as his eyes ere halfway glazed piers anthony it was fun she confessed now lets get the bleep out of here for sure breanna agreed they climbed into the boat edsel realized that the charm was fading pia had used up the talent but she remained a lovely creature how he hoped that this adventure in the land of xanth would somehow persuade her to reconcile the marriage he got into the boat the duck feet got moving carrying the boat and them along he looked back to see the lemon disappearing into the green mass of foliage at least it had turned out to be useful coventree p ia turned back to wave at the tangle tree and it actually waved a tentacle back so it could see and understand as many creatures and things of xanth seemed to be able to do she rather liked that it was a considerable contrast to mundamas perversity of the inanimate she also liked having her beautiful body back though she knew she would revert to normal when she returned home now if only she could get rid of the diabetes and stay rid of it in the real world but of course such fancies were loolish meanwhile para the duck footed boat was transporting them to the isle of talents the feet enabled it to cruise over land and water without pause it seemed to be floating on land certainly it was nice to let her own feet rest edsels temporary talent really had steered him right i am curious about one thing justin said you folk mentioned seeing a dark castle in this general region but we know of no castle here could you be more explicit it was just a dark outline against the sky edsel said and it vanished at the crack of dawn so i think its like the path one way b night did it seem inimical seem what hostile pia said translating no it was ust there and scary pifrs anthony the phantasm did not seem hostile either justin said it merely led you on assuming the guise of breanna to whatever it was leading us to pia agreed i knew it was nowhere i wanted to be this perplexes me normally the dangers of xanth are not subtle if the phantasm wished you harm it should have done it as soon as you were clear of the enchanted path why did it go to the considerable trouble of making a protected path of its own to bring you to an apparent castle protected path edsel asked it must have been because you came to no harm in the night there are many dangers in the dark oh i dont know about that breanna demurred i like the dark that is because your own talent is to see in blackness dear girl justin said fondly so you can go about by night as readily as by day but normal folk cant see well in darkness so it is both more frightening and more dangerous for them are you implying that im not normal breanna demanded archly pia noted that she was flirting but could use some tips about how to do it better dear girl you will never be normal justin said gallantly you are uniquely endowed endowed breanna echoed as in holding hands justin spluttered she had scored on an awkward memory pia wondered how that scene had worked out probably it hadnt gotten beyond the hand holding stage but maybe that was enough for now they passed a small creature like a squirrel with pearly gray fur perched on a bright spot of stone its little chin held high thats so cute pia said i wonder it it would let me stroke it dont touch it justin said alarmed thats a chinchilla a chinchilla their fur is no it feeds on chili powder and cools whatever it touches sometimes greatly see the ice around it now she realized that the stone was actually ice just as well she hadnt touched the pretty creature but they had already left it behind and were coming up on another creature that looked almost like a dog but not quite what is that laika justin replied dont touch it either they bite when afraid like a yes thats its nature to be like a familiar creature so that no one will hurt it then they passed a region of balls some were bobbing up and down while others were bashing back and forth the vertical ones are bowling balls justin explained thc are very courteous the horizontal ones are not nice at all they are sockher balls indeed one came zooming at pia ust missing her and striking the side of the boat and rebounding it had tried to sock her she was glad they were now m the boat instead of afoot this could have been an awkward region to cross the boat reached the water and splashed into it the isle of talents was in sight it looked as serene and innocent as ever which showed how islands were not to be trusted para ducks vas much taster than she and edsel had been in the other boat and soon they were at the isle now how arc we going to handle this pia asked justin and i cant atiord to touch the isle breanna said seriously well have to wait here on the boat and para shouldnt touch either he might lose his ability to float so youll have to go ashore on your own get good talents return teller and come back here pia nodded that makes sense but wont you folk be bored wailing out here sure so maybe well hold hands breanna justin said blushing they wont be bored edsel murmured how about you and i forget it she wasnt mad at him she just wanted to maintain control he was ever the opportunist anyway this was hardly the time the boat drew up to a rock beside the water edsel stepped onto it feeling his talent change then braced himself and held out his hand to steady pia they walked to the interior searching tor the tellers pedestal before we leave it we had better make sure we have good talents pia reminded him he brought out the teller whats my talent you can modify deflect other folks talents thats woith saving pia said yeah i guess so she took the teller what m talent you ean speak things real what does that mean but ol eourse the thing didnt anser i guess youll ust hae to try it to find out bdsel said unhelp tullv what am going to dospeak of a mountain of chocolate a mound appeared before them it was a small mountain of chocolate she reached out and broke off a piece to taste it was delicious but now ie used up the talent she said regretfully i cant speak anything else real sorr about that he said breaking olf a chunk ot chocolate for himself frustrated she addressed the teller again whats my talent to put wings on anything she considered how useful might that be tin not sure edsel said theres no guarantee they could make anything fly take a person for example put wings on him and he wouldnt be able to fly because he would not have the muscle or the balance or the experience she trusted his logic very well throw this one away she looked around spied a rock and willed it to have wings wings sprouted evidently startled the rock flapped them wildly it sailed up into the air and flew away then again i could be wiong edsel said now he tells me she muttered but she doubted she would haxc wanted to keep that particular talent anyway whats mv talent to know what is inimical that will do she said i wont invoke it now if justms right once we gel off the isle without the teller our talents will stay yes lets do it before we lose them they found the pedestal and set the teller on it this time it stayed the walked carefully back never jumping in due course the reached the rock there was the boat a little wa out justin and breanna were sitting in it embracing actually she seemed to be sitting on his lap and one of each of their hands was out of sight thcv ate making progiess pia murmuied foi sure he agreed smiling that little girl could hold m hand anvtime oh pia inquired dangerously look fiayou said we should be dating out ot course i wouldnt touch breanna because she belongs to justin but someone else he shrugged he had a point if they were going to divorce they needed to be trying other relationships sorry youre right you can hold hands with someone else how about a nude nymph he was testing her if you can catch her you can have her she masked it but he had succeeded in making her faintly uneasy he had always been faithful to her and it wasnt comfortable to give him leave to be otherwise they waved to the boat and it paddled in pia braced against edsel and stepped in first then he followed the boat moved out so what talents do you two have breanna asked eagerly knowing whats inimical pia said modifying or deflecting other talents edsel said these are useful talents justin said you should have seen the one that got away pia said t made a mountain of chocolate and you left it behind breanna wailed not entirely edsel said producing a big chunk breanna took it i loe chocolate especially black chocolate she broke off a section she has a fondness for all things black justin remarked he glanced at her so do i now breanna looked at him so does that mean you want me or the chocolate both are surely delicious she nodded correct answer she broke off a piece tor him then gave the main mass back to edsel this is supper i think edsel said so we dont have to stop to look tor a pie tiee they pitched in demolishing the chocolate but wed better test our talents pia said to verify and make sure they dont fade she looked around anything maybe dangerous around deep waters usually dangerous if there arent mermaids in it breanna said pia dipped her finger in the water it tingled almost painfully she jerked it oul a big blue fish snapped at the spot her hand had just been loan shark breanna said theyll take an arm and a leg il you let them i see pia said shaken my talent did warn me though do you still have it edsel asked well i hope so she paused gazing at her finger ohyou mean the talent that too she brought her hand near the water it didnt tingle im not feeling anything she said alarmed there may be no danger now justm said but suppose there is and my talents not working that is an excellent consideration pias eoneern for her talent overrode her caution she lowered her hand and touched the water nothing happened there was no shark but after a moment the tingle started she pulled her hand out and saw a dark shape glide by below its working she said relieved but why doesnt the shark go after the duck feet i think paras feet arc magically protected breanna said he goes everywhere een the deep sea and his feet never get in trouble how do i test my talent edsel asked i dont think should try to mess with any ot yours a sensible caution justm agreed there should be opportunity to experiment in due course so lets get the bleep on back to the enchanted path pia said i want to be able to relax justin frowned it is now neanng dusk even with this fine transportation it will require several hours to pick our way through the jungle and it will not be safe at night we would do better to find a place to camp and make the return trip by daylight i like traveling by night breanna said you are competent by night he said in more than one sense but we others are not we would blunder and bring danger on our heads she nodded sometimes i miss m das of solitary wandering oka lets lind somewhere sale to camp i have an idea justin said howeei ou may not agree xone of contention breanna shot two glances at pia and edsel hes usually not fooling when he says something like that wed better hear it though pia said curious we could explore that dark castle pia felt a shock youre right i dont like it whats your reason breanna asked him the phantom who led the two of them astray did not try to hurt them the path did not lead to a tangle tree or dragons lair this suggests that the intention was not necessarily inimical and we can check inimical pia said catching on yes it might be that there is something of interest to us at the end of that path with our collected talents we could try it breanna said and back off in a hurry if it looks bad but the castles gone edsel said il should reappear at the crack of night justin said edsel shrugged if it does lets try it its not nearly as scary to me now that you folk are here pia agreed the boat earned them rapidly toward the region of the castle as dusk loomed they passed a piza pie tree wed better harvest some of those ior supper breanna said we can eat as we travel they paused and took a harvest break and rest stop pia looking for suitable bushes discovered a low wall or ledge just the right height for sitting on so on her return she sat on itand suddenly all the knowledge in the world seemed to flood into her head alarmed she jumped up and ran back to join the others somethingsomething she gasped soon the others were looking at the wall justm sat cautiously on it why this is a knowledge he said it provides much knowledge to anyone who applies his posterior a seat of learning edsel said exactly i must mark its location so we can return when we need further education meanwhile breanna was exploring the other end of the wall theres a window in it she called itouch they ran to join her that is a window pain justin said made from bad tempered glass probably shattered in its childhood it hurts anyone who touches it pipks anthony tell me about it breanna said holding her hand but she was not injured then with a boatful of assorted pizza pies and several warm blankets and pillows they rode on does para need to eat pia asked not that i know of breanna said she tapped the side of the boat hey parawant a pizza there was no response other than a slight weaving from side to side that seemed to be an answer and as the sky craeked closed shutting out the light the castle reappeared there it is pia said perversely glad to be vindicated theres the glow marking the path too is the path inimical justin asked pia reached out toward it no if my talent is working the boat got on the path and turned toward the castle soon the structure loomed large it was on the top of a low hill with a tiled stone avenue leading up to it got to be illusion breanna decided nothing solid could disappear so quickly but why would anyone go to the trouble pia asked thats what makes us curious breanna said its too much trouble just to gobble someone beware justin said those tiles are gobble stones i hope thats meant to be funny pia said nervously the boat halted at the edge of the tiled surface duck feet didnt want to be gobbled either no that is really their type but they do not seem to be active at the moment does your talent indicate malignancy no but im not quite sure my talent is working breanna looked around theres a snooping dmomite she said test it on that pia looked i dont see anything but darkness oh i forgetyou cant see in blackness here ill lead you to it breanna jumped out of the boat but just exactly what is a dmomite a reptile that blows up when annoyed but dont worry we wont annoy it were just checking your talent pia reluctantly climbed out of the boat and followed the black girl to the side there were no glowing stones or fungi here so she would have been lost by herselt here breanna said putting out a hand to stop hei heat its breathing there was a sound like the crackle of a burning fuse yes reach toward it pia reached toward the sound her hand began to tingle its inimical she said for sure so your talent works yes but its asleep breanna said i can see its eyes closed anyway it wouldnt explode just tor two innocent girls she backed away guiding pia so what would it do if it woke it would merely chew us up and swallow us what a relief pia said but her attempt at irony was lost amidst her shuddering breanna had a nervy way of testing a talent so now cheek those stones again just to be sure pia reached toward the path there was no tingle she touched a stone it was inert no problem she said relieved they got back into the boat and the duck feet waddled forward the stones remained inert conjecture that the stones become active only when there is a threat to the castle justin said we are obviously no threat most castles are capable ol defending themselves when there is need even illusion castles edsel asked evidently so he paused but it just occurs to me that it the castle is illusion so might be the approach those are probably not real gobble stones merely the semblance of them thais right breanna said youre so smart justin the man shrugged pleasantly embarrassed pia was faintly envious those two got along so well despite their inexperience in romance breanna turned to edsel you said that phantom knew your names knew my name edsel said and yours because she emulated you but maybe not pia or justins i think i mentioned them first knew i was supposed to be your companion breanna said so you would do what i said if i said it was an emergency maybe that was about all it needed yes should have been more alert piers am mm how could you know we should have been more alert but we were too busy holding hands which was a technique pia had suggested so she might have brought it on herself anyway we followed the spook it was a oneway path when ve got suspicious we couldnt go back and oneway paths arent common justm said there is formidable magic here meanwhile the boat was climbing the easy slope of the hill it was too dark to tell but there seemed to be pleasant gardens surrounding the castle pias talent gave no tingle this was not a hostile place yet its mystery remained why had they been lured here they reached the huge front gate of the castle the stones of its construction were outlined in faint glow brcanna jumped out of the boat and approached the gate she touched it her hand passed through sure enough it was illusion then the girl walked into the illusion and disappeared dont go alone justm cried pained its okay breanna called back through the seeming wood and stone i can see clearly wed better follow her edsel said the boat moved slowly forward the prow disappeared and then the rest of the cratt as it moved on through pia was in the center she flinched as the closed gate came at her but the passage was painless the thing about illusion was that she couldnt feel it inside the castle was lighted they were in a long hall leading to a large chamber breanna was ahead approaching that room pia felt no hint of danger this was jusl an inanimate structure illusion that it was but what on earth for the boat walked along the hall decorative statues of people and things lined it and there were a number of plants too this was a nice building for all that it didnt really exist but what was its purpose i see a thyme being juslin said perhaps it is just as well that it is illusion just what is a time being pia asked it is a creature who occupies a patch of thyme plants and is immune to their temporal influence people will come to leave offerings in order to obtain the beings help with their problems of time sometimes they have too much sometimes too little the being can fix that they entered the chamber it was enormous with tall arches and a xom or contention dome over the center the floor was clear laid out in diminishing circles of stone in the very center was what looked like a large manhole cover with a ring in the center they stopped here looking down at it this appears to be an illusion intended to call attention to a subterranean cavity justin said then lets explore breanna said justin and edsel took hold of the ring and pulled upward slowly it came lifting a hinged circular panel below it was a set of faintly glowing steps leading down into the ground this then is the reality beneath the illusion edsel said the whole path and castle are designed to bring folk to this spot i just wish i knew why it is certainly a curiosity justin agreed it seems furthermore that it was you it wanted brought here because the phantom knew your name it couldnt have known me from mundania edsel said it must have listened as we walked and picked it up does it occur to you boys that the fastest way to find out is to head on down these steps breanna inquired suppose the manhole cover slams down sealing us in pia asked nervously let me try my talent edsel said maybe i can modify its magic if it has any so that it cant do that he inspected the lid but this doesnt seem to be magic it has no catch it cant seal us in unless someone slides a block over it pia said who would want to do that justin inquired i dont know i just dont trust this business of going underground they considered maybe one of us should remain here breanna said i would not recommend that justm demurred but perhaps if we divided into two parties it would be secure which couple goes breanna asked which stays we cant let them go alone justin said we are their companions we must not let them get separated from us again but then how can we make two parties she asked split the other way edsel answered breanna and i can go down while pia and justin keep the rear guard the other three considered that surprised they sent a glance around then a nod traveled the same route but pia had a qualification i can check for whats inimical so i should go where there might be something bad so juslin and i should go down for sure breanna agreed well watch tor stray monsters of the night pia set fool on the top step there was no tingle she tried the next it was clear she moved slowly down into the ground this was like heading into u subway station so would there be a train down there justm followed her down equally cautious watch yourself with that sixteen year old creature breanna called after him pia smiled she had forgotten she had her teen figure back she was sixteen physically so was breanna justm however seemed flustered he was not used to such byplay having been a tree for so long they reached the bottom a passage led past the base of the stairway so they could go either left or right both sides were lighted pia looked at justin does it make a difference neither direction seems dangerous this is curious he remarked it was a oneway path that brought you here yet now there seems to be a choice well lets try one direction and if it doesnt work well try the other that seems sensible he agreed they bore left the passage widened forming an alcove in it was a picture or a display it showed mountains covered in ice there are icy mountains in xanth pia asked intrigued there are justin agreed i am not clear which range this would be but the scene has an aspect of authenticity she peered more closely theres something about this scene i thought it was a painting but it seems three dimensional it must be a model rather than just paint like a museum exhibit a museum thats a place where things are shown often in naturalistic settings so the people can sec them without having to travel to the ends of the world but whats a museumtype setting doing here under an illusion castle this perplexes me also i must confess i am having difficulty making sense of any of this xomf cumintion pia poked a linger at the scene she touched the nearest mountain and her finger passed through it its illusion she exclaimed why so it is he agreed no wonder it is so realistic i had assumed that the illusion stopped at the surface of the ground this is weird it certainly seems to be here for us to see but whats the point i confess the point eludes me lets go on i sort of like mysteries so long as theyre not dangerous they walked on along the gently curving hall soon it formed another alcove with another scene this was of the mountains again but now much of the ice and snow was gone a river coursed away into the distance pia touched it this too was illusion but it was also fine art whoever made this really knew how to make a scene she said i agree i have a certain appreciation for nature having been a natural creature for much ol my life this is extremely well crafted we are all natural creatures pia said why that is true he agreed surprised i meant to say i know what you meant to say and i agree this person really knows his stuff indubitably pia discovered that she was getting to like this archaic man he was a gentleman in the classic sense they moved on and came to a third exhibit this was of a lowlands scene with rolling hills and valleys it was largely forested with many odd trees what are those she asked pointing to several grossly fattrunked growths beerbarrel trees their trunks contain beer they are rather popular in some circles you mean people get drunk in xanth she asked surprised some do i confess i do not understand what they see in such activity you never drink i drink water of course or one of the myriad flavors of soda from lake tsoda pop or milk or boot rear simitar but i would not care for an intoxicant me neither she said actually she had had her flings back when she had really been sixteen but it had complicated her diabetes and she had learned better that goes double for bos i wont go near one whos drinking because hes sure to get ideas ideas of what nature of a sexual nature oh he seemed embarrassed lovely man then she saw a small figure half hidden behind one of the fat trees oh look she exclaimed delighted it seems to be a little man or an elf or fair he peered more closely no i think none of these i dont believe i recognie the type its a leprechaun pia said really i have never seen one before maybe they are confined to this particular forest in xunth their range is very limited in mundania too to ireland i think ire land are they bad tempered no just ery shy they walked on to the next exhibit this scene was the same as the prior one except that there were some ponds in the low sections pia looked at justin does this mean anything to you the exhibit is very nicely done but apart from that i see no special significance perhaps this is after a heavy rainfall they moved on to the next exhibit in the gallery this was the same scene but with several of the ponds linking into a lake it was an attractive view but some trees were being overtaken by the water the bases of their trunks were covered the leprechaun was back and looking worried i guess im not one to make judgments pia said but maybe this is too much of a good thing i mean ponds and lakes are fine but this was regular land i agree it is painful for me to see trees suffer the next scene showed a still larger lake and several of the trees were dead if this is meant to be uplifting justin said it is not so for me lets move on they did soand came to the steps to the surface we have completed a circuit justin said amazed i was so taken with the exhibits that didnt realize me neithei so its one big loop six illusion pictures of two scenes and thats it i fear i still do not understand the rationale pia agreed maybe im too bleeping suspicious but i cant believe that this is all there is do you think its a test or something a test he asked blankly to imd out just how smart we are see if we have the wit to figure out the real situation i suppose that could be the case i confess feel rather unintelligent at this stage pia realized that edsel probably could have figured it out he was good at puzzles she wanted to prove that she could figure out something on her own before appealing to him for help there must be something were missing we have to prove were smart enough to figure it out this may indeed be a challenge but my mind is not apt at such riddles lets see we made a loop and saw six exhibits theyre in a big circle could there be something inside that circle that seems to be a fair possibility but i saw no access to it right no tunnels going anywhere just those illusion pictures then she had a bright ideaand was amazed to see a light bulb form and hash about two feet before and above her face you have a bright notion justin said yes she said recovering from her surprise these pictures are illusion right so theyre not solid there could be something behind them behind them i should think merely the wall how do we know there could be another passage we wouldnt see it because it would be covered by the illusion why i believe you are correct it is certainly possible so lets go look she forged on toward the first of the exhibits justin followed actually there could be other passages from this one covered by illusion but your notion is certainly viable they reached the snowy mountain view pia reached into it the snow wasnt cold there was no sensation and no tingle of danger she lifted a foot and stepped into it as her head enteied the illusion she became blind there was nothing but fog in view she backed out and the passage reappeared im not breanna i cant seen in the dark that scares me mean suppose theres a pit and a pendulum a pendulum ho piers anthony neer mind what i mean is that there could be something dangerous in there maybe not inimical bul not good to go into blind like a dropoff because folk arent expected to walk through the illusions anyway it makes me distinctly nervous a sobering prospect justin agreed it may be unfortunate we lack a rope so that we could protect ourselves from a possible fall yes pia remained unwilling to give up on it but what else uas there to do then a second bulb flashed clothing i beg your pardon we could knot our clothes together to make a rope maybe not a long one but maybe enough i saw that trick in a movie once a what never mind lets try it am airaid i dont he was truly diffident which was one big reason she felt free to try it we take off our clothes and tie them end to end to make a crude rope one of us can hold it while the other goes ahead so there wont be a fall why i suppose that could work but she understood his reticence you feel it would be bad to see each other naked that is a matter of concern he confessed youve seen it before havent you i beg your pardon you have seen breanna nude well yes actually technically on occasion she has insisted on bathing in my presence but tin much the same only a different color anyway well be in illusion so wont see much for long lets do it we dont want the others to worry because were taking too long she found she was enjoying this it was a kind of adventure she was rather proud of her restored body too i suppose that is true perhaps breanna would understand sure she will maybe too well but pia did not find it necessary to say that she pulled off her blouse and stood in her bra justins eyes bulged dangerously but he managed to squeee them back into shape that didnt bother her at all she liked making an impression especially when it was risk free he visibly nerved himself and iemoed his own shirt xom of comi thi pia stepped out of her skirt justin froze he didnt move at all after a moment she inquired justin arc you all right he didnt answer he just stood there his eyes glazing over then she realized he had freaked out she had overdone it forgetting about the magic effect a girls panties had on men in xanth what was she to do they needed all their outer clothing to make the rope but if he couldnt function while her sknt was oil that wouldnt work she remembered something breanna had said nymphs ran nude all the lime and didnt freak out men though they did attract consideiable attention so would justin unfreakout if she went all the wa naked maybe so but she did not care to risk it even il it worked her purpose could be misunderstood she did not want to make an enemv of breanna so what else was there maybe she could hide her lower body under the illusion then he would be all right until they were through once they were through they could dress again that seemed to be the best course she walked into the picture centering on one of the mountains the floor seemed level beneath the picture her footing was firm she could see the illusion up to her waist now she called again to him justin he blinked and his eyes lost their glaze i heg pardon i must have been thinking of something else what were we doing he had no awareness of the freakout she would not enlighten him we were getting out of our clothing so we could knot it into a rope i tried stepping in and it seems okay how about you take oil your trousers justin got out of his trousers he stood there somewhat blankly okay now lets tie them pia said she suspected that though her bra was not freaking him out it was having some effect so he needed to be guided it would probably be best not to lean forward she rathei liked this aspect of xanth now that she was working through it it gave a woman control of a situation he knotted the clothing together securel and had a clumsy kind of rope now give me one end she said and follow me through the illusion pia held on to one end and stepped dcepet into the scene jusiin clung to he othei end bracing in case he had to take her weight suddenly her face entered a higher mountain it was like walking into pea soup tog she could nol see her tree hand two feet hetore her eyes but the tooting remained firm and that was what counted suddenly she was out ot the fog and standing behind the illusion scene she saw the hacks ot the mountains and glacieis then the rope went slack and juslin stepped out of the scene now it was his jaw that went slack as he troe in place oh that again well they were safely through and there had been no pitall pia unknotted the clothing and slipped her skirt back on justin she said he returned to animation was i woolgathering again i must be more tiied than i thought no problem we are through the illusion without trouble so can put our things back on she handed him his tiousers to be sure he put on pants and shirt while pia put on her rumpled shirt she wondered idly why there was no similar efiect on women the sight of his underpants hadnt freaked her out at all maybe women were simply more sensible or maybe they had better assets she could see it either way preferably both ways now they considered what next there was another passage opening out to either side behind the picture probably an inner ring servicing the six settings but was that all they walked around the ring seeing the settings from the rear that was all suspect that we have not yet fathomed the riddle justin said i agree there must be more but maybe we hae established that this is a safe place to spend the night should we return to the others justin asked hopetully pia was tempted but uncertain how can we be sure this is sate without a rear guard until we know more about who set it up and why alas i fear you are correct but maybe we should let them know we are working on it yes he agreed eagerly they walked through the icy mountain scene not making the rope now that they knew it was safe soon they mounted the steps it seems safe pia said but theres more to check can you tolk hold on a while longer sure edsel said breannas fascinating hes just teasing pia whispered to justin he does that oh ot couise okay pia called we should be done soon they returned to the mountain image and walked through it to the inner passage pia walked along it checking the outei wall while justin checked the mnei wall looking lor illusionmasked passages there weie none maybe the ceiling pia asked justin looked up j fear it is just beyond ni reach and mine certainly she said tor he was substantially taller than she but could check it it you lifted me i suppose i could do that he said doubtfully she had a notion why you dont want to pick up a girl whos not breanna it would seem too inendly this is an accurate observation well you could carry me without picking me up i dont understand let me ride on your shoulders oh he seemed not wholly relieved we do have a job to do she reminded him he squatted down beside the wall and she mounted his shoulders putting her legs down in tront you clasp my knees so my hands are free to reach up he rose to his feet somewhat unsteadily putting his hands on her knees she in turn clasped his neck with her thighs her dread panties were now in contact with his head but he couldnt see them so didnt freak out it was possible to get around some ol xanths magical effects she realized he walked and she teached sliding her ringers along the smooth ceiling it was solid throughout no illusion covered it when they completed the circuit they knew that the had failed squat down so i can dismount she told him justin just stood there or lean oei so i can jump down she said he did not react what was the matter couldnt he heai her she realied that he hadnt said a word since they started the ceiling search then she caught on her panties were against his ears close enough so that he could hear their faint lustlmg they had freaked out his hearing piiks aiuot she edged her hands down to cover his cars breaking the contact get down she said loudly enough to he heard through the barrier cerlainlv he got down and she climbed oft well we hacnt gotten tar she said theie just doesnt seem to he anwail a minute ve didnt cheek the pictures there could he a passage there perhaps so he agieed though he sounded wearv they entered the mountain scene again this time checking the side walls there as nothing thev went to the next scene and checked similarly nothing tin getting depressed pia said but wed hettet check the test they checked the next three and found nothing one more failure and they would be done resigned pia entered the hooded sceneand found a gap in hei wall justin she shrieked ic found it he made his wa to her and felt the wall dear girl you are correct he said there is an apeiturc it was about head height on her justm boosted her up and she cradled into it in a moment she was beyond the illusion and saw that she was in a short tunnel leading gradually down the sides oi it glowed faintly so she wasnt blind gie me a moment to get clear then follow she called back she needed that moment because she was on her hands and knees and he ould treak out if she didnt get her panlies out of sight first my hands seem to hae gone numb he said the must have touched her panties during the boost this was multimedia magic flex your fingers she called theyll recover in a moment she reached the base oi the curve and the tunnel debouched into another full sied passage below okav come on she called justin scrambled into the tunnel and crawled down toward her soon he stood beside her this ceitamly seems to he an avenue he agreed looking aiound it must pass under the inner passage going toward the center of the circles that would seem to be where the answer to out question lies yes lets find it then we can tell the others and maybe tmally get oui nights rest that would he eminently salisfactoiv the passage sloped downward and at the base theie was watei it wasnt illusion it seemed to be ground water that had seeped in and flooded the floor it wasnt deep they sloshed through it and come out the other side thev came to a large chamber whose ceiling was supported by a number of thick columns the columns were square rather than round the chamber seemed to be curved in fact it was like the two passages circling around a huge central pillar this was the true center of the establishment what s this place pia asked impressed by its magnitude why i suspect these are square roots justin said awed cube roots more accurately and that this must be a tree a tree a very large very special tree in fact i believe this is the coventree the what it is largely isolated from the regular forests but has remarkable properties i know of it only hy reputation but believe the identification is secure this would be its root system pia looked around with a new appreciation all these columns roots and the center is the main root so its a big tree so what the coentree has the power of illusion were it human it would perhaps rival the sorceress iris in that respect that explains why we did not see it in the light ol day its enormous upper girth was concealed hy illusion but because it is vegetable it is not considered to be a magician still it is a plant well worthy of respect by other plants maybe she agreed cynically other trees but then she made a connection you were a tree for a long time thats why you relate true i have learned appreciation for the way of trees yet by what coincidental chance i should find myself here escapes me another bulb flashed over her head that spook who called us this wayit was you it really wanted me maybe it couldnt reach you duectly so it lured us instead knowing you would follow because you understand trees you relate dear girl i believe you ate correct everything was illusion including the copy of breanna except the pathand maybe the other plants cooperated to make that to get us hereand ou here and now youre here but wh would an important tree like this want my presence maybe vou should ask u but i cant just ask a tiee something trees dont speak not even this one that spook ho lured us spoke but pia reconsidered it didnt say anything meaningful just about danger and hurrying like a recording no intelligence there tiees dont really understand human dialogue was a man betore vas a tree it took me some lime to learn the was ol trees and think it ould take longer tor a tree to learn the was of people so doubt that the coventree would be able to speak to me or anyone in intelligible terms that is simply not its nature but you do understand its nature she said warmlv better than any other human being so it must want to talk to you justin considered i think more likely it simply wants my understanding but of what this is a puzzle pia said edsel could figure it out better than could but maybe can get it this whole placethe castle the tunnel rings the picturesthe must all be part of it something to understand to figure out just as we figured the way to get in here but why would a tree set riddles because thats the only way it can communicate you said it cant talk it doesnt understand dialogue but it must have some reason to tell you something you just have to figure out what it is justin considered you must be correct that is the way a tree would do it but what message could there be in a phantom castle thats just to mark the place so we couldnt miss it i thought that was obvious all along but the picturesit didnt want us to get bevond them until we had truly figured them out think the pictures are the message she remembered how their companions software back in mundama wouldnt let folk sec the pia guide without clothing until they had demonstrated master over the subject matter this could be similar in egetable fashion but the are taken as a whole revolting that rising waterperhaps mobile animals like it but it is not good tor trees rising water she echoed justinthat could be it it cant be it no tree would want its roots hooded out the tunnel hereits flooded at the low point it suielv wasnt that way when it was built the waters rising here too just as it is in the pictures and thats not good juslin stared at her this m it he agieed amazed the water is rising and drowning out the trees and nobody cares but the trees and the leprechauns who must have helped with the excavation of this gallery yes of course and with the cralting ol the pictures something shifted inside her and the chamber seemed to change color do you know justin all my life ive been a selfish brat and its never made me happy now suddenly i sec a way to do something unselfish i want to save those trees but no one can we know whats happening the snows in the mountains are melting and flowing to the vallev and its flooding and drowning out the trees they cant slop it because theyre immobile the leprechauns probably cant go to ihe cold mountains but maybe we can thats why coventree wanted to bring you here so you would understand because you of all people relate to trees and do something before its too late and i want to help you maybe it will be the one truly decent thing do in my life but youre mundane you have to return to mundania yes so i guess wed better hurry and get this done belore i leave xanth i suppose if you insist he said dubiously but this problem may have no ready resolution the forces of nature may be intractable there must be a way to handle it or the coventree wouldnt have asked for help we just have to figure out how now lets go tell the others but they may not agree yes they will how can you be certain of that because edsel will do it if ask him fo and with the two ot us in it you two companions have to tag along to make sure we dont get in trouble we cant handle you seem truly determined i truly am this is mv one chance pllrs athon he nodded i that case i feel free to say that i am very much in accord the thought of trees suffering unnecessarily is intolerable to me and wish to do all that i can to alleviate their distress why didnt you say so before because it was not my province to direct your tour of xanth on to facilitate it a mission like this is well beyond the parameters of my assignment let me see if i have it straight she said you couldnt ask it but you can support it exactly youre so archaically ethical that you couldnt even hint at what you wanted true think its a pleasure to know you justm maybe the decade will come when ill be able to be like that but right now im simply not up to it i have to go for what i want i would not presume to criticize your policy can see what breanna likes in you he smiled abashedly then you are able to perceive this more clearly than i can she is such a wonderful girl but i am ordinary there are times when it is all i can do to avoid he hesitated touching her pia considered he evidently didnt realize that she and edsel knew about this he hadnt touched breanna technically she had held his hands i think shes more touchable than you think but she is too young pia flush with the joy of her decision to do something truly decent for a change realized that there was a bit more she could do justin things have changed in the last century in xanth as well as mundania okay so maybe the adult conspiracy stops you from going all the way yet but there is an inbetween stage and you should pass through it before the conspiracy ends so youre not caught flat fooled as it were when the time comes i mean you dont climb a mountain in one giant step do you you do it in easy stages i suppose that could be the case i confess that breanna surprised me phenomenally the other night however so now its our turn to surprise her shell appreciate it believe me she will surprise her pia considered then changed the subject lor a moment okay lets go tell the others she paused but dont tell them this dont this she put her arms around him hauled his face down and kissed him soundly on the mouth he stood hallway stunned i ah and when you do that to her she continued not yet bieaking the embrace do this too im afiaid i dont understand she caught his right hand and cupped it in her left hand she carried it around behind her this she squeezed his hand making his fingers gently pinch her left buttock he did not quite freak out but it was a close call she put his limp hand back by his side and stepped away from him then she led him back toward the entrance they had work to do xonl ofcontintiov modemode i n the morning nimby and chlorine struggled with new mundane clothing and helped each other look presentablethey went downstairs just as their companions arrived to guide them through breakfast now we need to show you how to ride the lemon dug said but first maybe wed better tackle the modemode the what chlorine asked the gigagrid it goes by various names and nicknames it covers the world but you need a modem to access it so we call it the modem mode or mode m mode or modemode three syllables we met you there in the ozone of the magic mesh address of the mundane mega mesh or mmm of the grid i realize its confusing at first but it does make sense in its fashion once you get the hang of it zonemeshgridmode chlorine said working it out all steps of a stairway yes dug said mdmdmmminmoonebreanna thats where we found you now we need to be sure vou know the way back because if you should ever be in trouble thats your escape route you can reach it from any modem not just this one so you can travel anywhere in mundama and switch back when you have to no need to do it from this site but the mesh is fun in its own right and you might as well enoy it so we figure to take you in for the checkin then gie you a small tour of the modemode they went in chlorine sat m pias seat and nimby in edsels with kim and dug standing behind them for guidance chlorine followed the labyrinth picking out the letters on the keyboard invoking the modem spell which was associated with something called a browser and a provider then m d m d and on she had to give pias identity and pias password insulin before being granted admission when she got to the magic mesh there she was in the familiar hall and there was nimby with her breanna wasnt in her leaf but they left their checkin message probably she hadnt made it in yet because there were fewer mesh connections in xanth and breanna might have forgotten about the ear but nimby and chlorine had done their part the message would respond automatically when the others checked in the magic of the oxone would see to that kirn made chlorine go back to the screen and keyboard in the house then to the magic mesh again making sure she knew the route dug did the same with nimby then they went exploring elsewhere in the mesh the browser enables you to go places kim explained we use exscrape and mundania inline inline you have to wait in line often sometimes you cant get in at all but they still charge you plenty lets go to a babble box a what its a place where people can meet and talk on the grid friendships are made there romances flourish and fights occur its a lot of fun in fact many people are ensnared in it dug added typing their lives away they cant leave babbling has become their lives chlorine wasnt sure about mundane fun or living but went along after all anyone who put eye to gourd peephole in xanth was similarly caught until someone else broke the connection folk simply had to learn to be careful i know what youre thinking dug said and youre right theres even a through the gourd home leaf kim guided her to lumber on to a gigagrid alternating babble or gab where the gabbing occurred they went to gabfest and merged she had to assume a persona and decided on poison because ot her magic talent oi poisoning water the interaction was in the form of words on the screen kim had to reach in and type tor her because she could not do it iast enough she signed the guestbook and it started poison someone called fun gus typed lol that means laughing out loud kim said youd better come back with some clever rejoinder well i do it only to water chlorine replied with kirns help you pee in water oh hes one of thoe kim said with disgust change the subject chlorine did whats your talent i make things fun gus replied how old are you watch it kim warned hes a prowler but chlorine answered twenty two that vas pias age why do you want to know how about a date dont get too friendly with this predator kim said im out of dates will you accept a pineapple lmfao never mind that that means kim said dump him no i want to know she typed lmfao a picture appeared it showed one donkey mounting another but the one below was laughing so hard that the other was falling off oh donkeys chlorine said she had liked them ever since nimby first appeared to her in the form of a dragon with a donkey head but i still dont understand what theyre doing never mind kim said urgently break off this dialogue a new name appeared moon shine hi poison i make women look better in the full moon is this creep bothering you dont butt in fertilizer face gus typed angrily fertilizer isnt exactly the word he typed kim said the babble box automatically translates any objectionable terms no this is interesting chlorine replied how about going priv for modering gus inquired dont do it kim said what does it mean going privatethat is to some other chamber where others arent watchingfor modem sex modem what where you talk dirty to each other haing pretend sex the grid is clogged with dirty old men of all ages who want to get their verbal or written hands on young mesh thats what you are chlorine considered but its not real is it i mean its just talk talk can lead to desire for the real thing that can put marriages in peril i dont think nimby would appreciate your doing that with someone else i suppose not how do i end this ill do it kim typed rapidly no thanks go do it with your laughing donkey thats telling him moon shine said approvingly you wouldnt like him irl whats that in real life kim said now lets move on nice meeting you moon kim typed thanks for rescuing this newbie newbie new to the babble box thats why gus was hitting on you none of the rcgs will touch him regs regular folk of this region but i dont think we will need to come here again youve seen how it works i like it youre right its fun they exited the mesh and the grid and were back in the house dug and nimby came from the other room that was some dialogue you had dug said i recognized kirns touch she doesnt like mesh moochers true kim said if they want it so bad let them pay through the nose for phone sex through the its expensne kim said frowning now its time for the lemon dug said nimby i mean ed ou seem to catch on quite rapidly do you think you can handle a two wheeled machine after i demonstrate it nimby nodded purs anihonv they cnt to the garage vhere the machine lurked it looked like halt a eai dug wheeled il out and bestrode it this is edsels lemon motorcycle here is how you start it he said he pushed with his toot and the motor came ahe this is how it moves he started it moving and it carried him down the drive and onto the road beyond he looped around and returned to the house then dug had nimbv get behind him and the two rode off discussing the ways oi the motorcycle ed and pia tide all oxer on that thing kirn said i dont feel easy on one of those monsters but maybe youll like it bettei it doesnt look worse than riding a dragon chlorine said after a time the motorcycle returned sure enough nimby was now in front and seemed to be handling it competently your turn kim murmured oh couldnt make it work chlorine said your turn to ride in back kim clarified to make sure all is well dug got oft and chlorine got on behind nimby the machine started moving the ride was different from that ot a dragon but she found she could handle it she put her arms around nimby s waist and enjoyed the ride they went out on the road and gained speed the wind took her hair she was amazed at the velocity this was faster than a dragon they slowed she saw that it was because oi a red light that hung above an intersection nimby had learned the rules of the road i like this she said as they resumed motion they returned to the house where dug and kim waited we can handle it chlorine called theres one other thing you should know about on the mesh kim said xanth is there the oxone chlorine agreed no this is an emulation xanth not magical it consists ot a group of people who assume xanlhly personae much as the folk in the babble boxes have nicknames only their names are limited to xanth folk oh chlorine asked do they have any real connection to their xanth counterparts they had agreed not to refer to xanth by name but this did not seem feasible in practice and mabc it didnt mattei thev like to think so but i dont think theies any solid evidence that they do come on ill take you there and you can meet yourscll but theres only one ol me chlorine said not quite pleased kim smiled you were not in mundama to preempt the name so she got it but be assured that she means you no harm i ust dont think ou should challenge her about the name because ou are here anonymously youll have to assume some other xanth name to enter the xanth xone this is ridiculous dug stepped in think of it this way xanth natives have the infinite privilege ot actually living in xanth mundanes arc stuck forever in drear mundania this is one of the few wavs they can relate to get at least the trace of a notion what it might be like to be among the blessed can you begrudge them that faint fond illusion chlorine glanced at kim he has a certain talent for persuasion i had suspected that kim said with hve eighths of a smile i think thats why i married him well you started it dug told her when ou kissed me oh you always bring that up she flared with eleven sixteenths of a smile yeah i bet you dont dare do it again you lose kim kissed dug hard and long they finally broke i dont think i lost he said with the remaining five sixteenths of the smile thats your opinion kirns expression ol mock severity made her look almost cute dug turned to chlorine so you had better be persuaded or she might kiss um chlorines conviction that she liked these mundanes was growing the fact was dug vas a handsome man while kim was an ordinary woman in appearance but they both had personality chlorine remembered her early life as a distinctly plain and less than ordinary girl before nimby had enhanced her into beaut charactei and intelligence she related to kim who clearly had made something ot herself im peisuaded lets go meet me pick a name kim said chlorine pondered who would be obscure enough to be free she remembered another poisonei a disreputable female vaguely related to the mermaids but ugly and gross no one would choose to be hei ella she said salmon ella dug laughed salmonella that ill surel do she must he a real pain in the stomach kim said quickly with mock primness close enough he agreed patting her on the bottom they went hack mime this time just chlorine with the three others watching her screen and kim giving verbal instructions they made their wa to the grid and the mesh and to the xanth xone there chlorine registered as s ella and looked up chlorine she was not there at the moment but at least she had learned how to locate her you ean try another time kim said the mesh is quite flexible or you ean leave a message for her chlorine realized belatedly that she had no idea what to say to the xone chlorine so it was just as well that she hadnt made direct contact ill try again she said she would have to think ol something suitable to explain her interest in this character but there are plenty others to chat with dug said as they exited we can go to a goo a what he laughed that stands for grid operating oubliette goo for short its an offmesh mime game where players from all over the world interact they make up their own characters and participate m an established setting where they make inends or alliances or enemies they gossip about each other or even lall in love and get married in the game sometimes they have tights to the death they stay at inns eat good or bad meals fight monstersits actually a real world for these folk maybe as real as mundama and better for them some addicts live almost entirely in their goos playing day and night without sleep but a good goo polices itself so there are no vulgar laughing donkeys to harass you is that a pun chlorine asked of course it is kim said harass as in donkev it sounded more like her ass that too kim agreed men think its funny to slip m references to female donkeys my point being that there are no female donkevs getting gooed dug said that sounds nice chlorine agreed deciding not to explore the matter of gooed lady asses how do we get there ill take you dug took ovei the keyboard ill use fishnet on m tux account hirst i have to lumber on bv giving my operatoi name dm then mv password v then when i gel to the prompt line i type the addicss iishnetaavvhatname oo that brings me to the computer where the goo is in this case origin the screen blinked and then a scene came on with a forest field and castle and here we aie he said in this realm im a dwarf ogre smarter than the aveiage ogre but not as strong its amazing how some women go lor ogres just remcmbei kim said warningl you dont know what my mergirl chaiacter is doing with men who like wet bare bosoms while youre making time with feebleminded nymphs anvway dug continued this could seem familiar because some players overlap xanth i mean an ogie mermaid can be anywhere in fantasy maybe some aie refugees from xanth for all we know ill i erne m her chlorine agreed now there are still other realms that might relate the gnd is a pretty extensive realm no i think this is enough for now chlorine decided lets focus on what nimbv wants nimby wanted to cxploie more ol the phsical mundama so the rest of the day was spent in setting up lor their vacation travel they learned about the uses and denominations of money and little cards called credit they learned about maps and motels and places to eat tomorrow they would ieall start exploring mundama at one point chlorine remembered something didnt vou have a dog kim who accompanied you to xanth when you were on the roc jury yes bubbles i found her floating in a bubble m xanth the first time i was there m the companions game and adopted her but she was old and continued to age in mundama and i knew she would die so i did what had to do and made an anangement lor her to return to xanth to be with anathe ma anathema did i imsheai kim laughed you fell tor one of the xanthly puns her name is anathe and she is a veiy nice motherly person though hoirendously uglv she liked bubbles and bubbles liked her so it just seemed better bubbles is much less likely to die m xanth because of the magic as long as she has he sense to sta clear of diagons i cried toi thice davs but of couise i was awav at college much of the time then so it was plhrs ahot better for the dog im sure shes happy now but for the moment kirn looked iead to cry again mabe some day if the business gets established well enough therell be company again in the house dug said maybe kim agreed but she did not seem to be much cheered chlorine as baffled what did this mean and why the sadness nimby touched net hand and then she understood they wanted to hae a child but somehow their signals to the stork had been ignored and there was a growing teai that something was wrong in that tespect ironically there was no question about pias ferliht but pia did not want children so dug and kim pretended that it was simply their business with the software business that held them back as they completed the preparations dug was looking increasingly thoughtful that suggested to chlorine that he had something on his mind you have thoughts she inquired well i dont want to pry into whats not my business yet as a companion i do need to know whats going on so as the better to anticipate and aoid problems especially as we travel out ot my most familiar haunts nimby glanced at him that meant that mis matter should be fol lowcd up what is your concern chlorine asked dug the real reason tor your visit to mundama but we told you chlorine said nimby just wanted to see what mundania was like and ot course the demon earth wouldnt let him dug shook his head the demons arent like that they have no human curiosity and the hardly care about territory their entire existence is wrapped up in contests with each other nimby may be learning a lot about human foibles but he wouldnt lake a risk like this without good reason chlorine rcalied that he had a point there must be more here than nimby had let on she looked at him nimb reached acioss and touched her hand then she had it straight you are correct there is moie nimb did not wanl to burden you with details ot demon interaction but since ou ask he will yes there is another demon bet and that is that nimby cant entei mundania and remain three days without being discovered and caught he has one year to make the attempt lose b default if he is discoxeied theie will be complications since the demon earth is watching the normal connec tions between their two regions nimby used a special one the oxone he is also using a mundane body turther masking his presence but does it count if hes not here in physical person kim asked oh yes because he n reall here just without his bod and most of his magic that makes him almost impossible to trace so he suffeis the privations of lack ot magic for the sake of succeeding in his endeavor and he does want to exploie mundania because he has indeed been learning human traits like curiosity they dont come naturally to him but he is studying them and this experience helps dug nodded that makes sense to me what would teveal his presence here if he did something crazy that no mundane would do that would attract attention but if the demon earth happens to look at uswell they can read our minds so he would know thats chance and the demon harlh is looking kim said yes probably routine sweeps because hes not sure nimby is here at this time but hes alert so we might make no mistakes and still get caught actually the odds of success are crafted to be about because thats the way the demons like it even odds so here is always a strong element ot uncertainly they are true gamblers dug said the risks mean nothing all they want is to win the wager nimby nodded well well do our best kim said but you know i have a question too ii its all right i dont want to be offensive and it has nothing to do with the success of this mission so so ask chlorine said we wont answer if we dont want to well i understand that the two of you now wander around xanth doing spot faors for people who dont know nimbys true nature given that nimb is who he is why should he bother chlorine smiled i can answer that without consulting with him nimb is trying to learn about all the things he never paid attention to before and he teels that mixing with ordinary lolk is the best way they think were just damsel dragon and thats fine because then they dont come asking special favors by studying the problems of folk with little or no power we learn a lot about human feeling and hope and grief so that if nimb ever wishes to go among people alone without me as a butter he will be able to do so without making mistakes but arent you worried that kirn hesitated evidently thinking hettei o the question that he will dump me as no longer useful chlorine said tor her no im not worried because even it my association with nimby ends tomorrow will be lar better oft for the wonderful experience and love he has given me in this time and of course it would be simple for him to erase all memory of him from my mind and leave me with some ordinary man who would lake good care of me i would never know the difference she glanced obliquely at nimby teasing him maybe that one we met last month rusty with the talent ol making metal rust down to any length maybe the stork would delher babies with rust colored hair as long as rustvs not gay kim said oh i would expect him to have a really gay time chlorine said inhaling on pias body this had good effect kim pursed her lips maybe we have run afoul of a linguistic anom aly but why should the man be sad instead of gay im not exactly minced spleen dug interceded in current slang the term gay now refers to a sexual preference for ones own gender and a person who prefers the opposite gender is called straight kim said oh that did set chlorine back a bit but then she had the answer but i would put him in a straight jacket that would stop the gaiety dug and kim exchanged a glance that should do it dug agreed or maybe could marry that man simon chlorine continued with another slice of a glance at nimby the one who said things and then they happened he could say id be happy the three others glanced at nimby but he still didnt react so chlorine tried one more maybe that sixteen year old mundane boy we saw in the region of madness what was his namebrandon risner he seemed nice she addressed dug and kim wend things are found at the fringes of the region of madness we were doing a raccoonnaissancc looking for a lailgatorthey have tierce teeth in then tailsand we boarded a scholar ship bach passenger had to submit a written essay which meant that only educated folk could use it but it was fun td like to sail on that ship dug said yes ou would hae liked some ol the folk on it there was elena human from the north village her talent was liteiatuie she could summon any character from a book as long as she was holding that book theie was also polly esther from the west stockade whose talent was to make longlasting clothing some of it was quite sheer when she wore it hed like that ship too well kim muttered we crossed a lake ol pollux oil which smelled even worse than castor oil then we docked and rode a defective donkey chlorine paused searching her memory no it was an ass fault very hard and black until we came to a toad lily which was really all together thats where brandon was he was learning to play chess from a chess nut tree wait i think missed one kim said i got asphalt and chestnut but whats toad lily you aie toad lily stupid about puns dug told her had it been xanth a mortified light bulb would have hashed over her head oh you bad boy she exclaimed punching him on the shoulder toad lily bad nimby yawned chlorine decided she had had enough fun with him puns bored him i hope you never do dump me she said kissing his ear i like donkeyheaded dragons dug stood i think its time tor us to go home youre ust smug because youre one up on me kim said but she hardly seemed loath as they departed for the night mountains i m nervous having them down there so long breanna said suppose they get in trouble and we dont knov it a then we would have to go in after them edsel said maybe youll be able to see what i cant and ill be able to deflect hostile magic so we can rescue them but he was nervous himself justin and pia had gone down the steps into the ground and though they had reported back safely once now time was extending without their reappearance i guess i fuss too much she said its just that loc him so and we havent been together long physically i mean and im so afraid ill lose him to a dragon or something before i ever really have him she glanced sidelong at him do you icel like that with pia he shook his head no not really but of course weve been married tor tout years the bloom is otf oh yes you said that before but it seems weird to me how can you lose loc she shifted her position sitting crosslegged and he couldnt help wondering how far up under her skirt he would have been able to sec if there had been more light she was a cute kid and nicelv formed but he needed to address her question well havent really lost mine tor her but im atraid shes lost hers lor me im hoping she will recover it i guess i feel have lost her and im arraid i wont recovei her is that close enough to your sentiment no i know i wont lose justms love just his body maybe if something bad happens i know its foolish but it still bothers me but i hope it works out tor you then she thought ol something else do you notice other women how much honesty was appropriate well this was xanth the land of htcralness might as well be candid yes i notice you that doesnt mean me whats to notice about me youre an attractive girl the age pia was when i started with her and you would be freaking me out with your tegs if it werent daik she glanced down really without even showing my panties she seemed pleased for sure he said smiling then to change he subject he addressed the boat para how are you doing the boat slapped a webbed loot against the ground in acknowledgment i wish you could talk he said id like to know your history you could play nineteen questions breanna said tell him to tap once for yes two for no three for uncertainty say yes he agreed okay para would you like to tell us your personal history a foot slapped once were you born or made oops wrong phrasing were you born wrong question breanna said folk dont get born in xanth thats a clumsy messy mundaman custom they get delivered by the stork oh yeah thats right okay para were you delivered one slap which he heard as yes so no one made you yes there was a moment of conlusion as they established that the answer was literal no one had made the craft because it had been delivered by a stork this is getting interesting breanna said who could be the paients ot a boat with ten pairs of duck feet edsel zeroed in on the answer was youi mother a duck two loot slaps no edsel asked he tried other creatures hut none was right bieanna got a notion a boat was your mother a boat yes they considered it seemed unlikely to be an ordinary boat what kind of boal could signal the stork a dream bout breanna said a bulb hashing oer her head yes was your lather a duck three slaps signifying uncertainty uncertain because you dont know no because its not exactly a duck yes they tried variations ot ducks and finally edscl got it a quaek your father was a quack yes it turned out that the two had blundered onto a love spring tricked there by anemone which was a water creature with a bad attitude an enemy in tact they desperately signaled the stork about ten times before they managed to get clear of that potent water the stork orks had pondered the order for some months and finally compromised by delivering one boat with ten pairs of duck feet by that time the quack was long gone but the dream boat remained and she showed para the ways ol the water but he had to learn the way of the land himselt and that was chancy now they wanted to know how para had come to be associated with the two docks where breanna had first encountered him this was hard to zero in on but they were making progress when justm and pia returned im almost disappointed breanna murmured smiling she had a ven white smile in the subdued light of the illusion castle therell be other occasions edsel said then they loeused on the others the four stood beside the boat catching up the two who had gone underground seemed oddly animated as if they had had some tran scendent experience we have discovered a tree justm said the coventree this region is safe for us a tree edsel asked wondering if he had missed the punch line but weve just got to help that tree pia said its getting drowned out and so are its friends but we cant take time to get involved in forestry bieanna protested we have to get edsel and pia safely back to the oxone i think not justin said breanna spluttered but justin turned to his companion pia pia turned to edsel would be so grateful tor your support so cry ven grateful she never spoke like lhat unless she really wanted something and not only could she make him extraordinarily glad to cooperate she could make him phenomenally unhappy when he did not you have it he said immediately he didnt need to know what he was committing himselt to just that heaven was better than hell thank you she said and hugged and kissed him she had her sixteen year old body back and it put images of squadrons of storks into his feveied imagination she would make good on the implication too when the opportunity came she always did the fact was he loved being wound around her little finger since they are determined to resolve this matter justin was saying we are obliged to assist them in whatever way we are able have you been enchanted breanna asked suspiciously what happened down there well show you pia said come you must meet the coventree breanna shot a desperate glance at edsel but he was lost he could aigue with pia he could exchange insults with her he could be mad at her but he could not oppose her when she used her sex appeal to win her way he knew this did not mean lhat she would remain married to him but lor the duration of his cooperation in her design she would be his loving girlfriend that might be the best he could get and he was incapable ol refusing it i guess we have to do it breanna said clearly not entirely pleased justin embraced her and kissed her and pinched her bottom justin she said astonished you got fresh something i learned from pia he said looking apprehensive you learned fromwhat were you two douiq down there he told me that you surpused him pia said evenly i told him how to surprise you in turn oh the girl reconsidered perhaps remembering the business of holding hands then she tumed back to justin okay do it again pilrs amhom edsel had to laugh pia had made quite an impression on those to hrst gelling breanna to lead justin into something then getting him to initiate something physical romance was a process pia knew volumes about the xanthl adult conspiracy would neer be the same then justin and pia led the way dovn into the nether section para followed them his duck feet handling the steps well enough edsel hesitated then drew the lid down closing them in it no seemed safer than advertising where they had gone first the tour pia said t know youre tired and well test soon but this is important actually edsel wasnt tired because he had been riding in the boat and then sitting and talking with breanna he was curious to know what had gotten pia so excited and commuted it was a showing of six museumstyle pictures or settings illusion paintings justin explained two were of snowy mountains and four were of a pleasant wooded valley they completed the circuit they were back at the stairway thats it breanna asked edsel felt much the same so there were six somewhat repetitive pictures so what the snows are melting pia said the alley is hooding edsel exchanged a glance with breanna this time he did the honors so so the runoft from the mountains is flooding the valley pia said the roots of the trees are drowning and so the trees are dying edsel shrugged it happens whats your point those are good trees its not right just to let them die when we can maybe do something to save them since when were you ever an environmentalist instead of retorting with a cutting remark pia paused to consider since i met the coventree is this a magic tree did it enchant you pia considered again i dont think it enchanted me but il it did im glad of it i feelas if ive fallen in love with a mission this was strong medicine but not necessarily bad pia had nevei before been dedicated to anything other than her comfort ot the moment then maybe we had better meet the coventree breanna said coming up pia led the way into the last picture edsel and breanna stared oh thats right edsel said after a moment you can pass thiough illusion xovi comlmion it turned out to be an awkwaid route especially for the duck footed boat they went through a hole in the side wall down a small tunnel into a larger cioss tunnel through a puddle of bilgewater and into a large central cave where squat square columns abounded this is the coventree pia said or rather its root system we can camp safely here lor the night but we saw no big tree above breanna protested illusion can conceal as well as appear justin reminded her so what do we do edsel asked can we talk to it no this just proves how it is getting hooded out that water in the passage will rise unless we stop the mountain melt you mean those pictures are of this area breanna asked or the valley part of it yes justin said they illustrate the problem and were supposed to somehow stop nature edsel asked stop the melting in the mountains pia said patiently that will stop the slow flooding and save the trees he found this hard to believe and for this you will give me she stepped into him very soft and exciting yes then bring on the mountains he said they found nooks spread out the blankets and settled down for the night pia joined edsel and if she had ever been more desirable or ardent he could not remember when all this to save some trees he had to be missing something but meanwhile he had a piece ot heaven in the morning by his watchthe fungus light down here was unchangedthey stirred and got organized they ate more pia for breakfast and prepared to set out on their new mission overnight perhaps in his dreams edsel had pondered the flooding problem evidently it was a chronic thing not merely seasonal mountain glaciers normally melted some in summer and refroe in winter staying in balance only a larger pattern of heating a climate change could make them melt continuously what was causing that pia had brought him into this but now he was getting into it in his own fashion as a challenge he liked solving mysteries and perhaps this was a worthy one justin went to touch one of the square roots we will try to address the problem he told it we will do our best pia went to another root we really will she said then she leaned forward and kissed its rough bark the faint glow around the cae brightened whether that as in tesponse to the promise or the kiss edsel wasnt sure both were surely potent they turned to the exit passageand there across it was an illusion picture it showed the valley with no lakes or ponds the sun shining brightly the coxentree understood their mission and was acknowledging in its fashion edsel realied that the tree could not respond in animate fashion but could at least make pictures which it probably had to grow in the course of hours it must have been working on this one overnight the walked through it suffering no blindness as this illusion was paper thin beyond it was another this one was a map showing the local lay of the land and the placement ol the snowy mountains now they knew exactly where to go they made their way out through the passages and illusions and emerged to the daylight above the castle was gone the region was flat with one significant exception there was the coventree rising above the region where they had seen its great central root it was a huge tree larger than edsel had ever seen before stretching toward the clouds the illusion castle must have been formed around it concealing it at night but by day freed of its protective illusion it stood out m all its grandeur it would indeed be a shame to let such a tree die they got in para and the boat set off justin and pia rode in front eager to see the way ahead leaving edsel and breanna to the rear so did she do you last night breanna inquired am i allowed to answer without violating the adult conspiracy she laughed thats answer enough you know can see how justin would relate to the welfare of trees and i dont blame him at all but pia surprises me i never figured her for the type she surprises me too he admitted ioe her but she has always been selfcentered i dont see any way in which this intermission can profit her personally this what intermission a mission inside a larger mission she considered that quest what its a quest rather than a mission more eclat quest he agreed liking the concept but not her type it there were the promise of a bag of pretty gemstones at the end i could see it but just to save some trees she ncxer cared about trees before there must be a reason there must be he agreed they had speculated about enchantment but il didnt seem to fit a shape flew out of the background it was large and somewhat clumsy beware breanna said thats a harpy have no concern justin called back thats handi i know her shes clean and intelligent trees get to know many flying creatures breanna said i suppose i shouldnt be jealous the harpy had the wings and talons ot a buzard and the head and breasts of a woman edsel had understood that they were always ugly but this one wasnt what is the nature of your quest she called her voice was not a screech either hello handi justin called come and perch for a bit the harpy was surprised you know me she hovered doubtfully and you know me justin said im justin tree in manform justin she cried that is your voice she came in to perch on the side of the boat but what are you doing with three mundanes two and a half mundanes breanna said nettled im a permanent xanth resident breanna of the black wave and justins my man handi turned to eye her well he used to be my tree he had the nicest foliage i would perch on his firm warm branch and we discussed nature we are going to the mountains to find out why the snow is melting justin said thats important the meltwater is drowning out the coventree handi nodded thats important thats the finest tree in all these parts she preened a leather well i must be off she spread her wings and lifted into the air breanna watched her go was i too bleepy she asked not at all edsel reassured her you hardly spoke hate being jealous but the thought of justin talking about nature with bare breasted birds just drives me cray she docs haxe nice he caught himself completely under piers anthony standable but how could a man have an luturc with a creature with no human legs she considered i never thought of that he ieall couldnt well whatever i dont have to be jealous of harpies at all he spied another creature it might be a dragon but it wasnt threatening them whats that she looked oh thats a iiredrake they have iron lungs that made sense he realised the level floor of the valley tilted providing some leverage so the river could rise toward the distant mountain range edsel had never been much for watching scenery but there wasnt much else to do justin and pia were chatting amiably at the other end of the boat they seemed to be really hitting it off after their exploration of the underground gallery edsel hardly minded talking with breanna she was cute and vivacious but there was absolutely no prospect of a romantic association there and he had never had much to do with girls who were not romantic prospects so he was stuck with the scenery fortunately it was varied and interesting they passed a woman who was working in a vineyard but the vines were odd they seemed to have eyeballs what are those he inquired breanna looked i think they are eyequeue vines put one on your head and it makes you smart really he asked amacd well im not sure maybe they onl make you think youre smart ill find out she waved to the woman hi im breanna of the black wave my talent is seeing in blackness and i have a question the duckfooted boat obligingly drew to a halt so she could have the dialogue you wish to know whether these vines provide the illusion or the reality of high intelligence the woman said thais right how did you know because i am jeanie yus and long association with the ee queue has made me quite intelligent in fact thats my talent intelligence or cultivating vines edsel asked yes and you are evidently a lascivious mundane only when looking at lovely women he said actually jeanie looked smart rather than pretty but he was a tair hand at dialogue with women x t of conti ntio she nodded false flattery can indeed be charming the answer to your original question is that the effect of these vines varies with the person they do enhance the appearance of intelligence but only in restricted ways relating to observation of details rather than substance obscure vocabulary rather than effective communication spot memonzation of numbers backwards superficial analysis of pictures general information of a selected cultural nature and tnek questions but not only do they make those who use them think they are more intelligent than they are they also make school administrators think so thev have schools in xanth edsel asked indubitably we have a fine school of fish right here in the melt river breanna was interested what effect would such a vine have on someone like me they tend not to greatly enhance the seeming strengths of folk like you jeanie said on a basis of one hundred they would make you seem like eighty five but how can they do that she asked annoyed they relate only to the qualities to which they are crafted to relate they ignore all others such a creativity artistic ability musical sensitivity special qualities of character like integrity or compassion or perseverance or specialied knowledge in diverse areas they assume that intelligence is an entity represented by a single figure and that that figure is the only relevant one but why would the assume that breanna asked because if they did not their prophecy would not be properly self fulfilling i dont understand naturally not jeanie said with a superior attitude breanna seemed about to jump out of the boat to tackle jeanie edsel grabbed her getting a faceful of her lustrous black hair para he cried get your feel moving the boat lurched forward carrying them away from the vineyard he hung on to the struggling girl until she relaxed then he released her aware that his embrace could be misinterpreted justin and pia were looking back in surprise but then returned to their dialogue breanna looked at him i guess you didnt do that to grab any quick feel true he agreed then to deluse it oh i dont mean to imply that you dont hae things orth teehng you are a very nice little package it i ever had a legitimate excuse id reel in teels it worked she smiled for sure that woman made me so mad i think it was unconscious arrogance she called out the weakness in her ines without realizing that it applied to hcrsell she really does think she is smarter than you but why because you are of the black wave that is most of what she felt she needed to know about you self fulfilling prophecy she said musingly it you figure the color of your skin makes you better than someone else the tests you make will reflect that you will make sure they do he agreed in the name ot objectivity ironically but if s not worth arguing with an altitude like that it would be like getting into a mud fight i used to like mud fights you know what i mean she considered what do you think of ombies he was startled by the irrelevance why i dont know any ombies but i wouldnt want to embrace one for sure she said turning away edsel found himself vaguely nettled am i missing something those eye queue vines would make a zombie be about ten on a scale of one hundred their brains are rotten he was baffled i am missing something i feel sort of stupid no just from another culture maybe some time ill tell you about zombies meanwhile ill apologic for confusing you it wasnt fair oh thats all right he said still wondering what was going on m her mind then she caught him about the shoulders drew him close enough to be well aware of those things she had worth iceling and kissed him so soundly that it telt as if the boat were tipping over the brink ol a waterfall when she released him he put his hands on the sides of the boat to maintain his balance why he gasped after a moment two icasons first you saved me from making a fool ot mysell back there second those two up front owed us a kiss and maybe a feel but think you got that too indeed owed us a kiss your woman kissed my man underground and gave him a feel i can tell now that score is even he wasnt sure of the logic but it had been such a good kiss that he didnt question it breanna kept her own particular social accounts she had kissed him in the oxone because she had said thai someone else hud done it and it showed someone else had kirn and pia apparently it anyone else got a kiss breanna felt entitled you said something about an apology then you kissed me is there a connection yes gac you a gourd apology thats like that i think i could get interested in the gourd for sure she laughed all in good time you know i think i could get to like you if i tried ditto here but i think we had better not try too hard were pushing it she agreed maybe were a little jealous of them her gaze flicked momentarily toward the front of the boat they have found a common interest he agreed pia has become an environmentalist would never have expected that justm is already because of his seveial score years as a tree i like that in him but have sort of left it to him same as he has left civil rights to me xanth has a civil rights problem it does with ombies youre representing the ombies he exclaimed catching on yeah how did you get into that well it staited with king xeth he she broke off because at that point they were approaching an odd couple it was a centaur the first edsel had seen in the flesh and on ils back a girl the girl had brown hair wore blue jeans and would have been rather short if seen standing on the ground but as it was hci head was high enough hello justm called from the front i am justm tree is this the best way to the snowy mountains hi the girl replied she wore a hat that said tom but maybe she had borrowed it unless she was a torn boy im heather im ten and my talent is relating to dragons im looking for one whos not hungiy at the moment i dont know the besl way to the mountains but im sure shaunture does purs anthony the centaur seemed reluctant to talk he merely pointed upncr my concern is that the ruer may meander and we would like to reach the mountains expediliously justin said heather looked down i guess youll hae to answer shaunture she said now the centaur spoke the river does not measure hut he paused for a measuring tape had appeared in his hands meander heather said it does not meander thank you the tape disappeared but you will want to avoid the colored people breanna sat up straight edsel put a cautioning hand on her brown arm what is the problem with colored people justin asked their talents they were originally mundanes and their form of greeting is to shake hands when they got magic thanks to the curse of a passing demon it was inconement they are named white green brown black grey and other collars and he paused lor a huge horse collar had appeared around his neck colors heather said other colors thank you the centaur said as the collar faded out not only are they those colors but anything they touch becomes those colors too so the really are colored people edsel murmured literal xanth strikes again for sure breanna murmured back i should have known i appreciate the problem justin said we shall not wish to shake hands with these people yes the centaur agreed their mundane costume is quaint hut he paused for now a clownish costume had formed around him custom heather said their mundane custom ot touching hands thank you the costume dissoked begin to see why he doesnt like to talk breanna said eery time he makes a mistake it takes form is there a detour e can take to aoid them pia asked ii you lake a shghtlv different angel ou can the centaur paused tor an angel had appeared hovering before him complete with glovmng halo and white wings angle heather said a slightly diifcrent angle thank you the angel taded you ma then pass the home of a centet magician who nov a small building appeared before him with airos pointing to it making it the center of the illustration centaur heather said centaur magician thank you he will be able to direct you further thank ou justin said you have been a real help so has heather yes she is invaluable shaunture agreed dread the day vhen she finds her dragon and departs with it well it doesnt take much brains to be a damsel lor a dragon so im qualified heather said though ill hate wearing a skimpy dress i hae no concern what she wears shaunture confided i would like to give her a bucket ol a bucket appeared on the girls head mmmph mmph she cried unable to make herself understood she tried to lift it off but it seemed glued in place bouquet edsel called a bouquet of flowers thank ou the centaur said as the bucket iaded i shall stop speaking now this is understandable justin said we nevertheless remain appreciative heather i think your talent is relating to creatures not just dragons breanna said to the girl maybe you should stay with shaunture who really needs you the girls mouth dropped open in surprise really really you always know what he means to say and that really helps him well he says i help so as not to hurt my childish feelings but centaurs are way too smart to associate long with dull kids like me breanna seemed to be digesting an internal thought intelligence isnt always what you think ask him heather looked at shaunture he nodded oh shaunture she cried id loe to slay with you i know youll never chomp me the centaur looked at breanna i must speak again atter all i am grapefruit for he became a huge grapefruit grateful heather cried joyously perched on the top for her insight the centaur resumed his natural form he spat out a grapefruit seed and shut his mouth nrmlv purs amho para moved on i like your boat heather called alter them para made a dip of appreciation without breaking stiide that centaur reminds me of someone pia remarked demoness metna justm replied there was a swirl ol smoke oh no breanna muttered the smoke formed a mouth did someone mention m name it was an accident breanna said the smoke coalesced into a loel buxom form bound by an elastic halter stretching almost to the snapping point and you found the loul looted boat para quicred with indignation what kind of foot edsel asked quickly avis feathered game bird domestic fowl whatever the demoness agreed crossly the boat relaxed im sure the children will love to ride m it melria said thank you so much for offering she fued back into smoke we didnt breanna started but ol course it was too late the smoke formed into demon ted and demomca they were stuck for anothet round of babysitting maybe the two of them will one day grow up and marry each other pia muttered and the stork will bring them children ihev have to babysit named tedmon and monled breanna agreed and therell be no mundanes visiting who are foolish enough to do it whose menfolk are dazzled into volunteering pia said they both laughed actually the children arent all that bad and the dazzlcability of the menfolk make them more readily handlcable for sure justin turned his head to exchange a glance with edscl the girls were having their bit of fun they departed from the river at a slight angle so as to avoid the colored people soon they came to a boy who stood bv the side of the path they were following with his right thumb lifted same to you jerk ted called shush thats a mundane pia exclaimed hitchhiking we do have room for another passengei justm said first things first pia cupped her hands and called to the bo whats your name gabriel the bo called back so hes not one ol the colored people pia said he can ride with us whats wrong with colored people monica asked nothing edsel said forestalling trouble the boat stopped and the boy climbed in do vou know a safe way to the snowy mountains pia asked him oh sure right the wa youre going now but you dont want to go all the way there theyre cold well chance it pia said and resumed her private dialogue with justin she had tuned him out as was her custom with folk she had no immediate interest in so edsel and breanna took up the slack lest the children do it what are you doing in xanth gabriel breanna asked because youre obviously mundane i guess h does show gabriel said abashed id like to live in xanth i made a deal i can visit xanth for a week can stay here if i can find a family to adopt me or a girl to marry me otherwise i must return forever to drear mundama how old are you breanna asked fourteen thats what i thought youre younger than i am and so you are still mired in the adult conspiracy you cant marry a xanth girl could marry one who is eighteen or over gabriel said if she wanted to if she didnt break the conspiracy both children perked up evidently intrigued by the prospect of breaking the adult conspiracy but you already know all that stuff dont you breanna asked sure but in xanth i know and youd rather put up with that lhan go back to mundania yeah do ou think i have a chance to find a girl no to find a family maybe then breanna brightened does it hae to be any special kind ol girl i dont think so how about a nmph gabriel smiled id love a nymph but shed break the conspiracy in the first live seconds the children squealed with laughter ted grabbed monica and she hung her hair around and kicked her feet up in a parody of a nymph for sure breanna agreed ruefully bad idea but maybe therell be a famil maybe he agreed hopefully there was a fairly sharp turn in the path para traveling rapidly was otfbalanced by the extra weight and his side seraped against a sad looking tree it emitted a sighing sound what was that edsel asked as they moved on a sighpress tree juslin called back they sigh when pressed now they came to another person it was a somewhat portly woman arc you looking for a ride pia called im looking for a lake the woman replied theres a lake on the river not far ahead gabriel said how do you know edsel asked because i saw fire ants near a fire and earth ants near earth and air ants near air i saw water ants here so there must be water near edsel nodded that works for me then get in and well take you there pia said to the woman para could use a swim a swim ted cried clapping his little hands monicas dress became a two piece swimsuit the woman climbed in and there were introductions she turned out to be alexandra whats youi talent breanna asked im a weredolphin i never heard of that i think im the only one ive been searching out stray lakes hoping to find another of my kind so far without success why do ou want another of your kind gabriel asked im lonely i dont like swimming alone but you dont need another of your kind just for company breanna said i think i do who else would want to stay with someone whos half in and out of the water i vvould gabriel said alexandra looked at him you look young and wild surelv vou wouldnt want to settle down to a dull lakeside life life would never be dull in xanth not if we kept you company ted said were younger and wilder monica agreed edsel exchanged a glance with breanna would ou consider marrying a boy without violating the adult conspiracy alexandra considered that depends on how good company he was why dont you talk with gabriel here edsel suggested the two half demon children lost interest and peered out of the boat could be great company i think gabriel said if that meant i could stay in xanth the two started a dialog sitting in the center of the boat edsel as a matter of courtesy tuned them out there seem to be a number of interesting people in xanth he remarked to breanna every person is interesting when you get to know him she said id like to meet every person in xanth but thete are too many surely so what do you think well find at the mountains melting snow ive wondered how there can be such a cold place in warm xanth well its because the temperature drops with elevation thats in mundania here in xanth you can fly way above the mountains and not be cold ive been up there so there must be magic he realized she was right xanth did not follow mundane tules what kind of magic well once i met two brothers one could turn himself into ice the other could turn anything else to ice maybe those bi others live in the mountains maybe so he agreed that seemed just crazy enough to suit this magic land but vou know there seems to be an awful lot ol fortunate coincidence in xanth like the way certain people meet without moving his head he flicked his eyes in the direction of the youth and the woman in the center of the boat for sure ive thought about that i think maybe the land ol xanth is female so she does nice things for her people but the demon x m is male yes mostly actually demons are an gender they want to be but the demon is not the land the land is more like his daughter pilrs anthony edsel nodded nov that makes sense maybe thats why marriages last forevei in xanth for sure it ou could arrange to stay in xanth with pia i dont think so we have obligations in mundania and these are borrowed bodies but sometimes it rubs off on people dug and kirn are just as mueh together now as they ever were and they dont spend much time in xanth maybe lhe drank some love elixir if thats magic it shouldnt work in mundania she nodded maybe not still it might be worth trying it we pass love spring you might save some of its elixir and try it on her i hear that diluted love elixir and a finder spell can enable a person to find her true love they came to the lake oh wonderful alexandra exclaimed im so diy she jumped out of the boat ran to the water and dived in as she struck the water her clothing disappeared and her body became roughly fishlike she had assumed her dolphin aspect gabriel ran after her i love to swim he said but there might be sharks or serpents in that water breanna warned him they wont bother me he said pausing at the edge to rip off his clothing not with a dolphin friend protecting me hes got a point breanna said youre not supposed to look edsel said smiling i meant she paused oh youre doing it again you rogue para moved to the lake and into it without pause now there were three of them swimming dolphin boy and boat our turn ted said he was now in trunks and monica had a shower cap no wait breanna said sharply to edsels surprise they obeyed theres a shark pia cried she was especially nervous about them since one had snapped at her hand then the sleek dolphin circled intercepting the shark before it could reach the bov the shark veered away it knew better than to tangle with such a toe isnt she great gabriel called what a creature think this is going to work out breanna said you can swim breanna told the childien even as she spoke they were leaping off the side making small cannonbafl splashes but su close to the boat para paddled joyfully around then moved back toward land a centain stood there hello justm called as they walked out on land arc ou the centaur magician i am the centaur replied my name is rempel my talent is to know the talents of others i thought all centaurs had names with ch sounds edsel said that is the custom not the rule rempel said we who are outside the norm do not necessarily follow it outside the norm conventional centaurs do not have magic talents he said let alone strong ones they consider personal magic obscene breanna murmured something moved through the grass whats a shark doing on land pia cried alarmed rempel looked those are a variety of shark called skates he said they arc harmless to ordinary folk unless stepped on now edsel saw that the creatures were forming hoops and rolling along the ground skates he asked roller skates he should have guessed the boat halted by some sweet smelling rose bushes the roses were all colors breanna had hauled the children in now she got out and went to smell a brown oneand suddenly floated into the air above it there was a shrill of laughter from ted and monica beware rempel said those roses have the talent of levitating things their own color edsel went and caught breannas flailing arm he drew her away from the rose and she tell back to the ground im getting in trouble lust like a mundane she muttered maybe its contagious edsel said breanna looked around whats that it doesnt look quite like a centaui edsel recogmed the creature immediately but decided not to speak rempel smiled indeed it is not thats all short for b b allusion a chestnut copper marc just visiting when breanna still looked blank he said a horse a member of one of m ancestral species piers anthony oh breanna said embarrassed like a night mare only less magical for sure edsel agreed rempel suddenly galloped to the edge of ihe lake away away he cried splashing the water with his forehoofs edsel and breanna walked across to see what vas going on there was only a rather blobb sea creature feeding on what looked like weeds at the edge this is hugh rempel said he is a manatee sometimes the sharks come after him then i have to drive them off awww ted said his sympathy was for the sharks to save hugh manatee edsel said precisely then the centaur paused thoughtfully glancing at ed sel he does that breanna said at least it bypassed the children alexandra and gabriel emerged from the lake she changed to clothed human form in one motion clothes seemed to be part of her magic thus she wasnt violating the adult conspiracy by showing him any panties gabriel had to clothe himself the ordinary way but since alexandra was of age it didnt matter what she saw they walked toward edsel breanna and rempel im going to hae sore muscles gabriel said i haent swum like that in a long time rempel trotted a short distance to pick something from what looked like a pea plant he brought it back and gave it to gabriel try this what is it the boy asked doubtlully a thera pea it is good for sore muscles the children tittered i thought it made you p demon ted breanna snapped silencing the boy it oceurred to edsel that some day she would make a good mother she had the ma ternal reflexes gabriel popped it into his mouth in a moment he smiled the soreness is gone rempel shrugged it is convenient to know the talents ot things can show you a lielack bush if you wish a person near it cant tell a he or a ruler that writing device takes control of the person who uses it why is it that ou are out here in the wilderness hdsel asked surely many folk would like to have you and your talent near xone or comfntio i piefer nature edsel nodded i can appreciate that he looked at breanna i suppose we had better be getting on if we want to reach the mountains today if you plan to spend the night in the mountains you vill need much warmer clothing rempel said unless your love keeps you ery warm edsel realized that there was a natural confusion breanna and i are not a couple our significant others are the other two he gestured toward the boat where justin and pia were talking and looking around i apologize rempel said the compatibilities seemed otherwise opposites attract breanna said so im attracted to justin tree im young and hes old she glanced around and we arc involuntary babysitters tor these two half demon children for sure monica said mimicking her do you have any advice on the best route to the mountains edsel asked the path forks rempel said you will want to take the right path to avoid mischief and find warmer clothing for sure breanna agreed as the children tittered thank you if you get on the wrong path you will need both your talents for there will be darkness and magic to be deflected thanks edsel said they walked back to rejoin the others this is a beautiful place pia said justin has been pointing out its novelties for example theres a chemistiee they looked the trees fruit seemed to be in the form of colored fluids in little beakers and a water chestnut tree pia said indicating another the nuts were in the shape of damp little chests you are becoming a naturalist edsel remarked i really am she agreed i neer cared before i met justin hes teaching me so much we have to gel moving if we want to catch the mountains today breanna said her voice seemed just a trifle tighl justin called to gabriel and alexandra do you wish to ride farther with us no thanks gabriel called back we like it here pivrs anthum mavbe well get married alexandra agreed then the to of ihcm dned hack into the lake its definitely vorking out pia said in the xanthly way they got into the boat the duck feet cained them along the path up the river we need to take the edsel began oh look pia cried theres an adder she reached for a nearb snake oooo great monica exclaimed but thats poisonous edsel protested too late pia caught the snake and lilted it into the boat edsel kicked desperately around tor a stick but there wasnt even a paddle whats two plus two pia asked the snake as the children crowded close the adder struck at the side of the boat there was the sharp bong of a hell now there was a mark on the wood the number lour edsel relaxed it was alter all harmless pia lifted the adder and set it outside the boat it slithered away she glanced back at edsel what were you saying just that we should lake the right path did we take the wrong one justin asked there was a pitchfork back near where we saw the adder a pitchfork edsel asked concerned from a pine needle tree technically the smallest needles make tuning forks the middle ones make pitchforks for farmers to use and the largest make forks in the road they are all sizes of pitchforks re ally so a pine needle tree could make a fork in the road now he got the punnish logic ot it and they had passed right through that fork while distracted by the adder should he ask para to go back and check that lork an awtul shape loomed behind them haaa it roared it looked like a centaur except that it had black horns bat wings red skin and green stupes what is that edsel asked more than concerned its a demon centaur breanna said this is mischief she laced forward get moving para were in trouble great ted said no it isnt monica said they chomp children the boat acceleiated but the centaur was in full gallop and still gaming haaa it repeated just in case they hadnt heard the first time i am dyrak scourge ol mortals and you are on m path i think we took the wrong fork edsel said for sure duck feel cant outrun that thing but maybe if we can reach water she looked desperately from side to side para take thai detour ahead it leads toward the river the boat slowed around the sharp turn and plunged into an olfshoot path the tree branches closed overhead forming a canopy making it seem like a hall the demon centaurs hoofs screeched to a halt he did not follow them youll be sorry he called oh pooh monica called back yeah poop ted agreed now edsel saw creatures standing between the trees that lined the hall they had the lower portions of men and the upper portions ol hulls they looked ferocious but they werent moving what arc those he asked i think theyre hall minotaurs breanna replied they keep order in halls but i hear thai folk seldom like the order they keep they dont seem to be doing anything edsel said thais because were going the way they want she said darkly theyll step in if we try to escape edsel glanced at the children they looked nervous that made him nervous we cant gel out of this rcmpcl said wed have to use our talents edsel concentrated what was his talent ah yesto modify or deflect other talents he hadnt tried to use it but this must be the time breanna peered into the deepening gloom sunounding them as the foliage of the trees became thicker edsel remembered that she could see in blackness worse coming she said tcrselv ugly folk i wish i had a pair ol binoculars edsel knew better than to guess what are they they help you to see in the dark twice as far the boat slowed the way ahead was being blocked dont stop breanna cried plow on through para tried but hands were grabbing onto his sides they were gnarlv warty hands they belonged to people clinging to the boat trying to climb in edsel reached lot a hand about to rip it off the boat dont touch them breanna said thev look poisonous piers anthony who arc you ted asked a horrendous male face as it drew up over the rim e coli the face answered bdse didnt like the sound of that who are you monica asked a disreputable female face salmon ella the sound of that was no better but could his talent help edscl leaned over e coli how did his talent work did he have to toueh or speak then coli heaved himself up and sprawled half in the boat edsel put both hands out to push him back recoiling at the touch and the man turned green and lumpy and fell away what had happened great ted said you turned him into broc coli now salmon ella hauled herself into the boat edscl pushed her hack she turned into a sleek lish and fell away ellas a salmon monica said so that was how his talent worked in true xanthian fashion the dark path lay right under an innocent looking tree beyond which was open water and light dont go there just in called and the boat veered to the side crashing through brush why not edsel asked its a eaptivi tree oh of course justin knew his trees now the boat shot out of the gloom and splashed onto the water of the river they had won through that was fun ted said lets do it again isnt it about time for your nap breanna inquired we dont take naps monica said you do now breanna said she unfolded one of the stored blankets and draped it oer them it was decorated with pictures of tires look out ted cried shes making a bed its part of the adult conspiracy to subjugate children monica said appalled then to edsels surprise the two children settled immediately into nap mode what kind of blanket is that he asked its a lire its attire a tire it makes children tired she shook her head must confess al limes the adult conspiracy is convenient you mean naps really is part of it as far as they know breanna smiled mysteriously he realized that she being underage was not yet officially part of the conspiracy she had been bluffing now that they were on the water it seemed to be clear sailing edsel relaxed that last session had demonstrated that xanth was not necessarily benign say we should check in he said remembering another day has passed for sure breanna produced the ear and handed it over edsel mundane here he said into it all is well for the moment thats line chlorines voice returned same here he returned the ear i feel a bit guilty for that bul theres no point in worrying them oh looksiamese triplets breanna said pointing to the shore wha then he saw them three identical cats but they had not escaped cleanly one of the monsters had poked a hole in the boat water was leaking in forming bilge edsel looked for a cup or container to dip it out the leak wasnt large but it could not be ignored then a water creature swam toward them it dived under the boat suddenly the leak slopped it had been closed up or patched oer and now the hull was tight the swimming creature must hae done it what was that thing edsel asked a seal of course breanna answered a seal had sealed the boat of course now they made good progress upriver was there some reason we didnt travel on the river before edscl asked maybe justin knows breanna lifted her voice and called to the from end of ihe boat why didnt we use the river before the rapids justin called back and the slows edsel worked it out the rapids would be too fast for comfort and the slows would be too slow everything made sense in its fashion but soon they had to return to the land because a storm was coming the clouds loomed massively i dont like the look of this breanna said she lifted the blanket and the children woke up refreshed stay close well have to take shelter piiks anthony stoims can be uncomlortable hdsel said but its only water she shook her head ecr time you stari seeming normal you say something stupid they pulled off the path and edsel and justin lifted the boat and turned it ovei the duck feet lav flat against the hull thc all got under that shelter just in time lor no the storm struck objects the size oi footballs struck the ground with sickening thuds then one splatted against the boat part of the blob dribbled down to plop before edsels nose it was gray and wrinkled what kind of storm i this he demanded a brainstorm silly breanna said i hate them he could understand why onlv in xanth soon the storm passed they got out righted the boat and resumed their travel toward the mountains the grade steepened and the temperature dropped they had to wrap blankets around them to stay warm because they had forgotten to get better clothing justin and pia shared a blanket in front and edscl and breanna shared one in back the two demon children did not seem affected by the cold i wonder whether we should change partners edsel murmured no i dont think you two men would want to share a blanket but breannas brown face was serious she was concerned pia was a mighty fetching figure of a woman for what its worth he said know pia she goes for what she wants and theres not a romantic bone in her body unless she chooses to put it there she wants information not justin and hes thrilled to a convert to the interest of trees she agreed guess dont have reason to be jealous its just my nature then she turned to him maybe the should be jealous of us uh tell me more about this inbetween stage vou call petting better show me treacherous ground partiv because he did feel himself attracted to her ithink ou already know enough she laughed soltly just teasing ed was she he had no doubt of her loyaltv to justin but she could be as single minded as pia about getting what she wanted she wanted experience awww teds voice came arent ou going to even goose hei like this he reached under monicas skirt eeeee monica scieamed sailing high into the air then they both dissolved into laughter they must have rehearsed that little charade obviously they did know something of the secrets of the adult conspiracy and thought they were hilanous edsel was abruptlv glad tor another reason that he had not done anything with breanna aside from her age and commitment to her fiance he had not realized how closelv they were being watched the boat rounded a turn in the trail and there suddenly was the scene the illusion picture he exclaimed this is it this is the reality justin called back they gol out of the boat each swathed in a blanket and studied the situation the mountains were indeed only half clothed with snow and their middle and lower reaches were still draining into the liver obviously there is a warming trend justin said but what is causing it there was a swirl of smoke larger and more ominous than metnas it ioimed into a giant diffuse demon i am causing it the demon announced proudly do ou have a problem with that edsel hesitated caution seemed best this could be an ugly customer for sine breanna said its flooding out the valley so much lot caution the demon swelled to a larger size glowenng down at her and who arc you dirt face uhoh breanna didnt like being put down im breanna of the black wave the girl said boldly and who the bleep are you hot stuff the demon swelled another size i am the demon cotwo and i like warming air i hate ice and snow then what in xanth are you doing here b the snow mountains airhead edsel opened his mouth to interject something but nothing came to mind he sa justin and pia similarly stymied breannas mouth had been too quick lor them cotwo expanded another notch you date to question me you burned up urchin i mean to abolish all cold air in xanth starting with the coldest that is here altei all the snow and ice is gone i will look loi other ice to melt until the whole land is warm pilrs anthom we dont like that foghead breanna said the demon swelled to yet more horrendous girth and hat do you propose to do about il toasted gamine we propose to stop you gasbrain she retorted the demon coto opened his mouth until it was wider than his head ho ho ho he laughed and how to you propose to do that now breanna hesitated im not sure but well do it and here is what i will do cotwo said i will blow you away and if you ever return i will tieat you unkindly you dont scare me you quartcrit breanna said uh breanna edsel murmured but it was too lale as it usually was in such situations cotwo bloated to gargantuan proportion then aimed his big mouth and them and blew the wind was horrendous it picked them up and literally blew them away they sailed heels over head through the air edsel didnt have time either to be seared or to try to eateh a naughty glimpse of one of the women they landed some distance downriver in the cold water unhurt but shaken para was inverted his duck feet waggling frantically in the air the supplies had gotten dumped or soaked that was fun ted exclaimed lets do it again monica agreed the adults shared a sigh as they helped right the boat and then dragged themselves out of the water at least they had found out what was causing the problem of rising water what they would be doing about it was a work still in progress good magician p ia shook herself off she hated getting soaked in her clothing she was shiveringly cold and their blankets were also hopelessly wet and dusk was closing what a mess para the duck looted boat was the only member of their party who seemed satisfied he was resting on the water untouched by the chill and undismayed by his dunking he was evidently not the smartest of creatures and liked being of service well she had never been one to mope ineffectively we need a fire a tent and food she said then we can strip and dry our clothes while we eat in comfort i can find some fireweed justm said i can make a tent from the blankets edsel said i can roust out some chocolate spiders breanna said peering into the darkness spiders pia said alarmed the girl shot her a dark glance youre a vegetarian no but she realied that she was in danger of looking like a squeamish female it was true she was plenty squeamish about bugs and other noxious notions but she didnt like admitting it maybe someone else would balk at eating spiders and then she could safely do so too okay ill make a hearth well letch wood demon ted said pitks anthony and pillows demonica agreed the children were getting helpful pia distrusted that but maybe such chores were their idea of fun the others scattered justm and breanna disappeared into the darkness while edsel scouted around tot sticks of wood suitable for ridgepoles he was good at things like that he used a rock to pound forked sticks into the ground put the ridgepoles into the raised torks and then set about stretching the sodden blankets across them the blankets would drip dry as tune passed and should provide shelter pia used a stick to scrape a section of ground clear then carried in stones to make a circular hearth the effort warmed her but not enough her teeth were still chattering ted brought in a number of dry sticks for the fire and pia thanked him he stepped on his own toes and almost blushed he didnt know how to handle thanks from an adult monica brought pillows they were dry and promised lo be useful for sitting on and for sleeping on later pia thanked her also and she reacted much the way ted had they were not bad children ust active and sometimes impertinent what was interesting was the way they brought these things each in turn held the locket they had found before and spoke to it out sticks or out pillows and the things had abruptly appeared before it that was a most useful and capacious locket justm returned with the rireweed this was dull green stuff but when he laid it in the hearth and said fire it burst into brightly colored flame the light radiated out blessedly warm then breanna returned with an armful of dark brown leggy substance it was hard to tell where she left off and it began pia forced herself to look and smell it was chocolate in the shape ot spiders oh she was glad she hadnt made a scene about that then one of the spidei legs moved pia stifled a scream oops i got a lie one breanna said she picked it up and carried it to the fringe of the glade they slough off their old skins as they grow and those are pure chocolate but i wouldnt care to eat a lixe one for sure pia agreed weakl the two children tittered she wasnt sure whether they were laughing at her imitation of breanna her alarm about the spiders they sat around the fire and warmed but their clothing temained clinging and clammy the others did not look an moic comfortable than pia felt she would have to lake the initiative let me make sure i understand she said standing up the adult conspnacy decrees that no child shall hear an bad words or see panties is that right that is correct justm agreed and no child shall be told or shown the secret ot summoning storks correct but he looked a little nervous as il distiusting what she was leading up to well none of us will be doing any of those things pia said but we do need to clean and dry our clothing so i am going lo wash mine she reached under her blouse and unfastened her bra then she drew blouse and bra oft together naturally both men stared at her bare upper torso but no undergarment had been shown so they did not freak out of course she knew from her subterranean experience with justm that bras alone did not do it but she didnt care to speak of that the children looked also but immediately went back to eating chocolate there was nothing interesting to see pia removed her shoes then drew down her skirt and panties together the eyeballs of the two men expanded by five pei cent and their jaws dropped by a similar amount but again no undergarment had been exposed there was no freakout and the children remained bored now i shall do my laundry pia said prhately reheed she hadnt been quite sure that she would get away with this and wasnt sure of the penalty if the conspiracy stepped in then i shall retire to a tent with edsel to keep me warm she carried her clothing to the bank ol the river there was a pause then she heard the reaction for sure no violation and in a moment bieanna joined her carrying her own bundle of clothing then at last the men oddly most reticent did the same the children being half demon formed their clothing from their own substance so didnt need to wash it separately there was a swiil of smoke for a moment pia was afraid that their fire had spread out ot control but then a pair ot eyes formed and it plhks athon coalesced into demon vorc he looked at the tour adults and his eyehalls too expanded a size as he surveyed the girls but he made no comment about time ted said its really boring here monica agieed so sec vore replied tomorrow metna will take you to visit robota both children clapped their little hands in delight then vore swept them up and puffed into swirling smoke one swirl was white another brown and their shapes were oddly suggestive as they dissipated did you see his eyes breanna asked one reflected a white nymph the other a brown nymph i wonder who those could have been pia said then they both laughed the men came up behind them if i heard correctly justin said we shall not have to babysit the children tomorrow thats a relief pia said however we have a small problem he continued we have just two tents and while edsel and pia can share one for warmth time to stifle this the conspiracy frowns on stork summoning when one of the parties is under eighteen pia said but i dont believe it says anything about sharing warmth does it ah no but so until your clothing is dry you had better stay close to breanna for warmth alter you both have suffered a chill this is merely routine common sense true but pia turned a severe glance on him you are not going to summon any stork are you ot course not but so there is no problem is there when he hesitated she repeated s there for suie not breanna said eagerly and hauled him off to a tent edsel joined her in the other tent and closed off the ends sometimes i think could get to like our style he said if didnt already love ou shut up and warm me she said but she was pleased their tacit deal required her to make him delinoush happv for the night and she knew exactly how to do that and was doing it now but sometimes she liked doing il better than other times she appreciated his recognition of the way she had sohed the problem of wet clothing he spoiled it by only one comment i wish could win ou back were not yet out of xanth she replied hinting that his ploy was not yet lost but it was a mere courtesy she still intended to divorce him after this was over then she would see about studying mundane cnvironmenlahsni justin was a continuing font of information and insight into all things natural but the things here were mostly magical she would need to learn the nonmagic variants poor justin he said he cant do this and he wants to so much maybe can educate him for she could say things to the man that breanna could not because despite her sixteen year old body she was not sixteen and there was precious little the adult conspiracy had left to show her sixteen she loved being physically sixteen again the merest twitch of this body could make a man flip she twitched edsel flipped ah there was true power he was completely unable to resist her and with the magic of this land she could freak him out whenever she wanted to just by putting on the right bit of clothing he thought he was having his will of her but she was having her will of him making him perform with desperate enthusiasm thinking every notion was his own how little he knew how little men ever knew in due course hdscl wore himself out and she was able to relax she had not thought lo bring any mundane stork signal interrupters but there were other ways if she were unlucky and it did guarantee edsels complete cooperation on the quest she wondered idly what it would be like to seduce justin she could surely do it if she chose but it would not be ethical and with her appreciation of the need to save the trees had come an appreciation of the rules of that game strictly hands off the companions anywav breanna was hei friend still it had been fun making both men stare she did not merely love this she actually reveled in this sixteen year old physique and wanted lo show it off while she had it once she returned to mundama she would revert to her real body that one was not as good her necessary consumption of sugai to counterbalance the insulin shots had led to some weight gam if this body was a thai one was an s and descending but maybe she would now have the stamina to do the dieting r purs anthony and exercise required to whip it back into shape working around her condition she slept surprisingly comfortable on the pillows in the warmth of the tent and edscls proximity theii session had really heated him up and that in turn warmed her in the morning she disengaged from edsets toofond embrace and went out to recover her clothes they were where she had left them hanging on sticks by the gently blazing fire and quite dry someone must have tended the fire during the night for it was in good order she put on her bra and panties then reached for her skirtand saw justin the man had evidently been out gathering more food and come upon her unawares and freaked out he was fully dressed standing frozen well she knew how to handle that interesting that the sight of her underwear itself had not affected juslm when he tended the fire in the night it was only such apparel on the bod that did it as was the case to a lesser extent in mundania like soda and ice cream it took a combination to do the trick what would be the effect of panties on a dressmakers mannequin there had to be some special magic because edsel was also affected as breanna had demonstrated when she mooned both men with her black panties edsel had seen similar sights many times before both from her and the steamy moies he liked yet in xanth he had completely freaked out so was it something in the air she donned the rest of her clothing then snapped her fingers the man recovered hello justin she said cheerfully as if there had been no break hello pia he answered unaware of his time out he set down the armful of pies and milkweed pods he had foraged they would have a good breakfast did you sleep well no need to go into the first half hour very well and you he fidgeted ii have never before been that close to aa naked girl whatever he agreed hallway emulating metna i ver much admire and love breanna but i was so sorely tempted toto his diffidence was charming but probably pointless let me ask you some things if two people both know the content of the adult conspiracy and both wish to indulge in an aspect of its mystery is thete any reason they should not she took one of his pies and began warming it over the fire well that depends on their ages if one xonl of contention but doe it doesnt the conspiracy govern what they may learn or say rather than what they actual do why surely it governs also what they do i breanna mentioned a man called ralph who was supposed to guide her to the isle of women last year who attempted to summon the stork with her why yes he agreed i was with her at the time in her mind she kicked him into para who carried him hastily away that was an ugly scene why did she have to fight him off i mean if the conspiracy is enforced in actions why couldnt she have just lam there and he would have been unable to violate it the same way we are unable to say bad words in her presence like bleep her pie was warm enough she took a bite he stared at her i never thought of that i dont know what would have happened i do she did need to fight him off which means that aspect is not magically enforced some things can be done but not spoken of such as natural functionswhich this happens to be she couldnt identify the flavor of pie what kind is this brownberry similar to blackberry but less so and with a mocha flavor then he returned to the other subject but surely it must be enforced because because it is enforced in every other respect maybe you are right in which case you dont need to worry next time you are with her dont hold back the conspiracy will stop you she decided that there was indeed a hint of chocolate and coffee flavor in the pie he was clearly nonplused but suppose suppose it doesnt then it must be because it doesnt apply to two people who are knowledgeable and willing and who love each other at least when both are at least sixteen doesnt that make sense but ive always believed ive always believed that magic doesnt exist she said sometimes longheld beliefs are mistaken i think the practical thing to do is to try a thing to see whether it works she sucked on a milkweed pod getting the fresh milk possibly you are correct he said dubiously justin you know an enormous amount about nature but not much about romance so dont take my word just let yourself be natural with piers anthony her and see what happens whatever happens must be right isnt that so perhaps it is he conceded she had finished her pie she was satisfied she had set out to educate him and might have done breanna a considerable favor in the process it was quid pro quo pia as monopolizing justin by day so she was enhancing him for breanna by night the flap of a tent moved breanna emerged oh i must have overslept she said it happens pia said not deceived the girl had been listening and she was no fool justin would be in for the night of his long life tonight breanna had no clothing she fetched hers and took it back into the tent she emerged a moment later dressed justin had been with her all night without clothing but this was daylight he seemed ahout ready to faint and of course the girl had done it deliberately she could have called for her clothing to be passed into the tent no fool indeed then edsel emerged from his tent what am i the last one up he asked oh the shame of it he was too theatrical he had been listening too pia grabbed his clothing and tossed it to him before he could come out the others ate and then they took down the tents and put the blankets and pillows in the boat together with the rest of the pies they were ready to travel but where should we go edsel asked we know what the problem is but not what to do about it the good magicians castle breanna said well ask him he always has the answers however there may be a complication justin cautioned for sure breanna agreed its a challenge to get in and he charges a years service or the equivalent for each answer but he does deliver justin said pia considered we cant do any years service were here for only a few days perhaps considering the importance of the mission he will make an exception justin said also considering who else is involved in this exchange bieanna said she meant nimby the demon x m justin nodded pertinent thought xoh or coniemios so lets go there pia said do you know the way for sure thats our jobto take you safely where you want to ј they got into the boat and it paddled oft downstream that was faster than the upstream trip had been soon they came to the slows and the rapids they moved out onto the land that was the nice thing about this boat it wasnt limited we had better check in edsel said its that time for sure breanna gave him the ear edsel and pia checking in he said into it then he put it to his own ear to hear its reply he looked surprised nimby and chlorine didnt check in yet well maybe they forgot well check again later he returned the ear do you think theyre in trouble pia asked com passion doesnt know there was no indication of trouble yesterday so maybe theyre just late maybe she agreed but this made her uneasy then the boat stumbled and stopped moving they hastily piled out and justin looked you are missing some toes he said appalled para bobbed his way of nodding but thats not supposed to happen breanna protested his feet are magically protected justin looked around no wonder he said advancing on a patch of milky white weeds you walked over lack toes its extremely intolerant even a protective spell may not suffice to counter it and if we had been walking wed be lacking toes too breanna said shuddering we must help para get his toes back especially considering that riding in the boat was an awful lot easier than walking but pia kept her mouth shut it wasnt a worthy thought doesnt xanth have healing springs edsel asked yes but none close by here justin said however i believe there is a quack doctor in the area pia started to laugh then reahed that he wasnt joking so she stifled it paras father was a quack edsel said and his mother was a dream boat breanna said so a quack doctor should be fine perhaps we can get directions justin said at that point a oung man came from the path ahead he wore a piers anthony loose shirt and saggy trousers pia was closest so she hailed him hello she smiled wmningly he paused young men tended to when she hailed them and smiled i am pia and i would really like some information i am don my talent is yes of course do know where the quack doctor is then she stopped to stare for a young woman now stood where the man had been she wore a shirt that was tight across the front and trousers that were tight across the hack changing gender at will she said thats his story i am dot youyoure the same person pia asked she had seen some amazing things in xanth but nothing quite like this the man reappeared with the clothing losing its spots of tightness his hair was tied back in a ponytail that could have applied to either gender yes i do know where the quack doctor lives thats her story right this way he turned and his hips flared he was becoming the woman again historyherstory edsel murmured as they followed i get iti think i guess she can see his story and he can see hers breanna said no battle of the sexes there but it does give new meaning to the term genderbender edsel said he would they followed dotdon along another path pia verified that the persons clothing did not change with the gender it was a unisex outfit that filled out in different regions according to the body beneath it probably a tunic would have been better because it vas more naturally pliable she wondered what it would be like if dondot wore no clothing edsels eyes would inflate at sight of the oman and deflate at sight of the man what kind of a romantic life would such a person have they passed a handsome tree edsel was about to touch its trunk but justin stopped him no thats reverse wood edsel paused does that mean what it sounds like yes breanna said think of antimatter edsel abruptly stepped well back from the tree antimatteitouch that and its total destruction not that extreme justin said but reverse wood is never to be taken tor granted it reverses magic and ou can seldom be sure what form that reeisal will take dot looked back i was delivered near that tree i think it accounts for my talent the first time i touched it it reversed me from a hoy to a girl and the second time the other way aftet a while i got so i could do it on my own don concluded i dont ant to touch it pia said im satisfied as a girl for sure breanna agreed reverse wood does not necessarily reverse gender justin said it may have no effect on a person and merely reverse some thing a person touches it to but i agree that we do not wish to experiment i am surprised to discover it here i had thought most such trees were destroyed some time ago that reminds me don said when i was really little this tree was a rotting stump then it formed into a gnarly old tree now its a mature tree healthier it is living backwards justin said reverse wood lives backwards that makes perfect sense though it had not occurred to me before they moved on and soon came to a shack where a number of ducks flocked an old man sat on a stool bandaging a ducks sore foot this was obviously the quack doctor someone to see you grandpa dot said the man looked up hello im owen cossaboon quack doctor what can do for you youre mundane breanna said yes i have no magic thats why im a quack but i do what i can he turned the bandaged duck loose we have a patient for you pia said she beckoned to para who had hung back the boat limped up oh you ran afoul of the lack toes owen said sympathetically thought we had cleaned out that patch but it must have grown back can you help pia hardly relished the notion of walking a long way instead of riding no but maybe my daughter can he turned his head and called sharon a woman in her mid s emerged from the house whatoh look at that boat plhks afhon para pia said thats his name he lost some toes has he eaten anything iroin around here no breanna said para doesnt eat yes i can help sharon said she came and kneeled by the boat she picked up an injuied foot and massaged it and us webbing extended youre healing it pia said surprised yes but its not much i can heal only other folks injuries sharon said a lew drops of healing elixir could do the same she picked up another toot its enough pia said she had seen a good deal of magic in xanth but it still could surprise her soon all the duck feet vere whole again thank you pia said much relieved what can we do tor you folk in return owen glanced at her we dont seek any return faors just being useful is enough just being in xanth is enough and thats one remarkable boat well ill give you something anyway pia said she leaned down and kissed him on the ear owen blushed that pleased her it meant that she still had it and it worked on strangers while she would have bridled if anyone had called her insecure she did appreciate evidence that she was as pretty as she had ever been thete was power in prettiness edsel fidgeled something was on his mind maybe im missing something he said but if sharon can heal a ducks feet wh did you have to bandage that other duck owen glanced at his daughter i cant heal local creatures sharon said i think its because of the ambiance of the reverse wood tree any creature who has eaten something here is immune to my healing but dad helps them it just takes more time they got into the boat well thanks again bieanna said we have to move on lo the good magicians castle you will have to get across the gap chasm owen said that may be a problem unless para can sprout wings oops i hadnt thought ot that breanna said but maybe well be able to imd the invisible bridge invisible pia asked not at all sure she liked the sound if it youll see breanna said cheerful or maybe wont see as the case ma be the moved out pia had to admit it to herself xanth was getting to her she liked it and she liked the people she was encountering here it was edsel who had made the deal to gel her here in the hope that it would change her mind about their mairiage she had deemed that a forlorn hope of his but his chances no longer seemed quite as remote if she could just keep her nice bodybut of course this wasnt reall her body it was a borrowed body better than her own they returned to the main path and headed south soon it ted into one of the enchanted paths so that they could relax thev would be safe as long as they stayed on it by about noon they reached it the gap chasm was an enormous cleft in the land dropping awesomely far down pia felt a bit dizzy and ill peering down the thought of crossing an invisible bridge hardly appealed how would they know where the edge of it was they ranged along the brink the bridge isnt right by the path breanna said this may be a long search pia was getting hungry is it safe to forage here perhaps i should accompany you justin said diplomatically fine he was always such a gentleman that she wouldnt hae minded his company even if she wasnt trying to learn all about nature they walked a bit away from the chasm those berries look good pia said they are excellent but not for eating he said those are thimbleberries useful for sewing he picked one showing how it was hollow and fit over the tip of the finger then she saw what looked like pies growing except that they had projections on the sides how about those now thats inteiestmg he said those are the very first of that variety i have seen in xanth i know them only from a description they are pie ears note the ears on the sides so that was what they were are they edible oh yes certainly but best to stay with the ones with ears wh she asked picking one without looking because when they have legs they she looked a pair of legs hung down from the one she held sudden the legs moved alarmed she dropped itand the pie ran awa into the brush they run away she said understanding yes or she was picking one with a smily face on its surface she lifted it to her opening mouth the pies eyes went round and its mouth formed an o of horror she set it down point made she picked one with ears they might hear hut the didnt protest the others came for pies ol their own then they settled down to do a thorough search lor ihc inisihle bridge but belote they got far there was a distraction first there was the sound a raucous screeching then there was the smell as of week old garbage uhoh breanna said perhaps it would be expedient to hide justm suggested we aie after all some distance from the enchanted path what is ita sick dragon pia asked worse breanna said they hurried into the brush but before they could get out of sight the horror arrived it was a flock of big ungainly birds no not birds they had human female anatomy they were harpies but not similar to handi harpy these were foul of mouth and feather look one screeched men they flocked to gawk at edsel and justm pia realied that harpies hamg very few males oi their species must be very hungry for male company that was probably why handi had been so nice to justm but these ones were so foulmouthed and filth that the would drive away most males of any species beware justin cried we have found a nest of stingrays youre bluffing a harpy screeched she hovered evidently about to fly at him pta wasnt sure what the dirty bird would do when she reached him but strongly suspected he wouldnt like it any more than the average girl liked being sexually harassed by men perceive it for yourselves justm said gesturing at a large glowing hie the harpies retreated evidently this was an effective threat whats a stingray pia asked knowing that it would not be the same as the sea creatures she knew of a crossbreed between a bee and a sun ra he explained the sting with laser beams so cant be readily avoided an aroused nest is a thing devoutly to be fled he stood by the nest holding a stick pia pictured a swarm ot angry bees these might well be worse they would surely rout the harpies but what would happen to the humans she hoped the harpies did not call justins bluff xonh of comtimion how could a bee and a sun ray interbreed edsel asked remarkable things occur at love springs that must account lor all the crossbreeds of xanth pia made a mental note be wary of love springs then she thought of something else you know those harpies could be useful not in any way i know of breanna said we need to cross the chasm and we cant find the bridge they could carry the boat across and us in it breanna agreed catching on but it would be one stinking trip pia glanced at the daunting crevasse maybe we could stand it for a while excellent point justin said then he called to the harpies we would like to make a deal are you threatening us a harpy screeched by no means we wish to cross the gap chasm and we havent found the bridge could you carry our boat and us across several harpies spun about to stare at the boat we could why should we what would you like in return there was a briei hubbub a million kisses justin was ready tor that my fiancee would object to that diplomatically phrased the harpies could assume that it was jealousy the dirty birds reconsidered were going to the circuss one screeched but it moved and we cant find it justin smiled as it happens i know its schedule i can tell you where it is this year they distrusted this this isnt the kind of thing you clean folk like we have our cussing contests there i am aware of that it is where you and the goblin males settle who has the foulest mouth in xanth thats it she screeched in agreement the towlest mouth carry us across and i will direct you to it no you dont the harpy screeched cannily tell us where lirst justin considered it is not inordinately far from our destination carr us and i will show you where then you can set us down and we shall go our way the harpies exchanged a dirty glance done the humans got into the boat and the harpies settled along its sides their soiled talons taking hold it was a good thing the wood didnt have nerves pia thought the smell alone was bad enough the creatures spread their dungy wings and heaved upward the boat lurched into the air and out over the precipice pia fixed her eyes on the boats floor not wanting to see just how precarious their situation was but after a while she nerved herself to look they were high over the depth of the chasm maybe the smell was numbing her wariness of heights because she found she could handle the view it looked clean and fresh whats down there she asked the gap dragon justin said matter of factly he eats most creatures he catches and he catches most that venture into his domain the gap dragon pia repeated weakly he took this for a request for more information hes stanley a steamer he breathes steam rather than fire or smoke that cooks his meals before he chomps them he has six legs and vestigial wings hes princess ivys pet her what it is a long story briefly he was youthemzed when they met and they became friends is that euphemized or euthanized youthcnized or youthened made younger because of an overdose of youth elixir he was a baby dragon so they grew up together its one of the better friendships of xanth he wont eat anyone she asks him not to this princess sounds like quite a girl oh shes a woman now with triplet daughters there was a jolting crash as if they had stuck a barrier pia clutched the seat gazing wildly aboutand seeing nothing what happened we hit a wall a harpy screeched in the aii pia demanded a wall of air were trying to fly around it i know of a couple called waller and wallette justin said thev build walls and their daughter wallnut makes wallpaper but hardlj think they would be working up here there was another crash on the other side several leathers flew another wall a harpy screeched indignantly now i think i know what it is justin said its an air compressor the walls of air squeee things between them and drop them into the gap now he tells us a harp screeched what can we do drop down as it squeeed out justin suggested then fly again when free ol it dead stick landing a harpy screeched suddenly they all folded their grimy wings and they and the boat plummeted pia felt as it she were floating and she hated it not too tar justin cried spread wings a harpy screeched together thev spread their wings suddenly the boat was braking pias stomach sagged down toward her leel but it was better than crashing forward another harpy screeched the boat surged ahead pia waited anxiously lor another crash but it didnt happen they must have dropped free of the air compressor she pried open an eyeand almost wished she hadnt they were flying toward a nearly vertical cliil it was the far wall of the gap they had descended into the chasm the wind of the harpies wings dislodged a small object rolling along the brink it dropped down into the boat and danced about as it hyperactive it looked like a small tin can whats this pia asked for the moment distracted trom the menace of the looming cliff lace breanna looked oh thats a teenage can a what you know a canteen throw it back oh then the boat lifted clearing the edge they were out and back over normal land pia picked up the little can and tossed it to the nearby ground she was reined to be across the chasm where a harpy screeched south justin said go toward the good magicians castle just how good s this magician pia asked justin smiled he is not a magician in the sense you may believe he is called good as contrasted to evil hes the magician of information he has a big book of answers that can answer any question well i hope he can answer ours one problem is that his answers are not necessaiily intelligible at first they arc always correct but sometimes a recipient does not undeistand until his adenture is over and tor that they pay a years service after struggling to get into the castle he agreed why docs he make it so difficult it is his way of discouraging frivolous inquiries he prefers not to be bothered maybe were wasting our time going there no i suspect it is the only way ordinary mortals are unable to deal with a surly demon she remembered the demon cotwo and had to agree and there is the castle justin said pointing ahead then to the harpies just south of here you will see the burnt foliage of the swearingin ceremony at any moment sure enough a blighted section of torest appeared below the harpies descended how can they cuss so villainously when our bad words get bleeped pia asked they are largely immune to the adult conspiracy juslin said in any event they are all adults so hae no reasonable limits but im adult and i cant say bleep you have the body of a sixteen year old girl which may affect you and you are in the presence of a true sixteen year old so cant speak with complete freedom pia nodded she had been speaking rhetorically having already caught on to this particular idiocy it made a certain nonsensical sense but she still preferred to argue the case but ive been telling you how to test the limits of the conspiracy why am i not slopped from doing that the conspiracy is very literal to a considerable degree words are more important than actions so there arc things you can do but not speak he was echoing what she had told him that morning perhaps having forgotten in his distraction so she argued the opposite case thais ludicrous actions have to be more important than words brcanna shares your sentiment she teels that the adult conspiracy is a vestige of idiotic misguided censorious foolishness but il has ihc slaying power of almost universal acceptance so cant be ignored for sure she said smiling he had now almost openly questioned the validity of the conspiracy bieanna would follow thai up with a engeancc tonight the harpies lauded the boat bumped on the ground thanks chumps one screeched you arc indubitably welcome fair creatures justin called back as they took off do they understand irony pia asked if they dont they will be truly annoyed because beauty is no compliment to a normal harpy bul they did help us edsel said and theyre not bad birds they could have dropped us when we had that trouble over the gap chasm pia hadnt thought ol that not bad birds she agreed weakly para knew the way and was heading north toward the nearby castle i guess it will be up to me to get into that castle pia said since its my quest it is true that brcanna and i are otherwise engaged as your companions and hae already been there justin agreed in fact that is where we first met he rolled his eyes reflectively what a dear girl what kind ol challenges did you face mare imbn put us together my mind joining hers in her body and we tackled them together we used parallax to locate the castle itself as it was concealed by illusion then we navigated a sticky situation answered some awkward questions and rescued mare imbri from a dream catcher the mam challenge was figuring out the actual nature ol the challenges we were encountering but gather they wont be the same challenges this time that is true there are always three ol different natures tailored to the querent querent the person or persons seeking an answer to a question querent she agreed since im mundane just about any magic thing will be a considerable challenge to me will i be able to gel through they are oral ted to be possible to pass but they arc ncer easy wits rather than power seem to be the operative lactoi id bettei have edscl along hes sharp with puns and riddles we will all come along including para but the challenges will surelv be directed at vou the boat approached the castle it looked conventional as such things went with a cleaied region a moat and an inner wall it looks peaceful enough pia said that ould he deceplie a toothy head on a serpentine neck rose from the water of the moat oh look breanna cried delighted the moat monster you like moat monsters pia asked her sure theyre an endangered species there are only three castles in xanth with ionnal moats and one of them is castle ombie which isnt suitable foi a living monster so its between castle roogna and the good magicians castle souffle shuffles between them but this is a difleienl one probably because i know souffle wouldnt really eat a person so the moat wouldnt be secure this one will eat a person pia asked feeling slightly unwell for sure isnt it great breanna faors the classic elements justm explained so much is changing in xanth that its nice to see some old conventions retained like people getting eaten by moat monsters pia said with attempted irony precisely this merely means we must not venture into the moat the drawbridge is down pia said yes that is the obvious crossing point so something will stop us from crossing it that seems likclv i wish we had a handbook with instructions pia said edsel reached out to pick something up maybe this is it she looked it was a bookmade of hands there was no print in it she opened her mouth i know edsel said quicklv setting the book down sick joke cant read it i guess it makes me an ill literate she had to smile it was hard to stay mad at him well lets just keep going and see what stops us para advanced toward the bridge but then a barrier of sorts appeared it seemed to be a low table with plates and bread set on it the butter knives were vellow in fact the seemed to be made of butter that figured the boat stopped as the table crossed the path and was a bit loo high tot the shoit duck legs to navigate in an event it wouldnt do to walk on a dininn table pia looked to the sides but they were steep and apparently slippery banks not suitable for walking across the wax was straight ahead beyond was the bridge which remained lowered pia climbed out ol the boat the others joined her has breanna been explaining this to you she asked edsel for sure he said with half a smile theyve been through it before so its really us who will have to handle three challenges this time well need to keep our wits about us this table blocks the way so it must be a challenge what do ou make ol if it looks like lunch at a restaurant but somehow i dont think were supposed to eat those tarts theyre not tarts theyre bread rolls roll roll roll your boat he said in singsong gently down the stream she stamped her foot this is serious ed what do ve do to pass the challenge whats the challenge j dont know he decided he had teased her enough there must be some hint of a problem and ol a solution we just have to see it for sure she said somewhat acidly lets experiment he sat crosslegged by the table and reached lor one of the pieces of bread it put down legs and ran away from his hand pia was less surprised than she would have been had she not seen the pic ears by the gap chasm the inanimate all too often became animate in xanth so youre not for eating edsel said what cue you for the things on the table came to hie rolls ot assorted tvpes and sies walked to the center of the table then one sprouted hands and picked up a little pastr cowboy hat putting it on the bread strutted around in the manner ot a tough cowboy a second one picked up a fancy ladys hat preening a third found a crown and started lording it over the other bread they seem to be playing a game pia said mystified acting out parts edsel looked at her by george i think shes got it he said stop clowning around pilrs antiion these breads are playing a game he said carefully a rollplaying game stop joking she snapped this is serious no joke pi see they have settled down it was true the bread was inert again without arms or legs edscts stupid comment must have satisfied a requirement but the table remained it must be my turn pia said she sat down by the table folding her legs carefully under her so as not to show more than was proper she reached for a roll it rolled away was that a puna roll rolling so she put out both hands attempting to corral another one it sprouted legs and ran away before she could catch it all right she said what are you for the bread came to life one roll picked up some cloth and draped it around itselt it walked across the table turned with hair and walked back then another took the cloth and walked the same way with exaggerated steps its almost sexy edsel said dont be coarse but his crude remark triggered a revelation they are models she said roll models all the rolls went inert the table settled into the ground and disappeared leaving the breads strewn across the path i think that did it breanna said you each figured out one of the buns i mean puns now we can eat the bread she picked up a roll and took a bite from it there was no protest pia felt uneasy about it but tried it herself the roll she picked up was just that inanimate bread she picked up the butter knife inserted the blade and broke it oil inside the bread thus buttering it she nibbled and it tasted fresh and good maybe the animation was illusion bdsel said this is good stuff there is a lot of illusion in xanth justin said it can be extremely useful it wasnt what i expected pia said but it was indeed a challenge for sure the other three said together they ate the rolls then moved on to the drawbridge it remained down and the way across the boat seemed clear except ior one thing xonf or comhvrion the moat monsters head was now beside it looking down the monster could readily snap up something that tried to cross they halted just shy of the bridge pia did not like the look of this maybe the challenge is to distract the monster so we can pass unmolested that might work edsel said but how does the last one aeross do it someone will hae to stay outside pia said maybe para maybe he can swim in the moat after the challenge is done it works tor me edsel said okay you cross while i distract he walked beside the moat until he got a fair distance away then he jumped and waved his arms hey snootface come and get me the moat monster glanced at him then turned back to the bridge it didnt moe para waddled out the other way then entered the water the monster glanced but made to motion in that direction it didnt care who shared the moat maybe we can swim edsel called instead of using the bridge he put a toe to the water the serpent whipped around it swam hthely through the water in half a moment it was there but edsel had hastily withdrawn his foot just testing he said sheepishly the monster writhed sinuously reorienting on the bridge it was clear that it could get there before a person could walk all the way across it edsel returned to the bridge but you know it might work if a person ran across he said it seems it is only humans the monster is after justin and i could distract it while you two raced across breanna suggested wouldnt that be cheating pia asked if it is you wont get across justin said the good magicians challenges cant be avoided by ruse or fraud but could be youd be alone in the castle breanna warned which is maybe okay and well wait for you but you need to be ready pia exchanged a glance with edsel lets try it she said they tried it justin and breanna went to the side and splashed the water the monster went after them they stepped back pifrs anthony do we risk it edsei inquired i she hesitated not at all sure this was worth the risk then a bulb flashed before her face i get it its another pun the human race were humanwe race acrossa human race he agreed so it must be okay ou cracked the code last one acrosss a rotten egg she cried and sprinted for the far side he followed and soon overhauled her but he didnt run ahead he simply paced her glancing to the side she looked the moat monster was swimming toward them its course about to intersect it was going to be close she couldnt speed up she was already doing her best and panting and she had a side stitch she just wasnt used to exertion like this id help you edsel puffed but then it wouldnt be a race and it had to be a race she nodded and struggled on the monsters head struck she heard its teeth clash right behind her then they were across and she felt herself tailing but couldnt stop edsel caught her and held her up we made it he said i dont think the monster really tried it knew we had solved the pun she just hung in his arms and panted there were times when it was niee to have his physical support as her bleary gae wandered across the moat she saw the monster sink under the water its job was done justin breanna and para crossed the bridge unmenaced they were not a true part of the challenge pia caught her breath and her balance and turned to look at the castle from up close the detail differed from what she had thought or maybe it had changed the stone wall was now rounded probably circling the castle and had arched doorways every few feet this seemed remarkably porous for a defensive rampart she looked at the moat there were docks extending into it all along as if ready tor many boats at once some were tall standing well above the waterlme others were barely above the water why the difference in height pia asked edsel shrugged must be high piers and low piers foi tall and short ships ships here its a moat she reminded him withcrmgly he nodded in any event we are past the moat so i dont think its a challenge xonl of contention maybe the third challenge is farther in edsel said we may be certain that it will manifest in its own manner justin said i think that breanna and i had better wait here while you explore pia walked to the nearest archway as she reached it a centaur appeared with a man on his back the centaur had a bow and the man had a spear you shall not pass both said together pia retreated i think it just manifested she said for sure breanna agreed let me try edsel said he walked to the next portal beyond there was the centaur without the man i regret to say that you are not permitted to pass he said politely pia walked past that one and tried the third aperture the man appeared forget it he said gruffly who are you she asked striking a winsome pose i am christopher christopher and you are i am pia putz she smiled and saw him soften are you sure we cant pass very sure christopher said regretfully not even tor a kiss the man looked truly reluctant not even for that she walked on to the next portal there was the centaur again or was it really the same one who are you cy clone the centaur growled now get out oi here before i throw you into the moat she retreated the centaur looked the same but didnt sound the same as the one who had braced edsel she rejoined edsel there seems to be a man or centaur blocking each passage they look the same but im not sure they are right they dont talk the same maybe theyre twins or triplets they dont attack they just warn us away she said maybe we should check the other arches you go one way ill go the other and well meet on the other side she nodded and set oil every portal was blocked there were two centaurs and several similar men the centaurs were shy and bold respectively or peaceful and violent evidently they trotted to whichever portal she was headed for piers anthom maybe there was just one man but he was everywhere either by himself or with a centaur she met edsel on the lar side all blocked she said more men than centaurs christopher throughout he said cy centaur and cy clone the mean one the same ones saw she said i suppose the centaurs could alternate sides but how could the man get around so swiftly he never looked out of breath edsel was thoughtful so is it one man or seeral with the same name and two centaurs or more than two i think this is our riddle do you think theres a pun were not getting from what justin told me the challenges dont have to be puns she said but if its not a pun then what there must be something about these people we need to understand like how many of them there are really maybe we can narrow it down he said lets go until we find two of them together then got it she agreed they circled together back the way she had come when they came to a mancentaur combination pia stayed to talk with them putting on her winsome air and holding their attention she had always been good at this sort of thing and with her lovely sixteen year old face and figure she was better because she knew exactly how to use these assets she had never tried fascinating a centaur before but they had enough human attributes to be subject to some wiles she smiled she moed her hips she gushed over their masculine appeal she lifted a leg to adjust hei shoe and leaned well forward showing ust enough thigh and breast to guaiantee continued attention it was a science that worked well enough in the land of magic meanwhile edsel taded away she gave him as much time as she could keeping the two males anchored in place then edsel returned she bid the males farewell with a last smile and jiggle and stepped back they departed the archwa and were no more she turned to edsel whats the story theres another set four arches down christopher and clone the mean centaur she agreed i had the sh one i almost made him blush once so there are two different centaurs and two ot the same men we have established a minimum she said could there be more i think thete could be but how can they be the same something was nagging at the edge of her mind suddenly it connected clone clones he repealed catching on one centaur one man but they can send clones out to intercept any doorway they might be illusions looking and sounding just like the originals but they certainly seemed solid pia said we could walk right through illusions but i wouldnt want to try it with solid folk for sure he agreed with a third of a smile ill bet the clones cover every portal instantly then the solid originals come to replace them as we talk that way just two can block a hundred entrances so when we see both together and talk with them they become the originals she asked i think so then how were we able to talk to both in two different places simultaneously he looked at her sometimes i think youre not a complete idiot that was his way of saying that she had caught him m an enor and sometimes i think youre not completely ugly she said returning tit for tat but how do we rise to the challenge there has to be a way he said i think that if we could fix the two originals in one place we could walk right through the two clones elsewhere because they cant really he in two places at one time only the illusion clones can zip instantly to new doors except that we both talked to them both she reminded him or can an illusion clone talk without a solid mouth or lungs i doubt it though with magic anythings possible maybe one of each pair was the original and the other was a clone i wonder she said getting into the problem she was exercising her intellect and edsel wasnt disparaging it she liked that she had necr been known or alued for her mind limited as it was you know those old cartoons where only the person who is speaking or doing pifrs amhomi something is animated and the others are just still pictures could they be like that so we can tell whos the clone pia id kiss ou except that you wouldnt like it by daylight he meant when she wasnt honoring their deal giving him everything at night in return tor his complete support by day part of what turned hei off was his clear superiority of brain but now thev were thinking together td like it now she said he was wary whats different now youre treating me like an equal he laughedthen quickly sobered realizing that it wasnt a joke have i been a fool all this time tit for tat you wanted the one without giving the other for sure he agreed without any trace of a smile she waited and after a moment he embraced her and kissed her he didnt try to grab a feel she gae back making him melt he released her oh pia she liked him a lot better this way her emotion was stirring after being in remission for some time she had always known that her body was her mam appeal but she didnt like being considered onl a body however this was not the time to get into this we hae a challenge to surmount more than one he said he reoriented one original one clone for each door which one were you talking to she focused on the memory of her recent dialogue now she realized something she hadnt noticed at the time the man christopher he reacted he talked the centaur just stood there i thought he was reacting but now i realize he was just there you adjusted your shoe he was of course well familiar with the move and loved it sometimes she thought he would rather sneak a peek under her skirt than see her all the way naked yes i think my parity showed at one point but they didnt freak out they must be immune for the purpose of this challenge the good magician must have had lovely girls try that dodge before to get past male defenders but i did hold their attention the mans attention anyway cy clone just kept looking as before i thought because he didnt look away that i was fascinating him but he was really a cartoon still figure talked to cv centaur hes smart and inteiested in mundane tech nology the man was there but i dont think he eer spoke so think he was the clone image we each talked to one real person and we could hae walked through the clone she agreed kcept that the real one would hae stopped us but something bolheied her we figure chances are that the first one we see in a dooiwav is a clone and that as we talk the original comes to take his place thats my theory the clones can go instantly spotting us hen the real ones come to stop us probablv pretty soon so we couldnt ust walk through the clones but they are responsive from the start doesnt that mean that the clones can be animated edsel paused may i kiss you again kisses for sex appeal i can handle kisses foi respect i like then youll like this one he kissed her again and there was indeed a special kind of passion in it then he worked it out it must be that the can locus on thcii clones seeing what the clones see and making them move and talk but ill bet the can do a meaningful dialogue only through one clone at a lime they must do it while they are closing in on that one to lake its place and we dont dare gamble that were talking with clones pia said lest we get smashed i suspect they wouldnt smash us but wed fail the challenge and never get in to see the good magician so we dont want to gamble now if we could just attract the originals then hold them in place while we went through a different door the moment we moved ovei so would they she said but i wondercould they be anchored through then clones anchored pretend youre one of them she said when i sa go ou turn around walk in a circle or something thats no pioblem but i dont sec go she drew up hei blouse showing her bra edsel stared as he always did after a moment he started to turn she leaned lorward he froze after another moment he tned to tuin again she lifted a leg he froze again when he started to recover she lilted her leg farthei his eveballs hcaan to elae anthony she resumed her noimal posture his expression cleared point made he said here in xanth ou hae power maybe i cant freak them out but might anchoi them in place for a while she said so they couldnt walk across to join the clones good notion but maybe ou would catch only one and the other would avert his gaze when he saw the othei ireczc and move in then you can take out the other let me do the man and you do the centaur but nobody would freeze if i did a striptease with your mind she clarified say things so fascinating that the centaur is entirely distracted body and mind he agreed smiling lets tr it first wed better get them both to one door then when we figure there there in the flesh we can go to a tandorn one and go into our act i think you have figured out the key agreed she kissed him if he had always been like this working with her instead of treating her like an object their marriage might ncer have been in trouble they walked to the nearest archway cy centaur appeared thev walked on to the next christopher appeared they went on to the next both man and centaur appeared now pia breathed anchor site how are you doing edsel inquired ot the centaur you shall not pass it was cy clone speaking without moving now is that nice of you pia asked the man its our assignment christopher said taking in her trim figure but otherwise he did not show animation these were clones being operated by remote control we believe we hae figured out the key to this challenge edsel said i doubt it clone said gruffly flicking his tail in a disdainful manner now he was real oh but we do pia said smiling at the man it has been such a pleasure to meet you howcxei thats nice christopher said leaning forward to take in more of the smile he was real too so now it was clear where the originals weie they stepped to the lell beyond the archway the two figures therein faded then the ran back around the archwav and on to the right trvmg x m ol conti mion to take out the guaidians about the direction they were taking they ran by several arches then paused close to one the man appeared a still image they ran on about four more arches later they found a set christopher and c ceniaui go pia said she was a trifle breathless but that would be no liability foi this they stepped close to the still figures hello chris pia said opening her blouse she saw that she had his immediate attention cy i want to tell you about quantum theory edsel said earnestly meeting the centaurs fixed gae it has some fascinating properties i had thought the theory of relativity was challenging with its insistence that nothing could exceed the speed of light in a vacuum and its permutations of time in gravity but quantum physics is truly weird almost like magic the gaes of both man and centaur remained fixed they were still clones pia stepped forward slowly removing her blouse she saw that edsel didnt look because the moment he did he would lose his thread of dialogue she liked that too peripheral vision was more than enough meanwhile he continued talking doing his part you see cy according to quantum theory you cant know both the position and the velocity of a given particle the mere act of looking changes things so it you take a snapshot as it were and fix its position it is impossible to know its velocity sort of like a clone not moving if you know where it is isnt that weird absolutely fascinating cy said unmoving meanwhile pia was nudging forward in a kind of dance step that made the upper contour of hei bosom jiggle there was a certain art to the effect christopher remained fixed another quantum effect edsel continued is that two particles separating from a common source are linked if something happens to one it also happens to the other though there is no seeming connection between them docs this make sense to you amazing cy said without animation pia having used up about as much of her top as she cared to hiked up her skirt showing increasing amounts of leg the mans eyes remained riveted though nothing else moved he was still the clone seeing what the clone saw but not theie physically it makes sense if you hguie that when ou measure a propeit of one particle you are actually choosing between realities selecting the universe wherein both particles ate the same new universes are thus constantly fissioning oil its a mindbending concept they are now making quantum machines that can do calculations much faster than anything else edsel continued they are very good at probabilities but the boundary between the realm ol quantum efleets and that ot the ordinary world we know remains elusive still study continues relatnity relates to gravity while quantum theory relates to the other three fundamental forces ot the universe some day it may be possible to combine them into one great theoiy ol everything perhaps the superstnng theory will accomplish that did you say four lorces total c asked pia was now passing chris she was up to her panty line but as they had conjectured he was not freaked out she did however have his whole attention she wiggled her bottom yes ot course edsel agreed gravity the weak atomic force the strong nuclear loree and the electromagnetic force but what about the fifth ioree what fifth force magic she was past chris edsel was now largely past the centaur oh i meant the lorces of mundama they dont know about magic there that would seem to explain it xanth could not endure without magic i agree its what distinguishes it from the dreary realm beyond it was time to wrap this up psst pia whispered were through through edsel asked dismayed i thought we were getting along so well together will you stop it through the challenge the two clones faded pia and edsel were indeed inside the castle i thought so he had been genuinely confused rather than making one of his shaip remarks she liked that as well she stepped into him and kissed him you did well so did you i didnt dare look i would have freaked out exactly lets go ask the question xone c hlonne rode behind nimby on the lemon cycle enoymg it he was quite competent now and obeyed all the obscure signs and signals of the road dug and kirn drove their ear behind there to come to the rescue if there were any problem exactly as justm and breanna would be traveling with the real edsel and pia through xanth keeping wary eyes out for mischief indeed there was mischief to avoid because the dnvers of other cars all seemed to believe that the whole road belonged only to them and that all others were illicit intruders they honked their horns and nudged in too close at high speed and made hand signals that chlorine discoered related to stork signaling in a negative manner but nimby forewarned ignored them and stayed out of their way that seemed to satisfy them they roared on by kirn had said there was something called a speed limit but chlorine must hae misunderstood because no vehicle on the road was honoring any possible limit they were traveling north to the appleaching mountains where they could sec the sights and camp for the night dug and kim had camping equipment in their car but the first night they would stay at a motel so as to be able to find the best place in the mountains the next morning after several hours chlorines thighs were getting tired ol the unfamiliar bouncing she knew how to ride a dragon but this cycle had a different feel and there was less leeway to fidget she vas glad when the mountains loomed knowing the trip was nearing its end thc pulled into the mundane motel and saw about getting a set ol rooms which turned out to be nice enough the would go out to a fleet fare place lor a meal but first kirn set up her notebook computer so chlorine could check in she had done so in the morning but that had been earh and there might be a response now she navigated the grid and mesh but then had a problem she couldnt get into the oxone she got an error message not available at this time let me see that kim said she tried it and got the same message must be a problem in the mesh these things happen we can tr again after eating they went to the eatery it was shaped like a vehicle called a bus but as larger signs all around proclaimed the wares they got really weird long sandwiches called submersibles stuffed with every kind ol oddity but they tasted good enough back at the motel they tried the mesh again they still could not get past the error message kim tried to query the mesh server but couldnt get a coherent response they dont believe in magic she said grimacing nimby looked unsettled chlorine knew what was on his mind he didnt like having his contact with xanth cut off he wasnt sure it was coincidence these things happen all the time dug said sometimes a server gets overloaded and is down for hours or days theres no malice in it just inadequacy for the demand or there can be a hardware or software hitch nobody likes it but soon enough sen ice is restored and the mesh proceeds as usual nimby made a trace shake of his head that was enough lor chlorine nimb has ver little magic here in mundania but hes very smart and he can tune in on much that is going on around him thats why he can avoid bad drivers he behees that this is not coincidental mischief dug frowned we need to get this straight kim and i can handle routine mundane problems but it theres something else well hae to be more careful just how sure is nimby about this and just how much of what kind of magic does he hae in mundania kim added chlonne had ascertained this soon after they arrived in mundania but hadnt thought it relevant he has no direct power ol magic here but can do just a little thought piojection enough to let me know what he wants when he touches me and can extend his awareness some distance out he can judge whether a thing is natural or contnved the mteiruption ot the oxone interface is beyond his range of certainty but is suspicious what makes it suspicious dug asked each demon is fiercely jealous of his territory when it is part of a bet and guards it rigorously een if he doesnt cate about the well are of the creatures within it if the demon e ih realies that nimby is here now he will surely try to embarrass him in some way the oxone interruption could be the first step in such an embarrassment embarrassment kim asked like saying haha i caught you no like trying to trap nimby here so he cant return to xanth right away and will lose the bet that would mean that edsel could not return to his body in mundania and probably that pia and i could not exchange places either not until the contest is done just what form would a confinementtomundania contest lake dug asked i mean it can hardly go on forever there must be some limit three days after the challenge is made the demon e in would seek to hold nimby that time and nimby would have to return to xanth within that time or lose what would that do to nimby a demon cant be physical hurt but it would prevent him from defending his status among demons and that would be a penalty sacrificing what has taken him a thousand years to achice the demon e ih would assume his status and become thethe closest analogy would be the leaderof the demons i thought i had this figured out but maybe not dug said how tar would the demon e go to accomplish this were not sure it depends on his judgment of the likelihood of success if he tries to trap nimby and lails he would lose significant status himself more than it he just lets nimby escape without challenge so he is likely to mask his effort making it seem like chance mishaps so that il he fails there will be no consequence to him he will play it amho that way unlil he discovers a better opportunity to succeed then if assured of success he will do what he judges necessary to accomplish it thai could be severe just how much power does he have kirn asked can he do magic too no magic he uses science he cant make people do things but can affect earth processes such as the weathei he can make thundei storms at least but a storm shouldnt stop nimby from leturnmg to xanth dug said that depends on the storm kim pursed her lips you dont mean just ram you mean like hurricanes if those arc very big storms yes and shaking of the ground earthquakes yes and similar effects it could get awkward for local residents such things kill local residents dug said i doubt the demon e ih would care so it will be better it it doesnt come to that and the best way to sec that it doesnt is to ensure that nimby can return to xanth at will so that there is no point in trying to trap him here got it dug said so maybe this xone interface problem isnt the demon e hs work but just in case it is we need to explore our options are there other ways to return to xanth other than through the grid and mesh i think so nimby touched her hand information llowed from him and there are other ways within the grid chlorine amended those would be easier other was kim asked through the xanth xone chlonne said assimilating nimbys plan but those arent real xanth people kim said theyre mundanes with pretenses not entirely they cant use xanth identities without the assent of the real folk there there has to be an affinity or it doesnt take hoo boy dug said you mean there teally is a connection between say the xone irene and queen irene a tenuous one its chlorine concentrated living to handle a concept that was well within nimbys scope but somewhat beyond hers like quantity physicals the halloween connection between the two aspics of a dividend photo dug angled his head working on that may ir he asked after a moment extending his hand toward nimby nimby touched his hand got it dug said like quantum physics the spooky connection between the two aspects of a divided photon what happens to one is reflected in the other instantaneously though there is no apparent association between them even einstein had a problem with that because dug kim murmured he smiled okay the point is there can be devious connections between two things having a common origin such as bits ol light or queen irene the xanth xone folk associate with their land of xanth counterparts but its not direct so they cant just say better half send help and have it understood kim said right dug agreed for he now had the full import of nimbys thought but in quantum physics sometimes you can do on a mass scale what you canl do in a single instance if many xanth xone equivalents send a message some may get through like scattershot kim said got it so whats the message it has to be masked chlorine said so as not to be obvious and thus alert dearth who kim asked sorry demon e ih or d earth we dont know whether he is watching the gigagnd but better not chance it so it has to be something that isnt obvious but will be understood in xanth coded dug agreed seeming innocent to those who dont know the background but an immediate alert in xanth okay kim said so whats the message to gm nimb cats dust chlonne said to giant motors what do the kim paused the good magician i get it but is that enough it contains the problem and the solution chlorine said in your vernacular as we understand it eating dust is to be in trouble close enough kim agreed but whats the solution to felch magic dust which carries the magic ol xanlh ii some of pilrs anthony that can he sent to nimby he will recover some of his power and be able to do what he needs to oh i sec in xanlh nimb is the source of magic but hes in edsels mundane body so lacks most ol his magic but with the dust it would be like a little bit ot xanth an island in mundama yes with that he would be proot against dearth for a while and could continue his exploration without concern got it kirn said echoing dugs comment lets get the message out she typed in the address and made her way to the xanth xone doing it ior chlorine because she was much faster this is salmon ella with a public message non spam for all xanth xone regs please send these four words to your namesakes only gmnimby eats dust she looked up anything else better clarify that it isnt done via the keyboard dug said oh yes she typed again this is afk effort will they understand chlorine asked anxiously well have to hope they do kim said we cant clarify it online because that could alert dearth but theyll be discussing it privately and a number should catch on and spread the word then theyll go to it with a will what each wants most is to have a genuine contact with xanth they should enjoy making the effort even il they dont get through how will we know theyre doing it chlorine asked kim laughed no problem there theyre already doing it look she turned the screen so that chlorine and nimby could see it mela merwoman i sent it i think i got through electra i tried dont think so draco dragon we winged monsters are taking off chlorine couldnt make contact will try again thats me chlorine said with a mixed thrill thats why she couldnt gel through kim said youre not in xanth at the moment yes so shes honest whals that punctuation you read it sideways its a face the colon is the two eyes the dash is the nose and the endparenthesis is the mouth oh its smiling yes kim said they can smile or frown or make variant expressions some get pretty sophisticated its a way of conveying enio tions in lieu ot the facial expressions we cant see what this means is that they are getting on it and word is spreading but it theyre writing about it on the screen wont thai alert dearth kim nodded probably so but he wont be able to do anything about it because there will be too many to catch he canl shut down the whole gigagnd nimby touched chlorine actually he could shut it down she said because electrical effects are part oi his power but nimby thinks he wont because he cant be sure this isnt just a game similar to others the xoners play and there would be quite a reaction if the whole grid collapsed dearth doesnt like to be obvious any more than nimby does its bad demon form he prefers to let the ants play out their antics on their own the demons see people as ants kim asked when they notice them at all chlorine said except ior nimby when he had to participate as a mortal creature and win one tear ot love or grief he got to know some of us and now he accepts us as people in our own right she smiled at nimby loving him but the other demons would step on us without knowing or caring were just an infestation in their territories well at least we know where we stand dug said shrugging now weve set the ball rolling we can get on with our camping trip chlorine looked at nimby who nodded yes we can have the fun we planned on knowing that dearth wont be able to interfere they rode and drove to the nearby mountains surveying the situation the mountains were impressive they would be able to disappear into their green forest and get the feel of mundane nature that was part ot what nimby really wanted they would come out here in the morning with their camping gear and have days and nights in the wilderness they returned to the motel and relaxed they watched the mundane gourd nimby paid special attention to the news learning everything he could about this realm they finished on a public service channel which had a nature progiam about the pollution of the sea why do they despoil it chlorine asked xanth is so much nicer people are short sighted dug said and corporations care for nothing but making more money but tolk are beginning to be aware and things are starting to be done anthom chlorine managed to get through her insulin shot without too much discomfort messmess but this is a pain she told nimby id rather be rid ol it nimb looked at her she nodded yes why dont you abolish it when you get your magic it wouldnt be hard to get nd ol the diabetes and maybe trim down some of the fat on this torso as appreciation foi letting me use this body it would be a nice gesture nimb nodded later when they were alone and in their room and she stripped away her clothing she had another thought i wish pantymagic worked here in mundama it gives a girl confidence for instance i could just whip away my skirt like this and treak you out unless you clamped your eyes shut just barely in time but as it is i cant impress you at all she went through the motions and sure enough he did not freak out of course he wouldnt have being who he was but still she would hae liked to make the etforl but she did after all make an impression putting nimby in mind of the stork and this time their summons was more competent than before that was an achievement because drear mundania did not enhance it by magic they had to do it all themselves next morning they rode out to the mountains checked in as hikers and set off with their loads of gear along the appleaching trail the scenery was beautiful and every detail was special it had resemblances to xanth except for the lack of magic they had to use a special salve to keep the biting bugs oft there was no spell to banish them there were no dragons griffins or harpies in the sky only birds and small ones at that late in the day they camped pitching cozy minttents and watching the colored sunset had forgotten how much lun this was kirn remarked i hadnt dug said it was the first lime i got you into the sack that too she agreed why would he want to put you in a bag chlorine asked dug and kirn laughed mundane men have this quaint notion that women should be kept so they try to stuff them into sacks kim explained and foi some reason the women dont like getting stuffed dug ameed its called the war ol the gendeis and were winning kirn said fortunately the men dont yet know that chlorine shook her head mundania is a strange place well its not xanth but its bearable on occasion kim set up her little computer you can use that with no connection chlorine asked surprised thought that without magic it wouldnt work alone no magic its a notebook with a good battery and satellite link no problem sure enough her screen lighted and print appeared she moved through the linkages the oxones back we can check in again chlorine checked in leaving her message all is well then they closed as kim said it wasnt good to run the computer too long on batteries but reassured they lelaxed dearth had not caught on and they were not under siege it had perhaps been a lalse alarm still chlorine was glad they had made the effort of contact through the xanth xone if dearth was aware that might be the reason he was letting it go reahing that he couldnt entirely block the connection to xanth in the night it rained it was a sudden booming thunderstorm with shaip winds that brought down branches and the ram was torrential the tents were well pitched but a tluke of drainage softened the ground and let a peg on dug and kirns tent pull free and their tent collapsed in the darkness in the storm they couldnt do much about it except huddle under the canas and they kept reasonably dry but in the morning they discovered that some baggage had gotten exposed to the rain and soaked through the clothing would dry but the notebook computer had been shorted out and was inoperative it would have to be taken to a shop toi repair before it could be used again the computer had been put in a corner of the tent nearest the washed out peg the coursing water had made a channel that oriented on that corner with eerie precision almost as il nature had intended to nulhl the little machine dearth chlorine said grimly nimb nodded they had relaxed foolishly and now they were in trouble for chlorine knew that this was merely the second step after the oxone interruption of a program ol isolation and containment by the demon e he intended to trap nimby here and surely had other mechanisms to enforce that nimby pointed at the sk theie overhead was a shape in rainbow pifrs anthony colors but it was no rainbow it was a full circle with two lines bisecting it forming a cross the symbol for earth chlorine said it is the challenge nimb must get out of mundania within three days of this moment or he has lost and dearth has already handicapped him by taking out our computer contact dug said demonic timing of course now dearth believes he can win think we are not going to enjoy the next few hours kim said those were surely true words robota dsel really liked the way pia had warmed to him during the challenges and all because he had shown some rej spect for her mind if only he had realied that that was what she wanted all along they would never had drifted into marital difficulties wait for us breanna called she and justin were coming through the novv unguarded portal how did you ever do it we just saw you talking and then you were through sex appeal and quantum physics edsel said we distracted them pia clarified the guardians were only clones for sure breanna said uncertainly they turned to enter the castle proper now that they were saiely beyond the wall a woman was coming toward them oh theres wira the woman paused as they approached hello breanna and justin she said she turned to the others and you must be edsel and pia i am wira the good magicians daughter in law wira cant see you breanna said but she can hear you youre blind edsel asked before he thought i mean arent there healing springs he broke off afraid he was being crude fltrs avthom i am naturally blind wira said so cant be healed but i am happ here and humfrey and his designated wies arc nice designated whats pia asked sharply wira smiled the good magician has had a long life he married and lost rive and a half wives then got them all back together now they take turns being with him and the current one rose of roogna is here this month rose of roogna edsel asked isnt that the name of the capital castle yes she lived there for a long time until she married humfrey she grows magic roses she is especially nice wira turned and led the way through the castle a comfortable gray haired woman met them her ban was coifed to resemble a rose flower hello i am rose let me feed you before you see humfrey they sat down to a meal of rose hips and rose wine along with rose potatoes and red gravy there was rose scented bread with rose petal jelly it wasnt the most conventional food but it was good rose was a good hostess who seemed genuinely to enjoy their company though they were strangers to her that was an ait not eery person had the next step you two must take alone breanna said justin and i would only be in the way then wira conducted edsel and pia up coiling stairs to a dingy cubbyhole a gnomish man hunched over a monstrous tome edsel let pia talk as this was really her mission she stepped forward good magicianhow can we get rid of the demon cotwo the little man looked up his set features softened as he oriented on pia she had that effect on men of any age my dear you cant ask another question but this is the one i need she protested her lower lip beginning to tremble ive got to have it please wira murmured nervously dont argue with him it makes him grumpy i dont care if il makes him explode pia said sounding hysterical the trees are diowning and weve got to save them edsel stepped in maybe i can iincsse this he said quietly to pia this came under the heading ot supporting her complete then to xom conti mn humfrey what she means is there is a crisis we want very much to alleviate and we hope you will be able to provide us a means is there some way we can accomplish our objective the good magician oriented on him the gnomes direct gae was disconcertingly savvy well put what you require is the magic locket which is one of the stray artifacts with imbued talents irom the ancient city of hinge hitherto only bracelets have shown up but now so has the locket put the demon cotwo therein and it will lessen his power sufficiently to eliminate the melting without putting all xanth into deep freeze magic locket pia asked you have seen it humfrey informed her gently the half demon children have it boirow it from them lor your purpose now consult with my assistant to arrange your service that may be complicated edsel said you see we but the weathered old eyes had already returned to the tome the good magician had tuned them out this way wira murmured they followed her out of the cramped study and down the stairs to another chamber a man and woman each in the neighborhood of thirty stood to meet them as they entered this is the good magicians assistant magician grey murphy and his wife princess ivy wira said then to the others edsel and pia of mundania here as exchange visitors glad to meet you grey said advancing to shake hands he was a nondescript person who would have been unremarkable except for his magic i was raised in mundania myself i was frankly glad to get away irom it not just because oi ivy the princess smiled she had long greenish yellow hair and blue eyes i visited it but do prefer it here in xanth sit down we must talk they took seats on the large toadstools in the room we are supposed to see about our service tor our answer edsel said but we cant stay in xanth for a year much as we might like to humfrey knows that ivy said he always knows and things always come out well your service can be performed m as little as a day but it is vitally important pia began to relax a day we can handle but why would anything important be left to mundanes we hardl know anything about xanth really we depend on oui companions lo keep us out of trouble breanna and justm hae not deserted ou i said this just happens to be something rather special and private and especially suitable for mundanes grev said because vou have so little direct connection to xanth this is a peculiar qualification edsel said it is a peculiar mission grey said earnest are you familiar vith the concept of temporal paradox you mean traveling back in lime and murdering our grandfather edsel asked yes any change to a persons own present status would be as difficult but here in xanth the rules are different we can in our fashion travel in time and we dont necessarily honor the laws ol paradox thais what makes this mission so awkward you want us to travel in time pia asked alarmed nol you grey said me but i am concerned that i may do something that changes xanths present situation and might nol know it how would you know it edsel asked to you in the present whatever existed would seem to have always been the case exactly i might retain a memory of the other situation but no one else would believe me and if did something that caused ivy not to exist he shuddered whatever would possess you to take such a risk pia asked assuming its possible which i doubt i must bore you with a bit of spot personal history grey said my father is magician murphy who makes things go wrong my mother is sorceress vadne whose talent is topology seeral centuries ago murphy tried to wrest the throne of xanth trom the legitimate king for which he was retired to the brain corals pool for indefinite storage vadne resented millie the maids appeal lo the xombie master and topologically converted her to a book for this she too was banished to the pool during the time ol no magic the two escaped pool confinement and made a deal with com pewter he enabled them to go to mundania where they could not be apprehended but there was a price they had to give their future child to pewter lor lifelong service i am that child but how could ou be committed to such a thing bdsel asked you didnt even exist people of honor fulfill their deals grey said pewter performed a real semce for my parents that enabled them to live good hcs in mundania and enabled me to exist we recognize that debt but people cant he traded tor favors pia said grey shrugged those who feel that way should of course refuse to make such deals but il they do make them thev should honor them so you serve pewter pia asked unpleased no my service was preempted by that to the good magician since this is a permanent position the matter has become moot so you found a way to wiggle out of it pia said technically yes but i do feel i owe pewter something hence our present agreement i will perform a significant service lor him that only i can do to make up for the service he lost because of the delicate nature of it he is amenable to this and will consider the deal my parents made to be complete plea bargaining pia said or accepting reality ivy said pewter knows hes never going to get grey full time and this is a lot better than nothing greys good will is essential and the good magician goes along with this she asked he prefers to have me free of potentially awkward obligation this will free me edscl was getting quite curious just what is this significant critical thing you will do that maybe involves paradox i will conduct a creature of pewters creation to xanths past so she can learn something pewter wishes to know the journey would be extremely difficult to accomplish without my assistance because my talent of nullifying magic is necessary at some points however you could change pewters pastand therefore his present edsel said catching on you might even cause him not to exist gre nodded this is not a mission a person would send an enemy on as it is i do feel i owe him a favor and i am amenable to acquitting it in this manner he knows he can trust me to do my best to accomplish it without trying to nullify him i have my own reasons to see that the present situation is maintained he glanced at ivy who smiled back how do we fit in pia asked we need to provide more background first iy said the danger oi inadvertently changing the present is unavoidable grey said i will not do so intentionally but the effect could be just as sevete if i made a mistake but it will be very difficult to avoid that risk because not on will i be in the past where the consequences of m actions will not be immediate apparent but when i return to the present others may not believe that any change has occurred so it probably will not be possible to correct it id be extremely nervous pia said am but this is a necessary risk if i am to acquit my obligation so we hope to establish a safeguard we behee that though regular xanthians will not be in a position to kno whether any change has occurred mundanes who have no historical connection to xanth ma be more objective they should be able to see any changes because they are not affected thats us pia said how hdsel asked com pewter can set up a liaison a mental connection between us so that the two of you will be able to tune in on what the two of us in the past are doing then it you see xanth changing around you you can notify pewter who will send in another person to go to the past to try to change it back or get me to change it back if you see no change we will know that i have succeeded in avoiding incidental mischief and that reassurance is just as important edsel said to know you have succeeded cleanly yes the consequences of failure would be no less horrendous for being unknown without that assurance we couldnt risk the mission edsel whistled i wouldnt care to risk it in any event pewter has assessed the risk and believes that it is minimal with these precautions we have to assume he is correct and i guess wed better go along with it edsel said because there arent many mundanes traveling in xanth at the moment and we do owe lor our answer pia agreed so how does this work edsel asked we will go to pewters cave where he will use his power of reality alteration to establish a connection between the two ol us and the two of ou you will be comfortable in fact you will be able to walk around and talk with each other as long as you remain with pewters sphere of influence you will know whatever we do as if vou are seeing it yourselves even when ouhave natural functions pia asked distastefully the other person with whom you will identify will not have natural functions grey said edsel shut his mouth sure that no comment on pias own nature was intended not have pia asked shes a golem i said made ol metal and cloth animated for a purpose alive conscious but not fleshly her name is robot a we call her robota and what will she be doing in the past com pewter is studying the processes of weathei grey said he is vulnerable to electrical effects such as lightning and wishes to learn how to control them robota has been cralted to have the capacit to comprehend magical weather but needs to observe it in action therelore she is to be sent to observe the storm king who governed xanth before king trent took over in the year he had great power ovei the weather and she can learn more from him than perhaps any other person because talents do not repeat in exactly the same form this is the only person who can show her this so she will go there to study weather you are risking xanths very history so that pewters golem can study weather edsel asked weather is important to us all ivy said now that pewter is a nice machine he will use the information tor beneficial purposes we could use some more information about hurricanes pia said they do millions of dollars worth ol damage every year less so when theres an el nmo edsel said but that does other damage and we understand it even less since our weather has magic components its more complicated ivy said so we do feel its a worthy mission edsel nodded the weather affects history too sometimes drastically now we realize that much of this observation will be dull grey said but ou will be able to skip over parts it will be like he paused evidenll searching his distant memory of mundama for a suitable analog fastlorwarding a video recording past the commercials pia said exactly he agreed smiling at her i havent seen a video in in thirteen years he shook his head how time flies when youre having fun ivy inquired of course he agieed quickly edsel and pia laughed those two ate defimlelv married pia said purs anihom indeed we are iy said and here come our children thev are three years old nov three little energy balls hurst into the room one was in a green dress she ran into ivs embrace and edsel saw thai her greenish blond hair and blue eyes matched those of her mother another was in a brown dress she ran to hug her father and her brown hair and brown eyes matched his the third wore a red dress her ted hair and green ees matched neither she paused to gaze at the visitors then went to hug pia and that was where her green eyes matched pia accepted the hug she couldnt do much else but she seemed uncertain she had never had much to do with children they were by her definition incompatible with sex appeal this is melody ivy said setting her child on her lap the three hae a joint talent melody began to hum a ague disturbance appeared in the center of the room this is harmony grey said setting his child on his lap whatever they sing and play together harmony produced a little harmonica and began tootling on it in harmony with her siblings humming the disturbance became an opaque cloud with projections in the shape of a model castle and you have rhythm ivy said to pia she resembles her cousin dawn physically the three together make things real rhythm produced a little drum and beat on it with her lingers pro iding a cadence the music became better defined though hardly expert the shape in the center became a castle made of candy it was rather like a childs drawing with the walls somewhat askew and the gates uneven but thete was no doubting the cookies and pastries and the gumdrops that formed its substance of course this is illusion grey said they arent up to solids yet but in time they will be able to make a real castle of candy but theres no chocolate pia said all three girls focused the castle melted a bit then firmed up as solid chocolate oh you little darlings pia exclaimed hugging rhythm but that broke the childs concentration she lost the beat and the castle collapsed into a pile of chocolate rubble then it dissipated as the rest of the illusion crashed nevertheless impressive hdsel said congratulations girls all three little princesses tried to blush all they achieed was patches of red on their foreheads but surelv that too would impiove as the matured in body and talent but now we must go to see com pewter gre said im alraid we shall have to leae the children here with wira the three looked unhappy then the began to hum plav and beat and a dark thundercloud formed we have transportation hdsel said quickly paia the duck tooted boat plenty of room for them iy considered well in that ease the cloud dissipated and sunlight replaced it the toom was closed without a skylight the beam appeared from nowheie the three girls jumped down and mn for the door they will be a handful as they age edsel murmured to pia as the followed for sure she agreed faintly looking bemused they went outside there were justm and brcanna with para boat duck foots cried the three children respeetivel running to overwhelm the boat with attention para seemed to like it there was ust room for the six adults with the children scrambling around the edges to com pewters eae please grey said the boat started moving but it was somewhat slow and clumsy there was too much weight toi the ten feet to handle comfortably i will fnhance you iy said she put a hand on the side of the boat the craft steadied and the motion became smooth and swift thats her talent breanna explained enhancement she can make anything do better edscl was inteiested if i may ask whats our talent he asked grey i nullif magic of course i dont use it unless there is a magical threat danger ahead pia said tersely her talent is to know whats inimical edsel said just as mine is to modify or deflect other talents wed better check there appears to be a break in the path ahead justm said they looked it seemed that a recent storm had washed out the magic pn rs athox markers and part of the enchanted path had been erased a fire dragon was lurking theie waiting lo pounce on whoever entered the unprotected section para halted grey got out ot the boat and walked to the bad section the diagon pounced seeming about to devour him then the dragon fell over whimpering its tail twitching like that of a wounded snake these morsels are not for ou grey told it go and hunt elsewhere and our powers will return the dragon struggled back to its feet and limped away as it did so it recovered and soon was full functional again it turned to face grey inhaling it was about to blast him from a distance i wouldnt grey said calmly the dragon reconsidered it turned about and departed good decision iy said dragons are magical creatures and will soon die without their magic grey found the scattered markers and replaced them along the sides of the path these are depicted he said ivy went there and touched each marker shes enhancing them breanna said so theyll be as good as new edsel was impressed neither grey nor hy had magic that showed ordinarily but when they had reason to use it it was powerful that was ot course why they were called magician and sorceress the journey resumed this robot golem im lo identity with pia said exactlv who and what is she robota gre answered this requires some background seven yeais ago there was a game of companions wherein two mundanes visited and one won a talent i know pia said that was kirn we know her that was when dug helped the black wave find a good place to settle in xanth breanna said yes in that game required considerable coopeiation from a number ot entities among which was com pewter in exchange for that assistance he was given a numbei ot magical parts from which he and his mouse tristan assembled robola she is endowed by her creator with a poition of his magic abiht to change local reality she can do it onl in relation to herself however and even so her power is limited that might be considered hei talent she also has a remarkably analytical mind onented on weather as she is a weather golem this mission will be the completion of her training and education thereafter she will be to weather what grundy golem is to languages grundy pia asked he was made from wood and string ivy said but later the demon x made him teal and he married rapunel their child surprise can do almost any magic onceand only once grundy is a tianslation golem so he can speak to and understand any living creature including insects and plants it would put him in contention tor magician status if he were a man but you said he was made real so isnt he a man now ivy was surprised why yes i suppose he is and how am to identify with a creature who isnt alive grey stepped into the dialogue in xanth the distinction between living and nonliving can be obscure for sure breanna said consider the ombies robota is animate grey continued she is not flesh but she is conscious and motivated but if shes a machine pia said machines are people too your connection will enable you to see through her eyes hear through her ears and feel through her hands and feet you will not have to think of her as alive if you preler not to but we leel its not a relevant issue pia let it go but seemed unsatisfied meanwhile they were moving rapidly thiough the forest it seemed that com pewters cave was not really far from the good magicians castle and the enchanted path facilitated travel before long they approached the area an awful noise sounded ooogah thats the invisible giant grey explained he guards the cave pia sniffed what is that bleeping stench he doesnt wash ollen enough ivy said but soon well be in the cave the ground shook oooga he has a heavy tread breanna said but he wont step on us he knows us she lifted her hand and waved upward hi giant hi returned from the sky deafenmgly you look great as ever breanna called the invisible giant laughed the sound tolled around the landscape clashing off mountains and flattening valleys purs anthon the eame to a hole in the wall para lan in and they were surrounded b darkness then it opened into a chamber where a eolleclion of junk la ith a glassy screen sticking up in the center the boat stopped and they got out the children clustered around the screen hello com pewter gre said we have come with observeis to handle the mission the screen lighted hello magician grey murphy who two mundanes who will not be affected by changes in xanthly circumstance excellent here are edsel and pia mundane grey said introducing them on service for the good magician they have almost no prior experience of xanth and will return to mundania soon excellent the screen repeated i am aware of their identities because i maintain the oxone there is a message from chlorine they suffered an interruption in contact but later it was restored they are satisfactory thats a relief edsel said a puzzle pattern appeared on the screen evidently tor the amusement of the children grey turned to ivy why dont you and the children return for us this time tomorrow we will she agreed kissing him she turned to the companions do you wish to remain here or return with us breanna hesitated i think wed better stay here just in case may we use the boat then sure if para wants to go breanna said he has more than returned the favor we did him ivy departed with the children now two new figures appeared i am tristan troll the tall ugly one said pewters mouse the other was a tiny woman who resembled ivy as an elfin princess and i am robota she said pewters golem pia looked down at her you look alive the small figure fued and reformed in full human size looking more than ever like ivy it is mostly illusion am a creature made for a purpose given the abilities i need to fulfill that purpose for example i have been programmed to speak three mundane dialects english french and italian you speak english ver well pia said evidently startled robota laughed i am not speaking it here you are not speaking it here but ol course i am pia said its the only language i know when you enter xanth grey said you speak the human dialect of xanth all people do whatever their original languages it happens automatically it is part of the magic of xanth its true bieanna said it happened to all the members of the black wave when we came to xanth when you try to talk across the magic boundary its like gibberish edsel was as surprised as pia we were never aw are of any change there is no need to be grey said but when robota and i pass through mundania ve will not be intelligible and will need to handle the local dialects i will translate for you robota said and speak for you using your voice fortunately we wont be there long grey said why go there at all edsel asked i thought you were to travel back in time grey smiled that is the most convenient way it is done the interface between xanth and mundania is temporal as well as spacial we shall leave in our present time and reenter in the lime of the storm king robota is attuned to the key times this is weird pia said but feasible the screen printed like the adult conspiracy breanna muttered so what do we lvo observers do edsel asked you will be made comfortable here tristan said pewter will provide for any special needs you have simply tell me and it will be arranged m credulity is straining pia said i think id like to go home tristan didnt blink describe your home justin smiled you will like this well its a garden variety house pia said we each have an office so i can do the accounts and he can do the programming without getting in each others way we have colored carpeting on the floors and pictures on the walls she continued to describe their house in greatei detail evidently feeling nostalgia purs anthom edscl noticed what she did not as she spoke the house was foiming around them she hadnt clarified that their to offices were in different rooms so here they were side by side alcoves in the same room but otherwise correctly appointed there were pictures of flowers and lakes by hei desk and pictures of his lemon motorcycle b his desk plus a sexy pinup calendar pia finally noticed yes thats it in a way she said but its all illusion of course no this is temporar reality tristan said this is my masters power and its some power breanna said reality of course not pia said she walked to her desk and slapped at the chair probably expecting her hand to pass through without resistance instead it struck the chair she stared then she touched the desk more carefully then she lilted a picture from the wall its real for sure i told you edsel walked to his section his things were real too he tried to modify it using his magic talent but nothing happened ordinary magic ean not overrule magician caliber magic tristan said com pewter is supreme in this cave except for magician grey of course but if you wish anything changed no this is just fine pia said it really is pretty much like home then perhaps we should begin grey said if the two of you will touch the two of them the connection will be established tristan said to edscl and pia wait pia cried alarmed do we lose our souls or something i assure you this is not the case tristan said this is merely a link between you so that the two observers will always know what the subjects are experiencing and do they also know what were doing pia asked sharply no this is one wa onl my master has been as yet unable to develop the magic required foi two way temporal communication that a relief pia said edsel agreed though he didnt say so they went to stand before grey and robota edsel extended his hand to grey and pia extended hers to robota when edsel fingers touched greys he felt an electric tingle that was all thats it pia asked sounding almost disappointed close vjuir ees and look tristan said edsel closed his eyes and tried to see he saw himself standing there with his eves shut startled he opened his eyes and for a moment suffered a double image then the view of himself faded and his vision was noimal again i was seeing through your eyes he said to grev yes the magic sends to you then you ean tell com pewter especially when there is anything alarming i dont like to ask this question edsel said but i think i must suppose you die grev smiled that is unlikely in xanth because of my magic and robota of course cant die though she could be destroyed but it is possible in mundama and i admit i am nervous about that aspect of our journey if it happens your awareness will go blank then i regret that it will fall to you to advise the others advise me tristan said i will advise the others i hope that doesnt happen edsel said this is becoming much more serious than expected we believe that the mission can be safely accomplished tristan said in any event there is no personal risk to the two of you it would not be ethical to subject you to that yet you are subjecting xanth to the risk of serious change grey gave him a straight look not if you are sufficiently vigilant edsel shut up he would do his best though he sincerely hoped that nothing went wrong his knees felt a bit weak com pewters screen lighted do it grey nodded perhaps i should carry you at this stage robota yes grey picked up the golem and tucked her into a shirt pocket he turned to the exit tunnel he took several steps then paused turning hack if i discover a problem i dont believe we can handle i will signal you like this he lifted his two hands in a gesture as of prayer that will mean to send help if we see that well tell tristan edsel agreed but i sincerely hope its not necessarv i hope so too tristan said because i am the one who will have to go there and i do not feel competent as a tioll i know the feeling as a mundane edscl said grey turned again and walked on out of the cave edsel suddenly uncertain about the connection closed his eyes and pitrs concentrated he saw a light growing and realized that it was at the end of the tunnel it was the opening as grev approached it then daylight was around him the connection is working he said relieved as he opened his eyes i know pia suid gre closed his eyes again and found his vision sailing up into the sk he stumbled almost tailing until someone steadied him it was breanna somethings wrong he said for sure i hope youre not sick perhaps you are seeing the invisible giant picking them up toi transport tristan said oh edsel felt foolish yes i forgot about the giant perhaps it would be easier if you retired to your office and sat down tristan suggested edsel was feeling giddy yes greys images and mine dont mesh perfectly its like motion sickness he walked to his den and took his chair pia did the same with hers now breanna taued to tristan its going to he a long wait how about some solitaire perhaps we can connect with terian and com passion tristan said sounding pleased edsel tuned them out and closed his eyes again now he saw the land of xanth coursing by below it was a patchwork of jungle lake and field he realized that the legs of the giant must be between him and the land but they were completely invisible so it was like low level flying soon they approached the boundary at the northwest region what in mundama was called the florida panhandle the land came up grey was being set down he turned and waved probably to the departing giant maybe the giant waved back grey turned to look at the nearby sea it was changing color from blucish to greenish then sudden grev ran west away from xanth mundane foliage surrounded him are you ail right robota gre inquired patting his pocket im fading she answered but i will not lose my magic entirely keep me near your ear so i can translate for you grey walked on the scenery did not look like florida kdse opened his eyes are thev in the right place i dont rccognic the landscape tustan looked up from his card game the are in the land ou call italy circa it i have oui numbers conect pia exclaimed opening her eyes you mean like a century ago perhaps i can clarity this justin said in terms ot the xanth time they are visiting it is about seventylive yeais when the evil magician trent first transformed me into a tree lor trying to oppose him but when he was thereafter exiled he emerged in mundama of southern europe near the end of the nineteenth century your time he returned to xanth twenty years later and became king grey is following his route as it is easier to do that than to establish a new temporal route clear as mud pia said there is no fixed connection between xanth and mundama tristan said a person can step from xanth into any time of mundama and return into an time of xanth if he knows how thus that is merely a stepping stone from xanth now to italy then edset said from italy then to xanth then only not exactly the same then thats close enough pia said rolling her eyes edsel closed his eyes and tuned in again so did pia grey approached a settlement by the sea he spoke gibberish to a native the native responded robota is speaking for him in his voice pia reported he is holding her up near his face so its not obvious its italian heshes asking for the road to france you can understand italian edsel asked amazed no i can understand robota she understands italian grey negotiated to get a horse to ride and set off mountains loomed ahead but this may take days edsel protested for him yes tristan said but when he returns here he will do so within a day of his time of departure so you will not be unduly delayed but how can i follow days in hours you fastforward past the dull stuff breanna said this is weird pia said aint magic wonderful breanna said laughing edsel tried it lo suddenly he was looking at southern france at least the mountains were behind and the landscape looked vaguely french in a moment pia confirmed it skipping ahead they found grey joining evil magician trents mundane arm giey was able to do this because tient didnt know him back then in fact it was befoic grc had been delivered so no one in mundania could have known him edsel took a break he stietched and walked out to join the others they were playing quadruple solitaiie with illusion cards fieely interfering with each others layouts and evidently having a great time justin and breanna formed one team and tristan and pewter the other the trollmouse making the moves per the machines printed instructions breanna looked up oh hi ed everything okay theyre passing through mundania and there is no problem in tact its dull til be fasttorwarding soon for sure breanna slapped an illusion card down across the layout trump angry swirls ol colored light crossed pewters screen his way of showing frustration then they cleared double tristan said putting down a card for the machine raise justin said placing one of his cards hit me pewters screen printed breanna laid down three cards meld tristan picked one up kiss mee just what kind ot solitaire s this edsel asked baffled its one we invented called kiss mee donkee breanna explained its sort ol eclectic so i see edsel still could not make head or tail of the play you know com pewter could play better it he had a joystick and keyboard considering the nature of xanth those would probably give him joy and the key to new insights pewter was interested so edsel described those devices in greater detail and the others saw about making them he leturned to his stud and resumed tracking grey pia remained in her chair with her eyes closed either locked into the past or asleep they marched east back toward italy but grey went ahead because he needed to be in xanth before trent got there he used his magic to nullify the deadlv shield thai was now there and the familiar magic landscape returned robota came back to full animation she was a golem but used illusion to change her appearance and her reality adjustment to magnify her size now she icsembled an elt still much smallei than grey but able to keep up with him on her own edsel assumed that grey looked like himselt but robota now resembled an elhn pia quite pretty they spent a night on the path to the north village as it was a fair hike from the border the path was not enchanted and thcie were dangers but grey nullified them robota was metallic in essence and could hardl be hurt by routine monsteis but she was practicing the ways ol living feminmitv so as to be able to fool the storm king they found a mush room that was big enough the mush was mostly on the outside and the loom mainly inside so it worked well enough they brought pies in and gie ate one while robota emulated him i can take biles in my mouth but canl keep them there she said what should i do with ihem grey considered mavbe make spot illusions to conceal them and set them down but then there will be a growing pile of pie bites on he table he considered again maybe make spot illusions of biles and ot bites missing from the pie yes she agreed pleased she practiced and soon had a reasonably realistic mode of eating when the pie was finished she quietk moved it elsewhere on the table and let tt revert to complete as if it were a new one and my clothing she said do i have it light im not sure exactly what the elves of this time weai grey said but maybe you can represent yoursell as one from a distant tree with different conventions yes i shall be silica a princess of the mineral elves she shifted her outfit to a dark gray blouse and skirt that should do gray agreed now to be realistically female how much here she asked indicating her bosom well say when its right she said her bosom expanded ah he started evidently uncertain how to handle this it became full then large then huge then so large it burst out ol the blouse and threatened to fill the room lets start over gie said quickly the monstrous breasts vanished and the slightly filled blouse reappeared the bosom staited expanding again when grev said stopping it at a reasonable magnitude alter that they covered the legs until she had a rather nice set undci a tasteiull brief sknt and dont show vour purs anthonv i know she said lhe ireak men out then she reconsidered but think id like to do that some time not on this mission he said rirmlv we cant risk mischiel grey slept and edsels window closed but pias continued shes experimenting ilh poses she reported bieathing deepk ciossmg her legs she doesnt sleep he said so she has time to work things oul pia opened her eyes and looked around what time is it in real life brcanna looked up from her card game early evening youve been at it a while can we pick them up when we want to pia asked like in their morning when its our morning yes tristan said playing a card they seemed to he plamg a new different game of interactie solitane with pewter using his new joystick to deal smileface cards edsel decided not to inquire docs this suite have a bedroom pia asked a door appeared it does now tristan said pia got up and opened the door is it private tristan considered technically nothing is private in this cave my master governs all of it but apart from that context it is private pia nodded then come on ed edsel was glad to comply he omed hei in the bedroom and lound it was very like then own bedroom at home it was almost as it thc were back in mundama do you know what robotas doing now pia asked as she joined him in bed no my window is closed shes practicing wiles but greys asleep yes i think she knows better than to tr them on him when hes awake hes faithful to hy but now shes pretending she wants to be a real woman i suppose its sort of sad being an animate creature ot metal yes she does have feelings i can feel them she knows she exists lor a purpose and that purpose isnt to be a normal woman but because she has to emulate one she has the emotions and that becomes pamtul i neer thought about the morality ol making robots golems before he said but does seem cruel too bad she cant be teal giundv golem became teal maybe if she does a good job on this mission she will be similaily rewarded i hope so then pia proceeded to put him into the kind of rapture only she could manage in the morning they emerged from the bedroom to find that another bedroom had been formed for justm and breanna edsel wondered how far the girl had managed to take the former tree this time he knew that pia had been encouraging him but old inhibitions died hard he lell guilty for the thought but would have loved to snoop on their nocturnal acthity tristan appeared is everything in order edsel started to answer the realized that the question was actually about the time travelers he closed his eyes and tuned in grey and robota were walking along the path yes the seem to be headed south after a sale night edsel and pia had a mundane breakfast of cereal and fruit and cocoa it was amaing how pewter could shape reality within his cave then they tuned in again on the time travelers they were approaching a female centaur who was bare breasted in the fashion of her species now edsel knew that grey did notice such things for the image remained firmly framed in his vision hello he said i am grey human and this is my companion silica elf am cassie centaur the centaur replied or if you prefer cassie girl she became a human woman suitably clothed my parents suffered an encounter at a love spring so i am a crossbreed my talent is minor prophecy grey said completing his introduction mine is to go in and out of the void that is remarkable grey said i would not caie to go near the void but i would have thought your talent would be the ability to change between your two forms no thats inherent most crossbreeds assume aspects of both parents i must be one or the other in turn so it is independent of talent some of the inert an rs have talents too the mertaurs they arc quite rare so its not surprising ou havent encountered them centaurmerfolk crossbreeds with human heads and arms equine bodies and aquatic tails im going to visit them now purs aihov we wish ou a good isil we ate going to the north village to see the king you are on the right path proceed on south thev separated amicably and went their vays robota vas pleased because her identity had not been challenged centaurs were intelligent observant iolk so that was a good sign bdsel took several small jumps forward bpassmg the hours of dull walking pia kept pace with him so they wouldnt get out oi phase with each other grey and robota entered the noith village this was where the storm king hed but before they approached the rather meager palace they checked in with the village elders roland and bianca these were justin explained as he and breanna emerged irom their bedroom the parents of bmk who had recently been exiled irom xanlh for lacking a magie talent gre and robota needed an introduction to king aeolus and roland and bianca were the ones to do it i am a traveling man with the talent oi minor prophecy giey said when roland answered the door this is silica of the mineral elves whom i am protecting robota was in regular ell lorm about a quarter the height of grey but proportioned exactly like a human woman with not too much bosom she is interested in studying wcathei and would like to meet the storm king so we come to you as village elders to ask for an introduction to the king hdsel opened his eyes is this ethical he asked for not sure breanna said whats happening grey is claiming to have a talent of minor prophecy this is the second time he has done so that is his coei stor tristan said you will understand that they can under no circumstances tell the truth for that would lead to immediate chaos as every person sought to know his personal future and xanth would be changed irredeemably neither can the avoid identifying themselves for that could arouse suspicion so they must have persuasive false identities but this is mg pia looked at him when did a he ever stop ou hd what are you talking about when ou wanted to get a girl into bed thais diffeienl xont of contention perhaps this is not a fit subject for discussion at this time justin said why not breanna asked im interested its okay to lie when i apologize edsel said im sorry i brought up the subject i guess lying in a good cause is okay breanna said doubtfully oh pia said the end justifies the means well the end of getting a girl into bed you have a point breanna said its not right but the alternative would be to completely change xanths present tristan said pia and breanna looked at him oh that breanna said edsel wanted to get off the subject why dont we agree that lying is wrong but that what grey and robota are doing is role playing they must maintain their roles as the truth would either be not believed or would have devastating consequences the others considered then exchanged nods what is happening tristan asked edsel and pia closed their eyes and the king banished him bianea was saying because he couldnt demonstrate any magic edsel repeated that to the others shes talking about bink justin said he was believed to have no magic actually he has magiciancaliber magic but it is indefinable he will return grey said reassuringly i cant tell exactly how or where but foresee his return in good health and acceptance in xanth oh thats such a relief bianca said is she trusting or desperate pia asked desperate justin said by all accounts she was a fine person and loving mother her talent was the replay she could in a spot area set time back five seconds so that a scene could be briefly replayed h was very useful when someone misstepped or hit his thumb with a rock rolands talent was the freee he could make a person stop in place not even breathing until freed as a couple they could be formidable but they nevei abused their powers the appointment with the king was made edsel and pia skipped ahead to that they didnt seem to be able to return to any prior scenes so learned to be cautious about fastforwarding but so tar there was no piers anthonv indication of any trouble no one questioned the identity of the time traelers and they were making no waves but edsel was uneasy he knew that sometimes the simplest things could go drastically wrong in this case the wrongness could be extremely subtle and extremely unfortunate he refused to be lulled into complacency that afternoon in the past robota got to meet aeolus the storm king he was an old man feeble and surely not much longer for kingship i am silica of the mineral elves robota said flashing her most winning smile she was getting it down well it almost lighted the room and who are you aeolus asked grey i am grey with the talent of minor prophecy i am helping silica find her way through the human kingdom justm nodded when edsel reported that xanth elves associate with particular elm trees and their strength is inversely proportional to their distance from their home trees he said they are superstrong near their own elf elms but very weak when they are too far from them an elf maiden would need help in the human domain the king is inquiring their business with him pia reported edsel tuned back in robota was answering i am studying weather as it affects our activities please demonstrate a storm for me the storm kings answer was gruff no but i need to observe weather magic so i can understand it my talent is not a parlor game aeolus said i invoke it only when there is legitimate need robota argued but the king would not budge the truth is that his talent faded with age justin said he seldom invoked it toward the end did you tell them that edsel asked oh yes they know tristan said but the king still has some power and she can analyze its nature when he uses it then my master will be able to duplicate it with full power so they will do their utmost to get him to demonstrate it get on it pia said her eyes closed this is getting heavy edsel closed his yes a wiggle swarm to the south the king was asking incredulously there hasnt been one of those for decades nevertheless i see one coming grey insisted you could destroy it with a solid storm xonf of conthntlon why should i believe the word of a stranger aeolus asked grey spread his hands i cant prove that my prophecies are correct until they come true but in the past they hae been reasonably accurate well if a wiggle swarm comes well see about it the king decided im not at all sure a storm will blow wiggles away they can drill right through stone edsel reported that doing ongoing narrative as he listened he was getting better at it pia corrected him on details as she saw the same scene through robotas eyes and ears that king may be old but hes not stupid breanna remarked then grey found a prophecy that made an impression i see evil magician trent returning with an army to conquer xanth oops breanna said if he warns the storm king wont the king stop the invasion and trent will never conquer xanth and all history be changed not so justin said trent didnt take xanth by force aeolus died and they gave trent the crown oh breanna said ruefully i keep forgetting that you lived xanth history you were there and you are here now justin said you were well worth waiting for the black wave girl tried her best to blush with imperfect success the storm king seemed much more alert to this threat than the one from the wiggles he walked to the wall where a magic mirror hung the border he said a picture formed in the mirror it showed a group of men out beyond a shimmering border they were setting up cages on the other side of that shimmer which edsel realized was the deadly magic shield that prevented anyone from crossing before trent took power and shut it dovvn there is something happening out there aeolus said i had better prepare so will you demonstrate your talent robota asked favoring him with her most winning smile and a rather nice flash of elfin bosom old and feeble as the king was he was not completely immune to the wiles of lovely women yes wait here the king departed the chamber through a door that opened magically to let him pass immediately robota tried to follow but the door pjers anthovi balked her then grey touched it nullifying its magic and they went through aeolus was opening a magic strongbox he reached inside to lift something out but his hands came up empty yet there was a faint sparkle the king straightened up and turnedand saw grey and robota standing there you saw he said chagrined what did they see edsel asked mystified we dont know tristan said this is new to my master then grey caught on your soul is in that box he said but why robota asked the king looked frightened but canny i will tell you if you will promise not to tell anyone else not within fifty years grey promised and robota agreed he was aware that the information was being transmitted fiftyseven years to the future also spreading a truly significant secret might change xanth history and they couldnt afford that thats good enough aeolus took a deep breath he was standing up straighter and looked better now that he had his soul with him this is a soular cell made by magician yinyang centuries ago it prevents aging and death for the person who stores his soul inside i dont need to have my soul with me all the time so i store it here so i wont die but youre already pretty old robota said yes i got this box only a year ago and it cant undo the age i suffered before then but i can remain my present age for a long time unfortunately my talent remains with my soul so when i need to invoke it must recover my soul for the occasion so youre not really senile grey said just soulless that is correct i pretend senility in order to avoid onerous tasks well demonstrate your talent and we will depart and never see you again robota said will a small storm do certainly she smiled engagingly aeolus concentrated on the center of the room in a moment a cloud lormed it thickened and swirled then a little bolt of lightning shot out and there was a crack of thunder a small rain shower followed wonderful robota exclaimed clapping her little hands great demonstration the storm dissipated the storm king walked back to the soular cell aeolus made a clutching motion at himself something spaikly lifted from his body he crammed it into the box and pushed down the lid he had put away his soul he turned toward them now you will go and be silent he said yes grey agreed they left the chamber with the king so this time grey did not need lo nullify the door then the aeolus bid them farewell and they walked out of the palace you got what you need grey asked robota yes now i understand the secret of weather magic my master will be able to duplicate it then walk with me and do not argue argue when i do something surprising perplexed robota agreed they walked north out of the north village but the moment they were out of sight of it grey picked her up and stepped off the path into the brush revert to golem size he whispered she did and he put her in his pocket then he forged on through the brush at right angles to the path there were needle cactuses thornberries and tangle trees in that trackless jungle but he nullified them as he passed through what is he doing pia asked this is a mystery to us tristan said he is supposed to bring them right home grey circled the north village bearing west and then south there he found a small littleused path and followed it farther south as the day grew late he found a thick thicket between two thin thinets and used his nullifying magic to penetrate to the center where he was well protected and effectively invisible now what is this all about robota inquired in his ear you didnt need to go to this much trouble to get me alone you know grey surely smiled the storm king is without a conscience he seemed nice enough to me the conscience resides with the soul the soulless hae no decent limits as with the demons or the animated inanimate now wait a moment im animated inanimate and so you have no conscience fortunately you have not yet discovered how dastardly you could be if you thought of it i hope you will continue to act in a decent manner piers anthon you mean i cant seduce you she asked disappointed that s right a woman ot conscience would not try to seduce a married man but why not that comes under the heading of conscience to a person ot conscience that which is feasible is not necessarily that which is appropriate i dont understand precisely but if you do well one day you may became real and have a soul as grundy golem does you will want to be prepared for its limitations robota considered youre right i do want to become real so will study conscience now that i have studied weather but you will have to help me because my master never said anything about it com pewter is animated inanimate too and so without conscience fortunately there are some limitations established in his programming what about tristan hes funny he wont cheat at cards even when it seems he could and he doesnt do anything illicit even when hes away from our masters control tristan has a conscience in fact he has one ot the finest consciences of his kind and is a fine model to emulate you mean i should act like him yes with due allowance for your gender she sighed this will be horribly restrictive its worth it so why did you bring me here since it wasnt for illicit purpose the storm king wants to hold on to power as long as he possibly can he doesnt know he is going to die soon making his retention of the kingship moot we discoered a secret of his he will seek to eliminate us but we promised to keep that secret htty ears he judges us by himself he expects us to break that promise so he will seek to eliminate us before we do so how can he do that b arranging to have us ambushed and killed on our way home but he cant kill me im not alive lhe doesnt know that in any event he could have you taken apail and scattered xone of contention robota nodded that would do it especially here in the past where my master cant recover the pieces so we must hide from him we arrived at the north village from the north and departed it to the north he will assume that we live somewhere north and will send his scouts out to intercept us they will hardly think to look well away from the paths amidst the dangerous jungle and when they dont find us to the north they will spread their net wider yes but they will have little chance to find us if we are careful and if we stay well ahead of them so we must postpone our departure from xanth until the search dies out but won t that mess up our return to our own time no well reenter xanth just when we should this merely prolongs our stay here what of the observers they will have to tastforward by most of this i regret inconveniencing them but i had not anticipated dealing with a soulless king whats for supper grey looked around i didnt think ot grabbing any food before coming here i can go out and find something for you im small enough and hard enough to handle this thicket why should you bother you dont feel hunger yourself she shrugged isnt that what a person of conscience would do yes but so im learning she climbed down his shirt dropped to the ground and went out in search of food this is getting interesting pia said opening her eyes lets take a break then fast forward agreed edsel said for though the time travelers had spent a day in xanth the observers had spent much less time in fact their times were not snchromzed the two in the present could go through any amount of past adventure as fast as they wanted by skipping ahead but they did not want to skip too much too freely lest they miss something vital and be unable to backtrack to see it they missed nothing during their breaks but could miss everything during an ill advised tastforward robota spoke oi seducing grey pia said he talked her out ot piers anthom it but is it physically possible i mean shes a golem made irom metal she doesnt even have aa place it is physically possible tristan said for tvo reasons first she can change her own reality to an extent so can form a place second metal is no necessary bar to such activity just as the fact that my girllnend terian is a literal mouse is no bar when we meet physically magic makes us compatible its a anation of the accommodation spells the elves and imps use when they wish to associate with large folk on an equal basis even allmetal folk like the brassies can be remarkably soft when they wish to be so robota has that ability too pia seemed somewhat taken aback golems have more potential than i thought she said that surprise was true for edse too even seemingly simple forms of magic were turning out to have intriguing aspects in due course they resumed the observation edsel was finding it increasingly easy to identify with grey murphy who seemed like a fine person he suspected that pia was finding the same with robota who had arranged to look like her in her elfin form and in her golem form too that was a considerable compliment especially because it seemed to be unconscious grey and robota continued south to the magic dust village this settlement justin explained had lost most of its men to the call of the nearby siren a few men had been grabbed by a tangle tree near the path and rescued in injured condition but the injured ones kept trying to follow the sirens song the illage was run by a tough female troll named trolla a troll pia said but arent you a troll tristan yes we are not all bad just as full humans are not for sure breanna agreed no species is all bad not even zombies grey and robota joined the villagers she now in her natural golem form because the kings men would be looking for an elf when the siren sang again grey was unmoved how do you resist the sirens call trolla asked its my talent grey said i can nullify he has selective deafness robota interrupted he hears only what he wants to hear grey realizing that he had almost made a careless mistake shut up edsel was attuned to his mind and could follow his thoughts with increasing facility my word an old wile of the village said id swear my husband and all my children had that talent grev considered and concluded that he would not be changing history if he spared the men from the tree he went to the tree alone at night and touched its trunk when it tried to grab him he nulled it you will never again molest a man following the sirens song he informed it otherwise i will do this he nulled much of the trunk for a moment the tree got the message it left the men alone but it remained dangerous to women fortunately they had the sense not to go near it the assumed that the siren had made a deal with the tangler so that she could capture more males grey and robota remained a few days at the magic dust village but grey became increasingly uncomfortable because there were so many women there who missed the company of men they were becoming rather obvious about their attraction to him and some were quite alluring lovely music and singing filtered though the forest i think we should go see just what is happening with the siren grey said you are succumbing to her song trolla said alarmed he smiled no i can shut it out but as long as the siren remains there is a danger to the village maybe i can talk her out of singing that would be nice trolla said better yet we would like to have our men back for sure robota agreed the others laughed when pia reported that they followed the path through the jungle robota sitting on greys shoulder and holding on to his ear the motion of his body caused her to lean outward and inward her bosom colliding with his ear every so often thats not accidental pia murmured professionally shes keeping her options open keeping her whats open edsel asked the others smiled they were getting used to him of course we cant really change the siren grey told robota that would alter history but we can talk to her and perhaps make things easier for the magic dust villagers they seem like nice folk she agreed i could study conscience with them you could indeed they are doing a difficult ob dispersing the pikrs anthony magic dust so that it doesnt pile up too thickly and distort the magic of xanth all types of people are working together in harmony all motivated by their sense of duty an excellent model it was a good path it led them toward the sound of the singing to the shore of a small lake there was a island in the middle on the islands tiny beach was a stool and on the stool sat a lovely female figure facing away from them playing a dulcimer there was a bleat and suddenly a sheeplike animal charged toward them thats a battering ram grey said dodge it but you could nullify it i believe it has an encounter with bink not long hence i dont want to change that encounter lest lest history change she concluded now i understand the ram came at them grey jumped nimbly to the side and it ran right on by before it could brake and turn it collided with a pineapple tree a pineapple dropped detonating under the rams tail and shrapnel flew out the ram reasonably battered ran on the music continued it has a pretty melody robota said but i dont find it compelling i do grey said but i can nullify its magical component that is the siren they found a path across the water and followed it toward the figure the path faded behind them leaving open water it was oneway the siren heard them and turned ceasing her playing and singing she had hair like flowing sunshine and a tail like flowing water her bare breasts were spectacular she can summon me anytime edsel breathed well youre an idiot male pia retorted she pursed her lips but she does have formidable architecture the siren is seventeen years old at this stage justin remarked she has a teenaged figure thats the best kind breanna said indubitably you must be the siren grey said why so i am handsome man the mermaid said inhaling are you going to stay a while i ah already have company he said indicating robota who remained on his shoulder xone of contention im sure the golem girl can share you what can she offer that i cant legs robota said flexing hers really the siren drew her tail from the water and it split and became a fine bare pair of legs she stood setting her dulcimer on the stool we came only to talk grey said quickly you seem to have been causing some mischief in the neighborhood but all i do is divert myself by singing and playing my dulcimer the siren protested it gets so lonely couldnt you go elsewhere to divert yourself no our parents left me and my sister the gorgon here making us promise never to leave the lake so i remain hoping for company but it never remains gorgon robota asked thats her name shes lovely like me and has almost as sweet a disposition but we got tired of each others companyi mean were both femaleso she went to another island nearby the trouble is though i play fair and let men go on to meet her too she never sends them back its generating some stress between us you dont know why grey asked well i never thought she was selfish but im beginning to wonder they are truly innocent justin explained when they reached the age ofof stork interest breanna supplied um just so at that stage their magic talents also matured and they could no longer be safely kept at home so they were deposited on the islands of the lake to fend for themselves which unfortunately they were more than capable of doing despite their innocence so then you lure more men with your music grey said and the same thing happens she pouted prettily yes i would like to marry and settle down but i have to let them meet my sister because we are supposed to share evenly and then i lose them well i may not be an authority because im from mundania grey said carefully but i think there are better ways to meet men perhaps i can persuade your sister to send one back to you piers antmom she clapped her hands that would be wonderful i hac so much to give if only there was someone to take shes not tooling edsel commented that bare figure we know pia snapped she tended to get snappish vhen encountering women with fuller bosoms than hers grey and robota followed the one way path on to the gorgons island what are they up to pia asked that creatures dangerous i believe he wants to persuade the gorgon not to turn everv man to stone tristan said but this is chancy because the gorgon significantly affects xanth history especially after she encounters magician humfrey and this must not be changed grey knows that brcanna said he lives at the good magicians castle he knows the gorgon personally then shell recognize him breanna protested no dear justin said she does not know him at this time later she may remember him but thats much closer to the present and shouldnt have much effect still i confess i am not at ease about this encounter ssst pia said the golems on it is this wise robota asked as they walked the gorgon will marry the good magician after he makes her deadly face invisible i wont interfere with that of course he said i merely want to unstone some of the men trom the magic dust village so they can return there to work and comfort their women the sirens song will just lure them away again true but at least they will hae some time with their families making things better without changing history significantly i think youre risking paradox robota said no i think it will be all right in fact i think you have been foolishly smitten by the lovely innocence of the siren and want to see the gorgon in her teenage youth what makes you think that i am objective as only a machine can be and female besides turn aside grey i think shes right pia said he is after all a man theres only so much bare female flesh they can handle before their foolish minds overload the others looked at edsel i fear shes right too he said that xonh of comlntion siren is one luscious creature and she has made it plain she wants a man to love grey has lost hts objectivity do we have to send in help tristan asked nerously not yet edsel decided it hasnt happened yet maybe hell come to his senses before he does something really stupid but grey demurred forging onward he seemed to be beyond reason edsel winced watching it men cre foolish about women this was the danger they hadnt anticipated remember robota said pet haps resigned to likely disaster sight of the gorgons mere face turns men to stone all stone not just one little part of them the way the sight of other women does she hugged his head pressing her bosom against the side of his face shes trying to distract him pia said and for once i agree if he seduces him there wont be a change in history til be careful grey said carelessly they passed through a region of the lake where tall trees grew up through the water forming a natural screen they rounded a turn and something moved grey instantly exerted his talentand accidentally nullified the path across the water he fell in with a splash robota laughed clutching on to his hair serves you right she said maybe this will shock you into some common sense youre right grey said treading water in a more conventional man ive got no business meeting the gorgon what was i thinking of he was swimming now perforce maybe this robota said pressing her bosom against his ear again or this she spread her knees swim to shore and well get out of here right he swam to the nearest shore a hand reached down to help him climb out and up the steep bank he looked at his rescuerand turned to stone pia screamed edsel fell off his chair grey had been caught by surprise not thinking to nullify any more magic and had accidentally gazed at the face of the gorgon the ultimate disaster had happened fanta sea a fter a moment pia recovered enough to help edsel gasp out the nature of the catastrophe greystoned tristan repeated stunned we never anticipated this for sure breanna said not smiling she looked as white as her brown face could get we were so concerned about him changing history we never thought of how history could change him whatll we tell ivy shell be poison ivy when she hears about this even when its not the time of the month women in xanth have times of the month pia asked i thoughti mean with the stork and all breanna glanced to make sure no males were close enough to hear between storks they can get out of sorts about once a month she said men dont know but what i really meant was i know this is awful she loves grey do not panic com pewters screen printed stoning is not permanent it isnt pia asked foolish hope flaring all the stoned men recovered in the subsequent time of no magic justin said thats a relief edsel said looking more than relieved i thought he was dead xonf of comtntion i will have to go to rescue him tristan said with grim determination when i get him out of xanth the magic will relent and he will be restored he is not dead merely enchanted pia grabbed on to something whats this time of no magic it occurred about a year later justin said when bink mistakenly freed the demon x h and the demon departed taking his magic with him but the demon xanh is still here pia protested in the form of it was temporary justin said the demon returned after about a day and the magic was restored but the stoned men remained whole the gorgons spell had been interrupted and could not restore itself it was an incidental benefit of a very awkward period then pia said working it out then all they have to do is wait for that and grey will be all right the others circulated a surprised glance she is correct pewters screen printed no rescue mission is necessary at this time tristan looked twice as relieved as edsel had been it was clear that he did not want to travel into the past and risk disturbing history himself yet he had been ready to the troll had courage quick fastforward breanna suggested see if they work it out themselves no justin said resume at exactly that time to see how robota reacts that may be important yes pia shut her eyes and tuned in it was obvious that edsel couldnt for now hello robota said the gorgon stared at her oh thought you were a man not exactly robota said i was climbing on this statue of a man maybe you confused us that must have been the case i thought i saw a swimming man our eyes do sometimes deceive us robota said is there another path away from here yes that way the gorgon pointed robota took the path and made her way back toward the magic dust village she shows no regret at greys fate pia reported shes just going about her business shes a golem without a soul tristan reminded her she can plhrs athon emulate earing but cant actually experience it since she is alone she must see no reason lo emulate it robota reached ihe village he got stoned i dont understand trolla said he made a mistake and will not be returning so have come to join your community you arc welcome trolla said provided you are willing to work hard yes so robota settled in in her natural golem form and helped the villagers disperse the magic dust she worked hard and soon was accepted by the others she did them favors when she could and became increasingly decent as she studied the others to learn the ways of it pia opened her eyes what i dont get is why grey went so crazy there toward the end i mean i thought he was a pretty levelheaded married man he is justin said but the sirens songactually its her dulcimer that carries the magicis among the more remarkable lures of xanth grey surely underestimated its power to affect him and perhaps rationalized to believe that he remained in control tristan said men do that for sure breanna agreed the biggest pan ol the adult conspiracy is that women are the true rulers of xanth that song was pretty alluring edsel said if id been in control id have gone to her right away but that wasnt all when she made legs they were really something oh pia inquired mildly annoyed ive got legs she hoisted her skirt to better display them and those bare breasts edsel continued pia was moderately annoyed have breasts she pulled her blouse tight and that touching sweet innocence pia was silent and really annoyed breanna stepped in well we girls have sweet innocence until we gel corrupted by men indubitably justin agreed pia smiled to herself it was clear that he was the relatively innocent one in that relationship had we known that they would encounter the siren we would have prepared them better tristan said but that was not on the schedule obviously the siren did aflecl grey somewhat enough to distort his judgment robota tried to dissuade him but males in that state can be difficult to dissuade like alcohol edsel said the one person in the group who thinks he hasnt taken too much is the drunk lets hope that robota does the light thing tristan said to that they all agreed as pia closed her eyes and fastforwarded a year passed then five travelers came searching for the source of magic there was the good magician humfrey looking the same as always there was his son crombie in the form of a griffin there was chester a powerful centaur there was bink who was ivys grandfather and there was grundy golem not yet made real the villagers welcomed them with open arms wings and whatever else offered nymphs sprites and buxom human maids surrounded bink fairies elves gnomes and mimonettes mobbed humlrey centaur fillies rubbed shoulders with chester two griffin cows attended crombie griffin and robota went after grundy golem but isnt he married to rapunzel pia asked disturbed not at this time justin said rapunel is locked in an ivory tower on the gold coast i believe it will be several years before grundy rescues her he is at this stage without marital encumbrance without what breanna inquired dangerously a figure of speech justin said hastily i know what it means you think marriage is an encumbrance did not mean to imply that i merely robota is having a ball pia reported she kissing grundy and hes kissing her back they are the only two golems in xanth i think tristan said so they may be entitled to celebrate they certainly are celebrating pia said youre right she does have a place and shes getting pretty soft oh phoocy breanna said i cant keep my mad while theyre doing that come here justin pia noted the girls ways with a certain professionalism it she hadnt succeeded in seducing her man yet she was bound to accomplish it soon it made pia more interested in doing something with edsel for all that there was by now little noveli in it but now was not the time not when there was a better show on pia watched the activit ol the golems with some interest robota piers amthom had evidently done some thinking on the matter and was straightforward in her approach she continuously complimented grundy and showed him flesh which she crafted to be extremely well proportioned and she eagerly acceded to his even notion yet it seemed that he was using her too because he had no more soul than she did the result was a rather uninhibited session that surely would have alerted any golem storks in the vicinity then the sirens song came again all the males perked up listening it is the siren a tairy screamed the women sang trying to drown out the summoning sound knowing the effect it had on males but it was not to be denied the males drew away and headed for the sound they passed right by the tangle tree which let them be until crombie griffin who was then a woman hater balked and pecked at the tree that led to an amazing encounter they are fighting the tangle tree pia reported magician humfrey is using his magic against it and the village women have gotten courage and are coming with torches robota is among them oh this is a grade a fracas a tragedy justin said that poor tree the tangler was a fearsome opponent but the combined force of men women and magic was too much tor it and it was destroyed but the sirens song sounded again and the men resumed their march toward it to the womens great disappointment what happens to them pia asked her curiosity aroused lli cant tell because robota remains with the village this is known to history justin said they passed the battering ram and the pineapple tree then he paused what happened edsel asked justin resumed reluctantly chester shot the siren through the heart but she was no threat to them pia protested the good magician had healing elixir tristan said yes justin said as it turned out the men concluded that the siren was not a menace to them after they destroyed her magic dulcimer the gave her elixir restoring her and spent the night there then they went on to see the gorgon the good magician was able to handle her by making hei face invisible they liked each other right from the hist he had great power of magic and she had great power of beauty tristan said that is a feasible combination thereafter they justin resumed oh i see pia said closing her ees and tastforwardmg they retumed to the magic dust village but though the villagers welcomed the men they did not stay they accepted a local guide and pushed on into the region of madness robota remained at the village after further adventures summaned by justin the men reached the demon x h then robotas finally moving pia reported shes following the trail to the siren and gorgon though both of them have lost their powers she anticipates the time of no magic tristan said now if she just does the right thing robota made her way to the gorgon who had not yet made up her mind what to do things are going to become ery strange robota told the gorgon for a day there will be no magic then there will be magic again and your power will be restored your face will be visible again and as time passes you will be able to stone women and plants as well as men but i dont want to stone anyone the gorgon protested shedding invisible tears once the good magician made me understand what i was doing i was appalled then you must go to mundama where you will have no magic power robota said mundania the gorgon repeated horrified its the only way maybe we can guide you there when the magic returns i dont know the gorgon said everything i know is here what do you have here you cant interact with any man and the women are not hkcl to be friendly go to mundania where you can live in peace until you decide what else to do with your life i suppose so the gorgon agreed doubtfully but i already know what i want to do with my life i want to marry magician humlrey then go to mundania mature some figure things out and return when youre ready shall he gorgon agreed with sudden decision when the magic stops all these statues will return to life robota said and will lose much ol mine i am stuffed with magic dust so i will retain some animation hut ill need grey murphy so i will join linn now piirrs anthony she found greys statue and climbed up to perch on its shoulder she waited pia fasttorarded suddenly the scene changed its become a blur she said that must be the time of no magic tristan said it came suddenly and even the magic dust lost most of its potency when the demon x left the area entirely so robota may be worse off than she was in munduma she is pia said but shes hanging on grey murphy recovered he found himself at the edge ot the lake his legs still in water but i cant connect edsel said because there is no magic tristan said we are dependent on robotas limited awareness robota clung weakly to greys head time no magic she gasped without breath help me gorgon she collapsed i was stoned grey exclaimed catching on he put robota in his pocket where she was able to peek dimly out mostly she just listened men were milling around the other restored statues fortunately they didnt know what had happened to them or they would have gone after the gorgon with mayhem in mind she was nevertheless inghtened of them grey put his arm around her come with me we need to get somewhere else out ol xanth robota said faintly too long a trip grey murmured to her too dangerous there will be crazed beasts all around then find somewhere sale she said he pondered maybe i can reach com pewters cave thats sale butparadox she said i dont think so i dont exist in this time and pewter can keep a seciet robota evidently lacked the strength to protest further she ust watched from the pocket grey and the gorgon lorged through the jungle everywhere trees were drooping and animals were suffeimg they had never before experienced the absence ol magic grey would not be able to stop them b nullilymg their magic but they were too distracted to be a menace to him other than accidentally pia fastforwarded until the reached the cae pewtei was inert he could not animate without magic grey and ihe gorgon having walked most of a night and da lay down on the floor ot the cae and slept it was cold and they had no blanket so the held each othei for warmth alter a time robota stirred she hauled heiself from greys pocket she pulled a sodden handkerchief out alter her she crawled across to the gorgon and laid the handkerchicl acioss her face the gorgon woke what the magicreturning robota said cover face oh the gorgon spread the handkerchiel the spell of invisibility had been banished by the absence of magic and would not be mended by the magics return then the magic returned com pewter came to life his screen lighting grey murphys eyes opened and he stared lull into the handkerchief what look away robota cried with renewed strength gorgon he did so with alacrity robota had just saved him from getting stoned again he got up and faced pewters screen change reality he said uigently make the gorgons face invisible who are you the screen demanded i will explain its important null the gorgon first grudgingly pewlei did the gorgons threat disappeared and she returned grays hanky now i will tell you the truth grey said but you must forget and make the gorgon forget after we leave i will tell you why stranger has much nerve then grey told pewter why thats the first time ive seen a machine surprised pia commented now will you help us leae xanth safelyr grey asked yes then i will seal off this memory unit until you invoke it in your time good now we could use some food and better clothing pewter generated a well stocked table of tood and they fell grcedih to robota talked with pewter explaining how he had made her in the future and providing details ol their mission grey had skipped then two more people arrived at pewters cave they were bedraggled having evidently struggled through the nonmagical jungle most ot the way before the magic returned one was a middle aged man the othei a rathei pretl young woman they stood blinking at the loom grey looked at themand froze i forgot he whispered we must get away from here the gorgon and robota looked at him why the gorgon asked arent they people seeking refuge like ourselves yes but they aie my parents his talent is lo make things go wrongand they just went wrong for us oh no robota said paradox the man heard them there are people here he said surprised and food the two oi them lunged to the table too hungry to resist grey looked as if he were going to faint then robola came to the rescue pewter can erase the memory she said grey sighed with sheer relief yes hello the man said we are two strangers in need of sustenance may we join you yes grey said we shall talk then com pewter will help us all to go to mundama and erase your memories of this meeting why the woman asked around a mouthful of pie because this is robota a golem from the future robota smiled and inclined her head and you are magician murphy and sorceress vadne the magician leaped to his leet how do you a stranger know that he demanded because am yout son you ust signaled the stork for grey murphy both of them stared at him how can this be the man demanded i am also from the future on a mission to what is my past i will be dehveied to you in mundania and grow up with you before we all return to xanth we cant be in xanth vadne said they would put us back in the brain corals pool we just escaped you will be pardoned and become productive citiens of xanth and i will marry a princess until i undertake this mission fifty six ears from now they doubted but slowly the came to believe my son vadne exclaimed coining to hug grey it was odd because she was slightlv younger than he thats so touching the gorgon said blowing hei invisible nose robola turned to magician murphy it i were real would i be shedding a tear now murphv brought out a handkerchief and wiped oft her wel tace yes the scene blurred pia had lo open her eves so she could wipe her own face but oli hardly know grey murphy breanna said and you never met his folks its like a wedding pia said you just have to cry vsoon she returned to the observation grey robota and the gorgon had retreated behind a screen and the memory of magician murphy and vadne had evidently been wiped the two bedraggled figures stood at the entrance to the chamber greetings intruders who are you murphy demanded i am com pewter you are now in my power actually that was no sure thing because murphys talent was to make things go wrong but the two worked out a deal pewter would help them get safely out of xanth if they gave him iheir ustordered son they agreed then pewtei put them mlo temporary stasis and addressed the others grey you can and will guide them safely out i can and will grey agreed otherwise i would jeopardie my own existence he glanced around i will guide the gorgon out too yes i will now wipe her memory no the gorgon cried please i beg of you i promise never to tell let me remember this wonderful scene and the way magician grey has helped me pewter paused it makes sense robola said she will be in mundania and later will return to marry the good magician who knows everything anyway so it shouldnt make any difference agreed oh thank jou the gorgon cried and thank ou robola i will remember this favor she paused considering but never tell then they organized for the trip to mundania gtey robota and the gorgon made an entry and were introduced to magician murphy and vadne as their guides to mundania the partv of five sel off the walk took several days but was without event they took the invisible bridge across the gap chasm and followed the trail north through the north village they disguised themselves and no one rec pihrs anthonv ognized them when they reached the border grey did not have to nullity the deadly shield it had been taken down on orders of king trent but they forgot one thing to tune in the color ot the vater of the sea near the border so they did not come out where trent and his army had been but in a different time and region ot mundama thats all right grey said the border interface automatically registers you as you pass through it and at such time as any of you return you vill return to the same time in xanth that you left except that it will be as much later in xanth as the time you spend in mundania he did not explain about the time traveling aspect he and robota were a special case the gorgons face reappeared as they left the magie she was just as pretty as her sister the siren and had just as good a figure thats all right she said t will make do they ascertained that this was the region they had passed through beiore that spoke italian i can teaeh you a few words robota said the gorgon considered then she smoothed her skirt and inhaled i will pretend to be a mute girl in need of a good mans protection do you think that will work grey considered her statuesque face and figure i believe it will still thank you she walked away into the heart of drear mundama vadne nodded she will surely succeed now where do the two of you wish to be grey inquired there arc different sections of mundama speaking different languages and having different customs they considered you seem like an honest young man magician murphy said he no longer knew grey as his son because of the memory wipe but they had spent several compatible days together take us to a region you feel will be good for us grey paused and pia knew why he didnt dare change his own history robota whispered in his ear where you hed so he watched the changing color of the sea and brought them to the region and time within a year of where he had been delivered which was fourteen years after the gorgons time and on another continent where english was spoken the stork might find it a challenge to make a delivery outside ot xanth but history indicated that it would succeed grey explained the problem of language and robota told them a few useful woids so they could gel started as i understand it grey said xonp or contlntion when xanthians go to mundania they are not challenged the mundancs seem to believe that they have always been there but they do need to learn the conventions he did not say where he learned that justin remarked but it was surely from his parentsthe very ones he is now addressing they came to a crossroads three roads led away from them murphy and vadnc took one and grey and robota took another but vadne hung back a moment thank you we will name our son after you she called startled grey didnt answer thank you robota called back in his voice and nudged him with her knee so that he got moving they were at the fringe of magie so she had fair animation thats playing it close edsel commented i think we might find a paradox hidden somewhere in there il we looked hard enough dont look breanna said tristan smiled it does seem that this meets the technical situation of not changing the future when they were alone grey reversed course and went back the way they had come right back into xanth robota oriented and they entered just one day after their original departure the invisible giant was waiting for them he picked them up and brought them rapidly to the cave why didnt the giant carry them from the cave when they were leaving xanth pia asked the giant might have remembered tristan said then grey and robota entered the cave did anything change grey asked pia exchanged a glance with edsel she had forgotten about that aspect toward the end not that we know of edsel said you did a nice job of covering your historical tracks when my parents walked in i thought we were lost grey admitted but then i realized that was not overlapping myself because i did not yet exist i had merely been signaled tor and when you got stoned ne thought you were lost pia said but robota carried through i had to robota said i could not handle the return alone also it was what a souled peison would have done pewters screen lighted did you get the weather data purs anthony yes rohota said and so much more i hae learned to emulate a conscience for sure breanna agreed grey turned to edsel and pia i believe that completes your service for the good magician you are now free to go he turned to com pewter and i believe it also completes my obligation to you according to the terms of our agreement agreed and you may now open the closed tile and recover your personal portion of the adventure the screen dissolved into a pleased sw irl of color as pew ter did just that hello ivy called from outside were back are you yes dear grey called oh pia said suddenly remembering were demon ted and demonica here yesterday why yes robota said we played together but they departed before you armed did they have a magic locket yes that was what we played with where did they go demon vore took them to the fanta sea they love that what is that edsel asked its a pond where tolk can find their wildest dreams i hope they didnt stay there edsel said they should have been home by the end of the day tristan said one more thing pewters screen printed contact with the exchange couple has been lost again thats nervous business edsel said they could be in trouble pia agreed we had better wrap up our business in xanth and try to make the exchange back i shall continue to monitor the oxone pewter printed pia bid tarewell to tristan and robota whom she had really come to like and they left the cae there was the duck footed boat with princess ivy and the triplets they rode back toward the good magicians castle telling the story it was of course greys story but edsel and pia were able to rill in main details and reassure iy that he had done nothing untoward duiing his adventure except sleep with the gorgon pia said mischievously iy raised a brow oh well you have to understand edsel said she was eighteen and lovely then and innocent breanna added to keep her warm justin said ivy laughed ill ask her next lime shes the designated wife but pia suspected that she did not find the joke as funny as the others did they reached the castle and dropped grey and ly and the triplets off now we need to find those demon children pia said probably best to start with their parents breanna said nada naga should be able to round up demonica any time where can we find nada naga i believe shes visiting her home now justin said that would be mount etamin north of the gap chasm para set off he knew the way there progress was swill thanks to the duck footed boat soon they were crossing the gap chasm using the invisible bridge the same one she had seen through roboias eyes in the past when she and grey weie guiding his parents and the gorgon to the xanth border the gap was as awesome as before descending a mile or so into gloom they had crossed the chasm when the harpies carried them south but it seemed more formidable now that they seemed to be floating close to its maw suppose there were a break in the bridge a section out pia closed her eyes leeling unpleasantly giddy soon the were back on solid land to her relief and forging along a new path oh were coming to the library breanna said enthusiastically i love this place you like to read edsel asked not exactly pia looked at her what did she mean they came to a section where the tree trunks resembled the spines of books complete with print two close together formed a gateway in front of it was an armored knight on a steed galloping in circles para halted whats that pia asked thats sir q lation breanna answered hi q feeling smart today ver well rounded lhank you the knight replied courteous do you wish me to show you around no thank you breanna said were going stiaight through this time as you wish the knight guided his aimorcd mount to the side and para waddled on through the gate just inside was an ogre stamping his big hair teet they lelt little marks on the pile of cards beneath thats the date stamper breanna said hi can i hae a date for sure paramour the ogre responded with something like a smile he tossed her a card with a date on it if there had been any doubt before now it was clear that breanna had been here before then there was a solid man sitting at a desk shaped like a huge tome hi dick breanna said but the man stared stohdl ahead not deigning to answer thats dick shunary breanna explained he wont speak a word to anyone though he knows every word in the book she did not seem annoyed after a moment pia got it shun in dictionary a verbal pun lets see theres a map in here somewhere if we can find it breanna said para wove along different paths searching they came to a glade with a pattern of grass and sand like a miniature golf course atlast at last what pia asked we finally found the map she indicated the pattern and pia realized that it was indeed a map with the sand marking paths atlas edsel murmured atlas at last oh pia could have done without that they followed a path to a number of warriors doing a dance ol victory thats the conquer dance breanna said concordance edsel murmured he had more ol a mind tor this nonsense beond the dance was a dead tree a feline snoozed in its bare branches catalog edsel said cant we just get on out of here pia inquired pained it does get rather wearing justin agreed magic is the mam thing that distinguishes xanth but surel its second attribute is puns they passed a tree with dampish small fruit dew date breanna said happily then there was a dolorous reseaicher ponng oci a several volume set sigh clopedia breanna said do love her justin said even here breanna laced him shut up or ill use the card file on you card file pia asked unable to stop herself it trims the edges of the king queen jack and so on the girl explained with a straight face and there ate some book jackets pia looked sure enough there were shivering books with warm jackets they passed a moving picture ot young women dancing and removing items of apparel para breanna said severely i told you not to go by the film strip thats quite all right edsel said watching avidly the boat veered taking them by a high building whats this doing here in the library forest pia asked its a story collection you walked into that one edsel said they peered up to the thirteenth floor where spirits flitted in and out of the windows dont tell me let me guess edsel said thats a ghost story enough pia cried get me out of here she really means it edsel warned breanna yes shes series the girl agreed if pia had had a pillow she would have whammed them with it fortunately the exit loomed there was only one insubstantial plant barring their way through that mist tree breanna told the boat edsel opened his mouth to say something smart but caught pias dagger of a glance we found our way out because we have the mdecks breanna said patting the interior of the boat index the female dog was still doing it but now they were out of the library and back in normal magic jungle do you know i once met a lady who gave nothing but opposites justin remarked innocently her name was ami nym i believe she would have felt at home at that library but we dont really need the library breanna said we can see the paper view she held up a roll of paper pia knew she was going to hate herself but she had to ask paper view you pay loi each time ou see it anthony that docs it pia screamed she jumped out of the boat landed offbalance and whirled into the soft side of a cow like creature the thing made a soft sickl mooo i im sorry she said recovering her balance i did not sec you the cow looked so sad that all her anger dissipated the boat halted and she climbed back in moosick soothes the savage beast edsel murmured pia tried to summon back her rage but was worn out actually it is the savage breast that is soothed justm said shes got two of those edse agreed smugly and they are most elegant an elephantine creature remarked leaning oer the boat to stare at her blouse pay no attention to the sycophant brcanna said it flatters everybod with equal insincerity we are approaching mount etamin justm said pia was relieved until she saw the dragon circling the peak in a moment the dragon spied them and swooped down breanna seemed unalarmed she stood carefully in the boat hi draco she called its us justm and breanna and friends coming to see nada naga the dragon waggled with wings and veered off pia was not entirely reassured what would have happened if we had not been friends hed have toasted us breanna said shrugging but i wouldnt have let us come here if i hadnt known it was safe draco is an honorable dragon justm said he has a very nice collection of gcmstones in his nest i believe he is the only dragon to possess some black beryls para ran up to a tunnel and into the mountain soon it opened into a lighted cave a huge snake loomed forming the head of a human being who are you and what is our business here breanna oi the black wave justm tree edscl and pia of mundania and para boat breanna said we need to see princess nada naga about her daughter demomca the naga guard rolled his eves has that demon child gotten into more mischief not exactly she has something we need a locket wait here the human face disappeared and the serpent shthcicd ihiough a hole in the wall soon two other snakes returned the big one formed a lovelv human head with a small golden crown hello breanna the princess said hello nada breanna said edsel and pia are mundancs here on an exchange program they need to borrow the magic locket ted and monica found the small snake formed into demomca it got boring we left it in the fanta sea oh no pia thought they were going to hae to search for it can you show us where sure i think brcanna hesitated is it sale for mundanes in the fanta sea it is it they are careful the princess said why dont you take monica along and bring her back here when you find it thank you breanna said hop in monica the child performed a huge hop and landed in pias lap hi pia she said cutely and kissed her on the cheek pia hugged her this sort of thing was getting easier with such cute children hi monica how did you get so sweet i gave my sour to ted for today the others laughed the boat turned around and set off monica remained on pias lap pia loved it there was just something about the child pia had never wanted to have children but after meeting this one and ivys three she was changing her mind now just what is this fanta sea edsel asked i mean i know that wild dreams appear there but what kind of dreams arc they all kinds breanna said uneasily the truth is i dont much like the fanta sea but if thats where we have to go then thats where we have to go good dreams or bad dreams pia asked if breanna didnt like that region chances were that pia wouldnt like it either all kinds justm said it is a place where actual dreams escape from the realm of the gourd normally they are disciplined orgamed by the gourd ciews and carried b the night mares to sleepers who deserve them but at the sea they are undisciplined and can do what the want even the good dreams may not be welcome when they have no outside controls good dreams unwelcome edsel asked id loe to he swamped by good dreams piiks avrhom but both justin and bieanna looked dubious only the child agreed yes fun id like some clarification pia said nervously xanth was a land where face alues could be ery literal hut still needed to be handled with caution why should a child enjoy something that adults were wary of it is somewhat awkward to explain justin said were here monica said go straight ahead quackfoot pia looked ahead it seemed to be an ordinary lake with brush around the edges and reeds growing in patches para ran into it and started swimming breanna looked to the side there on the bank was a cemetery memorial stone she shuddered thats a dream pia asked for sure thats serious its a grave stone the girl nodded then pia smelled a pun grave stoneserious rock are you pulling my leg not this time honest that stone reminds me of my dead mom your mothers dead no but i used to dream she was and i knew because i saw that stone it scares me to pieces pia saw that the stone was moving along beside the boat paralleling their progress can you get rid of it i used to be able to wake up but now its out here in my waking state there is a way justin said it is possible to make the dream spooks cancel each other out what is necessary is to lead one into another so that they collide this requires some maneuvering but is feasible what happens if one catches you first edscl asked dreams cant cancel people because then there would be nothing to see them juslm said they are mere phantasms but they sure can scare you breanna said thats what they do thats their magic they make you feel whatever they want you to feel and you cant escape it so we have nothing to fear but tear itself edsel said or other emotions justin agreed xom or comlntion im too young to be scared bv grownup things demonica said proudlv meanwhile pia was watching the grave stone that thing is moving closer i know it breanna said tightly im airaid that if it catches me my mother really will die she was not joking her face was distraught i believe i see another justin said but i dont recognize it pia looked it was a tropical tree seemingly growing out of the watei its just a palm tree she said no threat to me edsel looked oh no he breathed if s mine whats its threat pia asked its a oke my brother bentley played on me when we were kids he told me about it and i thought it was real its a na palm tree i dont believe i am conversant with that variety justin said thats because it didnt exist in xanth until this moment edsel said its my bad dream it has barrellike fruits that explode on contact setting fire to anvone near oh a variety of pineapple tree maybe so but it terrifies me indeed pia had never seen edsel so scared tree go bang monica said intrigued pia saw that the tree was coming closer it did have deadlylooking fruits she remembered the description ol napalm it soaked its victims and burned their skin off and wouldnt stop it was one of the most horrible weapons in existence she didnt want to experience it even in a dream you said we can make them collide pia said lets do it only their subjects can lead them justin said but neither breanna nor edsel look capable of doing much pia pointed out yes that is the inherent irony of the situation however we can guide them he spoke directly to breanna call that stone to you dear i just want to get away from it the girl shrieked i love you tiust me breanna looked almost white with fear but justin look her hand and she fought for control she looked at the gravestone ceome she whispered purs anthony the stone moved tow aid her much faster me pia asked justm if you would we must have both orient on us pia leaned toward edsel you heard him ed call it to you edsel stared at her with dilated eyes the thing will destroy me no it wont she said firmly though she had some private doubt summon it i cant yes you can ill help you she kissed him on the mouth do it ed she hated using her power oer him this way but she had to motivate him to do what he had to do he stared at her his emotions of fear and kne warring on his face she smiled at him then he turned slowly and gaed at the tree come you horror come he whispered the tree responded with alaerity suddenly it was bearing down on them hold on everyone justm called paranow the boat had evidently been waiting for this directive he leaped forward so suddenly that pia fell backward off her seat and behind them the rushing gravestone crashed into the charging tree there was a ball of fire followed by dissipating smoke the two dream monsters were gone but there will be more breanna said recovering for all of us monica find that locket justin said urgently to the child that way monica said pointing to a nearby tiny island the boat veered but another shape appeared and it wasnt the locket oh no justin breathed what is it dear breanna asked its a morph morph edsel said as in morphine a pain killer or morphing changing form both justin said with impending dread but those are two diileient things pia protested ones a shot the others a movie and ad gimmick both justin repeated weakly its an injection that causes folk to change shape involuntarily ive seen it attack animals and ruin their lives they get addicted to change but cant handle the new forms its going to get me and make me change back into a tree or worse right when i want so much to remain as i am now feel your pain breanna said i dont want you to change changing forms is fun monica said innocently but its onl an emotional thing isnt it pia asked not really physical an emotional tree could not embrace breanna justin said his eves locked on the approaching hypodermic shape e have to get rid of it for sure breanna said but meanwhile edsel had spotted something else book shape at nine oclock he said pia lookedand iroze thats the awtul cook book whats scary about a cook book he asked you never cook anyway thats un i never cook she said tightly it burns me an errant glance bounced around the boat a cook book burns you breanna asked after one and a half moments its another experience from childhood pia explained unable to look away irom the horrible book as it nudged closet my mother was cooking in our apartment on a hotplate and she had a cook book out i saw the hotplate and asked what it was but she thought i meant the book and said its a cook book so i tried to pick it up and ou burned your hand edsel said now i understand breanna said that book out there is steaming hot you could cook on it for sure pia agreed faintly im terrified of cook books i know its stupid but i cant touch one of those things and that morph better not touch justin breanna said its our turn to maneuver edsel for sure he agreed now the two of them focused on their paitners reversing the prior case justin call in that morph breanna said its going to stick me pia call that cook book edsel said itll burn me call it breanna and edsel said together with extieme reluctance knowine that the others weie right pia pi ks anthony pried open her mouth and said come vou atul thing and the hot book accelerated tow aid her come needle justm whispered go para breanna cried the boat shot forward there was a crash behind it and pias horror eased two more awful fantasies had been destroyed but another was alreadv appearing it looked like a vertical column but it wasnt supporting anthmg what is that edsel asked pia recovering looked the thing did not till her with honor so she knew it wasnt hers that was a kind of relief it looks like a rug she said a rolled carpet a carpet demonica cued her oice a wail that shouldnt be here you mean its yours pia asked surprised she had thought the halfdemon child to be immune gotta get outa here monica shnlled and scrambled for the far side of the boat wail pia exclaimed catching her you cant run on water and anyway itll follow you let me go let me go the child screamed struggling but pia drew her in close and held her firmly whats the problem breanna asked and it wasnt any routine query let me go monica shrieked the child needs calming justin said pia did not know the first thing about calming a child she had never wanted anything to do with children who had in the past struck her as irrelevant nuisances but she tried take it easy she said hugging the little girl no monica was starting to change her form oozing out of pias grip m slow demonic fashion pia shifted hei hold but it was hard to hold on to a shifting squirming squigghng form she was losing the contest we must discover the nature ot the threat justm said insistent pia saw the lolled carpet looming closer it was angling now as if making lead to unroll on the water monica she said taking another hold whats about that carpet but the child was beyond listening she wanted only to get away and ti to flee though she drown in the attempt kiss her breanna suggested pia hauled monica in and kissed her on the forehead nmg to emulate motherly fashion the child buist into tears and clutched her dont let it get me wont pia promised though she had no idea how to keep that promise but you must tell me whats its secret it going to roll me up monica cued well ill smother now it was coming clear suffocation inside the rolled carpet someone must have threatened the child with that once and it had become a buried tear maybe the carpet was illusory but its terror could still stop the childs breathing it was tilting larther showing us hollow interior is thete another spook in sight pia inquired desperate no edsel said pia hugged the child closer then find another way to abolish it edsel turned to justin is there any other way sometimes if there is a pun that can be changed but there seems to be nothing funny about being smothered by a lolled carpet yes there is edsel said carpet tunnel syndrome you got it breanna said but how can it be changed pia was discovering to her surprise that she rather liked comforting the child she had ncer tried it before but holding the little girl seemed meaningful monica was taking comfort though as yet the had no certainty ot saving her the carpet was unrolling making ready for its prey there has to be some other variant edsel said carpet carpal a bulb flashed over pias head car pool tunnel thin dome she exclaimed the carpet apparition seemed to groan it changed form becoming a thin glassy dome with a tunnel through it wide enough for several cars no way to smother anyone in that disgusted it faded you saved me demonica said giving pia a heartfelt extra hug and then a wet kiss well i had to dear pia said feeling a tear at her eye i love you and i love oii pia said now she was sure she wanted a child of her own she had never icalied before how precious hey could be you never punned beloic edsel said amaed i guess i never had to she let the child go that ob was done but she would neer torget that oy of holding the little girl close fii rs antiioni theres the magic locket monica said as brightly as if she had never been scared children did recover from things rapidly on soft pia looked she saw the locket hanging by its chain from the neck ot a chunk standing man the man was facing the other way but the locket was against his broad bare back i can get it bdsel said no this is my mission pia said til get it she appreciated his offer hut suspected that she could more readily charm the man to give it to her para reached the isle and waddled onto land pia stepped out and approached the man she noticed that his back was flat and covered with small print excuse me she said he turned for a moment she was afraid he was completely naked but his front side was garishly clothed yes iim pia i need that magic locket welcome to it i am softcover i was holding it for demomca softcover she asked my soft paper hack is hard to cover now she made the connection paperbackhardcover he was in tact a standing talking book not a cookbook fortunately cheap adventure fiction she smiled fctchingly at him thank you so much mister softcover will you give it to me i am unable to reach it you must take it from me so did he want to make her embrace him well if that was the price of it she could do it she stepped in close reached her arms around his arms and chest caught hold ol the chain and lifted it up and over his head it was a stretch and at one point she was pressing fairly firmly against him but he didnt move she brought it down and had possession thank you she said smiling again you are welcome now she saw that his arms were actually the soft covers of the book with the hands painted on he could not move them other than to open and close them so he had not been decemng her she turned and stepped back into the boat now lets get the bleep out of here she said briskly the boat splashed into the water and moed rapidly back the way they had come but another shape was coming toward them it looked like a winged woman whose fantasy was this one willow monica called happily willow breanna echoed what are you doing here the winged girl came to land in the boat hello monica justm breanna i think i have business with your friends oh okay breanna turned to edsel and pia this is willow elf sean mundancs wife she turned back to the girl and these are edsel and pia from mundania yes the good magician told me to find them here i need the magic locket now wait a minute pia protested we need this locket to stop the demon cotwo the good magician knows that yes ol course willow agreed but as soon as you finish with it i must take it to mundania to help nimby nimbys in trouble breanna asked alarmed we fear so he has very little magic there because he is using a mundane body rather than his own and we think the demon b h is trying to trap him there messages came to several iolk saying nimby eats dust the good magician takes them most seriously so we must get magic to him soon this is serious justin said yes i need to fill the locket with magic dust so that it will carry the magic to him then he will be able to reconnect with you and return to the land of xanth while we return to mundania pia said surprised to hear a tinge of regret in her voice despite all its complications she was coming to like it here for one thing there was her sixteen year old body t had been wonderful having it and using it to impress men well give you the locket as soon as we finish with cotwo willow irowned it would be belter if i borrowed it now to fill it with magic dust you cant fill it monica said its bottomless willow nodded agreement i mean to put enough dust in it to help nimby but we need it now pia said distrusting this i will bring it back to you i simply need to take it to the magic dust village how long will that take no more than half a day the elf said most of that will be hying time pia was pained isnt there a faster way plfrrs athom willow considered actually there is now that remember it pearl lives near here pearl her talent is summoning magic dust with her help i could do it in an hour go to pearl pia agreed handing over the magic locket thank you where can most readily find you then at the snow mountains i will be there willow spread her lovely wings and took off this is bad news breanna said if nimby gets trapped in mundama all of xanth will be in trouble we shall deal with cotwo and then the locket will go to rescue nimby edsel said then his glance strayed my pia looked she saw a troupe of shapely nymphs dancing across the surface of the water whose horror is that mine edsel said only its no horror ive always dreamed ot going to a show like that pia eyed the figures disapprovingly they had very well fleshed legs and very short skirts there were five of them with hair matching skirts blue red green yellow and black this is going to freak you out for sure breanna said when they get close and do a high kick so as to show their pretty colored i get it so is there another horror to collide with them i fear so justin said over there pia looked the way he indicated her blood tried to curdle it was a formless hump that sent a dreadful chill through her what is it breanna asked its my personal monster pia said the thing i want least to encounter what is that justin asked i dont know just that ie got to get away from it how can you be afraid of something you dont know monica asked i think im afraid of it because its unknown pia said its something i simply cant face well well crash it into the dancing nymphs breanna said but youll both have to summon them so theyll collide where we were glad to edsel said come nymphs xonj ohcontintlon pia opened her mouth but the words wouldnt come out she just couldnt summon that unknown horror hey we have to get them aligned breanna said bring the hump only you can do it i cant pia moaned i just cant then we have a problem breanna said the nymphs are upon us para dodge the boat dodged to the side but couldnt escape the nymphs they intercepted it and spilled onto the seats going for edsel one of them tumbled head under skirt into pia gmng her a phenomenal hash ol green panties ot course that didnt freak her out because she was female and because her main attention was taken by the more distant lump pursuing hei but she knew edsel was another matter the nymph rolled on into piaand through her it was an illusion but those bright full panties would take men out regardless justin breanna said urgently maybe youd betterbefore one of them flashes ou i didnt want to use this but see i must justin said with regret he drew from a pocket something that to pias peripheral vision looked like a big letter d he flipped it at the cluster of nymphs there was an explosion pieces of nymph and skirt and panty flew out in every direction dissipating but pia didnt feel anything physical hey what happened edsel asked blinking justin destroyed them with his deetonate breanna said it blows things up he set it for illusions so it blew up only the illusion but i was just about to see them do the high kick edsel complained and it would have freaked you out fivefold breanna retorted a one panty freukout is over as soon as eye contact is broken but when there are several the effect is geometrical youd have been out for days and we canl afford that oh edsel looked both disappointed and sheepish but pias spook is still coming justin said and we cant stop it well just have to run for it breanna said maybe it cant go beyond the edge of the fanla sea go para the boat luiched forward they reached the bank and the boat heaved out of the watei and across the land were thev safe pitrs anthon pia faeed back watching because she had no choice for a while they gained on the horror but then it floated off the watet and oxer the land it was still coming well well figure out something breanna said uncertainly keep going para to the snow mountains the boat ran along at an excellent clip slowly the pursuing apparition lost ground and finally disappeared behind a turn in the torest pias gaze was freed but she knew the thing had not given up it would pursue her until it caught her the locket breanna exclaimed you can put it in the locket an illusion edscl asked for sure that locket takes in anything you ask it to and wont let it out until you say so but willow has the locket pia reminded her oh bleep i forgot well well just have to stay out of its way until we get the locket back para made excellent time and before long they were rising through the foothills of the mountains pia could tell because the hills were shaped like giant feel but this also slowed the forward progress of the boat the pursuing hump was floating and had no problem ith climbing it came back into sight slowly closing in its going to catch us breanna said before we get there and before willow brings back the locket what can i do pia wailed there is only one way to deal with inescapable terror justm said that is to face it and conquer it but i cant face it then it will destroy you he said regretfully but its not physical edsel said its just emotion emotion suffices justm said it can wipe out the mind it is called insanity so if she flees it and it catches her shes doomed edsel said but if she faces it down maybe shell make it that is the situation maybe not breanna said has anyone ever tried to intercept one of those things i mean someone its not aimed at i do not believe so but breanna jumped out of the boat caught her balance and stood in the path of the spook come on spook she cried youve got to get through me first the thing loomed upand passed right through the girl breanna couldnt touch it pia knew what she had to do if i cant escape it might as well face it she said she got out of the boat and stood beside a small pond this was not courage but desperation she was quaking the hump sailed toward her followed by breanna but the girl stopped when she saw pia this was something that only pia could tackle pia hoped she looked brave from a distance it certainly wasnt the case up close her heart was pounding her hands were shaking and she knew her eyes were dilated the only thing that stopped her from turning to run away was her certainty that it would catch her and be even worse than if she faced it the thing loomed close it slowed orienting on her it began to assume the rorm of a person or rather a horrible parody of a person who are you she demanded timorously the shape continued to clarify it became lemale with a shapely body a heart shaped face green eyes and long dark brown hair it looked weirdly familiar in fact she looked at its reflection in the pond beside it was her own reflection the two figures were the same she was terrified of herself she was indeed terrified and it was her image but behind the fever of her fear a certain animal cunning lurked wete things teally as they seemed or was this apparition fooling her in a way she did not understand she peered at the thing and saw that its face was colored did that mean something it was black what did that mean red might be rage green might be jealousy blue might be sick yellow might be fear but hat was black she was sure it had nothing to do with race breanna of the black wave had abolished any such concern it had to be an emotionshe felt it almost overwhelming herbut which one what arc you she asked the figure moved closer its face began to show the highlights of a skull but it wasnt death just a comparison to death something shed rather die than do or rather admit what awful secret do you hide she asked desperately pilrs anthony the figure reached for her she knew it would blast her mind if she didnt counter it but hem could she do that it she didnt know what it was desperately she reviewed her concerns huslrations and fears she couldnt think what it was but there was something much worse than a cookbook so bad that she couldnt lecogmze it even when it stared her in the face what nas this black emotion then she did something extremely nervy lor her she reached out and touched the things hand suddenly the emotion clarified it was guilt she was so horribly guiltridden tor something that she couldnt even face it but now she had to lest she be destroyed by it what was her guilt then slowly and painfully it came to net her guilt was about edsel and his friend dug for she had been dugs girlfriend and tired of him supposing edsel to be more entertaining so she had flashed a bit ol this at edselthe figures blouse faded to show breast and cleavageand a bit of thatit showed high thigh and in a moment she had captured his fancy then all mat remained was to engmeet an exchange it had been almost too easy so dug was without girlfriend and edsel was with her and pia was satisfied but it had been dirty dug was a fine man eminently undeserving of such treatment oh he had found another girlfriend in kirn and was happy now but that did not ameliorate pias guilt for the way she had treated him she should have been upfront told him how she felt assured him that it was no fault in him and wished him well instead she had covertly dumped him and now long after she thought she had buried it forevei that guilt had telurned to haunt hei to overcome hei the girls of xanth thought that there was shame in accidentally showing their panties they didnt know what real shame was the irony was that there was nothing she could do about it dug was better off with kirn than he had been with piaand pia was worse off with edsel than she had been with dug she had been doing neither dug nor edsel any lavoi she wasnt worth their company she would be doing them both a favor by getting the bleep out of the picture you win she said to the awful figure then she turned and leaped into the pond in half a moment she realized that even in this she had messed up first she couldnt drown heiselt because she was loo good a swimmer and the pond was too small second the watei was onl knee deep she had gotten soaked tor nothing para was there floating to hei lescue but pia waved him awav guess i reallv cant escape she said i have to deal with it the odd thing was that she was feeling bettei now despite her bedraggled condition she felt better than ever physically and more confident emotional h she saw the others in the boat breanna dipped her hand in the water

dialogue with the guilt spook she climbed into the boat and hugged him you will but right now youll have to settle tbi me wet any way you want he agreed enthusiastically heres a towel he started drying her oft somewhat ineffectivel wrap her in a blanket breanna suggested meanwhile we had better get on into the mountains tor sure breanna said she looked around monica lime to get back in the boat the child came running back from the bushes look what i found first in then tell breanna said the boat resumed his trek while edsel swathed pia in a voluminous blanket so she could get out of her clothing and get thoroughly dry she knew this wasnt the occasion to go naked again so what did you iind breanna asked demomca a slug yuck the child laughed no not a real slug a lake slug that pretends to be a coin or something see it takes an shape i want she held up a tiny dark disk in her hand it shaped itself into a thimble then a star hey thats clexer edscl said can i make it work too sure the child delighted in teaching the man how to do it hdsel had always been good with children it was pia who hadnt wanted any until now if by any chance they had succeeded in getting the stoiks attention she would keep what it brought her ol course this was xanth and they were in borrowed bodies so it didnt count but the principle was there in xanth or mundania she knew edsel would be happv to cooperate it was getting on time for her shot but she didnt feel the need she pricked her finger and did the blood test and il showed she vas perfect could she really be rid of her ailment that seemed too good to be true yet she continued to feel great physical and good mentally too it was as if the healing spring had healed her emotions as well as hei body as if it had made her whole they came into the region of snow it was smaller and higher than it had been more snow had melted that meant that more water was flowing down to flood the valley the demon cotwo needed to be stopped immediately which was ot course why they had gone lor the magic locket the locket pia exclaimed whcrcs willow she must have been delayed breanna said she wouldnt stand us up deliberately but what if cotwo comes dont speak his name breanna said too late a dark swirling cloud formed did hear my name the voice of the demon came were in for it now breanna said darkly you got that right blackwave darling the demon said as his tawny body took muscular shape didnt i tell you to stay away from here til distract him edsel said jumping out ot the boat you get out of range para turned ready to ilee not so fast quackfoot cotwo said reaching out to hook a huge finger into the back so as to hold the boat in place i think you would make excellent kindling til distract him pia said scrambling out her blanket still around her to stall tor time the demon gazed down at her what have we here a shrouded nymph a shrouded woman pia said bravely she opened the front of her blanket well well arenl you the shapely one what are you up to sensual creature he lifted his linger from the boat and it scooted away but then he aimed a blast ol air at it and boat and remaining occupants tumbled headlong into the river but pia couldnt help them she had to distract the demon long enough to give willow time to bring the magic locket how could she do that she knew only one way iill dance lor you she said indeed you shall cotwo agreed he reached out caught the edge pitrs anthon of her blanket between thumb and foiehnger and jerked the blanket whipped away and set pia madly spinning she caught her balance now she was naked tor there had not been time for her clothing to dry the blanket was her clothing she didnt even have her panties on so couldnt ireak out the demon assuming that demons could be so freaked but she had to carry through she started to dance making her hips shill and her mesh jiggle she had the best shape of her life and it seemed the best health of her life thanks to her sixteen year old body and the loss of her diabetes she could impress any manbut the demon was not exactly a man could she distract him long enough she whirled and bounced and lifted a leg fetchmgly ghing it her all where was willow youre pretty good cotwo said in fact i think ill keep you keep me she didnt like the sound of that you came back when i sent you away you are trying to stall me so your friends can escape but you do have an interesting shape so i will subject you to a late worse than death she had been too successful in diverting him now he wanted her for storkish purposes pia tried to run but the demons arm stretched out impossibly long and his hand became huge it caught her around the torso not hard but very firm it lifted her into the air so that her bare legs dangled as with the guilt monstei she could not escape she had to tackle it directly but she knew that vowing to be a better person would not have much effect this time so she pretended confusion worse than are you a masochist no way excellent because am a sadist i am going to bind you in chains and whip you and force you unwillingly to serve my pleasure at your great discomfort dozens ol times a day until i tire of you then ill break you and throw you away if he had intended to frighten her he had succeeded pia screamed she couldnt help it though she knew that was what the demon wanted cotwo smiled there was nothing nice about it yes scream my fair little toy scream in anticipation because the reality will be much worse the arm contracted bringing her closer as she tried dizily to free herself her eye caught a glimpse ol something in the sky it looked like a bird a planeno a winged ell willow was arriving all she had to do was stall a little more pia forced a sexy smile no im sure the reality will be much better youre quite a figure of a crcatuie dont try to fool me precious i will make you scream in physical and emotional pain the huge lingers contracted ciuelly showing that this was no bluff she was already hurting butbut dont you want me smiling she gasped obliging your every foolish whim obliging yes smiling no i like my toys to suffei not so fast hot stuff it was edsel cotwo looked so did pia edsel was advancing on the demon holding the magic locket before him she remembered that the locket had to be close to the object before it could be invoked could edsel get close enough the demon diopped pia like a squeezed sponge and focused on the man what do you piopose to do about it cotwo demanded i am going to put you inside this magic locket edsel said evenly just as soon as i get you into its range ed dont tell him that pia cried from the ground but she was being foolish because he already had told giving away the element of surprise fascinating the demon said that really is the magic locket i thought it was lost centuries ago along with the other hinge artifacts where did you find it demon ted and demomca found it edsel said carefully aiming the front of the locket at cotwo we recovered it horn the fanta sea its the one thing that will stop you because when invoked it puts whatever it is aimed at within and even a demon cant escape once you aie safely inside you will stay there and only a little of your substance will remain outside not enough to warm xanlh much the mountains will cool and the glaciers will grow again and the valley below will no longer flood and the trees will piosper what arc youan environmentalist nut or something like that cotwo asked derisively something like that edsel agreed he was close to the demon now dont dally ed pia cried just do it needless delay was sheer toll hen dealing with a brute like cotvo it wont work cotwo said oh why not edsel held the locket up and opened his mouth about to inokc it the demons hand swept through the air so fast it left a glowing blurstreak it snatched the locket from edsels hand because now i have the magic locket cotvo said triumphantly pia screamed she hated seeming like a helpless damsel but that was what she had become no edsel said looking horrified what are you going to do what do you think foolish mortal the same thing you were going to do to me ill conjure you into the locket then ill make your girlfriend scream and scream as i ravish her when she has sutiered so much that she cant scream any more will break her in half and put her into the locket for you to enjoy what do you think of that i cant stand it edsel cried turning to run away cotwo leaped forward bearing the locket he aimed it at edsel at close range in he said as pia screamed again in sheer despair there was an implosion as the locket took in substance a cloud of smoke pufted around obscuring the scene pia burst into tears not for herself but for her lost husband oh edyou were so brave and im so undeserving ill never forget you or slop loving you the smoke dissipated there stood edsel thats great he said fid youre free she wasnt sure she could behee it she run to hug him what happened how did you well i outsmarted him but as he spoke a horrible suspicion suffused her could this be the demon emulating edsel to torment her further she had to know ed who was with before i was with you he looked at her surprised what has that got to do with the price of beans in mundama just answer please dug of course but the demon might have eavesdropped on prior conversations and picked that up how did you get me we made a bet my motorcycle against his gnlfnend won so it really is you she hugged him again and kissed him ardently she couldnt remember ever before being so telieved willow elf flew down i hate to interrupt but i need the locket for sure edsel said but id better adjust it first he bent and lilted the locket from where it had fallen and used his fingernail to pry off the front panel what are you doing pia asked amazed well i ligured i couldnt get close enough to cotwo to conjure him in so i faked him out i used monicas slug to put this fake front on the back so it was actually lacing the opposite way it seemed to then so he conjured himself inside pia said instead of you that was brilliant ed when he grabbed it i thought that was the idea you really helped pia because you believed he handed the locket to willow now its right remember to point it the right way when you invoke it for sure willow agreed smiling then she spread her wings and ascended para boat waddled up carrying justin and brcanna we need to get back to com passions cave and let para go the black wave girl said hes done more than enough for us ed looked at pia you know i just love holding a bare damsel like this but maybe youd be warmer in the blanket for sure she agreed kissing him again oh ed love you i really do now ugh demomca said are you two going to get mushy for sure they said togethei laughing weather t he storm seemed to have cleared the air they packed their gear and rolled up their sleeping bags and started hack along the trail their camping excursion would have to be cut short they needed to get to a computer terminal and to the oxone before dearth struck again let me make sure i have this straight kirn said all you need is to connect with ed and pia via the modemode and switch back at then it will all be over yes chlorine said once nimby is back in his own body in xanth dearth cant touch him but couldnt dearth do something awful to ed for vengeance like stepping on a nuisance ant dearth wouldnt bother nimby is all that matters once he escapes the game is done and dearth will pay no further attention are you sure thats not the way a human person would react demons arent human it took nimby time and concentration to learn any human things like dreaming it doesnt come naturally he wouldnt hae done that it he hadnt gotten so closely involved with human folk because of his wager no other demon has done that they remain indifferent to antly affairs its just not in a demon to care what happens to ed or pia one way or the other when their bodies are no longer host to our spirits they will be perfectly safe xone of contention thats a relief kim said but while nimby and i remain here edsel and pias bodies are definitely at risk chlorine continued grimly nimby would lose considerable status if his host body were killed while he was in it killed as you said stepping on an ant actually the body wouldnt die as long as nimby remained confined in it but but can that happen kim asked with a shudder i mean if its only weather that dearth controls weather can become ugly the weather is beautiful right now but consider last night dug said the way that storm came up and washed out the one peg to collapse our tent and waterlog our computer that impresses me it should chlorine said demons have enormous power when they choose to exercise it so we need to reach the oxone and revert identities as soon as possible before dearth realizes dug agreed like an ant avoiding a trap unnoticed yes but chlorine alerted by nimby doubted that it would be that easy they hiked to the base camp where their car and motorcycle waited they loaded the gear then dug and kim got into the car and nimby and chlorine got on the motorcycle the cycles motor started right up but the car didnt follow they looped back to check dead kim called storm must have shorted out the battery the folk of a neighbor car approached need a jump the man asked fraid so dug said thanks the man had jumper cables kim explained the process to chlorine as the men did it the cables connect the good battery to the dead one and provide current to start the motor then it recharges its own battery as it runs but it didnt work dugs ear remained dead i think you have a worse problem the man said better call triple b i guess well have to dug agreed but thanks for the jump to the others he said theyll come fairly promptly but well still have to get the car towed and fixed and that could take longer piers avtmom they consulted maybe you two should get on hack to town kirn said were going to be delayed several hours by the look of it you can go to a library and use their connection and switch back before we get out of here chlorine looked at nimby he shook his head no then he touched her hand oh nimby thinks dearth is trying to separate us we will be relatively ulnerable without our knowledgeable companions it is better to remain togethei dug and kirn exchanged a look that could be dug said and we dont want to put you into any unnecessary risk we must advise you that there is risk to you as long as you remain with us chlorine said but maybe less than there is to you if you are alone kirn said so wed better stick together dug considered i wonder i think there is risk in delay and risk in separating maybe we should call a taxi just to get this done in a hurry but maybe dearth has anticipated that kim said in which case we would be playing into his hands i wondercan nimby sense the larger situation so as to know what course is best chlorine checked he cant fathom the intention ot dearth but can focus on the likely route that help will come to us from xanth if we cant reach the oxonc on our own maybe try that while we wait dug said i think this is a bit like a chess game we need to see more of the board before making our next move nimby agreed so dug went to call triple b while nimby sat in the dead car and focused his ambient awareness on noname key where a person from xanth would most like pass through to mundania with magic dust if any of the modemode lolk got through to the real folk in xanth and the news was good willow elf has passed through chlorine said carrying a locket of magic dust she has joined the baldwin family they are setting out to bring it here but how will they find us kim asked they have the address of hd and pias home chlorine said they will go there so thats where we should be going as mxh as we can kim said chlorine looked at nnnbv yes but she wasnt speaking the truth because nimby indicated no because dearth was now listening and would block whateei they tried to do the bbb help arrived the car had to be towed it refused to respond to the mechanic this was an interesting process whereby the truck connected to the cat and hauled it along by its nose they waited while the repairs were made at the garage thete was a place to cat nearby called a diner so they went there this has delayed things several hours dug said but with the car going again whats to stop us from just driving home and waiting for the baldwins to arrive kim added nimby merely smiled then what about going to a local hbraiy and lumbering on going to the oxone and exchanging back tiom here dug said chloiine knew the answer to that the others have to be there to make the exchange if we go there and edscl and pia arent there it will be lor nothing and dearth will make sure we cant go there again later we have to go at an appointed checkin time but weve been checking in different times kim said so have they evidently so breanna had an ear chlorine said thats what you would call a field unit for spot communication only they could hae been anywheie in xanth but now they must report physical to com passions cave to enter the ambiance of the oxone xanth is more limited in this respect than in mundania we trust they are on their wav and will remain there until we connect so its better late than early kim said comprehending because chances are theie will be only one chance attei that dearth will catch on and interfere exactly dug nodded so between times we might as well travel so as to get more convenient access and get the magic kim said as they left the diner it was as if night weie falling though it was onlv mid afternoon clouds loomed high and broad moving to cut oft what remained of the sky a considerable storm was forming and we couldnt get moving to escape it before it loimed because piers athon of the time it takes to fix a washed out car dug said understanding dearth knows what hes doing ive never seen such a dangerous looking stormcloud kim said awed nimby touched chlorines arm nimby wants you to know that if you leave now while we remain here the storm will not follow you you can escape what is apt to be exceedingly ugly weather dug and kim spoke together no spoken like true companions chlorine said but you will pay a price lets get moving now dug said but maybe youd better park the lemon and ride in the ear with us itll be safer nimby shook his head well ride it back chlorine said you told us how edsel values it we must return it to him in good condition dug looked again at the brooding cloud you do have a point but this could be dangerous we could have it garaged here to keep it safe cars are safer in storms but nimby would not yield chlorine knew that he had his own reasons perhaps beyond her understanding but surely alid the neptune was ready its amazing how much damage a single storm can do sometimes the mechanic said well its not a new car dug said this was independent of age this car has been well cared tor but somehow the wiringive neer seen this particular failure before its a fluke just so long as it wont happen again guaranteed its better than new now dug and kim did what they had to to settle the cost of the repair they had something called insurance that made it easier then they drove the car out of the repair shop nimby and chlorine climbed on the motorcycle and joined them maybe pia should tide in the car kim called its going to be wet on the lemon no ill stay with ed chlorine called back the storm looked worse than eer it frightened chlorine but she clung to nimby she was not going to let him face it alone the neptune turned south and followed the highway out of town most of the traffic was streaming the other way into town as mundanes caught on that the weather was tiuly threatening they were doing the sensible thing and heading for cover a gust of wind caught them the cycle veered then corrected course nimby had progressed from beginner to full competence at a rapid rate and now could handle it ery well but she wondered why he had chosen to ride the lemon when he could have ridden in the safer car was it to spare the companions some risk she suspected not there must be some way in which the motorcycle enhanced his own chances lightning cracked close by and thunder boomed out from it chlorine remembered cumulo fracto nimbus once the worst of clouds and the show he could put on but this was in drear mundania and that made it more frightening rain came down first a few big drops then a pelting ot medium drops then an almost solid sheet of small ones in one and a half moments they were soaked the road looked slick and slippery but nimby pressed on following the car chlorine shivered and hated what it was doing to her hair but what had she expected lightning struck a tree ahead of the car and a large branch crashed onto the road blocking it the neptunes wheels skidded as it braked and it almost didnt stop in time the lemon stopped beside it chlorine was in contact with nimby so knew what he wanted her to know clear the branch well distract the storm but we must stay with you kim called back well return soon and they were off riding back along the road nimby lifted one hand reaching behind his shoulder chlorine realized he wanted to talk more specifically she touched his hand with hers his thought came but she couldnt believe if at first you want me to drive this thing but i dont know how his further thought came instructing her in the rudiments he was serious he needed time to think to spread his awareness to find something he needed but he couldnt pause because the moment he did the storm would catch him with a bolt of lightning it wouldnt kill him but could kill her and knock out his body costing them valuable time ii his body was unconscious away from the companions it might be days before they got together again and dearth would win the notion appalled her but she would have to try to do it to give nimby the time he needed to be aware it was almost the only magic he retained and he had to have the chance to use it piers avrmm but to control the motorccle she would hae to gel in front how could they change places without stoppingf she drew her feet up setting them on the saddle beside nimby then she clung to his shoulders and lilted her bottom standing behind him bent over his head hanging on as the wet wind tore at her body then she hauled one foot up and over his shoulder and the other now she was standing in front ot him reaching under hersell to clutch at his shoulders her panties in his face if he had been a normal man in xanth he would have freaked out and they would have sailed into a tree she slid down his front to land in his lap then he slid back and she took over the handlebars and pedals he put his hands on her hips and did not move again he was tuning out she was controlling the machine all she had to do was keep it going without spinning out of control and crashing until nimby was through sensing she didnt have to race but in the driving ram the handling was treacherous she tried to keep going straight but eered to the left she leaned and steeied right and veered too sharply right the wheels went into the puddle that lined the side sending up a spray and dragging she felt the machine slow but she managed to get it back into the center and straightened out then something in the road loomed maybe a piece of branch or an animal she swerved around it and veered too far left into the puddle there again the water went up in a sheet and the ccle slowed she had to watch her reactions but she was getting better control her confidence was increasing this wasnt so bad lightning struck right ahead the flash blinded her and the crack ol it deafened her she could neither see nor hearbut they were still hurtling foiward she didnt have time to panic she knew where the load was and if she kept their balance it would be all right until she recovered her senses if she could ust go straight was she going stiaight she felt the motoicycle slowing that meant she had drifted to the side but which side she had to turn back into the load but if she turned the wrong way they would go off the road and crash she didnt dare go wrongbut which was right she used her ears which wete starting to recovei the splashing seemed worse on the lell and the motorcycle seemed to be tiymg to drag that way so she fought it going straight because she wasnt quite sure bellei to lorge on through watei than to turn the vuong wa her vision was returning around the glare blindness she saw the road on the right and moved that way recovering speed she had been correct she was back in control then she wondered had that lightning bolt been intended to strike them and missed because she had gone too slowly or had it been meant to blind her so that she would have to stop or crash would there be another chlorine nerved herself and accelerated she steered to one side and then the othei she wanted to become a more elusive target just in case she also squinted hoping to avoid any further blindness however dearth did not seem to be trying very hard to stop them maybe because they were going away from home when they eventually turned back south it was bound to get worse nimby squeeed her hips he was tuning back in you want to take oxer she asked over her shoulder and put one hand back he touched her hand yes she was concerned how to change places again as reversing her moves would be tricky but he simply moved up and she lifted to sit in his lap his arms going around her to take over the handlebars he had control now and knew where he was going he swerved splashing through the puddle and onto a dirt trail that was now mud the wheels slued and skidded but the machine remained upright the trail was sloppy but navigable chlorine couldnt have done it but nimby seemed unconcerned soon they went crosscountry zooming across a soggy held and up a wet slope they intersected another road and followed it to a farmstead nimby slowed the machine and held his hand toward her chlorine touched it and received a mindful of information as she assimilated this nimby guided the lemon to the farmhouse and stopped chlorine got off then nimby rode on so as not to make a stationary target for lightning chlorine knew what she had to do she marched up to the farmhouse door and knocked it opened after a moment revealing a mature woman girl youre soaking the woman exclaimed come in and get dry thank you but must go out again in a moment i must talk to your husband the woman led her to a warm stove the radiating heat was wonderful a mature man approached im farmer jones whats a slip of a girl like you doing out alone in weather like this am put chlorine said my party is stalled on the road because piers anthoni of fallen ood we need a pulley to haul it off i would like to trade for yours ive got a spare block and tackle but its too heavy for you to handle mymy husband edsel is on the motorcycle he ean handle it our friends in the car are bloeked thats why we need it my college son john can load it for you the farmer nodded at a younger man behind him thank you that will really help she smiled at john putting as much reward in it as she could muster in her bedraggled state what do you have in mind to trade aa dragon i mean a giant reptile bones very old on your land we will show you where what do i want with snake bones the farmer demanded dad shes describing a fossil john said maybe a dinosaur is that good why should i trade a good block and tackle for news about something ive already got on my land might be worth it dad dino fossils are valuable and hard to find the bones could get washed away in the storm before we ever saw them the farmer pondered briefly okay you go look at them and tell me if its worth it nimbyi mean my husband will show you where chlorine said but youll have to ride with him on his motorcycle this grows interesting john said pulling on a raincoat ill do it you can wait here and have some hot soup the farmers wife said wonderful chlorine said blissfully john went to the door there was the sound of the motorcycle arming by no coincidence nnnbys awareness made such timing feasible oh chlorine said edsel doesnt talk but he understands hell show you john nodded and stepped out into the weather chlorine settled down to a bowl of steamy soup it was sheer rapture the farmers wife tried to offer chlorine dry clothing but she demurred she would soon hae to go out in the rain again but she thanked them sincerely for the temporary warmth of the stoe and the soup xonl of coyitntion soon there was the sound of the returning motorcycle and john entered its true dad its a dinosaur for sure and wed have missed it well need to shore it up to keep it from washing into the river thing could be worth thousands well find out when this freak storm ends and i can call my paleontology prof at college but it sure as hell is something also thats a lemon hes riding only good folk have those give them the tackle and so chlorine found herself back on the lemon trying to keep the bulky block tackle and rope in place they headed south the storm abruptly intensified dearth obviously was tracking them and had been biding his time until they tried to head south again nimby seemed unconcerned he gunned the motor following the road at high speed chlorine hardly dared look for fear she would see disaster looming she reminded herself that nimby was not the mute dragon or manform he seemed but the demon x th one of the overwhelmingly powerful figures of the cosmos the fact that he lacked most of his power here did not mean that his intellect was diminished he knew what he was doing and where things were he had surveyed the whole area during his time of introspection and now had a virtual map of it in his mind now that he lacked most of his magic she was able to see the power of his other qualities such as his awareness and his learning ability if she hadnt loved him already she would have been falling in love with him now she was nothing owing everything to him but he was such a superior creature he turned his head to glance briefly back at her and winked oh she had forgotten that he could read her thoughts that was part of his awareness especially when he was so close to her but that reminded her that here in mundania she was neither her natural homely dull unhappy self nor her enhanced lovely smart nice persona she was an ordinary person in the body of a mundane woman but she at least had the wit to know her limits and to follow without question the guidance of the one whose limits were immeasurably beyond hers she trusted nimby and wanted to share his fate whatever it might be he did not have to read her thoughts to know that he made her seem like a princess in xanth while he made himself seem like nothing much but the reality was vice versa she never forgot if her late was to die in mundania she wanted to do it in nhnbys company lighting cracked ahead and a small tree fired out sparks and toppled piers anthony onto the road nimby hardly paused he simply guided me cycle overland around the base of the tree and back onto the road he had barely been slowed dearth must have been infuriated because the storm intensified thunder became continuous and the darkness of the massive cloud formation was countered b the brightness of repeated lightning flashes chlorine thought of rracto throwing a lit nimby was getting to dearth and that was good more trees came down crisscrossing the road so thickly that it was pointless to try to use it nimby didnt he rode through the forest winding between the standing trees and brush sluing around puddles and rocks in places the foliage was so thick that it seemed impossible to penetrate but somehow nimby guided the lemon through it without even scraping that map in his head made his course clear however opaque it might seem to her the tackle tried to dislodge she felt it shift as they whipped around a turn she reached back with one hand to take hold of it nimby was getting them where they needed to go she had to see that they got there with their payload something odd happened there was a funny quality to the air around them her long brown hair lifted of its own accord spreading out around her head like a dark halo the cycle suddenly braked skidding across the forest floor it spun around chlorine screamed but they did not fall over instead the paused then took off back the way they had come lightning cracked behind them the burst of heat shoved them faster forward dearth had struck directly at them but nimby had anticipated it and maneuvered out of the way just in time it seemed he could tell when and where lightning was about to strike that halo of hairthat must have been a signal in mundama things didnt just happen magically they had to be prepared for those few seconds were enough to allow nimby to get clear the demon earth was doing his worst and the were escaping it they did hae a chance she reahed that she had been somewhat fatalistic about that now her hope was growing they slid through ridges and channels across fields and through more forest and then arrived back where dug and kim were waiting with the car they had used a tow rope to haul the branch clear with the car so were read to move the block and tackle werent necessar after all chlorine rcahed that though nimby could sense what was around him he could not see into the future the tackle would have done the job if the car hadnt been able to nothing had happened to dug and kim in the interim even the rain had abated it was nimby dearth was after no one else and chlorine realized that dearth might not even be aware of others so nimby had enabled them to clear the way just by being absent they loaded the tackle into the car and tesumed their journe south this time the motorcycle led the way the lam increased and the wind but no trees came down dearth evidently realied that they now had the means to haul trees out of the way lor the tackle could multiply their pulling power several fold so the tackle finessed the trees the mere threat of it stopped that ploy but now it was afternoon and they would not get home today unless they drove in the night the storm was cxtremel dark ahead dearth was saving his worst for last nimby lilted one hand signaling the car then rode into a motel lot he stopped and the car pulled up beside it nimby touched chlorines hand imparting information you stay here for the night chlorine said getting off the cycle and stretching her legs but we can drive a couple more hours before night dug protested and into the night to get home we dont have to stop nimby knows chlorine said stop here eat sleep early well need to resume in the wee hours okay he said dubiously chlorine turned back to the cycleand it was starting to move wait tor me she cried but nimby just waved and drove awav i guess he means for you to stay with us kim said sympathetically i suppose so chlorine agreed concealing her huit she knew nimby was protecting her by giving her a chance to eat and sleep m peace while he distracted dearth but she hated being apart from him they took a motel room and turned on the tv while taking turns showering and cleaning up and changing to dry clothing chlorine saw the ongoing news and was appalled it showed scenes of devastation a freak stoim had laid waste the region and the chatahootcheese river and its tributaries were flooding one of the hooded rivers ciossed then route south the bridges were closed pilrs anthom were not going to get across that in the next two days dug said grimlv not with a ear nimby knew chloiine said beginning to appreciate why he had halted their drive south kirn emerged trom the shower wrapped in a towel she was a lanky girl but self assured look at that she exclaimed as the tv picture showed a bridge getting washed away where is this disaster on our route south dug said heading for the shower freak storm they say freak storm my eye kirn said thats dearth going atter nimby yes chlorine agreed that tree across the road was just to delay us while the storm flooded the area between us and home nimby stopped it with the tackle but too much time was lost but nimby has something in mind its like a ehess game kim said ploy and counterploy were just pawns not seeing the larger strategy until its too late nimby will rind a way chlorine said bravely kirn patted her hand im sure he will but chlorine knew fake optimism when she heard it the ram was only moderate in this region they went out to eat and got gasoline for the car and turned in at eight at night chlorine had a bed to herself she missed nimby but knew that li he returned here to be with her the storm would intensify and the motel might well be struck by lightning and burned down so nimby was protecting them all its an irony dug remarked from the other bed we companions are supposed to keep nimby out of mischief in this unfamiliar land instead hes keeping hs out of mischief nimby very smait chlorine said and hes been studying conscience demons dont come with consciences theyre like machines or golems in that respect but nimby s trying to learn how to loe to dream to have conscienceall the things the souled creatures do so this is practice for him id say hes getting there kim said okay weve got the alarm set for two am lets sleep shux dug said i thought we were in tor six hours of hot love six minutes swiftie kim retorted then youre done ready or not you are a hard taskmistress no a soft one for live and a half minutes alter that turn into a biassie lassie now chlorine real missed nimby the biassies weie xanth lolk made ol brass their women could be surprisingly soft when they wanted to be but were otherwise metal hard kim was obliging dugs interest but had set a time limit well within a normal mans capability she was a nice person chlorine knew that if she set nimby such a limit he would manage to signal rive storks in live minutes that was an advantage of not being human she closed her eyes imagining nimbys performance and thought she felt his answering nudge probably imagination because of his lack of magic here but maybe he was tuning in on her and shared her vision and feeling she wished they could signal the stork and have it deliver but ol course that would never happen unless nimb wanted it he had given her so much she was ashamed even to think of wanting more of being a normal family with all the os and travails ot raising children the alarm went off startling her awake they scrambled out of then beds and lined up at the bathroom getting ready twenty minutes later they were outside two in the ear and one waiting for the motorcycle it came chlorine got on behind nimby and they were on their way somewhere she wondered where he had been all night probabh riding around in random patterns never pausing so that dearth could not pin him down fortunately nimby did not need sleep when they lay togethei for the night and she slept she knew that his awareness was reaching out exploring all xanth but what about edsels mortal body that must be getting tired so where were they going now not south nimby followed roads and trails to the side dearth was awaieit seemed he always know where nimby was once he tuned inand the weather worsened but it was apparent that a storm could not be generated instantly and nimby taking an unexpected direction was staying just ahead of it still this was not leading home they drove some distance and dawn came still nimb led them in the strange direction they took a side trail this soon became waterlogged the hooding had icached this far diowmng out the road chlorine saw a bridge ahead that was above the water but the approach was impossible nimby turned otf the motoi and came to a stop he touched chlorines hand she siot off and went to the car which had stopped with its tires pifrs riioi deep in standing watei the toad goes thiough and crosses the nei theieaftei it s mostl high giound it we cuss heic deaith won t he able to flood us out latei but it will stop our motoi tuin it oft xvell make a winch it will be slow but can be done thev didnt question this thev shut down the motoi and brought out the block tackle and rope nimb walked the lemon out to a stout tiee then anchoied the block to it it was a special design that could be set to increase the pulling force considerabk this tequiicd a lot of tope but they had it nimbv had planned well then he tied one lope to the motoicycle and the other to the distant cai he rode the ccle along a dr ridgeand h hauled the cat slowly through the watei chlorine remembered that there had been an example of such a pullev in one of the moie preiews they had seen on the second dav in mun dama nimh had studied that and learned theie had been motorcycles too she leahed now he was using what he had learned then nothing passed him by then nimby disconnected and walked the lemon to another tiee farther along he repeated the process alter sevcial such stages the car was through the deep puddle and back on di land at the edge ol the bridge it had been towed through the water without hamg to stiuggle to keep its motor dr apparently water didnt hurt a motoi that wasnt running at least not in the same way as it had in the mountains unless it was guided in the night by the malign power of the demon f they lei the motors dr bnefl then they slatted them without dif hcult and rode aeioss the bridge the water was rushing tumultuousl under but the budge supports and structuie wcie solid bvidentlv this was a little known crossing that dearth had not thought to wash out now it was too late vas dearth angi so it seemed this time clouds did not toim and thicken the opposite was the case the ten am warmed and dried steam rose tiom the scene then smoke then hrcs broke out smoke rose into the sk what was happening nimb touched her hand volcanic actmtv she asked amaed aie theic olcanoes heie not hitherto but dearth was angi and the powei of the eaith was his as well as the powers of the an and water this legion would sec its first olcano it nimbv didn t get awa from here soon but nimbv was alreadv momg awa horn it i hen two ehicles raced past the spieading dies and left them behind the olcano too xom or cunti tn was too late deaith had not had time to raise it to sufficient powei thanks to nimb s sudden change of dnection even so there would be new weathei headlines toi the local newspapeis chlorine wondeied again where nimb had been during the nightbut obviously it had not been near here so be had suipnsed deaith and gotten through anothei barnei nimbv signaled the tar again the pulled ovei to the side ol the road nnnb touched chlorine s hand nimb needs time to be aware chlorine announced we have caught up to his prior plan and now he needs more information but we cant affoid to pause deaith will strike we have an houi of clear road ahead nimby must ride in the car and dug can ride the lemon got it dug said its been like magic getting through we want more of that he took over the motorcycle nimb got into the back of the car vitb chlorine kirn drove as the moved out nimb leaned back and closed his eves chlorine thought he was sleeping but he took hei hand suddenlv she was sharing his awareness she saw the land ot mun danu extending as her perception rose tiom the cai like a bird llmg upward the trees houses roads lakes and fields spread out in the manner ol an unfolding map there were tiny cars on the roads moving in aiious directions she realied with a start that this was not a pictuie this was icalitv this was what was happening in this region oi mundama right now there was another nvei also flooding with its bridges closed the had circled aiound one such impediment but now were heading into anothei well the had almost two das to get home and it it look one da to get around this one the would still be in time the scene flew south to the peninsula ot xanlh called florida in mundama it dropped down to another swollen uvei crossed it and oriented on a town beond on a motel into that motel searching out a paiticular unit into that unit there was a hguie chlonne tecognied sean baldwin mundane with a voung woman who looked somewhat familiaroh it was willow hi without net wings her mundane version and sean s little brothei david baldwin now age fifteen and his cat midiange the had visited xanth thiee ears ago chlorine knew them well toi she and nimb had been with them when the iii wind came to xanth dlow earned a locket chloime iccogmzed it horn nimb s awareness it was magic holding any amount of anything and at the moment it held a tew oddments a lessei demon and a bucket of magic dust magic dust she had lor the moment forgotten that was what nimby needed to hae some power ol magic in mundania his body in xanth was the source ol all magic but here he was mundane until he got that dust scan and willow were bringing it to him but had been stalled by the flooded rivers they could not get across did dearth know this so far he had given evidence of watching only nimby but he surely could watch anyone he chose here in his dreary land so he was not only blocking nimbys progress with impertect success but blocking scans progress with better success because sean did not have awareness he could not fathom the devious ways to circumvent the barriers that river would take days to subside how could sean and willow get through they had seans car but the bridges were closed the bridges were in place but deemed to be unsafe during the flood no one was allowed on them maybe someone could sneak across by foot but then he would be without his car what could they do willow perked up cocking her head she heard something or sensed it she touched seans arm and whispered something to him she had felt nimbys awareness chlorine knew this only because nimby did contact had been made willow was of xanthly origin so was better attuned to magic even this very slight magic of sensing but what good was it no one could cross that river from either side not until the three days ol the challenge were long since over nimby had gone around one block but used up a night doing it and the block at the other end he could not do much about so the essential nature of this contest suggested that nimby would lose did it mean that seans parl would gie up us effort to bring the magic locket to nimby then the scene faded the vision was done chlorine opened her ces nimb did not he had gone to sleep or at least his body had and that was surel good chlorine told kim what she had seen so the mundane baldwins arc trying she concluded but they cant reach us and we cant reach them even il one party managed to cross its rier the other river is keeping the other back we are kept apart by parallel rivers so it looks as though dearth has won is nimbv concerned kim asked or unntk i dont know hes asleep no need to clarify that it was really edsels tired body sleeping he probably got no rest last night so what do we do chlorine asked near tears we move on south maybe well get a break a break like finding a boat to cross the river dearth would sink it kim shrugged its not over till its over they continued south when they reached the city there was no way to go south beyond it nimby woke we have gone as far south as we can go chlorine said he touched her hand then returned to sleep turn left she told kim there is a motel there with a room free the motels were crowded now because of the number of people caught unexpectedly away from home finding a room for the night would be difficult kim turned and dug on the motorcycle followed they drove along the side road there chlorine said pointing but it says no vacancies kim protested try it anyway they drove to the front office kim got out and went in she emerged moments later with a look of vague awe they thought they had no vacancies but then they got a cancellation so we got it nimby knew chlorine said how could he know the future i mean you explained about the awareness but thats all in the present isnt it i think he knew the people were canceling in the present they just hadnt yet notified the office so they had a good room this time nimby joined them the storm hovered but did not intensify dearth seemed satisfied to keep the two rivers flooded knowing that they represented a formidable barrier he knew where nimby was and where seans party was as long as they remained separated victor was just a matter of time nimby went to bed and slept well go get pia dug said chlorine sat beside the bed and watched nimby surely his body was tired and needed the rest but he didnt even seem to be worried was piers anthony he bluffing but with the two parties unable to meet he had to lose should he at least be trying to get across the river on the chance that scan would get across his river whatever the end of this i love you she murmured you are my everything nimby for at least she had had three years of the wonder of him and perhaps she would have more if all nimby lost was status she didnt want him to be hurt but she hardly cared about his status as long as she could be with him but she was afraid that if he lost that status he would leave xanth and that would be the end of everything dug and kirn returned with the pizza they turned on the tv and watched the weather news it wasnt good they chatted about incidentals staying away from the obvious subject nimby slept on finally chlorine joined him lying beside him holding his hand he was unresponsive was that just because his body was dead tired or was it worse could nimby have given up in the morning nimby joined them at a restaurant across the street for breakfast finally dug broached the awful matter two days are gone what do we do nimby touched chlorines hand we relax she said we read a book read a book kirn asked it was evident that her patience was fraying i saw a little library just down the street from us dug said we could go there kirn glanced at him but refrained from making a sharp comment well it will pass the time i suppose as if they had too much time on their hands chlorine shared their gathering depression were they just supposed to dawdle here waiting for the end they finished breakfast and went to the library but as they entered the lights went out oh another power failure the librarian said im so sorry her name tag said mary lou matthew kim looked around you have a computer system yes for the patrons to use to go inline the librarian said they love it but the powers been so erratic the lust two days we cant use it they knew why the power failed nimby could escape the moment he reached the oxone if he had access to the grid at the right time xosr or contlntion the formal checkin time was in the next half hour but dearth would make sure the power didnt return until well after that or when nimby lett the library things were quiet now only because dearth was in control of the situation but dearth wasnt taking any chances they looked at books as it was light enough without electric lights nimby took one about quantum physics and read it avidly chlorine remembered that dug had discussed the matter nimby tended to follow up on anything that attracted his interest so now he was completing his knowledge of that subject chlorine preferred to look at a book of pretty pictures then nimby touched her hand mystified by his request she got up and went to the librarys bathroom it had a window to the back she loosened the latch and opened it here she said out the window something leaped up landing on the sill startled she drew back it was a nondescript cat then she recognized it midrange she said what are you doing here she picked him up nimby had known he was coming she carried the cat into the main section of the library and set him down beside nimby nimby reached out to midranges collar there was a chain with a locket nimby took the locket in his hand without removing it from the cat he touched chlorines hand and she felt a thrill of power it was the magic dust within the locket nimby was drawing on it without even having to open the locket something in her body changed in fact she felt three pulses of change chlorine stared so did dug and kim s that what i think it is kim asked there was a sudden roll of thunder outside dearth had just caught on nimby got up briefly touched the hands of dug and kim and went to the computer terminal carrying midrange who seemed more than satisfied chlorine knew how that was he touched the unit it came on lightning struck the building but the library evidently had an airester because there was no damage dearth had been caught by surprise and couldnt act swiftly enough kim caught on she leaped to the terminal and started typing the screen came on but theres no power the librarian protested now there is dug said and indeed there was for nimby was powering the sstem magically none of them saw fit to mention that detail however piers anthony chlorine sat at the adjacent terminal joining in this one was also working as the current flowed throughout the system dug came to tvpe for her kim led them straight to the oxone they entered it and the hall became real around them edsel and pia ere there in breannas leat so were breanna and justin we were atraid you wouldnt make it pia said coming to hug chlorine chlorine had had a similar fear but didnt care to admit it nimbv knew for sure breanna said we sent the locket out but heard there was really bad weather in mundama we figured we knew why when the baldwins reported trouble getting through we were really nervous midrange cat got through with the locket chlorine said think the magic leaked out and affected him giving him extra intelligence he knew where to go suddenly she realized why nimby had been sleeping so much his awareness had been following the cat guiding midrange throughout the demon e h was watching the humans not the cat so he slipped though she glanced at kim youll have to see that midrange gets back to his family with our gratitude we will kim said nimby touched hands with edsel and chlorine touched pia her orientation changed now she was looking the opposite way nimby touched chlorines hand suddenly she had important new information she turned to pia i have some news tor you nimb is pleased with the way you and ed cooperated and has given you three gifts oh we dont need any gifts pia protested being in xanth vas such a wonderful experience tor us she glanced at edsel were going to stay married and have children and im going to study the environment i have gained so much then hope vou are pleased with the gifts for they have already been given chlorine said first your bod has been restored to its form at age sixteen as it seems was your wish in xanth and will be easier to maintain that way oh pia exclaimed i thought that was only during the adventure it was a foolish wish anyway its really meant for edsel chlorine said i f fruim atrreed xoh oh conttntion second voui diabetes is gone pias mouth dropped open no more needles i thought that was only in xanth too the healing spring no more needles third you will receive a visit from the stork pia was astonished you meaneven though we were in xanth with your bodies peihaps chlorine said we used your bodies similarly because of yout association with xanth at the time your child will have a magic talent when visiting xanth pia seemed about to faint that reallv gave her something to think about kim said smiling i envy her kirns smile though genuinely warm tor her friends good fortune had a tinge of sadness she tried to mask you too will receive a visit chlorine told her with similar magic a but that cant be i mean kim hesitated unaware that they knew about her problem in that respect and her seciet heartache i mean we were in mundama the whole time the storks deliver as nimby tells them to the two of you were extremely helpful and are deserving now kim was the one about to faint you mean really will havea baby her underlying sadness was transforming to abiding joy and it was mirrored in dugs face as will i chlorine said then startled she looked at nimby i will everyone laughed then the three women came together and hugged each other this is wonderful but weird breanna said looking on somewhat enviously nimby touched her hand but my turn will come breanna added awed and be worth waiting for behind her justms eyes widened in surprised surmise but after a moment ot thought pia got serious dont want to seem ungrateful but dont think i want thesethese gifts kim winced pia this isnt exactly something you can turn down nimby is know who nimby is pia faced him i appreciate all this nimby really do but they arc selfish things ive been selfish all my hie but in xanth i discovered that i dont like that style want toto pifrs anihom do something useful with my lile so with all due respect take back your gifts i do want to be beautiful and free of illness and now do want to make a family but would trade them all for the ability to accomplish my new purpose which i think is to save the great old trees of mundama just as i helped save them in xanth and i guess thats something ill just have to do by myselt i think i can do it all the hard way nimby looked at edsel no argument here edsel said all i wanted was pia back and i think i like her even better this way nimby extended his hand to pia she stepped forward and took it nothing showed but chlorine knew that there was a pulse of magic they were all in magic all the way out to the library terminals that nimby s magic was animating then pia stepped back nimby touched chlorines hand you now have additional intelligence courage and persuasiveness chlorine told pia these qualities will help you to accomplish your purpose pia smiled with genuine gratitude thank you so much nimby these gifts i will use well i will always treasure my time in xanth but my true mission is in mundania nimby turned away the job was done the others bade each other quick farewells then the four mundanians departed and nimby and chlorine went back toward xanth leaving justin and breanna in the leaf wait till pia discovers that those last gifts werent in exchange for the first ones but in addition chlorine murmured and wait till edsel discovers your influence on his lemon motorcycle when midrange hides the magic locket in it nimby didnt reply but he smiled he was learning about niceness too
