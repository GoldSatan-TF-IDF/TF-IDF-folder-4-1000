chapter one the hardest things to say the most important things are the hardest things to say they are the things you get ashamed of because words make them smaller when they were in your head they were limitless but when they come out they seem to be no bigger than normal things but thats not all the most important things he too close to wherever your secret heart is buried they are clues that could guide your enemies to a prize they would love to steal its hard and painful for you to talk about these things and then people just look at you strangely they havent understood what youve said at all or why you almost cried while you were saying it i was twelve nearly thirteen when i first saw a dead person it happened in a long time ago although sometimes it doesnt seem very long to me especially on the nights when i wake up from dreams in which the hail falls into his open eyes chapter two the tree house gang we had a tree house in a big tree which hung over some empty ground in castle rock it was a kind of club although it had no name there were five or six regulars and some other pussies who came and went wed let them come up when we were playing cards for money and we needed some fresh blood the sides of the tree house were made out of wood and the roof was metal we had taken from the dump looking over our shoulders all the time because the manager of the dump had a dog which ate children for breakfast or so people said we found a screen door out there on the same day it stopped the flies getting in but it was really rusty it didnt matter what time of day you looked out through that screen door it always looked like sunset besides playing cards the club was a good place to go and smoke cigarettes and look at girlie books we built a secret space under the floor to hide magazines and cigarette packets when somebodys father decided to do the me and my son are best friends routine and visit us that summer had been the driest and hottest since the newspapers said and on that friday in september a few days before school started again the grass was dry and brown teddy and chris and i were up in the club in the morning complaining about school being so near and playing cards and telling the same jokes wed told each other a hundred times before teddy was laughing his peculiar laugh at the jokes eeeeeeeeee like a fingernail scratching on a board he was strange we all knew it close to being thirteen like the rest of us the thick glasses and his deafness made him seem like an old man sometimes in spite of the glasses teddy couldnt see very well and he often misunderstood the things people said to him his eyesight was just naturally bad but there was nothing natural about what had happened to his ears back in those days when it was the fashion to get your hair cut really short teddy had castle rocks first beatle haircut four years before anyone in america had even heard of the beatles he kept his ears covered because they looked like two lumps of warm wax one day when teddy was eight his father had got angry with him for breaking a plate his mother was out at work teddys dad took him over to the big oven at the back of the kitchen and pushed the side of teddys head down against one of the burner plates he held it down for about ten seconds then he pulled teddy up by the hair and did the other side then he called the hospital and told them to come and fetch his boy then he sat down in front of the tv with his gun across his knees when mrs burroughs from next door came to ask if teddy was ok she had heard the screaming teddys dad pointed the gun at her mrs burroughs left the duchamp house at roughly the speed of light and called the police when the ambulance came for teddy his dad explained to the ambulancemen that although the captain said the area was clear he knew there were still german soldiers around before long teddys dad was in togus which was a special hospital where they sent soldiers who were mad from the war he had been on the beaches in normandy and had just got worse and worse ever since in spite of what his dad had done to him teddy was proud of him and visited him in togus every week teddy was the stupidest boy in our gang i suppose and he was crazy he used to take the craziest chances like running out in front of lorries on the road and jumping out of the way at the very last moment this made him laugh but it frightened us because his eyesight was so bad you had to be careful what you dared him because he liked to do anything for a dare in the middle of a game of cards we heard someone coming fast up the ladder which was fixed to the side of the tree it was vern tessio one of the other regulars he was sweating hard wait till you hear this guys he said hear what i asked ive got to get my breath i ran all the way from my house all the way chris asked unbelievingly man youre crazy verns house was two miles away its too hot for that this is worth it vern said you wont believe this what can you all camp out tonight vern was looking at us in excitement his eyes were dark and hard in his sweaty face i mean if you tell your families were going to camp in my back field yeah i think so chris said picking up his cards and looking at them but my dads in an awful mood drinking you know youve got to man vern said sincerely you wont believe this can you gordie probably i usually could do things like that in fact i had hardly been at home all summer in april my older brother dennis had died in a jeep accident he had just started training in the army an army lorry hit the jeep he was in and he died immediately he was a few days short of being twenty my parents so whats this all about vern teddy asked he and chris were still playing cards i was reaching for a detective magazine vern tessio said you guys want to go and see a dead body everybody stopped chapter three the forests of maine wed all heard about it on the radio of course we had our old radio on all the time listening to pop music elvis presley roy orbison and the rest when the news came on we usually stopped listening but the ray brower story was different he was our age and from chamberlain a town about forty miles away from castle rock three days before vern burst into the clubhouse ray brower had gone out with one of his mothers buckets to pick wild fruit when night fell and he still hadnt returned his mother called the police and the search started but three days later no one had found him we knew from listening to the story on the radio that they were never going to find him alive sooner or later they would just stop searching they were already sending divers down into the pools and lakes nothing like that could happen in southwest maine today suburbs have spread over most of the land the forest is still there in places but if you walk steadily in a single direction youll find a road sooner or later but in those days it was possible to walk into the forest and lose your direction there and die chapter four a jar of pennies vern tessio had been under the front of his house digging before i go any further id better tell you why he was digging there and even before i tell you that id better tell you that vern and teddy were about equal in intelligence in not having very much intelligence that is verns brother billy was even more stupid as youll see four years ago when he was eight vern buried a jar of pennies under the front of the house in the dark space he called his cave he was playing a game about robbers and they were hiding the pennies from the police he drew a map which showed where the jar was put it in his room and forgot about it for nearly a month then one day when he wanted to go and see a film and he didnt have enough money he remembered about the pennies and went to find the map but his mother had tidied his room and taken away the map along with old magazines and other rubbish she had used them to start a fire in the kitchen the next morning so verns map went up the kitchen chimney ever since then vern had looked for the jar of pennies they added up to only about three dollars but as the years passed and vern became more and more desperate about these pennies of his the jar held sometimes as much as ten dollars he never found the place where he had buried them sometimes we tried to tell him what was obvious to us that his big brother billy had known about the jar and had dug it up himself but vern refused to believe this although he hated billy he also refused to ask billy about it probably he was afraid that billy would laugh and say of course i took them you stupid pussy and there were twenty dollars in the jar and i spent it all anyway he was digging there early that friday morning when he heard the screen door open and shut above him he kept very quiet he heard billys friend charlie hogan say jesus christ billy what are we going to do now charlie was one of the hardest guys in town he was in the same gang as ace merrill and eyeball chambers so he had to be hard so as soon as vern heard him talk like that he was very interested something big was happening nothing billy said thats what were going to do nothing but didnt you see him charlie said it must be that boy in the news on the radio the one called brower or something christ billy the train must have hit him yeah right billy agreed and you puked it was lucky the girls didnt see him they would tell everyone do you think they guessed something was wrong no said charlie marie doesnt like to go down that back harlow road anyway she thinks its frightening out there but its a pity we stole that car billy now we cant tell the police because they would ask us how we got to harlow district without a car of our own and i puked on my new shoes the guy was just lying there did you see him man they finished their cigarettes and went off to find ace are we going to tell ace billy charlie asked as they walked away man we arent ever going to tell anyone said billy as soon as vern was sure that they were really gone he ran all the way to our tree house with the news chapter five making plans youre really lucky i said theyd kill you if they knew you had listened teddy said i know the back harlow road it ends at the river i used to go fishing there could he have walked all the way from chamberlain to harlow i asked thats twenty or thirty miles i think so chris said if he was following the railway tracks its easy to walk on them and he probably thought they would lead him out of the forest and then in the dark along comes a train and bang anyway do you want to go and see it vern asked he was so excited that he could hardly keep still yes said chris throwing his cards on to the table and you know what i bet we get our pictures in the paper well be famous what said vern teddy grinned yeah chris explained we can find the body and report it i dont know said vern billy would guess that i heard him and charlie talking and hell beat me no he wont i said he wont have to worry any more about the stolen car and everything but what about our parents teddy said if we find the body theyll know we werent camping in verns back field well just tell them we got bored in the field i said and decided to camp in the forest instead and then everyone will be too excited about us finding the body to beat us ok teddy said lets all meet here after lunch what can we tell them about supper chris said you and me and gordie can say were eating at verns and ill tell my mother im eating over at chriss vern said that would work unless there was some emergency or unless any of the parents contacted each other none of us came from rich families and neither verns nor chriss house had a telephone a lot of people didnt in those days my dad had retired from work verns dad worked at a factory in town teddys mum hired out a room in her house when she could find someone to take it chriss dad was nearly always drunk and didnt have a job chris didnt talk about his dad much but we all knew he hated him like poison his dad beat him often once the year before some milkmoney had disappeared from school chris was accused of taking it he swore he didnt steal it but because he was one of those nogood chambers he wasnt allowed back in school for two weeks his father put him in the hospital that time with a broken nose and wrist its true that he came from a bad family his eldest brother dave was in prison and richard called eyeball because he had a bad eye went round with ace merrill and the other local hard men i think thatll work i said what about john and marty john and marty despain were two other regular members of our gang theyre still away chris said they wont be back till monday we were too excited now to play cards we all left the clubhouse and went home to get ready chapter six brother denny when i got home my mum was out my dad was in the garden hopelessly watering the dry plants hi dad i said brightly will it be all right if i camp out in vern tessios back field tonight with some of the guys what guys vern teddy duchamp chris sometimes he took the opportunity to complain about the friends i chose but today he didnt care i suppose its ok he said there was no argument in him that morning he just looked sad and tired he was sixtythree old enough to be my grandfather my mother was fiftyfive when she and dad got married they tried to start a family straight away but with no luck a few years later a doctor told them they would never have a baby but five years after that dennis was born the doctor said it was amazing and that my parents should thank god and be happy with denny because he would be the only child seven years later i was born for my parents one gift from god was enough i wont say they were cruel to me or anything like that but i certainly came as a surprise and i guess when youre in your forties you dont enjoy surprises as much as you used to they just acted as if i didnt exist most of the time i was the invisible man like in the book at the supper table it was denny how did you do today at school and denny who are you taking to the dance and denny wed better talk man to man about that car we saw if i said pass the butter dad would say denny are you sure the army is what you want if i repeated my request for the butter mum would say denny do you want me to buy you one of those pendleton shirts tomorrow one night when i was nine i said jesus these potatoes taste like garbage i wanted to see what would happen and mum said denny auntie grace called today and asked about you and gordon i didnt hate denny or think he was the greatest person in the world either we rarely did things together he was seven years older than me and lived in a different world so how could i have strong feelings about him it was great when he took me to the park to watch him play ball with his friends or when he read a storybook to me but there werent many times like that most of the time i was alone i guess thats why i started reading a lot and why im a writer now like all writers i sometimes try to put the places and people i knew when i was young into my stories after his death my parents just went to pieces now it was five months and i didnt know if they would ever be whole again they left dennys room exactly the same they didnt touch a thing that room frightened me i expected dead denny to be there waiting for me in the clothes cupboard with his brains spilling out of his head from the accident i imagined his arms coming up and him whispering why wasnt it you gordie why wasnt it you who died chapter seven the gun my room was on the second floor and it was really hot up there i was glad i wasnt sleeping there that night and the thought of where we were going made me excited again i rolled up two blankets and tied an old belt around them i collected all my money which was less than a dollar then i was ready to go i went down the back stairs to avoid meeting my dad i was walking up carbine street towards the clubhouse when chris caught up with me his eyes were shining gordie you want to see something sure what come down here first he pointed down an alley between two shops what is it chris come on i said he ran down the alley and i ran after him at the bottom the smell from the rubbish was terrible chris sincerely im going to puke im but i forgot about the smell when chris put his hand into his backpack and pulled out an enormous handgun do you want to be the lone ranger or the cisco kid chris asked with a grin naming our two favourite tv heroes jesus chris where did you get that from my dads desk man your dads going to beat you when he finds out chriss eyes just went on dancing he isnt going to find out he and his friends have got enough wine to keep them drunk for a week ill put it back before then chris hated alcohol hed already seen too much of what it can do he was the only one in our gang who didnt have a drink when the despain twins brought some beer theyd stolen from their father have you got bullets for it nine of them all that was left in the box hell think he used them himself shooting at bottles when he was drunk any in it at the moment no of course not what do you think i am i finally took the gun i liked the heavy way it sat in my hand i could see myself as someone out of an ed mcbain story or a john d macdonald novel i pointed the gun at a large tin with smelly rubbish spilling out of it and squeezed ka blam the gun jumped in my hand fire shot from the end it felt as if my wrist was broken my heart was in my mouth a big hole appeared in the surface of the tin it was the work of an evil magician jesus i screamed chris was laughing wildly i couldnt tell if he was amused or frightened you did it you did it gordie lachance is shooting castle rock to pieces be careful everyone here comes gordie shut up lets go i screamed and grabbed him by the shirt i gave the gun to chris and he pushed it into his backpack as we ran up the alley when we reached carbine street we slowed to a walk so that no one would notice us if they had heard the noise of the gun chris was still laughing man its a pity you couldnt see your face oh man that was really great you knew there was a bullet in it didnt you that was a rotten trick chris really i didnt know gordie honestly i just took it out of my dads desk he always takes the bullets out of it i suppose he was too drunk to remember last time chris looked as innocent as a baby but when we got to the clubhouse we found vern and teddy waiting and he started to laugh again he told them the whole story and after everyone had had a good laugh teddy asked chris what he thought they needed a gun for nothing really chris said except we might see a wild animal besides its frightening out in the forest at night everyone nodded at that chris was the strongest and bravest guy in our gang and he could say things like that if teddy had said it wed all have laughed at him did you put your tent up in the field teddy asked vern yeah and i put two lamps in it and turned them on so itll look as if were there after dark hey man great i said and slapped vern on the back for him that was real thinking he grinned so lets go teddy said its nearly twelve already chris stood up and we gathered round him well walk across beemans field he said and then well meet the railway tracks by the dump and just walk across the bridge into harlow how far is it do you think teddy asked i dont know said chris harlows big were going to have to walk at least twenty miles does that sound right to you gordie yeah maybe more thirty miles even if its thirty we should be there by tomorrow afternoon if no one turns into a pussy said chris no pussies here teddy said straight away miaoww vern said and we all laughed come on you guys chris said and picked up his backpack blankets and water bottle chapter eight the railway by the time we got across beemans field and had reached the tracks we had all taken our shirts off and tied them around our waists we were sweating like pigs we climbed the bank up to the railway and there we stood and looked down the tracks ill never forget that moment however old i get the hands on my watch stood at twelve oclock and the sun shone down with cruel heat behind us was castle rock where we had all grown up with its houses and its factories sending smoke into the sky and waste into the river in front of us were the railway tracks and the sun seemed to send us messages off the metal the castle river was to our left and to our right some empty land covered in small bushes we stood there for that one midday moment and then chris said come on lets go we walked beside the tracks and our feet sent up clouds of black dust at every step vern started singing but soon stopped which was better for our ears only teddy and chris had brought water bottles and we were all drinking from them a lot we can fill the bottles again at the dump i said theres a tap there with good water my dad told me ok chris said that will be a good place to rest anyway what about food teddy asked suddenly i bet nobody remembered to bring something to eat i know i didnt chris stopped god i didnt either gordie i shook my head feeling really stupid vern nothing vern said sorry lets see how much money weve got i said i untied my shirt and laid it on the ground we all put our money into it we had about two and a half dollars not bad i said theres a shop at the end of that little road that goes to the dump one of us can get some hamburger meat and some cokes there who vern asked well spin coins for it when we get to the dump come on i put all the money into my pocket and was just tying my shirt around my waist again when chris shouted train i put my hand on to one of the tracks to feel it although i could already hear it the track was shaking like a living thing vern and chris jumped down the bank the train was really loud now instead of jumping teddy turned towards the train the sun flashed off his thick glasses come on teddy i said no im going to wait till its close and then jump he looked at me in excitement lorries are nothing man this is a train youre crazy man do you want to get killed just like on the beaches at normandy teddy shouted and walked out into the middle of the tracks for a moment i was too surprised to move unable to believe such amazing stupidity then i grabbed him pulled him to the top of the bank and pushed him over the edge i jumped after him and he hit me in the stomach as i landed i got a knee into his chest at the same time and he fell down then we were locked together rolling over and over hitting and scratching each other you little worm teddy was screaming dont you act big with me ill kill you teddy i shouted back no one must know were here dont you understand you stupid pussy eventually chris and vern separated us chris held teddy until he became calm and just stood there his glasses bent and hanging off one ear youre a pussy lachance teddy said he was just trying to do the right thing man chris said come on you guys vern said lets go chapter nine the dump we reached the dump around half past one and slid down the bank the dump was surrounded by a high wire fence and there were signs saying that the dump was open between four and eight in the afternoon no entry at any other time under any circumstances we climbed over the fence and jumped down to the ground we went straight to the tap while vern and teddy argued about who would go next i looked round there was always so much stuff in the dump that my eyes hurt just looking at it all of america was there all the stuff for which america had no further use there were plenty of wild animals too but not the kinds you see in disney films or in childrens zoos where they let you stroke the animals the town dogs came here too they used to attack each other over a piece of rotten meat but they never attacked milo pressman the manager of the dump because milo always had chopper with him chopper was the most feared and the least seen dog in castle rock rumours and stories had made him enormous cruel and ugly it was said that milo had trained him to go for particular parts of the body he could take an ear an eye a foot a leg or any part of the body even teddy was afraid of chopper there was no sign of milo or chopper today chris and i watched vern and teddy at the tap teddys crazy i said softly i know it chris said he wont live to be twice the age he is now you remember that time in the tree of course the year before teddy and chris had climbed a tall tree behind my house chris had stopped near the top because the rest of the branches looked dry and rotten teddy wanted to go on and nothing chris said made any difference teddy did it though he reached the top but then the branch he was on broke and teddy fell chris just managed to grab hold of teddys hair as he went past although his wrist hurt for a week afterwards he held him until his feet found a branch to stand on when they got down chris was greyfaced and almost puking from fear and teddy was angry with him for pulling his hair i dream about it sometimes chris said except in the dream i miss him i just grab a couple of hairs and teddy goes screaming down through the branches to the ground strange eh right i said and for a moment we looked in each others eyes and saw some of the true things that made us friends after we had all had enough to drink and had thrown water at one another for a while we sat in the shadow of the dumps only tree this is really a good time vern said simply he didnt mean just being here in the dump or going for a walk up the tracks all that was only part of it everything was there and around us we knew exactly who we were and exactly where we were going in life it was great we sat under the tree until the shadows grew longer and then we realized someone had to go and get some food the dump opens at four vern said i dont want to be here when milo and chopper arrive ok i said odd man goes thats you gordie chris said youre odd all right i grinned and gave them each a coin spin i said four coins shone brightly as they turned in the sun four hands grabbed them from the air four flat slaps on four dirty wrists we uncovered two heads and two tails we spun again and this time all four of us had tails oh jesus thats bad luck vern said not telling us anything we didnt know four heads meant really good luck four tails the opposite nobody believes that garbage teddy said its baby stuff come on spin this time the other three all had tails and i had heads and i was suddenly frightened they still had the bad luck then teddy was laughing his crazy laugh and pointing at me and the feeling disappeared go and get the food teddy cried go on gordie said chris well wait by the tracks you guys had better not go on without me i said and away i went i never had any friends later like the ones i had when i was twelve did you chapter ten milo and chopper words mean different things to different people to me summer is always going to mean running down the road to the florida market with coins jumping in my pocket and the sun flying my brains the word brings a picture to my mind of railway tracks running off into the distance there were also favourite songs and films games to play grass to cut sports to play and teams to support and now i sit here trying to look through an ibm screen and see that time and i can almost feel the thin brown boy buried in this yearold body and i can almost hear the sounds i heard then but all of that summer is contained in the picture of gordon lachance running down the road to the florida market with the coins in his pocket and the sweat running down his back after i had bought the food i walked fast back to the dump i put the bag of food inside my shirt and climbed over the gate i was halfway through the dump towards the back where i had left the others when i saw something i didnt like milo pressmans car was parked beside his office building if milo saw me i was going to be in a world of pain suddenly the other side of the dump seemed very far away why hadnt i gone round the outside of the fence but i was too far into the dump now to want to turn round and go back i kept putting one foot in front of the other trying to look calm trying to look as if i belonged here with a paper bag down the front of my shirt walking towards the fence between the dump and the railway tracks i was about fifty feet from the fence and just beginning to think that everything was going to be all right when i heard milo shout hey you get away from that fence get out of here i started running for the fence with a wild shout vern teddy and chris appeared on the other side of the fence and stared through it you come back here milo screamed come back here or ill send my dog after you that only made me run even faster for the fence teddy started to laugh his crazy laugh eeeeeeeee go gordie go vern shouted and milo screamed get him chopper go and get him i threw the bag over the fence and vern caught it behind me i could hear chopper coming shaking the earth breathing fire and ice from his nose i threw myself halfway up the fence with one jump screaming i reached the top in about three seconds and simply leapt off without looking down to see what i might land on what i almost landed on was teddy who was bent over with laughter his glasses had fallen off and tears were streaming from his eyes i turned round and got my first look at the famous chopper instead of some enormous creature from hell with red eyes and cruel teeth i was looking at an ordinary black and white middle sized dog he was jumping up at the fence and trying to reach us teddy was walking up and down outside the fence making chopper even more angry kiss my ass chopper teddy invited and turned round to hit the fence with his ass chopper went crazy and leapt at the fence to accept teddys invitation but teddy moved away and all chopper got was a hurt nose chris and vern were lying on the bank laughing so hard they could scarcely move and here came milo pressman you boys stop being horrible to my dog stop it this second bite it chopper bite it come and get me teddy continued from the other side of the fence chopper went mad he ran around in a big circle three times perhaps giving himself courage and then threw himself with full force at the fence he was doing maybe thirty miles an hour when he hit the fence the fence seemed to stretch and then chopper fell back to the ground in a cloud of dust he lay there for a moment before walking away with his tongue hanging out of one side of his mouth milo was now really angry his face turned dark red i know you he shouted youre teddy duchamp i know all of you ill beat your ass for being cruel to my dog id like to see you try teddy shouted back lets see you climb over this fence and get me fatass what what did you call me fatass teddy screamed happily you and your stupid dog you little madmans son ill talk to your mother what did you call me it was teddys turn now he had stopped jumping up and down and was looking at milo strangely milo realized that he had found the right button and he pushed hard down on it your dad is crazy he said grinning mad and up in togus thats what crazier than a rat in a pile of garbage crazy its not surprising youre behaving the way you are with a madman for a father teddy and milo were nose to nose at the fence now vern and chris had almost stopped laughing and begun to see the seriousness of the situation dont you say anything else about my dad my dad was on the beaches at normandy you fat pussy yes but where is he now you ugly little foureyed lump of puke up in togus isnt he ok thats enough said teddy now im going to kill you he started to climb the fence come on and try you dirty little rat milo stepped back and stood there waiting and grinning no i shouted i got to my feet grabbed teddy by his jeans and pulled him off the fence let me go teddy shouted let me get him no thats just what he wants i shouted in his ear he wants to get you over there and beat you and take you to the police what teddy turned his head round to look at me you think youre so clever milo said approaching the fence again with his hands curled why dont you let him fight his own battles sure i said a grown man against a boy i know you milo said your names lachance and those guys are chris chambers and one of those stupid tessio boys im going to talk to your fathers he stood and waited for us to cry and say we were sorry or something chris made an o with his thumb and finger and pushed his tongue through it vern looked up at the sky teddy said come on gordie lets go before this guy makes me puke ill get you you dirtymouthed little rat wait till i get you to the police we heard what you said about his father i told him were all witnesses and you sent your dog after me thats against the law milo looked uncertain before he could see how weak my argument was i said come on you guys lets go something smells bad around here i cant wait to tell the police how you called a war hero a madman chris called back over his shoulder as we left what did you do in the war mr pressman thats none of your business milo shouted back you hurt my dog come back here but his voice was lower now and he seemed to be losing interest i looked back when we reached the top of the bank milo was standing there behind the fence a big man with a dog sitting beside him his fingers were holding the fence and i suddenly felt sorry for him he looked exactly like a schoolboy locked in the school playground by mistake calling for someone to let him out chapter eleven nightsweats we showed old milo that were no pussies vern said right agreed teddy you bet we did although i enjoyed the victory too i was worried perhaps milo would go to the police perhaps those four tails on the coins were a sign of bad luck what were we doing anyway going to look at the broken body of some poor guy that a train had hit but we were doing it and none of us wanted to stop we had almost reached the bridge which carried the tracks across the river when teddy suddenly burst into tears he fell to the ground shaking with the violence of the storm that had come on him none of us knew what to do this wasnt the kind of crying we were used to when you fell off your bike or something hey man vern said in a very thin voice chris and i looked at vern hopefully hey man was always a good start but vern couldnt go on at last when the force of his crying had lessened a bit it was chris who went to him chris was the hardest guy in our gang but he was also the guy who made the best peace he was good at it ive seen him sit down on the pavement next to a small boy he didnt even know who had hurt his knee and get him talking about something until the boy forgot his pain listen teddy does it matter what a fat old bag of puke like him said about your father it doesnt change anything does it does it teddy shook his head no it didnt change anything but this was something he had thought about on those long lonely nights when he couldnt sleep and hearing it spoken aloud in the daytime realizing in the clear light of day that everyone else in the world considers your father a madman that had shaken him he still fought on the beaches at normandy didnt he chris went on he took one of teddys hands teddy nodded fiercely do you think that pile of garbage was at normandy teddy shook his head violently no do you think that guy knows your father no talk is cheap teddy nodded but still didnt look up and whatever there is between you and your father talk cant change that he was just trying to get you to climb back over the fence man he doesnt know anything about your father hes only heard stuff from people he drinks with thats all teddy had nearly stopped crying now he wiped his eyes and sat up im ok he said and the sound of his own voice seemed to persuade him he was right yes im ok he stood up and put his glasses back on he laughed thinly and wiped his bare arm across his nose im a crybaby right no man vern said uncomfortably if anyone said those kinds of things about my father then you have to kill them teddy said right chris right said chris and slapped teddy on the back right gordie yeah right i said wondering how teddy could care so much for his dad who had almost killed him and how i didnt either love or hate my father who had never even beaten me as far as i could remember we walked on down the tracks for another two hundred yards and then teddy said in a quieter voice if i spoiled your good time im sorry im not sure i want it to be a good time vern said suddenly chris looked at him are you saying you want to go back no verns face showed that he was trying to work out how to say what he was thinking but were going to see a dead guy that shouldnt be like going to a party i mean i could even get a little frightened if you know what i mean nobody said anything and vern went on i mean sometimes im in bed at night and maybe ive been reading a frightening magazine or something and i start wondering whether theres anything under my bed you know something with a green face and blood on its hands which might reach up and grab me we all began to nod we all knew about the nightsweats i certainly didnt imagine then that in about a dozen years id turn a simple example of the nightsweats into about a million dollars so you see if this body were going to see is really bad maybe ill start dreaming and imagining him under my bed but i feel as if we still have to see him but maybe it shouldnt be a good time right chris said softly maybe it shouldnt you wont tell anyone else what i said will you vern said the other guys wouldnt understand we all said we wouldnt we walked on in thoughtful silence it wasnt yet three oclock but it seemed much later we hadnt even reached harlow yet we were going to have to move faster around half past three we arrived at the castle river and the bridge which crossed it chapter twelve the bridge the bridge was made of wood and had spaces all the way across through which you could look straight down into the river there was a narrow walkway on either side of the tracks wide enough so that you wouldnt actually get hit by any train but so narrow that the wind of a passing train would blow you off the bridge and it was a long way down to the river and the river was shallow and fast in fact this bridge wasnt for walking across looking at the bridge we all felt fear start to move in our stomachs but mixing with the fear was the excitement of a really big dare something you could be proud to tell your friends about after you got home if you got home teddys eyes were shining this was better than lorries man chris said softly come on teddy said lets go he was already at the start of the bridge where the wooden supports were built out over the land does anybody know when the next trains due vern asked uneasily nobody knew i said theres the route bridge no man teddy cried that means walking five miles down the river on this side and then five miles back on the other side itll take hours we can cross the bridge and get to the same place in ten minutes but if a train comes theres nowhere to go vern said he wasnt looking at teddy he was looking down at the river of course there is teddy said he climbed over the edge of the bridge and held on to one of the wooden supports between the tracks he was still hanging over the land but the thought of doing that in the middle of the bridge with the river fifty feet below and a train thundering by overhead made me feel sick see how easy it is teddy said he dropped to the ground wiped his hands and climbed back up beside us what if its a car train chris asked are you going to hang there for five or ten minutes are you afraid teddy asked you can go the long way round if you want to but im going across the bridge ill wait for you on the other side there are probably only one or two trains a day here i said and one has passed us already look at all the grass growing in the middle of the tracks see teddy was delighted at his victory theres still a chance of a train i added yes chris said he was looking only at me his eyes shining i dare you lachance darers go first all right chris said he looked at the others as well any pussies here no teddy shouted vern cleared his throat and said no in a small voice he smiled a weak sickly smile ok chris said but we hesitated for a moment and looked up and down the tracks i knelt down and touched the steel nothing ok i said we went out on to the bridge one by one chris first then teddy then vern and me last because i was the one who said that darers go first you had to walk looking down to make sure you put your feet down on wood rather than thin air when i saw river instead of rocks below me i stopped to look up chris and teddy were a long way in front almost halfway across the bridge vern was between them and me i had to go on if i turned back id be a pussy for life when i was nearly halfway across i stopped again and looked up i had almost caught up with vern who was being very cautious chris and teddy had nearly reached the other side and although ive written seven books about people who can do strange things like read other peoples minds and see into the future that was when i had my first and last experience of it myself i bent down and touched the track it was shaking hard although it hadnt made a sound i have never been as frightened as i was at that moment holding that live track my whole body just stopped working my legs felt like water my mouth opened i didnt open it it opened by itself i couldnt move but i could hear and see and sense everything inside me and for miles around me i thought of ray brower and i thought that vern and i would soon be joining him that thought unlocked my body i jumped to my feet at least i suppose i jumped to me it felt as if i was moving slowly up through five hundred feet of water i screamed train and began to run vern looked back over his shoulder he saw my attempt at running and knew straight away that i wasnt joking he began to run himself far in front i could see chris stepping off the bridge and on to solid ground he was safe i was glad for him but i was also jealous as hell i watched him drop to his knees and touch a track my left foot almost slipped but i recovered and ran on now i was just behind vern we were more than halfway across and for the first time i heard the train it was coming from behind us from the castle rock side of the river ooooooh jesus vern screamed run you pussy i shouted and hit him on his back with my hand i cant ill fall run faster gordie i cant you can run faster pukeface i shouted at the top of my voice and was i enjoying this the train was very loud now i kept expecting the bridge to start shaking under my feet when that happened the train would be right behind us go faster vern faaaster oh god gordie oh gordie god ooooooh heeeell the noise of the train filled the air now there was no other sound in the world it tore the air and it was the sound of death i could see chris below us and to the right and teddy behind him they were both mouthing a single word and the word was jump but the train had taken all the blood out of the word leaving only its shape in their mouths the bridge began to shake as the train charged across it we jumped vern landed in the dust and the stones and i landed beside him almost on top of him i never saw the train and i dont know if the engineer saw us i clapped my hands over my ears and dug my face into the hot dirt as the train went by metal screaming against metal the air blowing over us i had no wish to look at it before it had passed completely i felt a warm hand on my neck and i knew it was chriss when it was gone when i was sure it was gone i lifted my head vern was still lying face down in the dirt chris was sitting between us one hand on verns sweaty neck the other still on mine when vern finally sat up shaking all over and wetting his lips chris said maybe we should have those cokes what do you guys think could anybody use one besides me we all thought we could use one chapter thirteen the losers life about a quarter of a mile further on the tracks ran into the forest and the land ran down to a bog the air was full of biting insects which were about the size of aeroplanes but it was cool wonderfully cool we sat in the shadows of the trees to drink our cokes we hadnt been there five minutes when vern had to go off into the bushes which caused a lot of joking when he came back train frighten you much vern no man i was going to go when we got across anyway i had to you know are you sure vern come on you guys i did sincerely chris turned to me what about you gordie were you frightened no way i said and had a drink of my coke sincerely sincerely man i wasnt frightened at all no you werent frightened teddy was looking at me carefully no i was a long way past fright i was into terror they laughed for a long time at that then we lay back not joking any morejust drinking our cokes and being quiet my body felt warm and peaceful i was alive and glad to be i felt affectionate towards everyone and everything around me it was a very special feeling after a while chris stood up lets do some walking he said it was still bright daylight and the sky was a hot steely blue but our shadows were beginning to grow longer i remember that when i was young september days always seemed to end much too soon and catch me by surprise it was as if something inside my heart expected it always to be june with daylight hanging softly in the sky until almost half past nine what time is it gordie chris asked i looked at my watch and said after five yeah lets go teddy said but lets make camp before dark so that we can see to get wood and stuff im getting hungry too well stop at half past six chris promised ok with you guys it was we started to walk again along the stones beside the tracks soon the river was so far behind us that we couldnt even hear its sound we were slapping insects off our backs and necks vern and teddy were up in front deep in conversation about tv shows chris was next to me hands in his pockets shirt slapping against his knees ive got some winstons he said one each for after supper yeah thats great thats when a cigarette tastes best chris said after supper right we walked in silence for a while and then he asked are you ready for school i guess so but who ever was ready you got a little excited about going back and seeing your friends you were curious about your new teachers and what they would be like in a strange way you could even get excited about the long boring lessons because by the time the summer holidays were nearly over you sometimes got bored enough to believe you could learn something at school but summer boredom was nothing like the school boredom that always started by the end of the second week and by the beginning of the third week you were busy with the really important stuff could you hit stinky fiske in the back of the head with a paper bullet while the teacher was writing the capital cities of south america on the blackboard could you get a good loud noise off the surface of your desk if your hands were really sweaty how many girls would let you feel their asses during lunchhour this is higher education man you know what gordie chris went on by next june itll be all over between us what are you talking about why would that happen because me and teddy and vern will be doing different courses from you youll be on the college courses well be on the shop courses making bird houses and pots and stuff like that youll meet a lot of new guys clever guys like you thats just the way it goes gordie ill meet a lot of pussies you mean i said he held my arm no man dont say that dont even think that you know how you tell us stories sometimes youve got a million stories inside you and you can just sit there and tell one to us vern and teddy may not always understand your stories but those guys on the college courses will understand them it doesnt matter about the stories im not taking courses with a lot of pussies if you dont youre a fool why is it foolish to want to be with your friends he looked at me thoughtfully as if deciding whether to tell me something we had slowed down vern and teddy were almost half a mile in front the sun which was lower now came at us through the trees overhead in broken columns of light and turned everything gold its foolish if your friends can drag you down chris said finally i know about you and your parents they dont care about you your big brother was the one they cared about its like my dad it was when dave went to prison that he started hitting us and all your dad doesnt hit you but maybe thats even worse hes put you to sleep if you told him you were joining the shop course do you know what hed do hed turn to the next page in his newspaper and say thats nice gordon would you ask your mother whats for dinner and dont try to tell me im wrong ive met him i didnt try to tell him he was wrong its a bit frightening to find out that someone else even a friend knows just how things are with you youre still young gordie thanks dad i wish i was your dad he said angrily if i was you wouldnt talk about taking stupid shop courses its as if god gave you somethingall those stories and said here you are try not to lose it but children lose everything unless somebody is there to help them and if your parents are too stupid to do it maybe i ought to he looked like he was expecting me to try to hit him his face was unhappy in the late afternoon light he had broken the unwritten rule you could say what you liked to a guy about himself but never say a bad word about his parents if you stay with us just because you dont want to lose the gang chris went on youll turn into just another guy with no good use for his brains except to make clever cruel remarks about other people youll never escape castle rock youll think its important to have the right kind of car and then the right girl and then youll get married and work in the factory or some shoe shop for ever is that what you want chris chambers was twelve when he said all that to me but something in his face as he spoke was older ageless it was as if he had lived that whole life already and his words made me frightened he understood the losers life so well he seemed to know what i was thinking i know what people think of my family in this town nobody even asked me if i took the milkmoney that time did you take it i asked i had never asked him before and if you had told me i ever would id have called you crazy the words came out like a dry bullet yeah he said tiredly yeah i took it he was silent for a moment you knew i took it teddy knew everybody knew even vern knew i think i started to deny it and then closed my mouth he was right i had argued with my parents that a person was innocent until proved guilty but deep inside i had known the truth then maybe i was sorry and tried to give it back chris said i stared at him you tried to give it back maybe i said just maybe and maybe i took it to old mrs simons and told her and gave her all the money and maybe i wasnt allowed back at school for two weeks anyway because the money still never appeared and maybe the next week mrs simons had this new skirt on when she came to school i stared at chris speechless with horror he smiled at me but it was a tight terrible smile which never touched his eyes just maybe he said but i remembered the new skirt chris how much was that money almost seven dollars christ i whispered but if i stole the money and then mrs simons stole it from me and if i told anyone what do you think would happen who would believe me me chris chambers younger brother of dave chambers and eyeball chambers no one would believe it i whispered jesus chris i never thought that a teacher oh hell who cares anyway why am i even talking about it he wiped an arm angrily across his eyes and i realized he was almost crying chris i said why dont you go into the college courses youre clever enough the teachers decide all that in the school office all they care about is whether youve behaved yourself in school and what the town thinks of your family they dont want you to infect their top collegecourse pupils the ones from the big houses on the hill i dont know if i could do it but i might try because i want to get out of castle rock and go to college and never see my father or my brothers again i want to go somewhere where nobody knows me and people dont have bad ideas about me before ive even done anything but i dont know if i can do it why not people people drag you down who i asked thinking he must mean the teachers or his brother eyeball or maybe his parents but he said your friends drag you down gordie dont you know that he pointed at vern and teddy who were standing and waiting for us to catch up they were laughing about something your friends do theyre like drowning guys who are holding on to your legs you cant save them you can only drown with them come on guys vern shouted dont be so slow yes coming chris called and before i could say anything else he began to run but he caught up to them before i could catch up to him chapter fourteen darkness in the forest we went another mile and then decided to camp for the night there was still some daylight left but nobody really wanted to use it we were exhausted from what had happened at the dump and on the bridge but it was more than that we were in harlow now in the forest somewhere was a dead child who probably had a broken body and was covered with flies nobody wanted to get too close to him with night approaching by stopping here we thought there had to be at least ten miles between us and him and of course all four of us knew there were no such things as ghosts but ten miles seemed about far enough if we were wrong vern chris and teddy gathered wood and started a campfire chris laid it on stones and made a clear space around it because the forest was very dry and he didnt want to take any risks while they were doing that i sharpened some green sticks and pushed lumps of hamburger meat on to them when the flames were low and the fire was good and hot we cooked the meat but we were too hungry to wait we pulled the lumps off their sticks early they were black on the outside red on the inside and completely delicious afterwards chris opened his backpack he took out a packet of cigarettes and gave us one each we lay back on the ground or against trees and smoked our cigarettes as if we were grown men we were feeling good theres nothing like a smoke after a meal teddy said absolutely vern agreed we laid our blankets out on the ground and lay down on them then for about an hour we fed the fire and talked the kind of talk you can never quite remember when you get past fifteen and discover girls we talked about fishing and sport and about the summer that was now ending teddy told about the time he had been at whites beach in brunswick and some guy had hit his head while diving and had almost drowned we had a long discussion about our teachers at school we didnt talk about ray brower but i was thinking about him theres something horrible about the way darkness comes to the forest there are no car lights to make it softer or less sudden there are no mothers voices calling for their children to come in now if youre used to the town the coming of the dark in the forest seems unnatural and as i thought about the body of ray brower i didnt feel frightened and wonder whether he would suddenly appear as a ghost unexpectedly i felt pity for him lying so alone in the dark if something wanted to eat him it would his mother wasnt here to stop it and neither was his father nor any of his friends nor jesus christ he was dead and he was all alone and i realized that if i didnt stop thinking about it i was going to cry so i told the others a le dio story le dio is a soldier i invented who had a lot of adventures in the second world war it wasnt a very good one and when it ended as the le dio stories usually did with a single american soldier coughing out a dying promise of his love for america and for a girl back home it was not his face i saw in my minds eye but the face of a much younger boy already dead his eyes closed blood running from the left corner of his mouth and behind him instead of warscarred france i saw only dark forest and the railway tracks dark at the top of a bank against the starry sky chapter fifteen a dream of deep water i woke up in the middle of the night i didnt know where i was and i wondered why it was so cold in my bedroom and who had left the windows open then i realized that this wasnt my room this was somewhere else and someone had his arms wrapped around me while someone else was kneeling beside me head turned as if listening to something whats happening i asked in puzzlement the thing holding me made a noise it sounded like vern that made me wake up properly and remember where i was but what was everybody doing awake in the middle of the night i had been asleep for some hours dont let it get me vern said i promise ill be good i sat up frightened chris shut up vern chris said he was the one next to me listening its nothing oh yes it is teddy said heavily its something what is i asked as if to answer my question a long and hollow team rose from the forest it was the sort of scream you might expect from a woman who was dying in extreme pain and extreme fear oh jesus vern whispered his voice high and filled with tears he tightened his hold on me making it hard for me to breathe and adding to my own terror i threw him loose but he came straight back like a young dog which cant think of anywhere else to go its brower teddy whispered his ghost is out walking in the forest oh god vern shouted i promise i wont take any more sexy magazines from the shops i promise to eat my vegetables i wont swear i wont shut up vern chris said but verns voice only dropped back to a whisper chris sounded strong but underneath i could hear iff i wondered if the hair was standing up on his neck as it was on mine its a bird isnt it i asked chris no at least i dont think it is i think its a wild cat my dad says they scream like hell at certain times of the year it sounds like a woman doesnt it yes i said but no woman could scream that loud chris said and then added helplessly could she gordie its his ghost teddy whispered again im going to go and look for it i dont think he was serious but we took no chances when he started to get up chris and i pulled him back down let me go you asses teddy shouted if i say i want to go and look for it then im going to go and look for it i want to see it i want to see the ghost i the wild cry rose into the night again cutting the air like a knife and freezing us with our hands on teddy the scream climbed impossibly high hung there for a moment and then slid down to the lowest imaginable sound this was followed by a burst of what sounded like mad laughter and then there was silence again jesus christ teddy whispered and he talked no more of going into the forest to see what was making that screaming noise all four of us stayed close together and i thought of running i doubt i was the only one if we had been camping in verns field where our parents thought we were we probably would have run but castle rock was too far and the thought of trying to run across that bridge in the dark made my blood freeze running deeper into harlow and closer to the body of ray brower was equally unthinkable we had nowhere to go if there was a ghost out there and if it wanted us it would probably get us chris suggested that we keep guard and everyone was agreeable to that we spun coins to see who would go first it was vern and i was last vern sat by the campfire while the rest of us lay down again close to one another like sheep i was sure that sleep would be impossible but i did sleep a light uneasy sleep that was as near to being awake as it was to being asleep my halfsleeping dreams were filled with wild cries which were possibly real or possibly imagined i saw or thought i saw something white and shapeless float through the trees at last i slipped into something i knew was a dream chris and i were swimming at whites beach a lake in brunswick it was where teddy had seen the boy hit his head and almost drown in my dream we were out in deep water swimming lazily along with a hot july sun up in the sky from behind us came cries and shouts of laughter on the sandy beach people lay face down on blankets and little children played with plastic buckets at the edge of the water or sat happily pouring sand into their hair teenagers formed grinning groups and the boys watched the girls walk endlessly up and down in twos and threes never alone the secret places of their bodies wrapped in swimsuits mrs cote our english teacher from school floated past us on a rubber boat she was lying on her back dressed in her usual septembertojune uniform of a grey suit be careful boys she said if youre not good ill hit you so hard that youll go blind now mr chambers well hear the poem mending wall please i tried to give the money back chris said mrs simons said ok but she took it do you hear me she took it now what are you going to do about it are you going to hit her until shes blind mending wall mr chambers if you please chris threw me a desperate look as if to say didnt i tell you it would be like this and then began something there is that doesnt love a wall that sends the and then his head went under his mouth filling with water in the middle of repeating the poem he broke through the surface crying help me gordie help me then he was dragged under again looking into the clear water i could see two bare swollen bodies holding his ankles one was vern and the other was teddy and their open eyes were empty and white chriss head broke out of the water again he reached one hand towards me and out of his mouth came a screaming womanish cry that rose and rose in the hot sunny summer air i looked wildly towards the beach but nobody had heard chriss scream was cut off as the bodies pulled him under the water again as they dragged him down to black water i could see his eyes turned up to me and his hands reaching out helplessly but instead of diving down and trying to save him i swam madly for the shore or at least to a place where the water would not be over my head before i could get there before i could even get close i felt a soft rotten hand wrap itself firmly around my leg and begin to pull a scream started to rise in my chest but before it came out the dream passed into reality there was teddy with his hand on my leg he was shaking me awake it was my turn to keep guard chapter sixteen the deer the others slept heavily through the rest of the night i was sometimes awake and sometimes half asleep the night was far from silent with the cries of birds and mice and insects but there were no more screams finally i came awake and realized that something was different it took a moment or two to know what it was although the moon was down i could see my hands resting on my jeans my watch said quarter to five it was dawn i stood and walked a few yards into the forest i stretched and began to feel the fear of the night before slide away it was a good feeling i climbed up the bank to the railway tracks and sat on one of the tracks spinning and catching stones i was in no hurry to wake the others the new day felt too good to share i dont know how long i sat there watching dawn turn to full morning watching the sky change from purple to blue i was about to get up when i looked to my right and saw a deer standing between the tracks not ten yards from me my heart flew up into my throat i didnt move i couldnt move her eyes werent brown but a dark dusty black she looked calmly at me her head held a little low in what looked like curiosity seeing a boy with his hair standing up from sleep in jeans and brown shirt sitting there on the tracks what i was seeing was a gift given with a kind of terrible carelessness we looked at each other for a long time i think it was a long time then she turned and walked off to the other side of the tracks she found grass and began to eat i couldnt believe it she hadnt gone away she had begun to eat she didnt look back at me and didnt need to i was frozen solid then the tracks started to shake under my body and seconds later the deers head came up and turned back towards castle rock she stood there for a moment and then she was gone in three leaps disappearing into the forest with no sound except one dry branch that cracked like a gun i sat and looked at the place where she had been until the actual sound of the train came through the stillness then i slid back down the bank to where the others were sleeping the train woke them up they yawned and scratched there was some nervous talk about the screaming ghost as chris called it but not as much as you might imagine in daylight it seemed more foolish than interesting almost embarrassing best forgotten i nearly told them about the deer but in the end i didnt that was one thing i kept to myself ive never spoken or written about it until just now today and i have to tell you that it seems less important when it is written down but for me it was the best part of that trip the cleanest part and it was a moment i found myself returning to almost helplessly when there was trouble in my life my first day in the forest in vietnam when this guy walked up with his hand over his nose and he took his hand away and there was no nose there because a bullet had taken if off the time the doctor told us that our son might have a brain infection the long crazy weeks before my mother died i would find my thoughts turning back to that morning but the most important things are the hardest to say its hard to make strangers care about the good things in life chapter seventeen leeches the tracks now bent southwest and ran through thick forest we ate a breakfast of wild fruit vern wished aloud for a couple of filed eggs with bacon on the side this was the last day of the heat and i think it was the worst of all by nine oclock the sky was a pale steel colour that made you feel hotter just from looking at it the sweat ran from our chests and backs and washed away some of the dirt insects were a constant annoyance we knew we still had eight or ten miles to walk but the thing pulled us towards itself and kept us walking fast even in that heat we were all crazy to see that boys body i cant say it any more simply or honestly than that we didnt know whether it was going to be harmless or horrible but we wanted to see it it was about half past nine when teddy and chris saw water they shouted to vern and me and we ran over to where they were standing there was a deep pool which was fed by a little stream which continued under the tracks do you think its deep enough to swim in vern asked looking hungrily at the water theres only one way to find out teddy said who goes first i asked me chris said he went running down the bank kicking off his shoes and untying his shirt from around his waist as he went he pushed his trousers down with his thumbs pulled off his socks and made a shallow dive he came up shaking his head to get his wet hair out of his eyes its great he shouted how deep is it teddy called back he had never learned to swim chris stood up in the water and his shoulders broke the surface i saw something grey on one of them i decided it was a piece of mud and didnt think any more about it if i had looked more closely i could have saved myself a lot of bad dreams later on come on in you pussies chris called we all got undressed vern was in next then me the water was clean and cool i swam across to chris loving the feel of having nothing on except water i stood up and we grinned in each others faces great we both said it at exactly the same moment we played around in the water for almost half an hour before we realized that the pool was full of leeches we were diving swimming between each others legs pushing one another beneath the surface of the water then vern swam into the shallower part went under and stood on his hands when his legs were up in the air i saw that they were covered in blackishgrey lumps just like the one i had seen on chriss shoulder they were big leeches chriss mouth dropped open and i felt all the blood in my body freeze teddy screamed and his face went pale then all three of us made our way as fast as we could for the side i know more about leeches now than i did then but although i know they are mostly harmless i feel the same horror about them now as i have felt ever since that day in the pool you dont feel them come on to your body if you dont happen to see them theyll go on feeding until their swollen bodies fall off you or they actually burst we pulled ourselves up on to the bank and teddy started screaming as he looked down at himself he started to pull the leeches off his bare body still screaming vern broke the water and looked at us in puzzlement what the hells wrong with him leeches teddy screamed pulling two off his legs and throwing them as far as he could ohgodohgodohgodohgod vern cried he swam over to the edge of the pool and pulled himself out i was still feeling cold the heat of the day was interrupted i kept telling myself not to scream not to be a pussy i picked half a dozen off my arms and several more off my chest chris turned his back to me gordie are there any more take them off if there are gordie please there were more five or six of them running down his back like horrible black buttons i pulled their soft boneless bodies off him i was starting to feel a little better i brushed my hair away from my ears and thats when i felt the big one it had gone down inside my ear it seemed so that only its back was still outside and thats the part i had touched i tried to get hold of it but i couldnt see it i held on to it tightly and pulled it burst in my fingers as i pulled it off and blood my blood ran down the side of my face and into my ear in a warm stream i couldnt stop the tears coming then i washed my ear and got dressed vern ran up to me still bare are they off me gordie have they all gone he spun in front of me like a crazy dancer i nodded that they were and kept on crying for a while finally the tears began to slow down when we were all dressed we just stood there looking at one another for a moment and then we began to climb the bank up to the tracks i looked back at the burst leeches lying on top of the flattened grass where we had danced and screamed them off our bodies chapter eighteen short shadows dusty shoes we walked on and were beginning to think that we were getting close but we werent as close as we thought we knew we wanted to reach the place where the back harlow road met the tracks we knew that the back harlow road ran by the royal river and we knew the royal river was only ten miles from castle river but those ten miles were measured in a straight line and the railway tracks made a long slight curve around some hills called the bluffs if we had looked at a map wed have seen that curve easily and wed have realized that it was more like sixteen miles between the two rivers walking along the tracks and there was nowhere else to walk chris began to suspect the truth when midday had come and gone and the royal still hadnt appeared we stopped while he climbed a tall tree and looked round he came down and told us it was going to be at least four in the afternoon before we reached the royal if we moved fast jesus teddy swore what are we going to do now we looked into each others sweaty faces we were hungry and tired the big adventure had turned into hard work we were dirty and sometimes frightened by now our parents would be wondering where we were and the police might even be looking for us if milo pressman or the engineer on the train crossing the bridge had told them anything we had been planning to hitchhike back to castle rock but four oclock was just three hours from dark and nobody picks up four boys in a back country road after dark finally chris said its still closer if we carry on lets go he turned and started to walk along the tracks in his dusty shoes head down his shadow short at his feet a few seconds later the rest of us followed one after another chapter nineteen a serious matter i have sometimes wondered why we decided to walk from castle rock to harlow on the railway tracks i imagine a conversation between the four of us we could easily hitchhike up route i say until it joins the back harlow road with a little luck well find ray brower only a few hours after we leave thats too easy man says teddy and vern adds dont be such a pussy gordie it will really be something to walk along the tracks chris only smiles so we didnt take the shorter way the easier way they say the effect of events can grow larger and larger as the years pass so who knows if we hadnt walked along the tracks maybe chris and teddy and vern would still be alive today no they didnt die in the forest or on the railway tracks no one dies in this story except some leeches and ray brower and he was dead before the story started actually but it is true that of the four of us who spun coins to see who would go down to the florida market to get food only the one who went is still alive at the ripe old age of thirty four maybe we knew or half knew that going to see a dead body was a big thing as big as sleeping with a girl for the first time and the big things in life should never be easy they should be marked in some way as important you dont hitchhike to a thing like that perhaps so if walking along the tracks turned out to be harder than we had expected maybe we thought that was right events had turned our trip into what we had always suspected it was a serious matter what we didnt know as we walked around the bluffs was that billy tessio charlie hogan jack mudgett norman fuzzy brackowicz vince desjardins chriss older brother eyeball and ace merrill himself were all on their way to take a look at the body themselves they were climbing into aces black ford and vinces pink studebaker even as we started on the last part of our trip billy and charlie had managed to keep their enormous secret for just about twentyfour hours then charlie told ace while they were drinking at the bar and billy told jack mudgett while they were fishing from the boom road bridge both ace and jack had sworn to keep the secret and that was how everyone in their gang knew about it by midday fuzzy suggested that they could all become heroes by finding the body they could tell the police they had gone to the royal river to fish and had found the body instead they were driving fast up the road from castle rock to the back harlow area just as we finally started to get close chapter twenty the body clouds began to gather in the sky around two oclock but at first none of us thought it would rain after all it hadnt rained since the early days of july but they kept building up to the south of us in great purple columns and they began to move slowly in our direction finally we had to accept that it was going to rain in the hour between two and three the quality of the days light began to change it was just as hot as before but we knew the birds knew as well they seemed to appear from nowhere and fill the sky with their cries the light grew less definite and our shadows became less clear the sun had begun to sail in and out of the thickening clouds and the southern sky turned brown we watched the enormous thunderclouds come closer and threaten the land sometimes lightning flashed within the clouds and changed their purplish colour to a light grey then we saw lightning flash down from the nearest cloud it was followed by a long shaking burst of thunder we complained a bit about how wet we were going to get but of course we were looking forward to it it would be cool and there would be no leeches in this water around half past three we saw running water through a break in the trees thats it chris shouted happily thats the royal we began to walk faster the storm was getting close now the air began to move and the temperature dropped suddenly i looked down and saw that my shadow had completely disappeared we were walking in pairs again two on either side of the tracks so that we could look down both sides of the railway bank my mouth was dry with nervousness the sun finally sailed behind the clouds and didnt reappear the light became dull we could smell the river clearly or perhaps it was the smell of the rain in the air a sudden impossible flash of lightning lit the area making me cry out and cover my eyes i heard the tearing fall of some big tree about sixty yards away the crack of thunder which followed made me stop for a second in fear i wanted to be at home reading a good book in a safe place jesus vern screamed in a high voice look at that i looked up in the direction vern was pointing and saw a bluewhite fireball rolling fast up the left track sounding exactly like an angry cat it hurried past us as we turned in amazement to watch it go twenty feet beyond us it suddenly burst and disappeared what am i doing here teddy said man chris said happily it is going to rain like its never rained before but i agreed with teddy the sky was alarming lightning flashed down again and this time there was no pause before the following thunder my ears were still ringing from the thunder when vern began to shout there there he is i see him i can see vern still if i want to all i have to do is sit back for a minute and close my eyes hes standing there on the left of the tracks one hand protecting his eyes from the lightning that has just come down the other stretched out and pointing we ran up beside him and looked i was thinking to myself verns just imagining it thats all but he wasnt although for a second i wished he was in that moment i knew i never wanted to see a dead body not even of a tiny animal at the bottom of the bank was a boggy smelly mess of bushes and appearing out of the bushes was a single pale white hand did any of us breathe i didnt the wind was blowing quite strongly at times now and was coming at us from no particular direction i hardly noticed why couldnt we have seen the whole body instead of just that one hand horribly white the fingers resting upside down on the ground that hand told us the truth of the whole matter it made us know that death was real the memory of that hand comes back to me every time i hear or read of some tragic disaster somewhere joined to that hand was the rest of ray brower lightning flashed thunder cracked after each flash of lightning jesus chris whispered verns tongue was running over his lips as if he had just tasted something new and different something which excited him and disgusted him at the same time teddy only stood and looked the wind blew his dirty hair first away from his ears and then back over them his face was totally blank there were black insects walking on the hand a great whispering noise began to rise in the forest on both sides of the tracks as if the forest had just noticed we were there and was commenting on it the rain had started enormous drops of rain fell for five seconds and then stopped there was a pause and then the storm really started immediately we were all completely wet the whispering sound changed now it sounded like millions of hammers it was as if the forest was blaming us for our discovery chris jumped over the side of the bank and i followed vern and teddy were close behind us but chris and i were the first to reach the body of ray brower he was face down chris looked into my eyes i nodded slightly as if he had spoken aloud i think he was down here and fairly undamaged instead of up there between the tracks and completely knocked out of shape because he was trying to get out of the way when the train hit him he had landed with his head towards the tracks arms over his head like someone about to dive he had landed in boggy ground which was rapidly filling with water his hair was dark red there was blood in it but not a lot not enough to make you feel sick the insects were worse he was wearing a dark green tshirt and blue jeans his feet were bare and a few feet behind him caught in a bush i saw a pair of dirty shoes for a moment i was puzzled why was he here and his shoes there then i realized and the realization was like a heavy blow to the stomach my wife my children my friends they all think that having an imagination like mine must be quite nice not only do i make a lot of money from it but i can also see films in my mind when i want to but sometimes my imagination turns out to have long sharp cruel teeth you see things you would prefer not to see things that keep you awake all night i saw one of those things then i saw it clearly and with absolute certainty he was knocked clean out of his shoes the train had knocked him out of his shoes just as it had knocked the life out of his body that was what finally made me realize that the guy was dead he wasnt ill he wasnt sleeping he wasnt going to get up in the morning any more or eat too many apples or worry about school exams he was dead completely dead he wasnt going to go out with his friends in the spring to collect bottles uncovered by the departing snow he wasnt going to get into fights in the playground he wasnt going to pull a single girls hair he was everything like wasnt cant dont shouldnt wouldnt couldnt he was one big not he was dead i could go on all day and not explain the distance between his bare feet on the ground and his dirty shoes hanging on the bush it was about three feet it was millions and millions of miles he was disconnected from his shoes and there was no hope of reconnection he was dead we turned him face up into the pouring rain the lightning the steady crack of thunder there were insects all over his face and neck they ran in and out of the round collar of his tshirt his eyes were open but horribly wrong one was rolled back so far that we could see only white the other stared straight up into the storm there was some dried blood around his mouth and on his chin and a wound on the right side of his face still i thought he didnt look too bad i had once walked into a door my brother dennis was pushing open and i had looked worse than this an insect came out of his mouth walked across his cheek stepped on to the leaf of a plant and was gone did you see that teddy asked in a high strange voice i bet hes full of insects i bet his brains are shut up teddy chris said lightning lit up his one good eye you could almost believe he was glad to see us boys his own age his body was swollen and there was the slight smell of some gas i turned away i was sure i was going to be sick but my stomach was dry and steady i pushed two fingers down my throat trying to make myself puke wanting to needing to but nothing happened the noise of the rain and the thunder had completely covered the sound of cars approaching along the back harlow road which lay a few yards beyond this boggy area it also covered the sound of them pushing through the trees and the bushes the first we knew of them was ace merrills voice calling above the noise of the storm saying what have we got here chapter twenty one ace merrill we all jumped in surprise and vern cried out he admitted later that he thought just for a second that the voice had come from the dead boy on the far side of the boggy area where the forest started again and hid the end of the road ace merrill and eyeball chambers stood together hell eyeball said thats my little brother chris was staring at eyeball with his mouth open his wet shirt was still tied around his waist his backpack darker green now because of the rain was hanging against his bare back you go away rich he said we found him it doesnt matter were going to report him no youre not i said i was suddenly angry with them i was determined that this one time the older guys werent going to just take something from the younger ones they had come in cars i think thats what made me angriest after all our hard work they had come in cars there are four of us eyeball in answer vince desjardins charlie hogan and verns brother billy stepped through the trees behind ace and eyeball and they were followed by jack mudgett and fuzzy brackowicz here we all are ace said grinning so you just vern billy tessio cried in a terrible accusing voice you little worm you were under the front of the house you heard us talking vern looked frightened charlie hogan supported billy i ought to beat the puke out of you yeah come on then teddy suddenly shouted his eyes were shining crazily behind his rainwashed glasses come on then well fight you for the body come on you big men billy and charlie stepped forward but ace put a hand on their shoulders now listen you guys he said patiently as if we werent standing in a rainstorm there are more of us than there are of you were bigger well give you one chance to disappear i dont care where just leave eyeball laughed and fuzzy slapped ace on the back because were taking him ace smiled gently if you go well take him if you stay well hurt you and then take him anyway charlie and billy found him first they were pussies teddy shouted back vern told us about it they were too frightened to do anything about it he copied charlie hogans voice its a pity we stole that car its a pity we went to the back harlow road oh billy what are we going to do oh billy i think i just puked on my shoes charlie started forward again i looked wildly at ray brower he stared calmly up into the rain with his one eye there was still thunder but the rain was getting lighter what do you say gordie ace asked he was holding charlie lightly by the arm you must have at least some of your brothers sense tell these guys to go away ill let charlie beat up the one with glasses a bit but thats all what do you say he was wrong to mention denny i had wanted to explain that we had really found the body first since charlie and billy hadnt been interested i wanted to tell him about the train on the bridge about milo pressman and his fearless but stupid dog about the leeches i wanted to say come on ace be fair but he had to mention denny and instead of a reasonable argument what i heard coming out of my mouth was certain death go to hell ace i said aces mouth formed a perfect o of surprise everyone on both sides of the bog stared at me in amazement then teddy screamed happily thats telling him gordie yeah man i stood still unable to believe what i had done i was like an actor on stage who has just spoken the wrong words out of the corner of my eye i saw that chris was digging in the bottom of his backpack but i didnt immediately understand ok ace said softly lets get them dont hurt anyone except the lachance boy im going to break both his arms and he meant it they started to walk towards us through the rain jackie mudgett took a knife out of his pocket vern and teddy dropped into fighting positions on either side of me teddy did so eagerly vern with a desperate look on his face ace and his gang moved towards us in a line through the mud the body of ray brower lay at our feet i got ready to fight and that was when chris used the gun he had taken from his fathers desk kablam god what a wonderful sound that was charlie hogan jumped up into the air ace merrill who had been staring straight at me turned round and looked at chris his mouth made that o again eyeball looked amazed chris thats daddys gun he said hes really going to hurt you for that thats nothing compared to what youll get chris said his face was horribly pale and his eyes flashed you all know charlie and billy didnt want to come at first we wouldnt have walked all the way out here if they were going to come they just went somewhere and puked the story up and let ace merrill do all the thinking his voice rose to a scream but you arent going to get him do you hear me now listen ace said youd better put that down before you shoot your foot off you havent got the courage to shoot a mouse he began to walk forward again smiling the gentle smile as he came im going to make you eat that gun ace if you dont stand still im going to shoot you i swear to god youll go to jail ace said he continued to advance he was still smiling the rest of us were frozen watching and waiting ace didnt think a twelveyearold boy would shoot him i thought he was wrong i thought chris would shoot ace before he would let ace take his fathers gun away from him in those few seconds i was sure there was going to be bad trouble the worst id ever known killing trouble maybe and all about who would report finding a dead body chris said softly with great regret where do you want it ace arm or leg i cant decide you decide for me and ace stopped chapter twenty two hailstones his face fell and i saw sudden terror in it it wasnt chriss words i think it was the way he spoke them the real regret that things were going to go from bad to worse ace controlled himself all right he said softly speaking to chris but you know whats going to happen to you dont you no i dont chris said you little worm eyeball said loudly youre going to end up in hospital kiss my ass chris told him with an angry cry eyeball started forward and chris put a bullet into the water about ten feet in front of him eyeball jumped back cursing ok ace said now what now you guys are going to get back into your cars and go back to castle rock after that i dont care but you arent getting him he touched ray brower lightly with his foot do you understand but well get you ace said he was starting to smile again dont you know that well hurt you sincerely i cant believe you dont know that oh why dont you go home and then the storm came back and the sound drowned out his words this time the storm was even stronger and this time it was hail instead of rain the hailstones were enormous and the sound they made when they hit the leaves and the trees was unbelievably loud stones began to hit my shoulders it felt as if some evil creature was throwing them intending to hurt but the hailstones also began to hit ray browers face with an awful sound as if they were sinking into him vern gave in first with a scream he ran up the bank teddy waited only a minute then followed vern his hands held up over his head on the other side vince desjardins disappeared back under the cover of some trees and fuzzy brackowicz soon joined him but the rest of them stayed where they were and ace began to grin again stay with me gordie chris said in a low shaky voice stay with me man im here go away now chris said to ace and he was able by some magic to get the shaking out of his voice he sounded as if he was giving instructions to a stupid child well get you ace said we wont forget this ok chris said thats another day were going to enjoy getting you chambers well get out of here chris suddenly screamed and pointed the gun ace stepped back he looked threateningly at chris for a moment longer nodded then turned round come on he said to the others he looked back over his shoulder at chris and me once more well see you later they went back into the trees between the bog and the road chris and i stood perfectly still in spite of the hail which was so hard that it was making our skin red and which was piling up all around us like snow we stood and listened until we heard the sound of the engines of two cars chris went and checked that they were really gone when he came back he said we did it i was shaking all over we looked at each other warmly for a second and then looked down together a nasty thrill of fear shot through me and the sound of chris moving his feet let me know that he too had seen it ray browers eyes had become wide and white as if he was staring blindly a second later i understood what had happened but understanding didnt make the horror less his eyes had filled up with round white hailstones now water was running down his cheeks as if he was crying chris and i just looked at each other helplessly branches cracked behind us i spun round sure that ace and the others were coming back but it was vern and teddy what are we going to do man chris asked he was still looking down at the body and i didnt know whether he was talking to me or to it were going to take him back arent we teddy asked puzzled were going to be heroes isnt that right man he looked from chris to me and back to chris again chris looked up as if he was suddenly waking up from a dream he walked over to teddy and pushed him in the chest so hard that he fell down in the mud you shut up chris said you pussy it was the hail teddy cried out angry and ashamed it wasnt those guys chris im frightened of storms i cant help it he began to cry sitting there in the mud and the water what about you chris asked turning to vern are you afraid of storms too vern shook his head surprised by chriss anger no man i thought we were all going to run but you ran first you pussy so how did you know we were all going to run vern swallowed nervously and said nothing he turned to me were going to carry him back gordie if you say so chris but what if those guys i dont care about those guys you are all pussies chris they could call the police for revenge i dont care he screamed and leapt at me but one of his feet hit ray brewers body he fell to the ground and lay in the exact position ray brower was lying i looked wildly at chriss feet to make sure his shoes were still on then he began to cry and scream beating his hands and feet on the wet ground teddy and vern were staring at him in amazement because nobody had ever seen chris chambers cry before after a moment or two i walked back to the bank climbed it and sat down on one of the tracks teddy and vern followed me there we sat in the rain chapter twenty three a twentyyearold dream it was twenty minutes before chris climbed the bank to sit down beside us the clouds had begun to break and in places the sun was shining through chris was covered in mud from head to foot youre right gordie he said he doesnt belong to anyone i nodded five minutes passed no one said anything then i had a thought what if they did call the police i went back down the bank and over to where chris had been standing i got down on my knees and began to search through the water and grass with my fingers what are you doing teddy asked joining me to your left i think chris said and pointed i looked and after a minute or two i found both cartridges they flashed in the sunlight i gave them to chris he nodded and pushed them into his pocket now we go chris said no man teddy cried i want to take him listen stupid chris said if we take him back we could get into real trouble gordie was right those guys could tell any story they wanted what if they said we killed him how would you like that teddy was silent were going to walk fast back to the bridge chris said then well leave the tracks and come into castle rock from the other direction if people ask where we were well say we were camping up on brickyard hill and got lost milo pressman knows better i said well say milo frightened us and thats when we decided to go up on the brickyard i nodded we were all on our feet now ready to go the birds were singing madly pleased with the rain and now the sun and all the worms appearing above ground we all turned round as if pulled by strings and looked back at ray brower he was lying there alone again we had turned him over so it looked as if he was just lying in the sunshine then you saw the blood on the chin and under the nose and his slightly swollen body you saw that the flies had come out with the sun and were beginning to settle on the body you remembered the smell he was a boy our age and he was dead ok said chris lets go we started back the way we had come we didnt talk i dont know about the others but i was too busy thinking to talk there were things that worried me about the body of ray brower they worried me then and they worry me now he didnt seem to be badly hurt but the train must have hit him why else would his shoes be of his feet perhaps the train had hit him hard enough to knock him down the bank but not hard enough to kill him that was just possible if he had been trying to get out of the trains way then he had lain awake down there in the mud too frightened to move in pain and not knowing where he was i caught a wounded bird once and it died of fear in my hands perhaps ray brower had died because he was simply too frightened to go on living but there was another thing which worried me most of all all the news reports said that he had been carrying a bucket when he went off to pick fruit back in castle rock i went to the library and checked in the newspapers but we never saw the bucket where was it he must have thrown it away somewhere between chamberlain and the boggy ground in harlow where he died he must have thrown it away when he was just too lost and frightened to go on carrying such a useless object ive thought of going back to look for the bucket ive thought of driving to the end of the back harlow road and chasing a twentyyearold dream i get my backpack out of the car take off my shirt and tie it around my waist i find the boggy ground is the grass growing yellow there in the shape of a human body of course not theres no sign then i climb the bank up to the now rusty tracks and rotted wood and start walking towards chamberlain i feel sure that somewhere to one side of the tracks i would find the bucket it would show that there had once been a thirteenyearold gordon lachance its a stupid idea of course but the line between childhood and adulthood is narrower than most people like to think and at times we all feel closer to the children we once were than to the boring sensible adults we have become and i remember those days at the end of that summer so well and i think that boy was me and then the fearful thought comes which boy do you mean chapter twenty four love has teeth we got back to castle rock a little past five oclock on sunday morning we had walked all night nobody complained although our feet hurt and we were unbelievably hungry we crossed the bridge in safety passed through the dump with no sign of milo pressman and the nownotsoawful chopper and finally reached town we stood in front of our tree house and looked at it so that we didnt have to look at one another at last teddy said ill see you in school on wednesday i think im going to sleep till then me too vern agreed but billys going to get me so what chris said richies going to get me and ace is probably going to get gordie and one of the others will get teddy but we did it thats right vern said but he still sounded unhappy vern and teddy left i hesitated for a second before going home and chris said ill walk with you ok we walked for a while without talking castle rock was wonderfully quiet in the days first light i almost expected to turn a corner and see my deer standing there finally chris spoke vern and teddy will tell others he said yes i said but not today or tomorrow if thats what youre worried about maybe not for years he looked at me surprised at first they wont know what to say i explained and then it will start to seem like a dream and theyll be too embarrassed to talk about it and then it sounds crazy but i think theyll almost forget it ever happened he nodded you see through people gordie we had reached the corner of my street i wanted to say something more to chris and didnt know how to shake hands man he said sounding tired chris shake we shook ill see you he grinned not if i see you first he walked off still laughing as if he didnt hurt like me and wasnt covered in insect bites as if he didnt have a care in the world and wasnt returning to a dirty threeroom house with no running water and broken windows covered with plastic even if i had known the right thing to say i probably couldnt have said it talking destroys the effects of love love isnt soft like those poets say love has teeth which bite and the wounds never close no word can close those lovebites in fact if the wounds dry up the words will stop too chapter twenty five empty kitchen back home the kitchen was empty i took off my clothes and washed all over until the skin began to hurt i made myself an enormous breakfast while i was eating my mother came into the kitchen gordon where have you been camping i said we started in verns field and then went up the brickyard hill verns mother said she would speak to you didnt she she probably spoke to your father she said and walked over to the cupboard she sighed i miss dennis most in the mornings she said i always look in his room and its always empty thats terrible i said he always slept with the curtains open and the blankets gordon did you say something nothing important mum chapter twenty six some people drown the story never did get out ace merrill phoned the police without leaving his name and thats how they found the body neither his gang nor ours became heroes milo pressman never said a word chriss dad hadnt noticed that chris was gone he was too drunk teddys mum got worried on the second night and called verns mum verns mum said that we were in the field she knew because she could see the lights on in the tent teddys mum said she hoped no one was smoking cigarettes in there verns mum said she was sure none of verns or billys friends smoked so the story never came out but that wasnt the end of it one day near the end of the month when i was walking home from school a black ford stopped in front of me i knew straight away whose car it was before ace and fuzzy got out of it i dropped my school books and ran but they caught me within a few yards if an old lady hadnt come out of her house i dont know what would have happened as it was they broke my nose and two fingers as well as giving me a large number of minor injuries chriss brother broke his arm in two places and left his face as colourful as a sunrise teddy and vern were hurt too various stories went round the school all wildly wrong when the injuries mended vern and teddy just drifted away they had discovered a whole new group of people our age who would do what they said they started bringing them to the tree house and chris and i started going there less and less i think the last time i went there was in the spring of teddy and vern slowly became just two more faces in school we nodded and said hi that was all it happens friends come in and out of your life like waiters in a restaurant but when i think of that dream the swollen dead bodies under the water pulling at my legs it seems right that friends should come and go some people drown its not fair but it happens some people drown chapter twenty seven tears for a friend vern tessio was killed in a fire that destroyed a house in lewiston in there had been a large party in the house the night before someone fell asleep holding a cigarette vern himself perhaps dreaming of his lost pennies teddy who had always wanted to join the army was refused of course everyone knew he would be because of his eyes and his ears everyone except teddy he started missing school going to the places ace and fuzzy and the rest had gone before him after school he got a job filling holes in the road he bought himself a car one day when it was full of his friends and they were all drinking he crashed into a tree turned the car over it rolled six times and no one came out alive chris joined the college courses his parents thought he was crazy his friends thought he was a pussy his teachers didnt want this leatherjacketed and leatherbooted person on their courses he and i studied together almost every night trying to win back the seven years of education chris had lost we were hanging on to each other in deep water we both graduated chris went to university to study law near the end of the spring term in chris was queuing in a restaurant when two men in front of him started to argue about who was there first chris who had always been the best of us at making peace stepped between them and got a knife in his throat he was dead in seconds i wasnt there chris was in graduate school and i had already graduated from university and was married when i read about it in the newspaper i told my wife i was going out to get a drink i drove out of town parked and cried for him i cried for nearly half an hour without stopping me im a writer now the end
