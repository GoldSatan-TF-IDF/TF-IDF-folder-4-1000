rhymes with fear the words echoed in colonel paul rackhams head as he floated in discoverys airlock the bulky manned maneuvering unit clamped to his back air was being pumped out cold vacuum was forming around him rhymes with fear he should have said no should have let mcgovern or one of the others take the spacewalk instead but houston had suggested that rackham do it and to demure hed have needed to state a reason just a dead body he told himself nothing to be afraid of there was a time when a military man couldnt have avoided seeing death but rackham had just been finishing high school during desert storm sure as a test pilot hed watched colleagues die in crashes but hed never actually seen the bodies and when his mother passed on shed had a closed casket his choice that made without hesitation the moment the funeral director had asked him his father still in a nursing home had been in no condition to make the arrangements rackham was wearing liquidcooling long johns beneath his spacesuit tubes circulating water around him to remove excess body heat he shuddered and the tubes moved in unison like a hundred serpents writhing he checked the barometer saw that the locks pressure had dropped below psi just a trace of atmosphere left he closed his eyes for a moment trying to calm himself then reached out a gloved hand and turned the actuator that opened the outer circular hatch im leaving the airlock he said he was wearing the standard snoopy ears communications carrier which covered most of his head beneath the space helmet two thin microphones protruded in front of his mouth copy that paul said mcgovern up in the shuttles cockpit good luck rackham pushed the left mmu armrest control forward puffs of nitrogen propelled him out into the cargo bay the long space doors that normally formed the bays roof were already open and overhead he saw earth in all its blueandwhite glory he adjusted his pitch with his right hand control then began rising up as soon as hed cleared the top of the cargo bay the russian space station mir was visible hanging a hundred meters away a giant metal crucifix rackham brought his hand up to cross himself i have mir in sight he said fighting to keep his voice calm im going over rackham remembered when the station had gone up twenty years ago in he first saw its name in his hometown newspaper the omaha world herald mir the russian word for peace as if peace had had anything to do with its being built reagan had been hemorrhaging money into the strategic defense initiative back then if the cold war turned hot the high ground would be in orbit even then even in grade eight rackham had been dying to go into space no price was too much whatever it takes hed told dave his sometimes friend sometimes rival over lunch one of these days ill be floating right by that damned mir give the russians the finger hed pronounced mir as if it rhymed with sir dave had looked at him for a moment as if he were crazy then dismissing all of it except the way paul had spoken he smiled a patronizing smile and said its meer actually rhymes with fear rhymes with fear pauls gaze was still fixed on the giant cross spikes of sunlight glinting off it he shut his eyes and let the nitrogen exhaust push against the small of his back propelling him into the darkness ive got a scalpel said the voice over the speaker at mission control in kaliningrad im going to do it flight controller dimitri kovalevsky leaned into his mike youre making a mistake yuri you dont want to go through with this he glanced at the two large wall monitors the one showing mirs orbital plot was normal the other which usually showed the view inside the space station was black why dont you turn on your cameras and let us see you the speaker crackled with static you know as well as i do that the cameras cant be turned off thats our way isnt it still even after the reforms cameras with no off switches hes probably put bags or gloves over the lenses said metchnikoff the engineer seated at the console next to kovalevskys its not worth it yuri said kovalevsky into the mike while nodding acknowledgement at metchnikoff you want to come on home climb into the soyuz and come on down ive got a team here working on the reentry parameters nyet said yuri it wont let me leave what wont let you leave ive got a knife repeated yuri ignoring kovalevskys question im going to do it kovalevsky slammed the mikes off switch dammit im no expert on this wheres that bloody psychologist shes on her way said pasternak the scrawny orbitaldynamics officer another fifteen minutes tops kovalevsky opened the mike again yuri are you still there no response yuri they took the food said the voice over the radio sounding even farther away than he really was right out of my mouth kovalevsky exhaled noisily it had been an international embarrassment the first time it had happened back in an unmanned progress rocket had been launched to bring food up to the two cosmonauts then aboard mir but when it docked with the station those cosmonauts had found its cargo hold empty looted by groundsupport technicians desperate to feed their own starving families the same thing had happened again just a few weeks ago this time the thieves had been even more clever theyd replaced the stolen food with sacks full of dirt to avoid any difference in the rockets prelaunch weight we got food to you eventually said kovalevsky oh yes said yuri we reached in grabbed the food back just like we always do i know things havent been going well said kovalevsky but im all alone up here said yuri he was quiet for a time but then he lowered his voice conspiratorially except i discover im not alone kovalevsky tried to dissuade the cosmonaut from his delusion thats right yuri were here were always here for you look down and youll see us no said yuri no ive done enough of that its time im going to do it kovalevsky covered the mike and spoke desperately what do i say to him suggestions anyone dammit what do i say im doing it said yuris voice there was a grunting sound a stream of red globules floating in the air red that was our color wasnt it what did the americans call us the red menace better dead than red but theyre no better really they wanted it just as badly kovalevsky leaned forward apply pressure to the cut yuri we can still save you come on yuri you dont want to die yuri up ahead mir was growing to fill rackhams view the vertical shaft of the crucifix consisted of the soyuz that had brought yuri to the space station sixteen months ago the multiport docking adapter the core habitat and the kvant science module with a green progress cargo transport docked to its aft end the two arms of the cross stuck out of the docking adapter to the left was the kvant biological research center which contained the eva airlock through which rackham would enter to the right was the kristall spaceproduction lab kristall had a docking port that a properly equipped american shuttle could hook up to but discovery wasnt properly equipped the mir adapter collar was housed aboard atlantis which wasnt scheduled to fly again for three months rackhams heart continued to race he wanted to swing around return to the shuttle perhaps he could claim nausea that was reason enough to abort an eva vomiting into a space helmet in zerog was a sure way to choke to death but he couldnt go back hed fought to get up here clawed competed cheated left his parents behind in that nursing home hed never married never had kids never found time for anything but this he couldnt turn around not now not here rackham had to fly around to the kvants backside to reach the eva hatch doing so gave him a clear view of discovery he saw it from the rear its three large and two small engine cones looking back at him like a spiders cluster of eyes he cycled through the space stations airlock the main lights were dark inside the biology module but some violetwhite fluorescents were on over a bed of plants shoots were growing in strange circular patterns in the microgravity rackham disengaged the manned maneuvering unit and left it floating near the airlock like a small refrigerator with arms just as the russians had promised a large pressure bag was clipped to the wall next to yuris own empty spacesuit rackham wouldnt be able to get the body now undoubtedly stiff with rigor mortis into the suit but it would fit easily into the pressure bag used for emergency equipment transfers mirs interior was like everything in the russian space program rough metallic ramshackle looking more like a victorian steamworks than spaceage technology heart thundering in his ears he pushed his way down kvants long axis toward the central docking adapter to which all the other parts of the station were attached countless small objects floated around the cabin he reached out with his gloved hand and swept a few up in his palm they were six or seven millimeters across and wrinkled like dried peas but their color was a dark rusty brown droplets of dried blood jesus christ rackham let go of them but they continued to float in midair in front of him he used the back of his glove to flick them away and continued on deeper into the station discovery this is houston rackham here houston go ahead we ah have an errand for you to run rackham chuckled your wish is our command houston weve had a request from the russians they ah ask that you swing by mir for a pickup rackham turned to his right and looked at mcgovern the pilot mcgovern was already consulting a computer display he gave rackham a thumbsup signal can do said rackham into his mike what sort of pick up its a body say again houston a body a dead body my god was there an accident no accident discovery yuri vereshchagin has killed himself killed thats right the russians cant afford to send another manned mission up to get him a pause yuri was one of us lets bring him back where he belongs rackham squeezed through the docking adapter and made a right turn heading down into mirs core habitat it was dark except for a few glowing leds a shaft of earthlight coming in through one window and one of sunlight coming in through the other rackham found the light switch and turned it on the interior lit up revealing beige cylindrical walls looking down the modules thirteenmeter length he could see the main control console with two strapin chairs in front of it storage lockers the exercise bicycle the dining table the closetlike sleeping compartments and at the far end the round door leading into kvant where yuris body was supposedly floating he pushed off the wall and headed down the chamber it widened out near the eating table he noticed that the ceiling there had writing on it rackham looked at the cameras one fore one aft both covered over with spacesuit gloves and realized that even if they were uncovered that part of the ceiling was perpetually out of their view each person who had visited the station had apparently written his or her name there in bold magic marker strokes romanenko leveykin viktorenko krikalev dozens more foreign astronauts names appeared too in chinese characters and arabic and english but yuri vereshchagins name was nowhere to be seen perhaps the custom was to sign off just before leaving the station rackham easily found the magic marker held in place on the bulkhead with velcro his cyrillic wasnt very good he had to carefully copy certain letters from the samples already on the walls but he soon had vereshchagins name printed neatly across the ceiling rackham thought about writing his own name too he touched the marker to the curving metal but stopped pulling the pen back leaving only a black dot where it had made contact vereshchagins name should be here a reminder that he had existed rackham remembered all the old photographs that came to light after the fall of the soviet union the original versions before those who had fallen out of favor had been airbrushed out surely no cosmonaut would ever remove vereshchagins name but there was no need to remind those who might come later that an american had stopped by to bring his body home the dried spheres of blood were more numerous in here they bounced off rackhams faceplate with little pinging sounds as he continued down the core module through the circular hatch into kvant yuris body was indeed there floating in a semifetal position his skin was as white as candle wax bled dry hed obviously rotated slowly as his opened wrist had emptied out there was a ring of dark brown blood stains all around the circumference of the science module many pieces of equipment also had blood splatters on them where drops had impacted before theyd desiccated rackham could taste his lunch at the back of his throat he desperately fought it down and yet he couldnt take his eyes off yuri a corpse a body without a soul in it it was mesmerizing terrifying revolting the very face of death hed met yuri once in passing years ago at an iau conference in montreal rackham had never known anyone before who had committed suicide how could yuri have killed himself sure his country was in ruins but billions of of rubles had been spent building this station and getting him up here didnt he understand how special that made him how quite literally he was above it all as he drifted closer rackham saw that yuris eyes were open the pupils were dilated to their maximum extent and a pale gray film had spread over the orbs rackham thought that the decent thing to do would be to reach over and close the eyes his gloves had textured rubber fingertips to allow as much feedback as possible without compromising his suits thermal insulation but even if he could work up the nerve he didnt trust them for something as delicate as moving eyelids his breathing was growing calmer he was facing death facing it directly he regretted now not having seen his mother one last time and there was something here something else inside kvant with him he grabbed hold of a projection from the bulkhead and wheeled around he couldnt see it couldnt hear any sound conducted through the helmet of his suit but he felt its presence knew it was there there was no way to get out kvants rear docking port was blocked by the progress ferry and the exit to the core module was blocked by the invisible presence get a grip on yourself rackham thought theres nothing here but there was he could feel it what do you want he said a quaver in his tones say again paul mcgoverns voice over the headset rackham reached down switched his suit radio from vox to off what do you want he said again there was no answer he waved his arms batting around hundreds of dried drops of blood they flew all over the cabin except for an area up ahead the size of a man in that area they deflected before reaching the walls something was there something unseen pauls stomach contracted he felt panic about to overtake him when a hand on his shoulder barely detectable through the bulky suit his heart jumped and he swung around hed been floating backwards moving away from the unseen presence and had bumped into the corpse he stopped dead revolted by the prospect of touching the body again terrified of moving in the other direction toward whatever was up ahead but he had to get out somebody else could come back for yuri hed find some way to explain it all later but for now he had to escape he grabbed hold of a handle on the wall and pushed off the bulkhead trying to fly past the presence up ahead he made it through into the core module but something cold as space reached out and stopped him directly in front of the small window that looked down on the planet look below said a voice in rackhams head what do you see he looked outside saw the planet of his birth africa millions of children starving to death rackham moved his head left and right not my fault the view changed faster than any orbital mechanics would allow look below said the voice again what do you see china a billion people living without freedom nothing i can do again the world spun look below the west coast of america theres san francisco the plague is everywhere but nowhere is it worse than there someday theyll find a cure what else do you see los angeles the inner city slums poverty they havent abandoned hope those who live there hope has abandoned them they can get out they just need help whose help where will the money come from i dont know dont you look below no look your eyes have been closed too long open them what do you see russia ah now russia free we defeated the evil empire we defeated the communist menace the people are starving but theyre free they have nothing to eat twice now theyve taken food destined for this station i read about that terrible unthinkable like committing murder to take food from the mouths of the hungry it is like committing murder isnt it yes no no wait thats not what i meant isnt it the people need food no the space program provides jobs and dont forget the spinoffs advanced plastics and pharmaceuticals and and microwave ovens yes and and dehydrated ice cream no important stuff medical equipment and all kinds of new electronic devices thats why you go into space then to make life better on earth yes yes exactly look below no no dammit i wont yuri looked below yuri was a cosmonaut a russian maybe maybe russia shouldnt be spending all this money on space but im an american my country is rich los angeles said the voice that wasnt a voice san francisco and dont forget new york slums plague a populace at war with itself rackham felt his gloved fists clenching he ground his teeth damn you or you he closed his eyes tried to think any price hed said and now it was time to pay for the good of everyone he said but the road was always paved with good intentions starvation enslavement poverty war he couldnt go back to discovery he had no choice in the matter it wouldnt let him leave but hed be damned if hed end up like yuri bait for yet another spacefarer he slipped into the control station just below the entrance portal that led from the docking adapter he looked at the cameras fore and aft the bulky white gloves covering them like beckoning hands an ending yes and with the coffin closed he scanned the controls consulted the onboard computer made his preparations he couldnt see the entity couldnt see its grin but he knew they both were there in the hell paul mcgoverns voice as rackham turned his suit radio back on why are you firing the acs jets it it must be a malfunction rackham said his finger still firmly on the red activation switch then get out of there get out before the deltav gets too high we can still pick you up if you get out now i cant get out said rackham the the way to the eva airlock is blocked then get into the soyuz and cast off gods sake man youre accelerating down toward the atmosphere i i dont know how to fly a soyuz well get kaliningrad to talk you through the separation sequence no no that wont work sure it will we can bring the soyuz descent capsule into our cargo bay if need be but hurry man hurry goodbye charlie what do you mean goodbye jesus christ paul rackhams brow was slick with sweat goodbye the temperature continued to rise rackham reached down and undogged his helmet the abrupt increase in air pressure hurting his ears he lifted the great fishbowl off his head letting it fly across the cabin he then took off the snoopyeared headset array it undulated up and away a fabric bat in the shaft of earthlight ending up pinned by acceleration to the ceiling paint started peeling off the walls and the plastic piping had a soft unfocused look to it the air was so hot it hurt to breathe yuris body was heating up too the smell from that direction was overpowering rackham was close to one of the circular windows earth had swollen hugely beneath him he couldnt make out the geography for all the clouds was that china or africa america or russia below it was all a blur and all the same an orange glow began licking at the port as paint on the stations hull burned up in the mesosphere the water in the reticulum of tubes running over his body soon began to boil flames were everywhere now atmospheric turbulence was tearing the station apart the winglike solar panels flapped away crisping into nothingness rackham felt his own flesh blistering the roar from outside the station was like a billion screams screams of the starving screams of the poor screams of the shackled through the port he saw the kristall module sheer clean off the docking adapter and go tumbling away look below the voice had said look below and he had into space at any price into space above it all the station disintegrated around him metal shimmering and tearing away soon nothing was left except the flames and they never stopped the end other short stories by robert j sawyer a profile of rob from
