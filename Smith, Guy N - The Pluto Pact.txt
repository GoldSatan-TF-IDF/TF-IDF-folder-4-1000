prologue dusk was beginning to creep down from the mountains when the witchfinder rode into craiglowrie his hunched position in the saddle of the black mare disguised his true height yet all the same he was tall and terrible the features beneath the dark broadbrimmed hat seemed like those of a sunbleached skull from a distance the grimace that revealed black and broken teeth the eyes that glowed with the fire of a personal hatred and seemed to search out each and every one of the peasants who trembled and watched behind the windows of their tumbledown bothies they remembered the last time he had come to this remote scottish valley a company of soldiers in his wake six villagers had been dragged from their homes and burned the witchfinders long bony forefinger singling them out judge and executioner not speaking just smiling evilly and when he left the stench of burned human flesh hung in the atmosphere for days afterwards as though he had commanded the elements not to disperse it a grim reminder to those who still lived that had been in and now fifteen years later he was back a devil incarnate on a mission of death hidden beneath the folds of his travelworn cloak was a royal commission which none dared question the fact that he was alone now was in a way more terrifying to the watchers than if he had ridden in with an armed escort for such was his aura of power that he seemed like a god of old come to torture and kill to wreak mayhem wherever he travelled his eyes narrowed to slits taking in the village in one sweeping glance reviving old memories which brought a grim smile to the bloodless lips there stood the kirk a symbol of defiance against evil in spite of its weatherworn structure almost contempt in the witchfinders expression now perhaps wishing that he could burn the ageing redfaced clergyman who peered from behind the partly open doors another monarch another act and perhaps one day that would come about eyes everywhere were watching him like frightened fireflies ready to withdraw into the darkness tall and erect now straining his gaze to make out the halfdemolished cottage some way up the mountain slope he watched intently as though looking for some movement from within but there was none just a faint wisp of peaty smoke rising straight up into the windless sky that meant balzur was at home but there was no hurry he would not be going anywhere the stranger nudged his horse forward tired hooves scraping on the stony track he rode slowly between the uneven line of dwellings until he reached a larger building at the far end beyond the kirk its windows lighted and a door ajar the hospitality of the inn denied to none the witchfinder dismounted in one easy movement throwing the loose reins over a hitchingpost the animal stood there meekly as its master mounted the narrow steps and threw the door wide open the single room which served as a hostelry for the inhabitants of craiglowrie was primitive trestle tables of planks placed across sawn tree butts earthenware jugs and mugs an acrid reek of ale and crudelydistilled spirit which caused the newcomers nostrils to flare a man straightened up from the fireplace hunched by some deformity from birth blistered lips moving beneath his red beard sire he gave a halfbow sweeping downwards with the stump of a malformed hand my humble inn food and drink are yours there was a gleam in the witchfinders eyes as he scraped mud from the soles of his riding boots on to the rough floor aye landlord all that i want ill take in the name of the king and his kirk ale for now and tell me of this man balzur amber liquid was slopped into a vessel on the bar and when the innkeeper spoke his festered lips quivered sire he began balzur has ruled craiglowrie and the people of these mountains ever since the royal soldiers left after quelling the uprising his word is law until now relief overcame fear thank god our message found you witchfinder my coming has nothing to do with your message a pause as the speaker took a long swallow of ale i have travelled many miles because there is said to be one here whose magic offends the king and his kirk but tell me more of this balzur and his black powers he communes with the devil a sudden rush of words young maidens and children have been snatched from their homes in the dead of night and never seen again the people live in terror and bestow gifts upon balzur in the hope that he might pass over their families only last week a wee lassie ill warrant his power is not as strong as mine the witchfinder gave a low laugh but nevertheless i shall need the help of the people of craiglowrie all the brushwood they can find to make a fire so great that it will light up the english towns on the other side of solway tonight the sky will radiate my power for all to see driving the evil ones back into the darkness the people await your bidding sire then bid them hasten for the time is nigh as the witchfinder watched the dwarflike figure step out through a rear doorway he heard the mutter of low voices laughing he refilled his mug this coming night would be yet another to savour it was fully dark when the witchfinder left the inn a myriad of sparkling stars in the sky promising frost before morning a night to huddle around a blazing fire and tonight the people of craiglowrie would be able to do just that the tall man glanced towards the mingled crowd further down the street he set off at a walk his pace deceptive so that some of the older villagers had to break into a shambling run just to keep his silhouette in view he permitted himself another smile as he noticed the dead branches piled high around the base of a lone oak which had once been struck by lightning these peasants had wasted no time in their eagerness to be rid of balzur the going was steeper now though he did not slow his step his heart was pounding at the thought of what lay ahead the remains of a hillside cottage were lit up an ethereal glow that cast weird shadows across heather and gorse so long as balzur was at home nothing else mattered as the witchfinder paused staring at the jagged stone entrance with its illfitting door he heard the low mutterings of those who followed at a distance they were afraid balzurs sorcery was feared from the craiglowrie mountains to the firth and beyond even now they doubted the powers of the witchfinder against the magic of balzur there was a faint stench barely noticeable but once you recognised it you heaved and vomited burning human flesh yet to the witchfinder it was the sweet fragrance of success familiar to one such as himself he moved forward no longer hesitating the time for savouring was over his booted foot struck the door and flung it back with a splintering of wood balzur was there at the far end of the littered room the fire in the wide grate belched out poisonoussmelling smoke as though the sootcaked chimney above was rebelling against it in some respects the wizard resembled the one who had encroached upon his domain beneath the grime on his scaly flesh the features were finely cut as though nobility had existed in his ancestry old so old it seemed incredible that he still lived and moved until you looked into his eyes and then you understood two sunken malevolent orbs that radiated the ultimate in evil an invisible force that had men cowering back and babbling their fear of his magic except the witchfinder he met his adversarys gaze unflinchingly then allowed his eyes to travel round the room hed seen most of it before in similar abodes verminous creatures scurrying and squeaking in their cages dried and whitened bones the jar of preserved foreskins only here the stench of death was predominant a dismembered childs body smouldering and hissing amidst the peat and kindling wood there were markings on floor walls and ceiling a few familiar but most beyond his ken balzur truly was a black magician supreme a disciple of the left hand path the witchfinders mouth was suddenly dry and a momentary spasm of fear twanged his heartbeat out of rhythm then he had himself under control again staring at the wizards tall skeletal figure arrogant and defiant i need no further proof of your vile sorcery the witchfinder cried with relief that his voice did not quaver i see it all before me here and for what i see you are condemned to die by fire so that your evil may be consumed with you my power is greater than yours witchfinder molest me at your peril seize him the other shouted halfturned towards the villagers crowding into the room drag him to the stake then came a rush of angry sweatstinking bodies and calloused hands grabbing for the old man whose upraised arm failed to hold off those who had so long yielded to his demands touching him at first with the revulsion of an inquisitive child finding a dead reptile then dragging him boldly out into the open a chorus of abuse drowned his feeble protests as he was raised aloft and carried down the uneven slope burning torches illuminated the scene reflecting on balzurs features the witchfinder bringing up the rear gasped in amazement their power destroyed his victims usually screamed and pleaded for mercy but not balzur his face was an impassive mask without so much as a glimmer of apprehension in the deepsunken eyes tightlipped angry but unafraid several stumbled on the long trek down to craiglowrie village and once the wizard was almost dropped but their anger had now escalated to a frenzy burn the fiend let pluto ruler of the underworld take his own back into his fiery halls they recalled the bible readings in the kirk as the timid clergyman had relied upon its teachings to combat the evil hanging over them for so long thou shall not suffer a witch to live he that sacrificeth unto any god save the lord only he shall be utterly destroyed it was time for those words to be put into action balzur was lifted up and tied with stout ropes to the treetrunk blazing torches were held at the ready as all heads turned towards the witchfinder the tall man emerged from the shadows and approached the condemned man this is the fate that awaits all who confer with demons balzur came his deep booming voice that seemed to echo through the village and along the valley my power is greater than yours my fire hotter than hell itself wait it was no desperate plea from the bound man on top of the pyre rather an insistence that his last words be heard you know not what you do blasphemy words stolen from the holy book no my words in truth my warning burn me and all of you shall burn you too witchfinder the anger of pluto will come upon those who destroy his disciple and he will send fire to consume you you and your descendants after you a heat that will consume you within and without a fire that will live in this place for all time this i promise the curse of pluto will be upon you and your offspring stop now before it is too late empty words the hollow threats of a cowardly murderer the witchfinder shouted noticing that a few of those with torches had stepped back this blasphemer cannot harm you do not listen to him fire him a torch was thrust forward with a loud crackling as the hungry flames found the dry tinder and began to spread other torches were thrown on to the fire instantly igniting and sending up orange tongues and flying sparks there was a loud roar as the flames amalgamated the thickening smoke spiralled and mushroomed out into the blackness of night hear me listen to the curse of balzur hear me pluto mighty ruler of the world below balzurs features seemed less wizened now the wrinkles smoothing out into the tenderness of youth no hint of the searing pain of the fire as it began to blacken the flesh beneath his blazing garments the crowd had fallen back in a frightened huddle unable to take their eyes off balzur dont look at him dont listen the witchfinder shrieked through the crackle of burning branches and there was no mistaking the fear in his voice he cant hurt you now no but his evil demons can pluto will take revenge for this far better to have fled craiglowrie and left our village for balzur to rule over the kings witchfinder had now fallen back wanting to turn and run to mount his horse and leave this devilish place far behind but he found his gaze irresistibly drawn back up to the face of his burning victim you heard me witchfinder his blackened lips made themselves heard above the noise you and these people and all their families shall die by the fire of pluto a living death my agony is shortlived before i go to join my master but yours will continue endlessly in everlasting hell fire a sudden collapse of burning debris and the blazing body was momentarily screened by the eddying smoke when this cleared he still managed one last soulchilling cry hear me pluto whom i have served so long and take my soul in return for a curse upon craiglowrie burn these people and their children and their childrens children with a fire that cannot be quenched the witchfinder found himself staggering away with the others in a panic stricken flight through the blinding smoke clasping his hands over his ears in a futile attempt to shut out the words and then through streaming eyes he spied his black mount pulling frantically at its tether eyes rolling as it bucked and plunged as if it too had heard and understood grabbing the reins he somehow brought the animal to a standstill gulping for breath as he hauled himself up into the saddle trying to get the horse under control you too witchfinder he spurred its flanks knowing he could not stop the horse even if he wanted to and crouching low over its neck he thundered past the scattered hovels of craiglowrie the place now cursed by balzur as he traded his soul for revenge upon his executioners galloping through the night the mare found its own path slewing violently in places and almost throwing its rider on on far beyond the glow of the dying fire now reflecting on the mountain slopes above the village then suddenly the night sky was lit up with dazzling brilliance a shooting ball of fire that seared the eyeballs a brightness impossible to shut out the witchfinder felt his steed rear knew that he was airborne somersaulting flying falling a sickening crunch that seemed to break every bone in his body then he was lying there blinded by fiery explosions that threatened to shatter his skull screaming for mercy until his voice was no more than a hoarse whisper then came the pain with all its excruciating force a burning that he had him gasping for water somewhere he could smell smoke but that was impossible because he had covered many miles and balzurs funeral pyre was far behind you too witchfinder oh god the pain his lungs racked him with every wheezing breath he couldnt move every limb was contorted with agony and he could not get that face out of his mind the cursing lips the searching eyes none would be spared and the witchfinder knew that he was going to die his body burned and yet there was no fire scorching heat and dancing flames and balzur still cursing pursuing him into the black void of unconsciousness it was three days before the villagers emerged from their homes and crept towards the burned patch where balzurs dwelling had stood past the ashes of the fire in which the ogre of craiglowrie had perished the blackened skeleton scarcely distinguishable from the charred branches of the old oak shivering on a damp misty morning but not because of the cold they stood some fifty yards away from the blackened ruin saw the heap of fallen stones that had once been walls the timbers reduced to powdered ash and something else an object roughly the size of a large tombstone embedded in the ground where once the door had stood uneven yet smooth and shining glinting with a coppery colour as the first rays of the morning sun penetrated the swirling mist once they glanced at it they had to keep on looking as though it was an eye that held them with a hypnotic stare as the sun rose the mist vanished but still they continued to stand there so warm like the glow of embers when the fire has died down getting warmer the longer they stood there until they began to sweat they assured each other that the strange heat came from the ashes that beneath them the fire still burned and would continue to do so for weeks like the moorland fires in dry summers but it was evening before they finally returned to their bothies and told their families what they had seen and each of them vowed never to return to that awful place again remembering balzurs curse and his pact with pluto winter came with its howling blizzards and deep snows that buried craiglowrie the villagers remaining in their cottages from november until the following march and as always the winter brought its own deaths the sick and infirm unable to survive the cold in spite of their incessant peat fires by february there were fifteen corpses awaiting burial strong men who had died in indescribable agony in the claustrophobic blackness of their tomblike homes pleading for water as their bodies burned with festering rashes wasting away in frenzied delirium finally the snows began to melt and in the first week of april a tragic fearful column of craiglowries survivors wound its way up towards the foot of the mountain the ascent up to where balzurs cottage had once stood was treacherous yet they had to see curiosity overcoming their terror in the bright sunlight they stood there aghast huddled together for safety the sweat on their bodies turning icy may god have mercy on us and on all the people of craiglowrie the ageing clergyman closed his eyes and prayed that the sinister blackened square which harboured not a flake of snow amidst the mountain drifts would disappear by the time he looked again but it did not its gone a shaking hand pointed to the place where a heap of rubble had once marked the site of the black magicians hovel in its place was a gaping hole that seemed to drop on down into the bowels of the earth none dared step forward to ascertain its depth a yawning black pit had swallowed up both the stonework and the thunderbolt that had come in answer to balzurs curse pluto had sent his messenger of destruction and once its work was done it had sunk back down to the underworld the villagers returned to their homes in terror never daring to venture back up that hillside again for when the lush summer growth began it was only too plain to see that not a single shoot of heather nor blade of grass grew on that spot they now called plutos patch and from that time onwards according to legend the people of craiglowrie died terrible deaths with a disease that spread over their bodies in burning rashes but always a few survived enough to transmit the curse through the following centuries then finally none remained just a ghost village where strange lights in the sky and burning heath fires were reported by wandering shepherds in search of missing sheep towards the end of the nineteenth century a town was built on the site of craiglowries dereliction new people moved in and if perchance they heard stories of balzur and the witchfinder they scoffed and dismissed these tales as folklore which had no part in a modern world and in a growing population a few deaths went virtually unnoticed chapter one muirburning time midfebruary when the heather is brittle after a dry spell the old growth igniting easily and the fire spreading leaving in its wake a charred and ugly landscape but only a temporary disfiguration of natures kingdom for within weeks the new growth will sprout lush and green tender shoots for the hungry grouse to devour cover in which to hatch their young hidden from the sharp eye of the gliding buzzard or eagle safety from the prowling fox moorland fires had their own special fascination for jock leggett the dancing orange tongues the way they ate up everything in their path a leaping tide of destruction crackling and hissing like an army of angry dragons thwarted when they reached the firebreak which jock had carefully scythed around the patch to be burned then he began all over again working zestfully so that from his croft that night he could gaze out upon the big squares of smouldering ashes and know that it was all his own work it crossed his mind once what he would have done had he lived within the bounds of a city edinburgh or glasgow instead of on the outskirts of craiglowrie it was a frightening thought because he knew he would have had to set fire to something he couldnt live without fire as though he had been spawned in hell the balzur legend didnt frighten jock not one little bit balzur had been a man of fire and hed died as hed lived not uttering a single scream even when the blaze was at its fiercest turning his flesh to dripping fat like the burning of a candle all the same jock wasnt happy with the sweet smell of heather smoke in his nostrils he gazed down with smarting eyes upon the activity in the valley below him bulldozers levelled the rugged terrain a gang of men were already erecting a high barbedwire fence around the perimeter of what the craiglowrie herald announced would be the most uptodate nuclear waste reprocessing plant in the world coyle the editor had nicknamed it holocaust and if anything went wrong that was what it would be a blazing hell on earth jock conjured up a mental picture skyhigh flames that would light up the sky for miles around the smell of burning flesh heavy in the atmosphere it wasnt that which worried him most though because he didnt really understand anything about nuclear recycling it was what these bastards were doing to the valley that upset him this was just the start theyd need more and more land and theyd take it as they wanted it regardless of sheep or grouse or the hill folk who eked out a living the simple way one day there would be nothing here but barbedwire compounds and squat featureless buildings like being taken over by the russians jock coughed as some of the smoke got down into his lungs it was sweet like tobacco smoke and made him feel heady until he couldnt breathe and had to back away out of the eddying clouds he wondered what would happen to these slopes in years to come theyd be barren the moor above too all incorporated in this latest foolhardy venture by man the suicide course of modern civilization it would be nice to burn them off now whilst there was still heather to burn a kind of defiant gesture to this bureaucracy which was spreading up from south of the border they wanted barren landscapes then bloody well gi it em a black stinking charred desert the blood coursed fiercely through jock leggetts veins his wizened weatherbeaten features clouded with anger gnarled hands clenched at the tiny moving dots down below the grouse and their predators would be driven to another habitat and then another and another until there was nowhere left for them to go man too would become an extinct species jock had already seen the best of his life nostalgic memories flooded back the moor as it used to be when the gentlemen shooters came by horsedrawn carriages in the days when his father was gamekeeper here wining and dining in the lodges at night lodges now fallen into decay because sportsmen today jetted up for a days shooting and had no time to savour the other more worthwhile aspects of their trip a hundred brace was average for a day then now thirty was considered good leisure had been replaced by haste an urgency to get everything over and done with selfishness and greed yes jock decided today was as good a day as any for a big fire a freshening westerly wind to fan the flames and drive the blaze downwards towards the monstrosity that was destroying the valley below sweeping flames that would destroy everything in their path and nobody would be able to prove a thing since dozens of muirburns got out of control every spring hidden by the smoke from anybody who might be watching down below jock leggett moved away and picked out a clump of gorse suitable for starting the big blaze he dropped to his knees in the heather the matchbox rattling in his hand no change of mind no regrets this was going to be the end of an era in a way it was like being god some dead gorse flared and crackled sparks igniting several more fires in the rough brown grass that lay around wisps of smoke thickened soon rivers of flame merged into an ocean inferno roaring as the wind caught it jock leggett remained kneeling almost as though he had not the strength to struggle to his feet and everywhere it had grown much darker as the thickening smoke hung in the sky shutting out the sun the blaze was really getting a hold now jock smiled feebly as he moved downhill soon the smoke would block out the sunlight from the entire valley a hellish night in the midst of day let that day be darkness let not god regard it from above neither let the light shine upon it let darkness and the shadow of death stain it let a cloud dwell upon it let the blackness of the day terrify it and then came the heat scorching the old gamekeeper smarting his eyes with a painful dryness through the billowing smoke he could clearly see a tenfoot wall of flame coming back towards him he lost his balance as his foot caught up in some tangled heather and he fell back his mouth opened but the cry of terror was no more than a wheeze let that day be darkness his fear escalated the wind had changed suddenly to an easterly direction no longer was the blaze being carried down towards craiglowrie instead it was moving back uphill the flames all around him as they raced towards the moor above jock leggett closed his eyes but he could not shut out the living hell all around him then suddenly he was aware that he was no longer alone a man he could see him clearly seemingly impervious to the fire which raged about him a ragged figure materialising out of the black smoke a face that belonged to a corpse in the final stages of decay hairless and blackened eyes that glowed brightly or else reflected the inferno that surely must consume him any moment blistered lips stretched into a mirthless smile uttering soundless words this is how it once was and is now and shall be again a land of fires destroying only i can live for pluto himself gave me everlasting life to carry out his bidding you shall die just as the people of this valley shall die my curse is at hand for i balzur rule this place and i shall rise again amidst its ashes i have brought fire and death leggett managed a scream but he had not the strength to attempt a futile flight the heat scorched his flesh his clothing smouldered he sank back staring wildly into the encroaching flames but the old man was no longer visible just a shapeless wisp of smoke amidst the inferno he prayed for death but it did not come his body was now ablaze with a hissing sound like wet logs make on a roaring fire strange shapes came and went a host of demons mocking him in his last hour delighting in his pain and terror shrill voices laughter pledge your soul and pluto will grant everlasting life jock leggett wanted to do just that somehow he forced his mouth open but he couldnt find the words his brain numbed and then the full force of the advancing fire was upon him consuming him utterly and passing on chapter youre crazy every bloody one of you the man who had spoken now looked steadily at each of the other eleven men occupying places at the same long table in the largest room of the craiglowrie town hall eyes met his then dropped fingers drummed nervously on the polished mahogany table top somebody coughed an embarrassed silence a match scraped furthermore bob coyle was not one to be deterred by an overwhelming contrasting opinion youre greedy for power how much more do you think this valley can take look whats happened to it remember the town most of us were brought up in sheep grazed the hillsides we lived peacefully happily and we had security look at what weve got now something that could be a thirdclass suburban area of any duty industrial town in britain only worse were living under a cloud of radioactivity one leak and now youre going to let them take the whole of the north end of the valley the rest of it until there isnt a blade of grass or a clump of heather left what about us our children its got to be stopped now before its too late silence again each pair of eyes glancing at bob coyle at thirtyseven he had the physique and appearance of a man ten years younger dark wavy hair reaching down to his collar with scarcely a fleck of grey rugged features inherited from his forefathers the flock masters who had eked a living from the steep windswept slopes of the valley the deep blue eyes that now flashed angrily his clothes too indicated the individualism which he valued so highly never before in the history of town council meetings had sweater and slacks been worn tweed suits were reserved for these occasions sometimes a kilt amongst the more traditional members well coyle was determined to force an answer one way or the other some of them hated him already if not him personally then his newspaper the herald brazenly outspoken almost to the point of libel yet there had never been a legal action against him always there was a glimmering of truth there a spark which produced the wisp of smoke just look what it means to the town said blackmead the butcher staring down at the table almost timidly yes just look snapped coyle angrily a future slum within a decade these cheapjack houses will be falling to bits were overcrowded already and nobody seems to care a damn that just one leak will mean them having to blast these hills into the valley for a mass grave but theyve overcome all that now all that was in the early stages the risks are still there the bigger they make this place the more waste theyll be recycling and the more waste lying about for processing the greater the chances of a leak maybe worse weve gone far enough too far stop it now in the name of humanity another uneasy silence as the councillors glanced at each other and looked away anywhere except at bob coyle er yes well mclellan the planning officer shuffled the papers hi front of him though he knew their contents by heart he made a pretence of studying them again only his bushy moustache disguised the fact that his upper lip was trembling er yes he sorted through the papers again stalling knowing that he would have to support the other councillors and oppose coyle it wasnt so much the man himself he feared but coyles paper the herald a couple of recent clippings were attached to the closelytypewritten sheets he now shuffled like a pack of cards well er we can find no objection to the plans submitted by nuclear fuels and oxide reprocessing none whatsoever he hesitated anticipating another outburst from coyle but there was none so he carried on and as a result i must inform the necessary authorities that they have the approval of this council to proceed with their extensions we must realise gentlemen the significant part we are playing in reducing the countrys unemployment figures at the moment there are over five thousand jobs at the recycling centre three years from now that figure will be doubled perhaps even trebled take the town too businesses have expanded once we relied upon sheep farming and local craft look at the auxiliary industries which this recycling place has brought in we shall be one of the wealthiest towns in the united kingdom we coyle stood up scraping his chair noisily mclellan stopped in midsentence undecided whether to tell the man to sit down or to resume his own seat he did neither his top lip trembled even more violently gentlemen coyles voice was low scarcely more than a whisper but it carried to every corner of that large room please accept my resignation from this council i will confirm this in writing tomorrow in the meantime please understand that everything possible will be done to oppose your diabolical decision my presses are already churning out petition forms and i have every confidence that the townspeople will back me i shall be calling upon the secretary for the environment to hold a fullscale public enquiry the secretary of state for energy has already informed british nuclear fuels that they can go ahead and sign contracts to reprocess even greater quantities of nuclear fuels from abroad it seems that this power game is being played at the highest level my newspaper will play its own part of that i can assure you good day to you gentlemen coyle walked from the room closing the door quietly behind him he descended the long flight of steps which led to the street below and slowly made his way to where his car was parked it was a rusting blue hillman avenger which had seen better days but which was still mechanically sound the town was busy this morning people scurried past him looking neither to right nor left housewives with loaded shopping baskets others heading towards the new bingo hall which had started opening in the early afternoon they were faces that were unfamiliar to him once he would have known almost everybody who walked these streets once people would have stopped him to chat or called out greetings from the other pavement but that had all gone with the coming of this new plutonium industry familiar accents were replaced by dialects he scarcely recognised all the casualness of life had gone to be replaced by this new ratrace and that was just what it was dyne the head of oxide reprocessing and his colleagues they were the pied pipers and everybody hastened to their call like lemmings it took him twenty minutes to drive back to the printing works he could have walked it in a third of the time the old town could not absorb the traffic which the suburban new town had brought with it next time he would walk it next time he laughed bitterly giving vent to his hatred for mclellan another great fat lemming there would be no next time not at the town hall anyway he swung into the printing works and braked to a halt he switched off the engine and just sat there needing a few precious moments of solitude time for a few private thoughts jane sprang first to his mind at thirtysix after nineteen years of marriage and two children she hadnt lost either her looks or her figure yet she had changed that was the trouble and he could not really determine the reason perhaps it was his own fault too much time spent at the office this obsession with plutonium and his efforts to shoulder the responsibilities of a nation maybe it was the kids richard had always been rebellious a hereditary streak perhaps sarah too a mature woman at seventeen and she had to get mixed up with a married man when she had the pick of the best young men in town but this was how it was today the new society the plutonium society of this town perhaps there was something in the atmosphere not so much radiation as a kind of tension that made everybody behave in illogical fashion himself too his thoughts turned to anne at twenty she was capable of running his business entirely on her own whenever he was away from the office perhaps that was why it had all started between them his honest admiration for her at first and her looks and youth did the rest every mans ego is boosted by the attentions of a younger woman better if it could have been confined to an office affair a screw on the carpet after hours but it had gone much deeper than that worse his daughter sarah knew about it that created a kind of stalemate blackmail situation in the household jane guessed something was wrong but he prayed she would never discover the two adulterous affairs within her family god why didnt some guy come on the scene and lay her it might ease his conscience to know that his wife had been unfaithful too damn it it wouldnt though he got out of the car and slammed the door violently hed thrash the bastard beat him till his features were unrecognisable coyle sighed he knew there was still a streak of victoriana in him a man could indulge in extramarital sex but god help a woman indiscreet enough to have a bit on the side he looked round at his premises a rectangle of dilapidated sheds converted crofters barns with patchup jobs on the roofs junk lying everywhere only the small office on the end was new red brick flat roof and large windows anne swivelled her stool round to face him with that same smile never any different her freckles never ceased to fascinate him but he wished she wouldnt always tie up her hair in a ponytail for some reason he did not care for that style maybe it made her look too schoolgirlish although not even the most mature sixthformer would have breasts like annes she was tall but everything about her was so perfectly proportioned tomorrow night he would undo that ponytail and let her long blonde hair fall about her body tantalisingly covering her unblemished flesh until he brushed the strands aside with one of his own fingers then it would all begin well her voice so soft and husky stimulated his loins he often wondered if she knew exactly what she did to him i resigned warned em of the fiery hell that waited for em and told em they could go to it good i thought maybe youd say that how are the petition forms going all printed and ready i sent ronnie into town with a vanload i gave him a list of the guys who will go out and collect the signatures robson jackman doyle enderby and oh yes peterson a hundred forms to each and if we get them all filled with signatures i guess even the secretary of state for energy will have second thoughts about giving the goahead for further contracts what would i do without you he leaned over and their lips met his intention was a peck of gratitude instead they clung fiercely to each other tongues probing each others mouth and her slender fingers located the hardness inside his trousers had not the doorbell sounded in the outerreception area they would probably have made it there and then anne extricated herself from him with a mild curse and coyle admired the way her buttocks wiggled as she walked away from him he went through into his private office a room no larger than the larder in his own house files overflowed and the desk was strewn with correspondence perhaps next week he would get anne in here to clear it all up introduce some kind of system so he would know where everything was he smiled as he realised there wouldnt be any work done at all if he let her in here the cramped conditions would encourage the inevitable it was crazy life would just go on and on until something happened up at oxide reprocessing then it would all come to a stop that would be it finis the culmination of an ageold curse which nobody really believed in he reached into a cupboard beside his desk and drew out a halffull bottle of whisky and a tumbler that could have done with a wash he splashed some of the amber liquid into it and drank half at one gulp he coughed and spluttered he wasnt a drinking man but it eased his feelings already it was beginning to relax him a little soon his thoughts came round to anne again it was always anne nowadays he remembered how it had begun between them a gradual process so gradual that at first neither of them realised they were becoming emotionally involved if she had lived in a flat of her own it would all have been too easy it would have become their secret sex den and possibly the whole affair would have remained purely physical coyles erection started again as he sat there in his office sipping the whisky and staring at the peeling brown wallpaper even this comparatively new extension to the old premises was already in need of redecorating anne lived with her parents a very staid typically scottish couple who would likely suffer a stroke if realisation suddenly dawned that their daughter had actually lost her virginity it hadnt even begun as a result of working late in the office after the rest of the printing staff had gone home it had simply come about through boredom coyle had been taking anne home at night it wasnt much out of his way and he enjoyed the prospect of young female company for a quarter of an hour after a routine day then one summer evening they had driven up on to the moorland above the valley to view the building of the nuclear waste reprocessing plant from above built directly over that place where for some inexplicable reason no grass grew sterile ground the surveyor had shrugged barren rock from which the elements have washed away the topsoil people seemed ready enough to accept that unlikely explanation coyle had taken a camera with him to get a picture for the following weeks herald he could have sent ross the official photographer but instead had suggested to anne that they go and view for themselves the new ugliness creeping into the valley coyle had taken his photographs and then on impulse he persuaded anne to let him snap her too coyly she had agreed she had been wearing a thin nylon blouse and a short skirt which had obligingly lifted in the breeze as he pressed the button nothing else had happened between them he had not even kissed her during the drive back his hand had brushed hers but she had not responded coyle developed and printed those pictures himself those intended for publication he handed over to ross whose wry expression soundlessly criticised his bosss talents but the one of anne he hid in his wallet and studied later that evening when jane was out at the local branch of the scottish womens rural institute somehow so much more had come out in the photograph he could detect the firmness of her nipples through the scanty blouse and bra and the almost transparent underwear beneath the lifted skirt showed an exciting dark v when jane coyle returned home shortly after eleven oclock she was mildly surprised at the eager man who shared her bed her weekly swri meeting had not offered its usual pleasantries and a petty quarrel with mrs macgregor had not improved the migraine which had been hovering in the background throughout the day she had gently pushed her husbands hands from her bosom and removed them more roughly from her lower regions her obvious revulsion had been a turningpoint in their already waning sexual relationship the following day coyle had asked anne if she would care to go out for an evening meal with him she had accepted readily and innocently even telephoning her parents who were flattered to think that the proprietor of the herald had seen fit to reward their daughter thus for her efficiency coyle had also telephoned his wife and told her he would be home late due to an article he was preparing jane had not even expressed regret after the meal they had driven up to that very same place from which coyle had taken the photographs less than a week ago the moorland was deserted silent except for the lonely call of a nesting curlew a threequarter moon showed coyle everything he wanted to see a radiantly lovely young girl in silhouette at his side the legend of balzur was pushed from his mind he had asked if he could undo her ponytail and see her with her hair down she had agreed giggling usually her parents let her drink only at hogmanay and then but sparingly tonight she had enjoyed a sherry before the meal wine with it then a couple of brandies and she even thought it was a great joke when he undid her dress and loosened her bra those nipples were as large and firm as coyle had expected she giggled again when he felt up her skirt and squeezed a couple of fingers between the tightfitting elastic of her pants they began kissing she clearly had never had a tongue thrust into her mouth before but she liked it ah the time he rubbed with his exploring fingers then used his free hand to guide her fingers on to the hard bulge in his trousers five minutes later she was shuddering violently clutching at him sobbing and then she was sober again and asking to be taken home he wondered if she would turn up at the office next morning and his stomach muscles grew taut when at ten minutes past nine there was still no sign of her at twentyfive past he sighed with relief as she came trotting in and later he could have shouted his joy to the whole world when amidst blushes and stammers she thanked him for a wonderful evening so he had asked her out again it required more ingenuity this time in order to allay any suspicions growing in the minds of her parents he admired her for the convincing manner in which she lied to them over the telephone about going to the cinema with margaret from the typesetting department had annes parents known margaret they would have been far more concerned for margaret was a selfconfessed lesbian jane had not appeared the least concerned that bob coyle would be home late recently he had the impression that she preferred to have the house to herself in the evenings if she suspected he had taken a mistress she did not seem to care coyle drove out to that same place again there did not seem any reason to go elsewhere by this time surely anne was fully aware of his intentions the fact that she lifted herself up so that he could slide her pants down confirmed this she was only too eager to clamber over on to the more spacious back seat that was how it had all begun coyle drained the last of his whisky his gaze still fixed on the wallpaper only dimly aware that he had an erection he pondered over the problems involved in divorcing jane she certainly did not want him sexually nowadays yet anne had never once suggested a breakup of his marriage his greatest fear was that one day she would find herself a boyfriend a younger man acceptable to her parents who had a damned sight more to offer her than a married newspaperman fast approaching middleage sometimes he contemplated getting her pregnant he wondered what she would do if that happened she would either have to demand a secure relationship or an abortion maybe he ought to try it and see at least he would know where he stood plutonium was to blame he crushed the empty glass fiercely between his fingers pluto and balzur bob he started unaware that the office door had opened and anne stood there smiling her gaze focused on the protrusion in his trousers sorry i was miles away he swung his feet to the floor and she advanced on him perching delicately on his knee one arm around his neck the fingers of the other starting to caress his hardness almost immediately i trust you were thinking about me her eyebrows were raised mockingly i was he admitted truthfully i was just thinking about how it all happened how we got together and how youve been transformed from a sweet little innocent teenager into the most beautiful sexually desirable woman imaginable and your journalistic training enables you to put it all so delightfully into words she continued to stroke him thats something which an awful lot of women miss out on you havent forgotten were going out tomorrow night i can hardly wait perhaps your wife will oblige you tonight i shant ask her oh by the way winston dyne rang while you were out he was a bit shirty he didnt like your article in last weeks edition the reference to the balzur legend and the link between pluto and plutonium he says youre playing on sensationalism which could have a detrimental psychological effect on the people of this town he wants to see you so ive arranged for you to be up there at ten in the morning darling coyle craned his neck up so that their lips brushed you are britains numberone secretary most definitely twice over the past few months i have been refused an interview with dyne barbed wire armed guards and christ knows what else and now im actually going inside the devils stronghold itself and it took you to fix it hes having your pass delivered here later today she purred my bobs making quite a name for himself isnt he even the boffins are sitting up and taking notice of him trying to shut me up you mean he laughed and stiffened as he felt his zip being slowly pulled down wed better lock the door he signed chapter coyle experienced an acute sense of uneasiness as he eased his foot off the avengers accelerator some twenty yards from the huge twentyfoothigh steelbarred barrier an elevated enclosed platform was strategically positioned above the entrance to the nuclear waste disposal and recycling centre he noticed a face behind a small aperture eyes that watched him unwaveringly without a doubt the man was holding a rifle possibly a submachinegun with his thumb positioned on the safetycatch the avenger rolled forward until it was barely five yards from the checkpoint a sentrybox stood to the right outside the barbedwire fencing coyle wound the window down and held up the green card so that it was visible to the man on checkpoint the newspaperman cursed beneath his breath more to boost his own morale than from anger all part of the process he decided another berlin wall playing on my nerves or trying to he pitied the workers who had to pass to and fro daily just like a siberian labour camp perhaps both these guys watching him from their sentry positions had read his article in last weeks herald maybe dyne had had it distributed amongst the men this is the guy who is starting all the rumours using a legend to help cause mass hysteria give him the treatment one visit and he wont want to come back again no that wasnt right it would all get in the paper and that wouldnt be good publicity nevertheless nobody was in a hurry coyle lit a cigarette carefully and deliberately nonchalantly tossing the spent match in the direction of the lower checkpoint he was genuinely angry now and felt like sounding his horn or calling out hey you instead he flicked cigarette ash into the wind and wished that a spark would hit this gateway dictator in the eye at last the man advanced slowly towards him he was heavily built a tightlybuttoned uniform holding back rolls of fat slav features too or was that his imagination just plain flatfaced and ugly he carried a revolver in a holster the flaptype which prevented a fast draw coyle guessed that in the event of trouble the upper man would do the shooting the guard held out his hand for the pass cole handed it over intending to meet his gaze but the other seemed interested only in the writing on the thin card he certainly took his time over it and coyle considered perhaps the fellow was illiterate but again decided it was all part of the demoralising process neither spoke and there was no need to everything was written on that pass name date reason for visit time of admittance the big man glanced at his watch the card stated am it was now he handed the card back and returned to his post without a word everything had been conducted in total silence not even a grunt coyle revved up his engine expecting the gates to open automatically nothing happened he was on the point of attracting the mans attention again when he noticed the hands of his wristwatch am at the gates swung back smoothly and he drove slowly through a black tarmac track headed directly across the red shale compound towards the giant towers with mph speedlimit signs spaced at intervals of a hundred yards several hundred cars were parked diagonally to his right obviously belonging to the local labourforce he kept going until he reached the second barrier here the uniformed atomic energy authority policeman almost smiled almost coyle had the impression that the man nearly forgot his orders and then remembered them just in time again the revolver was worn in a covered holster but the flap was undone the man took the green card read it through minutely and then pointed in the direction of a squat onestoried building standing on its own beside what were obviously offices and laboratories park over there sir the man on duty will escort you to the hors office coyle did as directed the uniformed officer inside the glass doors watched him closely as he climbed out of his car and with a touch of irony coyle carefully locked the avenger and pocketed the keys two can play at this security game he grinned to himself as he ground out the cigarette with his heel again a silent escort down one corridor past numerous doors a left turn then a right then another left all the time coyle was conscious of buzzing activity a murmuring of voices whirring machinery but not once did he sight another human being there was a hushed reverence within the place such as one might find within a cathedral he glanced at the man by his side but he was staring straight ahead without expression they halted and the policeman knocked softly upon the door immediately before them from a highly polished plaque coyle noted what the initials hor stood for head of oxide reprocessing winston dyne come in coyle stepped forward on to a lush carpet the door closed behind him and he was face to face with winston dyne for the first time the man behind the large mahogany desk was reclining in a plush tallbacked chair and he made no effort to rise or extend the customary hand coyle was instantly reminded of the times he had been summoned before the headmaster of his school for a sharp six of the best you stood meekly with your hands clasped behind your back repentance and fear in your expression with an effort he pulled himself together he had hated every minute of that publicschool life for which his parents had made stupid sacrifices the system was the same here come and have your arse walloped you naughty boy and promise faithfully that you will not err again not bloody likely coyle relaxed mind if i take a seat he reached out and drew a threelegged plasticcovered chair towards him my feet are hurting like hell after that routemarch down your maze of corridors sit down the authoritative tone in dynes voice made it an order rather than an invitation they regarded each other steadily for half a minute of silence dyne was stroking his heavy moustache his aquiline features never once giving a hint of his innermost thoughts i read that article in the latest edition of your trashy weekly he said at last the annoyance unveiled i would term it sensational libellousness the object being to instil fear into the townspeople and to disrupt something which is vital to the economy of this country your reference to the legend of craiglowrie is preposterous and many of your facts are totally inaccurate sue me then it would not be worthwhile your bankruptcy would hardly benefit the plutonium economy if i had my way coyle every known communist would be deported back to the country where his sympathies lie your place is in the saltmines of siberia along with a good many other traitors today the value of the pound dropped again overseas confidence is waning faster than ever before and even the oil flowing from the north sea seems incapable of restoring it plutonium is britains last hope our very last hope extracts from your article appeared in certain national dailies i would even assume you personally sent them the copy you are a saboteur coyle and i wish you could be arrested and put on trial as such and since i cant coyle smiled just how do you intend to shut me up have me murdered inside this place and dispose of my body in a bath of sulphuric acid a flicker of unease appeared in dynes expression but was instantly replaced by a wan smile you could make your fortune writing sciencefiction thrillers coyle he said and your energy and talents would be far better spent in that field however my motive in summoning you inviting me coyle interrupted as you wish dynes features hardened my motive is to explain to you the whole process of the disposal and recycling of nuclear waste the complete facts will be put before you and you may take notes if you wish it is my hope that the lead article in the next edition of your newspaper will convey the true facts to the public and thereby dispel any alarm you have generated by the balderdash already printed and another thing neither myself nor my colleagues appreciate the nickname you have given to this place it seems to have caught on as nicknames so very often do and was even mentioned on the national news on both television channels last night holocaust is a word that sums up unholy terror fire wholesale death and destruction and is therefore entirely inappropriate here this is an entirely civilised concern judging by the way your guards received me at both checkpoints im not so sure about that lets dispense with this flippancy with supreme effort dyne controlled his rising anger now firstly id like to explain to you the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel in powerstations such as this there is no doubt that plutonium is the fuel of the future and as such we have no right to ignore its potential those who actually work on it are in complete agreement there have been dangers in the past certainly but we are fully confident that these have now been overcome greater national prosperity is assured in this valley alone over five thousand jobs have been created and in a few years time we know all this crap coyle broke in harshly weve had it shoved down our throats since they first started to build this place just give me the true scientific facts concerning plutonium and oxide dyne otherwise ive work to do back at my office very well most of the basic facts have been revealed on television or in the newspapers many inaccurately so for your benefit i will begin with the elementary stages this nuclear waste disposal and recycling centre has been built in this valley because a twofold purpose can be served with planning permission granted for an extension over another few hundred acres it will be opposed that is not my concern and please do not interrupt at windscale they had the added inconvenience and risk of transporting lowlevel waste elsewhere for disposal here with the additional ground which we have acquired it can all be dealt with inside the centre a compact unit if you understand me but let me explain the functions of plutonium to you one gram of plutonium produces as much electricity as three tons of coal imagine the labour and haulage saving and the closure of ninetenths of the collieries in the united kingdom the num wont like that as we are all aware dyne ignored coyles interruption plutonium is the material from which atom bombs are made it is highly radioactive and should you inhale it the consequences would be dire however safety precautions have never been more efficient british nuclear fuels at this present time require plutonium for the prototype reactor at dounreay we here are hi the final stages of constructing our own prototype reactor again you see a complete selfsufficient unit the first plutonium was manufactured here a comparatively short time ago i witnessed the experiment myself it is a greencoloured liquid and currently we are producing a number of kilograms per day dyne carefully avoided quoting figures that might appear in either coyles paper or in the national press eventually those kilograms will become tons then tens of tons when we are finally using the full resources at our disposal it takes less than ten kilograms to make an atom bomb a device that would be little greater in size than a coconut world figures quote something like three thousand tons of plutonium in existence of course we shall never have anything like that quantity here coyle almost laughed out loud but held himself in check plutonium is manmade produced by human ingenuity dyne leaned back in his chair smoothing his moustache with his long nicotinestained fingers the beginnings of a selfsatisfied smile on his face much responsibility had been placed on his shoulders lately whenever the opportunity arose to take credit for something he seized it eagerly perhaps this newspaperman might see the light and give him a personal boost in his columns thats something that nature in all her greatness overlooked dyne lit a cigarette without offering the packet to the man seated opposite to him so far it has only been produced for the bombs and rockets in our nuclear armoury and it can be argued that plutonium has ensured our safety from a military point of view now it can also serve our national energy needs and put the economy back on a sound footing we have unlimited potential energy at our disposal and the risks which the press constantly exaggerates for the man in the street are but a small consideration plutonium will soon be used to power nuclear stations throughout the country we are entering a new era fair enough coyle lit one of his own cigarettes but now lets get on to this business of nuclear waste thats what i want to know about of course the other smiled with an air of contained patience the spent nuclear fuel will be dealt with in our own plant here which will be constructed surprisingly quickly as you will learn from it we shall produce uranium which will also be invaluable let us consider our present atomic power stations where the spent radioactive fuel is stored in tanks under water this spent fuel is transported to a reprocessing plant to be broken down we obtain our vital plutonium but we now have a highly radioactive plutonium waste which will be dangerous for thousands of years to come our new plant here will deal safely with this substance known as oxide oxide is an extremely dangerous material but the risks here will be minimal nonexistent in fact our nuclear laundry for want of a better term will be the first in the world to operate on a fully commercial scale and the fuel can be stored almost indefinitely if its as safe as all that why dont these other countries reprocess it themselves instead of paying us to do their dirty work for them simply because they do not have the technology and the resources which we have in this very place the japanese are well aware of the perils we can combat these dangers and it would be a sad day for our economy if they decided to do it for themselves indeed windscale will be obsolete once this place is operating fully there they have been reprocessing japanese waste since on a very limited scale compared to that which we shall be capable of in all they have dealt with something like a thousand tons of old fuel from foreign countries half as much again as has been reprocessed from solely british power stations we can double even treble that amount in half the time look at their antiquated system the fuel containers arrive on a singletrack railway the first reprocessed nuclear fuel is stored in ponds eighteen feet deep these ponds are now filled to overflowing now that does represent a hazard the longer the fuel remains there the greater the difficulty of reprocessing and the greater the danger improved reprocessing facilities are needed we shall provide them here a completely different reprocessing plant to deal with the more radioactive oxide fuel it is a wellknown fact that windscales pilot oxide plant ran into trouble we have learnt from their mistakes there were reports of an accident there in which resulted in the plant being shut down in the contaminated area was still sealed off i am confident that i know what went wrong in effect the plant broke down but the dangers were greatly exaggerated by the media it was an old military plant which had been renovated case of putting a highly radiated fuel into something totally inadequate for the purpose i am more than confident that our new plant will be adequate take american nuclear fuel services as another example of failure the west valley reprocessing plant was never able to operate on a commercial scale it lost money instead of making it it too was closed down in because it was too radioactive to work in the cost of closing down the plant and clearing up the remaining waste is already running into millions of dollars good money thrown after bad all the waste had to be solidified before it could be removed at a cost of million dollars the burial ground for the solidified waste had to be made one hundred per cent safe at an estimated cost of a further billion dollars waste products at windscale too present a major problem fortunately british nuclear fuels have learnt how to cope with oxide reprocessing something which no other country in the world has so far achieved that reprocessing system will be transferred here but on a scale of greater magnitude more reprocessing means more nuclear waste and this waste will remain radioactive for something like a quarter of a million years lorries leave windscale daily carrying sealed containers of lowlevel nuclear waste this stuff is not highly dangerous just dangerous mostly these containers are filled with gloves clothing etc which have been in contact with contamination and are transported to britains burial ground its a somewhat haphazard operation the lorries not being escorted en route but simply checked at their destination in time this burial ground will become a forgotten tract of derelict ground the lowlevel waste buried deep beneath it perhaps foolishly houses will be built upon it windscale also deposits lowlevel liquid waste into the sea something like five hundred thousand litres every day of course radioactive levels are kept strictly within the permitted limits but the risk is still there a few miles south lies the ravenglass estuary and this waste is being washed back by the currents on the seabed the plutonium is being picked up by fish and that plutonium will still retain its radioactivity in a quarter of a million years time bear this in mind coyle next time you eat fish and chips mankinds food is being polluted at a time when not enough is known about plutonium waste therefore how can the level of radioactivity which goes into the irish sea be contained especially when even more waste is still being deposited into it radioactivity therefore can only increase and the original intention of those at windscale is to ensure that the radioactivity discharged into the environment does not increase so per cent of the radioactivity remains in the works and does not enter the environment our concern is that remaining per cent at windscale the bulk of that per cent radioactive waste is stored behind feetthick walls seven hundred cubic metres still seething with radioactivity the tanks which contain these poisonous liquids are stainless steel and more tanks are now being built to take waste which has been accumulating for a quarter of a century here though in this place which you have chosen to call holocaust some further one hundred tanks will be constructed the liquids inside these tanks are so radioactive that they would burn if it were not for the cooling systems there will be seven separate systems in each tank in january one of the tanks at windscale sprang a radioactive leak and as a result the system had to be shut down highactive waste is still accumulating at windscale simply because they have been unable to dispose of it we have that method of disposal and much of it will be transferred here a technique for turning the liquid into glass has some promise of success already we have achieved it experimentally and soon it will be done on a commercial scale we believe that we shall be able to solidify radioactive liquids and once they can be turned into cylinders or blocks of glass on a commercial scale then we have here the means to dispose of them safety consequently the need to acquire the remaining part of this valley is paramount britains hazardous materials group has been searching for such a place a last resting place for britains highactive nuclear waste for a long time now i cannot overemphasise the urgency it is incredible that the very place has been discovered in such close proximity to our latest reprocessing plant granite coyle is the answer we shall bury this waste in the granite of this very valley at least a thousand feet below ground level to ensure that no changes in the earths crust will disturb it a last resting place and with no danger to mankind that is why we cannot allow anyone to stand in our way coyle drew deeply on the last half inch of his cigarette leaned over and stubbed out the butt in dynes ashtray very convincing he murmured but it does not nullify the dangers involved before this waste is actually committed to its grave the risks are minimal like sitting permanently on top of a few hundred atom bombs trying to lead a normal life and all the time hoping that we wont be blown to kingdomcome again you are resorting to sensationalism im being practical it is not practical to imperil the countrys economy particularly in these times another thing natures fuel supplies will run out one day you dont think north sea oil will last forever do you one mistake here and itll all be lost in one mighty whoosh you cant get away from the fact that this could be the biggest nuclear blowup in history and thats when history comes to a stop in theory but not in practice a fresh edge of annoyance was creeping into winston dynes tone the schoolmaster having his facts queried by a raw pupil and theres something else coyle exhaled cigarette smoke slowly suppose a foreign power got in here terrorists even they could hold the whole world to ransom not a chance a barbedwire fence and a few armed police i can assure you that there is greater defence indepth than youve ever dreamed of security here is top priority id appreciate a tour of your domain just to satisfy im afraid that is quite out of the question the head of oxide reprocessing replied abruptly our defences are not open to inspection and so the public are asked to resort to blind faith coyles eyes narrowed i am supposed to report the facts of this interview but when i add that i was refused permission to view the security arrangements the inference is that they are frail a sop to satisfy the fears of those who and you instigated these fears dyne pointed a forefinger accusingly at the newspaperman and you resorted to ridiculous legend to accelerate the terror did i coyles eyebrows were raised let me point out a few facts for your benefit thirty thousand people marched on a nuclear power station near hamburg to protest about a waste recycling process fifty people were injured in the riot which resulted in sweden japan and west germany similar plans are being met with protest so we agree to do all their dirty washing for them and yet dyne spoke with a note of triumph ka meeting in trafalgar square organised by someone like yourself attracted a mere one hundred and fifty people from that one can only draw the conclusion that the british people are happy for us to strengthen our economy with the aid of plutonium the goahead for the new oxide fuels is worth five hundred million pounds to this country we cannot allow it to be sabotaged by cranks like yourself it is a deal with the devil coyle rose to his feet in america the nuclear regulator commission is attempting to determine the full implications of nuclear reprocessing until new guidelines have been laid down no nuclear reprocessing in the usa will be allowed to operate on a commercial basis they no longer regard reprocessing as inevitable and preventing proliferation of nuclear material must take precedence over economic benefits the president has called for a worldwide standstill on the building of reprocessing plants until international controls are worked out yet britain apparently is blatantly ignoring this all countries with reprocessing facilities will automatically become atomic powers just think of the implications every new reprocessing plant is a potential trigger for a nuclear war and just what do you intend to do about it mr coyle dynes features hardened i shall emphasise the dangers of holocaust even more strongly in my paper coyle snapped i shall continue to warn people of this town and hope that the other media will support me im already organising a petition any large technological development of a hazardous potential should be under the control of an international authority i shall press the secretary for the environment to hasten a fullscale public enquiry you have an inflated opinion of yourself mr coyle winston dyne sneered youre attempting to prove that one man is mightier than the system you are fighting a lost cause and your foolishness will be apparent in a very short time it is clear that this interview has been a waste of both my time and yours as for this newspaper of yours well i advise you to tread carefully the freedom of the press is not quite what it was a decade ago good day to you mr coyle coyle turned away abruptly and saw that the door was already opening in anticipation of his exit the armed policeman motioning him back down the maze of featureless corridors chapter well anne looked up from her typewriter as bob coyle strode into the office allowing the outer reception door to slam noisily behind him he nodded to her but there was no hint of a smile on his rugged features the clock on the far wall showed the time as pm he had been gone five hours well at least we know where we stand now he flung his briefcase angrily into the corner both with this lunatic town council and these other ruthless bastards get me a couple of calls through will you please firstly to the secretary for the environment or as high up as you can get there secondly i want a word with the radiological protection board again as far up the ladder as is possible she consulted some telephone directories and began dialling he went through to his private office to take the calls it was ten minutes before bob coyle reappeared in the general office his expression had not softened if anything he was more tightlipped than ever anne looked up but did not speak the energy department were rather abrupt to say the least he said they pointed out that they were well aware of all the aspects relating to the harvest process as they officially term the new method of disposing of nuclear waste they promised to convey my concern to the secretary of state for energy himself a lot of good that will do the girl concerned has probably already forgotten about it and the radiological protection board theyre already looking into it he shook his head weve got a real fight on our hands now anne it could be youre wrong and nothing whatever will happen surely the radiological protection board will investigate every detail take steps to ensure that there cannot possibly be a leak i have no faith in officialdom he sighed its just another form of nationalisation everything botched up under a cloud of false efficiency one big con and i dont see that this is going to be one little bit different all that worries me is when a year two five ten who knows well fight them though wont we we tm with you all the way bob no matter what he leaned over and kissed her their tongues entwining briefly she sensed his gratitude and pulled him closer only one thing worries me though she murmured at last how long before your wife finds out about us or your parents that would be a minor catastrophe they would be shocked disgusted but there would be no repercussions from my end but what if jane got to know what would happen bob what would you do i dont know he admitted frankly but i wouldnt want to give you up at any price i couldnt im glad she sighed deeply but you may be faced with a choice i know whom id choose darling but i dont think itll come to that not yet anyway he noted a flash of disappointment on her face and regretted his words instantly what i mean is well weve time to get things sorted out us i mean not this damned plutonium business god knows if anybody will ever sort that out until its too late its an odd time to start discussing our future she blushed slightly something which she rarely did these days but well i suppose its the thought that we may all be blown to kingdomcome thats made me think about it more deeply i mean we dont spend much time together do we once maybe twice a week she has you every night even if you dont do anything we havent made love for over two months now he admitted and she knew he spoke the truth i used to wonder if she was going into the change prematurely but its just that her sexual desires have gone otherwise she performs the usual marital duties without complaining cooking washing cleaning and the children well they arent children any more are they richards nineteen sarahs seventeen and theyve made it quite plain that they dont need either of us it doesnt make it any easier for me to have both of them working up at the nuclear centre either theyre just plain rebellious or else dyne and co have done a firstclass brainwashing job dads just a trouble maker they think a silly bugger trying to stir up trouble in a lot of ways im glad i dont see much of them that doesnt sound very good coming from a father does it its sarah that worries me most though you mean her affair with houston he nodded that would really crucify jane if she got to know far worse than if she found out about us sarah knows about you and me of course a sort of family blackmail mind your own business dad or else ill let on to mum about you and anne you dirty bugger a man of your age carrying on with a young girl damn it houstons only five years younger than i am hes got three young children and thats what makes it one hell of a lot worse he only wants her for one thing thank christ shes on the pill maybe itll fizzle out i just pray that hell lose interest in her nothing i can do anyway richard knows about both her and me weve never been very close he hit me once he was sixteen at the time i could have killed him that was when the real breach started between us he hates my guts sometimes i wish i could return the compliment but it doesnt work out that way hes still seeing that lakin girl i saw them together in town the other night shes a right slut thats putting it mildly she came down here from aberdeen and her reputation wasnt long in following her ive heard it said that she was making a hundred quid a week out of the oilriggers i slave my guts out to earn that she did it easily just lying on her back with her legs open and now she has to come down here and latch on to my son maybe its as well i resigned from the council you cant be held responsible for what your kids do when they grow up these things sort themselves out like well have to he shook his head sadly i couldnt do without you anne not now you wont have to she kissed him again i dont need to guess the contents of next weeks lead article do i ill knock it out tomorrow his expression became grim the toughest yet ill phone kent too and get it in the dailies as well the people of this country will have been warned in the gravest possible terms after that its up to them but you know how lethargic the british people are a sort of itllneverhappentous attitude the evening meal was already in progress when bob coyle walked into his semidetached house on the outskirts of the old town richard looked up his mouth full his greasy unkempt hair straggling around his shoulders he had not even bothered to change out of his overalls coyles thoughts momentarily dwelled on the protective clothing his son would have worn during the day no doubt it was already on its way somewhere as lowlevel waste theneyes met recognition but no greeting scorn from a son who knew his father would terminate his source of employment if it was within his power coyle looked over at sarah her petite figure was clad in a brightgreen trousersuit which showed off everything to perfection no doubt houston had bought it for her short dark hair perfectly groomed obviously she had been to the hairdressing salon that afternoon another favour from houston perfectly moulded features lips that almost smiled almost he read her expression only too clearly contempt for an adulterous father he wished he could reciprocate with a similar feeling but he sensed only regret your dinners in the oven ill fetch it for you coyles gaze moved to jane as she rose and crossed towards the oven even her apron could not hide her still shapely figure coyle took his place at the head of the table and began to eat mechanically he wasnt hungry but it was something to do in an atmosphere heavy with family discord enjoy your trip up to our place today richard sneered coyle paused his fork halfway to his mouth the omission of dad made the question seem all the more insolent it was just business he replied slowly and filled his mouth with curry maybe youll get your facts right in this weeks article richard cleaned his plate with a chunk of bread but did not raise his eyes or are you going to invent some more crazy legends the town now has its very own comic paper sarah added why cant we have it all in cartoonstrip form dad something like the beano or dandy or maybe even a sciencefiction thriller you know dennis wheatley style balzur will come again to take vengeance on the offspring of those who burned him at the stake both of them laughed sarcastically only janes face was grave i think the whole subject is better not discussed at the table she rapped your fathers work is his own concern and we shouldnt be talking shop at mealtimes shop richard scraped his chair back dads the laughing stock of our place the trouble is hes a bad joke anyway im going out i cant stop here with this drivellish conversation dont you think you should change your clothes before you go out jane asked nervously trying to exert her declining authority in the household richard did not reply nor did he look at either of his parents as he opened the door then slammed it behind him seconds later they heard the roar of his motorcycle sarah left the table and went upstairs she came down a few minutes later wearing a three quarterlength coat which matched her trousersuit her cheeks were flushed embarrassment and guilt coyle decided she was fully aware that her father knew she was going back into town to get herself screwed this fatherdaughter blackmail pact was becoming unnerving for both of them as jane began to clear the dishes away bob lit a cigarette she was drying the first of the dishes before she spoke its plain enough what your children think of you isnt it the laughingstock of the nuclear station the newspaperman attempting to create sensationalism at pulp literature level so youve been up there today have you aware yet that your imagination has been running riot no he tilted his chair backwards in fact ive convinced myself that were sitting right on top of the most devilish bomb ever conceived by mankind one that could blow us to hell without warning theyre distributing circulars in town petition forms scruffy youths handing them out in the streets i see theyre printed and distributed by the herald youre going too far bob the whole thing has been fully explained on television and in the newspapers and youre deliberately setting yourself up against the greatest scientists technologists and politicians in the world waging a oneman war against this place you call holocaust people are looking at me in the streets my friends are sniggering behind my back i cant stand it any longer and all that nonsense you wrote about pluto has made a mockery of the whole thing yourself particularly coyle remained silent and lit another cigarette already he had presented his own arguments too many times in these last few weeks and if his own wife would not support him there was no point in going all over that same ground again he was only glad he had anne neither of them spoke again until they adjourned to the next room usually jane switched on the television and coyle hoped she would do that now instead she flung herself into an armchair as if exhausted that meant that there was a discussion in the offing an argument he sighed and braced himself bob theres something else i want to talk to you about her words jarred him he felt his stomach muscles contracting always the unexpected that was typical of a woman maybe sarah had told on him a sort of twisted revenge for all that he had printed about her employers its about richard coyle tried not to show his relief too visibly what about him hes seeing a girl i dont know her first name but mrs bean told me about her the family live not far from here lakins her name oh bob shes a shes a prostitute nonsense he didnt make it sound very convincing its true mrs bean is no gossip shes been worrying herself stiff for a fortnight wondering whether or not to tell me bob what are we going to do its your responsibility you must talk to him man to man suddenly coyle felt very angry always confrontations did nobody ever get anywhere in this life without direct conflict richards old enough to look after himself every man has to gain experience somewhere thats just what hes doing now but shes a prostitute its only hearsay vicious gossip mrs bean isnt a gossip well maybe shes mistaken anyway he hasnt announced his engagement to this whore has he but jane blushed deeply hell be having relationships with her you mean hes fucking her bob threw every vestige of cruelty he could muster into those words never before had he used a fourletter word in front of his wife well it was his intention to shock her you you what i said hes fucking her and apart from the social stigma involved your main concern is that he might get a dose of the clap jane sank back into her chair horrified speechless then youre not going to do anything about it she murmured her face white theres nothing i can do hell have to find out all about it for himself he wished she would switch on the television instead they just sat there in silence not even looking at each other at eleven oclock she made two cups of coffee and they drank them in silence half an hour later they made ready for bed there was no sign of either richard or sarah but that was only to be expected their daughter would creep in some hours later closing the door softly behind her leaving her shoes down in the hall richard however would come in noisily rattling crockery in the kitchen as he made himself a snack and then stamping up to his room in his heavy boots even then the nocturnal noises would not be finished taps ran unnecessarily the toilet was flushed and sometimes he even put his record player on by the time they climbed into bed bob coyle was convinced that the conversation of earlier was finished he put out the light and rested his head on the pillow his thoughts were a kaleidoscope of recent happenings and meetings balzurs curse the nuclear disposal dyne anne richard sarah and then without any warning jane groped for him he was too astounded either to resist or to cooperate her fingers rumbled their way inside his pyjama trousers sought and found his limpness it began to stiffen and pulse a vision of anne crossed his mind and he shuddered with betrayal jane mistook it for passion she rubbed him more swiftly more sensuously her face moving close to his her lips warm and demanding the first time for two months and it was too late to turn back why oh god why did she have to complicate everything maybe it was the fourletter word he had used which had aroused a slumbering eroticism within her his emotions were in a turmoil he lay immobile shocked her free hand began undoing the buttons of his pyjama jacket loosening the cord around his waist and pulling the trousers down he did not raise his body to cooperate but that made no difference she exerted all her strength and soon his loins were bared the bedclothes were thrown back a sudden rustling of nylon and he knew that she was naked at least the light was out otherwise she would surely have noticed the expression on his face not exactly revulsion but perplexity and unwillingness he felt her clambering astride him her thigh muscles pressing against him trapping him then the engulfing warmth as she claimed him she was breathing more heavily than he was guiding his hands up to her breasts wanting him demanding him i love you bob she murmured he should have replied but the lie would not come even in his own bed the marital bed the events within this valley would not allow him to escape do you love me bob the question he had been dreading yes the lie came at last unconvincingly but she appeared not to notice its as though she paused rocking herself softly to and fro on him almost as though theres been a barrier between us for these last few months its been the tension this whole nuclear business its been like like another woman coming between us i should have tried to understand you and admired you for what you were trying to do well i want you to know something no matter whos against you even if the whole town my own friends ostracise me im with you all the way and richard can look after himself he closed his eyes tightly aware of the taste of blood on his lower lip his fingers squeezed her breasts and then everything was blasted into oblivion with the shuddering force of his orgasm at first the long night hours passed slowly coyle heard his wifes contented shallow breathing as she slept he envied her as he tossed restlessly his nakedness buffeting her but not disturbing her he pitied her for she believed her long mental struggle was over and that she had triumphed but for him events were rising fast towards a crescendo later that night he dreamed of a valley engulfed in flames buildings and hillsides an inferno and in the sky the mushroomshaped smoke pall gradually taking the shape of a human head a face that was dark and evil its lips muttering a silent curse on mankind widening into a grin of triumph festering and oozing pus bob coyle awoke in the blackness of night his trembling body soaked with sweat his mouth dry he tried to recall that face it had been oddly familiar as though someone he knew or had met just recently but his memory failed hun and finally he drifted back into uneasy sleep he wakened sometime after daybreak recalling only snatches of that fiery nightmare he tried to visualise that face in the smoke but it was gone as surely as if dispersed in the wind but it left a lingering torturing reminder something he should have known a sinister warning snatched away from him next time it came it could be reality and too late sarah coyle struggled into her clothes in the cramped back seat of the cortina her tall rangy male companion was already dressed his dexterity amazed her the rapidity with which he always dressed even to the perfect windsor knot in his tie a flick of a comb and his blond hair was as neat as ever she cursed him silently as she struggled to groom herself with the aid of a small driving mirror and the interior light which he was reluctant to switch on always scared in case some passerby recognised them in the layby on the outskirts of town damn him he was only too eager to get her clothes off but now that she had satisfied him he was content to sit there smoking a cigarette and watch her struggle to dress herself occasionally clicking his tongue in annoyance at her slowness almost unwillingly he assisted her with a zip damn it youre only going home to bed he muttered she did not bother to explain for the hundredth time that there was always the chance that her parents might not have gone to bed early no girl relishes returning to the parental nest in the early hours of the morning with evidence of illicit sexual encounters evident on her person anyway i thought you were going to get a flat of your own and move out he helped her over into the front passenger seat im still thinking about it it cant be much fun living with a family like yours your dad still has this obsession about a radioactive leak does he ever talk about anything else except trying to close down holocaust i dont take any notice now well you ought to if that place closed down youd be out of a job still i suppose hed find you one at the herald you seem more worried about his efforts than he is itd effect my livelihood probably kill off my business altogether a few years ago i was living at subsistencelevel out of one small hardware shop somebodys floorboards came loose so i sold them half a pound of nails then the workers flocked into the new station ive now got three shops i employ a dozen people if your dad had his way id be back to relying on the sale of a few nails and screws for my living see what i mean you really hate my dad dont you no more than a lot of other tradesmen like mclellan and the rest of the council not him personally just what hes trying to do if it wasnt for him you wouldnt get what youve had off me tonight would you or maybe some other girl would serve just as well dont be silly he slipped an arm around her but she drew back turning her head to avoid his lips dont start being bloody stupid tm not but all we ever do is screw on the back seat of your bloody car twice in the last month youve taken me for a drink eating out seems to have gone by the board or are you afraid somebody will see us together in a restaurant the anger and sarcasm was building up in her voice and what about this divorce you havent mentioned that lately either seems to me youre getting the best of both worlds david well youd better sort something out and come up with a solution i bought you that new outfit last week he muttered sullenly gee thanks sugar daddy she turned her head away towards the window youre turning me into a bloody prostitute now id sooner do it for hard cash he let in the clutch angrily and slammed the gears ten minutes later they were parked a hundred yards from the coyle house the engine ticking over im sorry he managed successfully this time to put his arm around her her lips met his even though they were unresponsive get something worked out then she snapped ok he squeezed her arm i will i promise but dont forget one thing your old man is knocking off that bird in his office it wouldnt do for that to get around town would it sarah coyle was sobbing quietly to herself as she let herself in the house and crept up the stairs richard coyle stubbed out his cigarette in the battered tin lid which served as an ashtray he reached for his shirt and crumpled jeans which lay on the floor and looked up at the naked girl stretched out on the frayed couch above him she smiled back at him provocatively opening her thighs which had once been very shapely but were now turning slightly to fat turning away from her richard rested on one elbow and gazed at his surroundings one small dirty room dust on every item of shabby furniture crumbled plaster on the floor where it had spilled from the multitude of cracks in the ceiling a curtained alcove containing a stained loo and washbasin an unmade bed a heap of crumpled blankets and sheets the smell it was his wish that they made love on the couch nowadays he had told her he found it more erotic there he didnt want to offend her sometimes he wondered why he came here every night sex of course there was no other reason he could get it elsewhere no doubt about that but would he have got it any better he smiled to himself linda lakin was attractive there was no doubt about that a bath a visit to the hairdressers and she would probably be classed as beautiful she was always at her best naked in a way she was like a drug and he knew he was addicted to her all this time and youve never taken me ome to meet your folks i dont like my home or my folks my dads a cunt ive read is bloody newspaper dyou think itll ever appen what poison leakin out and killin us all or praps an explosion naw its a bee in the old mans bonnet i told you hes nuts the guys i work with would lynch him if they could theyve come from all over the country depressed areas and now theyve found jobs hes trying to take the bread out of their mouths mine too you could always work at is place on that newspaper thatll be the day if they close down the nuclear station ill go on the dole i wouldnt mind that all the same id hate to see him get his way do you do you love me richard always the same question every night of course i do thats all that matters then maybe one day we could get married or live together or something he groaned inwardly maybe even though you know i was on the game up in aberdeen what the hells that got to do with it he grabbed angrily for his shirt and began pulling it over his head were all on the game in some way or other whether its sex or something else my boss is on the game or rather the government is a prostitution of power anyway i like a woman whos been around a bit my sisters a whore get away a hoarse cackle of disbelief its a fact this guy buys her clothes drink presents meals out at expensive restaurants and in return she lets him stuff her wheres the difference between you and her eh linda lakin reached for another cigarette she felt good at his words on a par with these coyles perhaps not socially but at least morally soon richard was fully dressed buttoning his denim jacket he glanced towards the door his lust was spent and it was time to be gone i wouldnt let anyone else ave it with me honest she swung herself off the couch and gripped him by the arm whats appenin tomorrow night a few of us are going down to that transport place just off the motorway he resisted the temptation to push her aside bikers theres too many in this place now used to be just us regulars some of the bastards have got to be sorted out its been on the cards for weeks now id like to come with you you might get hurt so might you no theres too many of us well give the bastards something they wont forget in a hurry these things have to be attended to when a town gets too big youre talkin like your dad now there was viciousness in her tone keep the place for the privileged few he kissed her without passion descended the rickety flight of wooden stairs to the street below and angrily kicked the norton into life that bitchs last remark had cut deep hell the last thing he would do would be to get like his dad it was the first time for weeks that coyle had not kissed anne at least once before she brought him his cup of morning coffee he was obviously worried and that worried her she wondered if he wanted to postpone their evenings date and did not know how to tell her she took it out on the keys of her typewriter at the telephone rang she briefed coyle on the internal line its the union her tone was formal cold a click of annoyance but not directed at her she knew how he hated the union all unions he was on the line for twenty minutes then she heard the receiver slammed down and he came out of his office further proof that one man cant beat the system he spoke bitterly whats up now the freedom of the press has been stifled subtly of course but one can still read between the lines friend dyne appears to have enlisted the full support of the power workers union who in turn have sought the cooperation of our union ross is the sleeper here i wish to god i could get rid of him but i cant there are others too of course any articles relating to oxide reprocessing have to be union vetted facts only and those facts in turn have to be vetted by the nuclear authorities dyne again otherwise theyll just close us down ross will have the printers and typesetters out before their morning tea has a chance to go cold bastards she slipped a hand into his i knew something was worrying you when you came in this morning you must have a little crystal ball hidden away somewhere yes he lied thinking of jane again but in a way theyre shutting the stable doors too late he laughed hollowly to boost his waning confidence we got those petition forms printed and circulated before they had thought of plugging our machines and were still going out tonight that was the thought that had been worrying her most of course he replied darling were going to enjoy ourselves as much as we can whilst theres still time god only knows what will happen but theres a nuclear cloud mushrooming on the horizon chapter november th a group of ragged children were playing on a piece of wasteground behind the latest demolition area at the north end of craiglowrie their numbers had swelled towards late afternoon standing watching for the departure of the men working on a row of tumbledown terraced cottages impatience a few quarrelling dusk came earlier than usual today mingling with the hint of fog that had been creeping into the valley all afternoon the whine and rumble of machinery ceased cascading stone and brickwork lay strewn in an untidy range of miniature mountains then silence except for a scurrying of tiny feet as the juvenile force moved in eagerly gathering smashed woodwork carrying and dragging it back to die centre of the open space piling it up in layers on a foundation of cardboard boxes the bonfire was built just as night brought its mantle of darkness to blot out the unsightly pile of ragged lintels and skirting boards the bonfire was huge because there was ample wood then came the guy a crazy caricature made from a hessian sack stuffed with crumpled newspapers legs and arms of rolled cardboard with odd castoff gloves and shoes for hands and feet no hat because there wasnt one to be found a handful of straw served as hair the face was an uneven oval of white cardboard with features crayoned on in a dozen different shades by industrious hands its expression seemed to change depending upon the angle it was viewed from and how ones imagination reacted mostly it scowled from narrowed eyes and a mouth curved downward at the corners one hated it automatically couldnt wait to bum it from an inbuilt instinct to incinerate an object of fear inhuman alien hoisted aloft the effigy was precariously tied in a sitting position abuse came from all directions the fireworks were very few just some sparklers to light up the scene creating weird moving shadows as they spluttered and fizzed somebody struck a match a crackling of flames devoured the dry timber which spat a feeble protest almost immediately leaping tongues of fire showered sparks high into the sky belittling the puny sparklers a movement a sudden lurching of the whole structure it seemed to slip settle again as though the figure in the midst of the inferno had moved in a desperate attempt to escape the face oh god that face shrill screams the onlookers falling back closing their ranks as though to seek protection from the glowering countenance the eyes bulgedand narrowed again the nose was gone burned to a black hole by a floating spark the mouth was open lips moving definitely moving trying to speak words the children heard them reverberating inside their heads incomprehensible mutterings as the eyes glowed fiercely singling out each and every one of them fools you would burn me yet again even when your own hour of fiery destruction is nigh i shall be consumed by the fire which belongs to my master but it will not destroy me i shall come again more terrible than before and then you will scream as you burn another shifting of the pyre broke the hypnotic spell which held the terrified audience a column of black smoke gushing up from an old motor tyre and temporarily hiding the awfulness of it all nobody wanted to stay there any longer they ran with breathless cries of terror scattering in all directions leaving the bonfire to burn itself out all through that windless night it glowed a heap of smouldering ashes that still billowed its own warning when the demolition workers returned the following morning but they scarcely noticed it the winter came and went coyle had hoped for severe weather heavy snowfalls which would drift in the north end of the valley and prevent work from going ahead on the new harvest process plant instead the atmosphere remained mild and dry with not even heavy rains to impede the labourforce still more houses were being added to the untidy sprawling suburbs nothing had changed within the coyle household coyle still found ample excuses to be absent from home in the evenings without arousing janes suspicions sarahs wardrobe was now filled to overflowing and she had taken to wearing expensive jewellery well beyond the means of her modest income richard still went out every night and coyle was aware that his son had been involved in that massive and brutal brawl at the lorrypark of the transport cafe by the motorway the ugly wound across the boys cheek had healed but the scar would remain forever one youth had died as a result of the affray but fortunately the police had never visited the coyle household a clash of hooligans and one less to terrorise society yet there was a deadly calm in the valley that spring a slowclimbing tension there was something different about the townspeople even those employed at the plutonium plant possibly a stranger visiting the town would not have noticed it it was only evident amongst those who lived and worked together a lack of small talk tempers flaring at the slightest provocation and people hurrying about their shopping chores with scarcely a word of greeting to each other a cloud hung over the valley it was a time of waiting for what coyles petition forms had been filled with signatures and only the unions ruling prevented the printing of a further supply this problem was overcome by attaching additional sheets of plain paper the signatures were delivered to the secretary of state for energy and a covering letter sent to the prime minister both were acknowledged but by this time the work was already in progress on august the new oxide plant was fully operative peoples uncertainty was turning to something else although none would have openly admitted it it was fear fear of the unknown all the more diabolical in its inexplicableness little did coyle realise that the first hint of portending doom would be conveyed to him within his own household and that he would have foreknowledge of the catastrophe he had predicted of the disaster he was unable to convey to the people through the pages of the herald september th richard had not been to work for three days actually there was nothing remarkable in that five jobs since leaving school and every one lost because of absenteeism it was a foregone conclusion for his parents that he would not remain much longer at the reprocessing plant jane knocked loudly on his bedroom door at am she was answered by an unintelligible grunt and returned downstairs sarah left at bob at at she went back upstairs and knocked again on her sons door this time somewhat timidly on more than one occasion previously she had been the subject of verbal abuse are you ill richard there was a tremor in her voice no im fucking well not the reply brought tears to her eyes and she hurried back downstairs in dealing with her son it was best to ride out the storm until they entered calmer waters at ten oclock richard came downstairs he was wearing his polonecked sweater and a pair of wrangler jeans without even a glance in her direction he went straight outside to the norton standing alongside the garage she heard the clink of spanners more cursing it always amazed her that anyone could swear so profusely whilst pursuing a hobby twice during the morning she glanced outside he appeared to have stripped down the whole machine completely though as far as she was aware there was nothing mechanically wrong with it for him this operation had the fascination of a jigsaw puzzle he took it apart put it together then started all over again she sighed in resignation as she washed and vacuumed midday she usually prepared herself a snack of some sort and wondered if richard wanted anything to eat but fearing further abuse she declined to ask him the afternoon wore on and she began to prepare the evening meal at pm richard came back inside and marched straight upstairs in his oily boots soon she heard the bath running well that was something anyway cleanliness was not one of his regular concerns shortly after six oclock sarah and bob arrived home within a few minutes of each other the meal was served but still no sign of richard jane decided to remark upon it richard hasnt been to work today oh bob coyle looked up surprise and concern on his face i wondered how long he would stick it up there its not his fault sarah leaped to her brothers defence with the kind of natural support that children give each other against parental disapproval theyve laid some of them off laid them off coyle dropped his knife on to his plate thats nonsense theres a halfpage advert in my newspaper seeking to recruit more labour for this new harvest process as they call it theyve sunk thousandfoot shafts into the granite below the valley and now theyre working like hell to make this diabolical stuff into blocks of solid waste to store down there for evermore they cant get enough men to work fast enough the boys lying no he isnt sarah retorted hotly theyve laid thirty men off on richards section i should know i had to deal with all the paperwork coyle did not reply he continued chewing thoughtfully for some moments before he spoke again why have they laid them off i dont know im only a clerk in the office havent you asked i mean arent you interested in your job no its just boring clerical work and if you want to know why the men have been laid off youd better ask richard himself that of course was the logical solution but a task he did not relish he finished the meal in silence sarah went upstairs to change bob and jane looked at each other across the table there was a halftaunting smile at the corners of her lips he rose to his feet and mounted the stairs thoughtfully slowly hell of all the people to have to ask coyle realised his first mistake the moment he entered his sons room he should have knocked this sanctum adorned with posters of rock groups speedway stars and a host of other paraphernalia which he did not understand was no longer the kids bedroom to which he had right of entry at any time it was a temple of teenage worship where homage was paid to cardboard idols richard was lying on the bed fully clothed arms folded behind his head he sat up as the door opened his features twisting in fury and indignation what the hell dyou mean by barging in here like this wisely the youth had declined to use a fourlettered word coyle closed the door quietly behind him he stood with his back to it regarding his son with an expression as hard as the granite below holocaust you havent been to work today no i bloody well havent thats my business not whilst you live under this roof i pay my keep you even make a bloody profit out of me like you do out of everything else thats because youre never here maybe that lakin girl charges you board too richard leapt to his feet fists clenched and raised coyle realised his tactlessness his feelings had come to the boil now it was going to be tough well he would just have to prove that he was the tougher of the two physically if necessary dont you talk to me like that in my own house i merely came in here to ask you a civil question well it doesnt seem that bloody way to me if i dont want to go to work i wont dont worry i wont be sponging for cash you havent been to work because you were laid off sent home if you know all the answers why bother asking me i want to know why you were laid off ah i get it using me eh you need a spy inside oxide reprocessing well you do your own dirty work ask dyne maybe hell tell you or see if you can get one of my workmates to part with the information for a tenner me i dont take bribes coyle could contain himself no longer every nerve in his body shook his vision was momentarily blurred a splitsecond memory crossed his brain from three years ago his sons fist smashing into his jaw this same room the posters all this same teenage crap spinning around him his reaction his provocation powered the blow almost before he realised it knuckles met unresisting bone and flesh just below the right eye for perhaps a fraction of a second richard was airborne his calves catching on the side of the bed and propelling him backwards in a halfsomersault a soft landing except for the jarring of the back of his skull as it struck the headboard coyle fell forward checked himself and retained his balance remorse threatened to swamp his anger forcefully he rejected it it was too late to turn back now he had waited three years to strike that blow a fathers revenge against a son the score was even now all he wanted were some answers to his questions and he had been forced to fight for them you bastard richard rubbed his face just below his eye he wondered if the cheekbone was broken already the swelling was beginning you bastard yes im a bastard coyle tried to hide his regret in a flood of bitterness remember the time you did that to me an uneasy silence heavy breathing coyle heard hesitant footsteps on the stairs they receded jane or sarah whichever of them it was had decided not to intervene why were you laid off theres plenty of work up there how the hell should i know every worker in any industry is informed why hes been laid off the bloody unions see to that maybe this time theyre content to hush it up just a technical hitch there was a faint note of concession in richards voice his eye was swelling up and already the bruise was fully evident what sort of technical hitch a breakdown in machinery theres certainly no shortage of waste being brought in for disposal how the hell should i know they told us it might be a couple of days even a week or a fortnight report back monday you went through the decontamination chamber before leaving everybody does every day its a rule your protective clothing is removed and youre given a new suit the next day gooperation and it had taken a straight left to bring it about coyle knew that his son would be unable to tell him any more even had he wished to im sorry about that the newspaperman turned back to the door his eyes resting on the floor just leave me be the apology had been rejected that made him feel a thousand times worse slowly he descended the stairs jane and sarah were standing together in the livingroom with strained expressions their eyes boring into him explanations would be futile they had undoubtedly heard it all sarah was obviously on the point of going out she was wearing a brandnew sheepskin coat brandon the best quality with leatherlined trims coyle hated it he hated houston maybe one day hed hit him too only when that happened he would have no regrets you bloody bully coyle winced at his daughters words but did not reply there was nothing more to be said he was relieved when she turned her back abruptly on him and went out banging the front door behind her did you have to hit him a mothers instinct to protect her son sarah hates you for it shes hated you for some time now i know bob coyle attempted to take her in his arms but she pushed him away just look at what youve done to this household just when things were beginning to come right between us that made him think of anne sooner or later he would have to tell his wife maybe this new family rift would make it all the easier he threw himself on to the settee and picked up the sun some guy owning a pack of vicious dogs had refused to have them destroyed it had made the headlines oxide reprocessing had virtually disappeared from the papers these days even his own but that wasnt his fault he turned the pages a bird with boobs which reminded him of anne he couldnt concentrate tomorrow there would be an awful lot to do somehow something had to be brought to a head but how he regretted that he wasnt seeing anne that night she would have understood jane had promised her support that night she had taken him but it had not materialised not that he was aware of anyway his whole family was opposed to him that resulted from a culmination of events totally beyond his control perhaps he had got it all wrong perhaps he was under the illusion that he was the only soldier in the whole regiment who was marching in step it was a possibility but he didnt think so he made a mental note of tomorrows phonecalls in order of priority dyne a rebuff even if he succeeded in getting through to him eric stafford local representative of british nuclear fuels honest but unsure of himself he relied too much on dyne tyler of britains hazardous materials group a man with a conscience possibly he could be persuaded to give some hint but not over the phone kent the thought of speaking to his former colleague made him feel a lot better kent was a born stirrer a sensationalist who overdid it at times cost his paper a packet on one occasion an article concerning a cabinet minister they hadnt sacked kent though simply because they knew it had been true just lack of conclusive evidence or rather too many falsely substantiated lies from those in power that was how it went coyle wished that he had kent there with him now the short fairhaired man was an army in himself a terrier that could not be dislodged once he had a hold the door slammed loudly and they heard richards footsteps heading upstairs tonight he would not be going anywhere except to bed maybe he had decided to sleep his humiliation off jane came back into the room and switched on the television that was the best thing that had happened all evening the sound of voices stirred richard coyle from a deep slumber angry voices chanting boots scraping on hard ground the tinkle of breaking glass a slow emergence from sleep into a shocked awakening sitting up in bed throwing back the bedclothes aware that it was still dark outside except for the orange glow of streetlamps he ran to the window snagged the curtains back and stared with disbelief at what he saw in the street below a crowd of some fifty people maybe more pushing and shoving across the width of two pavements looking up at the window seeing him yelling obscenities come on down coyle we want you fear had his pyjamaclad figure trembling violently disbelief he tried to make his confused brain work the townspeople and probably some of his own workmates a frenzied mob incensed because his father was fighting to get the recycling plant closed down something that would cost them their jobs and throw them back into the dole queues their rage was understandable except that richard was one of them on their side its not me you want he shouted into the din through the partly open window its my father we want you richard coyle he stepped back as a jagged halfbrick bounced off the windowsill and in that instant his terror rose to a climax this was no ordinary group of protesting workers and the light which reflected the ugly scene did not come from electric standards the eerie flickering orange glow came from a dozen or more burning torches held aloft now revealing the uplifted faces in detail squat almost inhuman features grimed with filth and caked with dried blood mouths wide with animallike fangs clothing that was crude and illfitting handsewn garments of some thick unfamiliar material they were people who had no right to exist in this modern day and age and where were all the other houses just a street no a stony carttrack disappearing into black shadows in either direction a world of darkness beyond the blazing torches no glare from the new town or the processing centre emblazoning the night sky something terrible had happened perhaps there had been a radioactive leak or an explosion he had slept through and the survivors had come to revenge themselves on him for some inexplicable reason come out richard coyle or well drag you out he glanced around his bedroom nothing here had changed four walls covered with posters the small dressingtable piled high with junk which his mother had been begging him to tidy up for weeks everything lit up by that fiery glow from outside he was aware that he was shouting mom dad sarah but his words came back at him in a hollow echo as though the rest of the house was empty his family gone wherever the other occupants of craiglowrie had gone leaving him at the mercy of these crazed peasantlike monstrosities in an empty land footsteps coming up the stairs richard coyle shrank back pressed against the wall unable to take his eyes from the door knowing it would burst open at any second it flew back bounced off the wall the hinges creaking under the strain flaming torches bellowing black acrid smoke showed him that his worst fears were confirmed the landing was filled with sweatstinking unwashed bodies their faces primeval masks of anger there was nowhere he could flee to escape the hands groping for him broken fingernails gouging his flesh as calloused fingers closed over him a last desperate struggle clawing back at them in his panic then something struck him in the genitals and he sagged unconscious into a cradle of arms it was all a dream a nightmare dimly he was aware of his body being tossed and turned one way then the other he wanted to open his eyes but his head ached abominably and he was afraid of the light so hot sweating feverishly a subconscious awareness of being ill but unable to come to terms with it logically at last his eyes flickered open the pupils seared by a yellowish light he tried to tell himself that it came from the streetlamps outside his bedroom window but he knew it didnt the scene which greeted him was the same as before only a thousand times more devilish the angry shouting crowd looking up at him baying like a pack of wolves but he wasnt in his bedroom anymore now he was perched on top of a huge pile of dead branches far larger than that built by the boys brigade for the annual november bonfire in the recreation park he was securely bound to a thick stake a human guy fawkes effigy with a dozen torches poised to start the blaze which would incinerate him panic fighting his bonds although he knew it was useless his body hot and dry naked except for one remaining pyjama sleeve wait youre making a big mistake this time his shout was audible coarse laughter rippled through the watchers a chorus of jibes obscenities then a man smaller than the rest a grotesque dwarflike figure shuffled forward mouth strangely lopsided when he spoke we are not mistaken you are one of those sent to destroy us with magic a disciple of balzur you bear his mark on your loins the red plague by which his accursed are known richard tried to look down but the ropes prevented him from seeing further than his waist but there was a distinct burning sensation in the area of his genitals probably from a blow one of them had delivered go join your master in the flames of hell the dwarf thrust forward his burning brand and immediately the dry branches began to blaze and crackle at the foot of the pile more torches were hurled flames leaping higher seeking out his feet to lick at them richard screamed kept on screaming and through a red haze of pain and fire he saw a sea of jeering faces burn as balzur burned richard coyle his body was scorching his flesh drying up shrivelling being burned alive cruelly he was denied unconsciousness suddenly he was falling in a shower of sparks like some bizarre firework explosion the flames facelike leering seeming to reflect his own terror distorted mirrors of fire hotter a bed of embers leaping up to meet him crashing into it writhing trying to scream but no sound coming richard richard a familiar voice so far away a hand grasping him shaking him feebly he tried to fight it off but it clung to him with a firm persistence richard richard the tone more insistent now somehow his eyes opened his own bedroom again daylight streaming through the window wan sunlight making patterns on the wall above the bed richard stared up in amazement at his mother saw the concern on her features youre ill she said youve got a fever had some sort of a nightmare i heard you shouting from downstairs im all right his mouth was dry his naked body lathered in sweat the turmoil of bedclothes damp just just a a nightmare he started to show signs of getting up youre not well enough to get up maternal insistence even though jane coyle knew that she addressed a rebellious teenage son hed get up just because she didnt want him to tm going out he grabbed for his shirt on the bedside chair fought off a wave of dizziness so dont try to stop me all right she sighed turning away somehow richard coyle struggled into his clothes after a few moments he plucked up the strength to rise to his feet he swayed but remained upright as he tottered out to the toilet across the landing he didnt care if his mother heard him throwing up after that he felt slightly better he went downstairs and out to where the norton was parked he didnt want to face his mother and he certainly couldnt face breakfast as he sat astride his bike wondering if he had enough strength to kick the throttle he glanced up and down the street just an everyday scene that could have been any suburb in the country rows of boxlike houses cars backing out of driveways a queue at the busstop so beautifully mundane maybe last nights horror would wear off soon seep out of his system in the sweat which was dampening his shirt and jeans and trickling down his forehead shivering he used every ounce of his strength to kick the bike into life and roared off into the cooling westerly wind been sortin them bikers out again richard coyle glared at linda and rubbed his eye which was now virtually closed the short ride from home had been difficult for him twice he had nearly swerved into oncoming traffic my dad like i keep saying hes a bastard im glad i never met im dont worry you wont have to im not going back you mean we can live together maybe get married he grimaced as he stood looking at her she lay lewdly sprawled on the couch wearing only one garment a soiled and crumpled negligee she had deliberately pulled it up just far enough in order to see between her thighs he would need to pull it up just another couple of inches sometimes she was already naked when he arrived a touch of seductive subtlety tonight however well as subtle as she ever was she obviously wanted to play around a bit first he tenderly rubbed his face again and then another thought occurred to him he didnt feel randy as he usually did when he visited this filthy bedsit that was all he came for instead there was an uncomfortable sensation below a kind of stinging feeling in his genitals something else too he badly wanted to urinate he attempted a grin and nodded towards the curtained alcove she leered back and nodded richard loathed going into the smelly uncleaned toilet which hadnt seen a bottle of lavatory cleaner in the last six months it was certainly not the ideal prelude to a screw but he had to go he took a deep breath and pushed his way through the curtain silence in the room it was almost as though she had stopped breathing maybe she was kinky and obtained a thrill out of listening to him aim for the sides spoil her sneaky fun the bitch he was certainly in a bad mood a single bulb lit the dingy interior he pulled down his zip foreskin right back and then the pain had him gasping aloud burning scalding he glanced down eyes wide as the sudden horror of what he saw registered in his confused brain the bloated head of his penis was covered in tiny red pinhead rashes with a yellowish fluid around the base he clutched the wall for support and the stream spattered on to the linoleumcovered floor christ he stood immobile unable to gather his thoughts linda the dirty whore so she hadnt left it all behind in aberdeen with an effort he pulled himself together and began to struggle back into the main room extricating himself from the folds of the rotting curtain there was a ripping sound as some of it came away in shreds linda still lay as before her garment now pulled up around her waist thighs wide one foot resting on the floor smiling in the knowledge that her offering was on full view her eyes alighted greedily on the open vent in the front of his trousers and then narrowed with surprised disappointment at the sight of his flaccid organ you dirty cow he spat in rage and contempt advancing slowly and unsteadily towards her what what dyer mean she scrambled up into a sitting position her negligee slipping down again to cover her what the bloody ells got into yer this he stood before her holding his limpness the foreskin held back to display the raw weeping flesh gor blimey she edged as far away from him as the sofa would allow youve got a dose of the pox and youve given it me he snarled its true what they say about you you dirty little scrubber youve been on the game all your life and you cant get off it youre hooked on it half the guys in this bleeding town are fucking you and all the time you were trying to make out you had some sort of crush on me its a lie she yelled youre lookin for a scapegoat its you whatve been sleepin around and now youre tryin to blame it on to me you bleedin low dirty bastard go back to your poxy woman and dont never come back ere richard coyles rage erupted his one eye was virtually sightless his cheekbone felt as if it was broken the pain throbbed right up and over his skull terminating at the back of his neck but that was as nothing compared with the searing sensation below and the full implications of it all in the space of only twelve hours he had been brutally struck by his father and discovered that his girlfriend no his sexpartner had given him vd someone had to pay for all that right now only revenge mattered and somebody had to bear the brunt of it all you fucking little whore the full weight of his fourteen stone was transferred to the balls of his feet as he delivered the first blow a stunning right uppercut which caught linda lakin full on the point of her jaw bone splintered bloody broken teeth filled her mouth her head flew back he hit her again and felt sadistic satisfaction at the sound of her small nose breaking miraculously she was still conscious gurgling her screams as she swallowed blood eyes wide with horror she attempted to scramble up but fell back helpless richard coyle was now in an uncontrollable frenzy he struck wildly at her eyes laughing as they puffed up into blueblack swollen sightlessness it wasnt her he was hitting now it was his father repaying that one blow with interest again and again his knuckles began to bleed they felt as though they were broken the arms which had initially attempted to ward off his blows now lay still not so much as a whimper from her her head was twisted at an unnatural angle the features totally unrecognisable the nightdress saturated with blood then he stopped a numbness enveloping him from head to foot he realised that she was dead but it did not worry him he hadnt meant to kill her it was manslaughter not murder that would be the verdict there was provocation she had asked for it slowly his brain began to function clearly again he turned away from the revolting bloody corpse and went back into that stinking alcove he didnt even notice the smell this time turning on the single tap he ran water into the cracked basin and began to wash the blood from his hands there was surprisingly little on his clothing a few splatterings that would scarcely draw attention to him he bathed his swollen eye the cold water was soothing but it seemed to have little effect on the burning within his member he went back into the main room lit a cigarette and pondered upon the course of action he would take in no way could he disguise the fact that he had killed linda lakin her body would be discovered in a day or two probably when the landlord came to collect the rent richard coyles arrest would then be a formality still he would not make it all that easy for them he had no intention of returning home in his present mood he would probably kill his father too not that that would be a bad idea but in his predicament it would not help first he needed to visit a vd clinic that was what worried him most he had read all about venereal diseases but there was something about his own particular symptoms which worried him hed heard of guys going on for weeks with just minor discomfort yet this pain was like a searing heat radiating through the rest of his loins maybe it was a different type of pox he would head south the thought came to him in an instant the petrol tank of the norton was almost full enough to get him to london maybe hed been there once before guys and girls slept rough nobody bothered them they queued up at the vd clinics nobody would give him a second glance that also went for most of the major cities manchester birmingham and such i stayed in this fucking place one day too long he did not look back as he let himself out shouldve moved out months ago he winced almost cried out aloud as his genitals came in contact with the saddle burning blinding pain seemed to be eating away his lower regions as if they were being consumed by fire he kicked the starter it fired first time swaying precariously mainly because one eye was now totally sightless he hunched over the handlebars and roared off into the early autumnal night the journey south had begun chapter richard didnt come in at all last night his bed hasnt been slept in bob coyle barely glanced up from the morning issue of the sun and replied with his mouth full of toast so what hes old enough sleeping rough probably more likely with that whore well im not going down to the police station to list him as a missing person hell come home when he runs out of money and gets hungry kids his age are doing the same all over the country and meanwhile youll pursue this obsession of yours about the world being blown up because some ancient wizard put a curse on craiglowrie fathers all over the country arent taking that tine thank god thats just the trouble with the british he pushed his empty plate away stood up and reached for his coat he wanted to be out of the house before sarah came down one bickering woman was enough at that time of the morning going out early arent you there was resentment in janes voice a hint of suspicion too ive a lot to do today which means youll be late home yes im afraid so he averted his eyes from her searching gaze dont fix anything for me ill eat out tonight if i get time sometimes i almost think it would be better if you had another woman she snapped at least itd make you more human work work work and by the way this boyfriend of sarahs who keeps on lavishing all these clothes and things on her why doesnt she bring him home we dont even know his surname just david what are his intentions why dont you ask him how the hell can i when i dont know who he is i reckon hes a married man maybe mrs bean will have heard something the towns prophet of doom coyle called back as he went out the door hastening at the sound of sarahs footsteps on the landing above youll never hear glad tidings from that source the printers and typesetters were surprised to see coyle arrive so early he nodded to them as he passed through the workshops and flung himself into the battered old chair in his tiny office anne would not be here for another threequarters of an hour god how he needed her just her company he pulled the much depleted bottle of whisky from the cupboard and poured some of it into the unwashed glass he needed time to think it was too early to make any phonecalls something had definitely gone wrong up at holocaust maybe it was just a repetition of what happened to windscales pilot oxide plant in that meant contamination however slight he wished sarah didnt work up there christ there were obstacles at every turn anne arrived promptly at nine in time to catch him draining the last of the whisky from the glass my god there was concern on her face you look bad bob domestic or both he sighed somethings definitely gone wrong up at the new plant im afraid its going to be one helluva day today one way or another ajid its still going to be one helluva night tonight she leaned over him kissing him god i wish we were both away from here just the two of us anywhere away from it all that may be the answer he replied staring unseeing at the wall in front of him but only for us but she knew that bob coyle would never break and run he would stay and fight whatever the odds until the bitter end victory or defeat at am coyle tried to phone dyne the telephonist at the other end asked him to hold at when she requested him to hold again he replaced the receiver his next call was in quest of stafford representative of british nuclear fuels the same number just a different extension the same telephonist please hold but a couple of minutes later he was through to stafford a technical hitch there was a hesitancy about the others tone which was in contrast to the mans character ive got the reports here on my desk but i havent had a chance to go through them yet ive been away on a couple of days leave look coyle if theres anything in them that might present a local or national threat id phone you back ok coyle was used to promises to ring back on average twentyfive per cent of such calls materialised he knew this one would not simply because there would not be anything of a hazardous nature in those reports he tried tyler representative of britains hazardous materials group he got through almost immediately of course we cant give any details at this stage the answer came just too smoothly for coyles satisfaction the layoff is merely precautionary in fact it is doubtful if anything is amiss at all until a thorough investigation has been completed we cannot comment naturally we wouldnt conceal anything of a hazardous nature however in all probability this is something entirely technical which will not be a breach of security at all a purely internal business back to square one coyle slammed the receiver down the patient has just undergone a critical operation and a wellmeaning relative has been fobbed off with hints of a grumbling appendix he tried kent next but it was pm before the controversial journalist returned from a liquid lunch at the cheshire cheese coyle himself had not yet eaten and the whisky bottle now reposed empty in the wastepaperbasket since its disposal anne had been plying him constantly with cups of black coffee you should have stayed on fleet street kents speech was slightly slurred life hums constantly around one its humming here too coyle came to the point did you know that theyve closed down part of the new nuclear disposal plant purely technical im told no need for concern the devil they have kents speech lost its slur and coyle could visualise the old gleam in those grey eyes the tightening of the mouth smells fishy to me no doubt youve made some enquiries tried to coyle replied the usual negative answers one expects when dealing with officialdom particularly at this level of course the unions have combined to restrict my own personal views being expressed in the herald fuck the unions kent was always conveniently forgetting to pay his subscription tell you what theres nothing to hold me here at present ill drive up through the night and see you tomorrow morning coyle replaced the receiver with mingled relief and apprehension relief that kent might be going to throw a few spanners into dynes reprocessing works apprehension that well the london journalist had an uncanny nose for trouble in the past when they had worked together there had been so many reports that had seemed scarcely worth the trouble of investigating yet the little fleet street man had unearthed veritable holocausts linda lakins body was discovered at approximately three oclock that same afternoon in effect shortly after coyle had finished speaking to kent it was pm when the police visited the premises of the herald a plainclothes chief superintendent accompanied by two cid officers coyle was well acquainted with all three of them rollason the superintendent rarely smiled possibly on account of the eternal cigarette which smouldered between his thick lips depositing ash at intervals down his worn brown waistcoat he had small eyes buried beneath fleshy sockets which rarely disclosed his innermost feelings mclane the inspector was not so stolid as his superior his cleancut features an admirable advertisement for some brand of aftershave he was a man destined to climb to the heights of his chosen profession and he would be ruthless in that quest sergeant conniston stood respectfully behind them retirement was his goal in life now and his toothbrush moustache was reminiscent of an era when local policemen commanded the respect of the entire community that too had gone a mixed bunch coyle decided the superintendents expression conveyed that he had a matter of a confidential nature to discuss coyle nodded to anne she understood smiled and withdrew closing the door behind her it was cramped in the tiny office and there were not sufficient chairs available coyle pushed a sheaf of papers aside and what can i do for you gentlemen your boy rollason came straight to the point any idea where he is hes not at work nor home we checked the ringing of the telephone interrupted them coyle lifted the receiver annes voice came over the internal line your wife wants to speak to you tell her ill call her back ive already told her that she says its urgent and she refuses to ring off oh all right put her through he placed a hand over the mouthpiece excuse me its my wife i wont keep you a minute bob janes voice had more than a ring of urgency to it she was on the verge of panic its about richard the police have been here looking for him coyle gave no hint either in his voice or in his expression of his true feelings the jarring of his nerves the sensation of nausea as his stomach churned i know theyre here now just arrived whats happened i dont know havent had a chance to speak to them yet somethings terribly wrong i know it the police wouldnt say look ill ring you back he cut her off abruptly by replacing the receiver well he looked at rollason suppose you tell me what its all about does the name linda lakin mean anything to you the superintendent lit a fresh cigarette with the butt of the old one before crushing it in the ashtray yes coyles uneasiness escalated a girl my son used to knock about with ive never met her he never brought his girlfriends home well shes dead beaten up one hell of a mess and your lads gone missing my men are going over the scene of the murder now and already theres ample evidence that he was there recently what we want to know is where he is now weve circulated his motorcycle registration number to all patrol cars my god coyle buried his face in his hands it all came back to him the quarrel the blow already he was blaming himself finally he looked up his complexion ashen i only wish youd come here to me first ive no idea where my son is right now we followed a methodical line of enquiries silence three men totally unmoved and the fourth a few minutes ago he was challenging singlehanded the rights of a nation to risk the lives of its entire population now he was just an ordinary father shattered dazed everything else forgotten well probably want to speak to you again rollason moved towards the door call us if he shows up coyle nodded he wont though hes gone and i drove him away he watched them leave in single file conniston last their eyes met briefly coyle thought he read sympathy there but he could have been mistaken the door closed and he heard them go out through the reception area a tap on the door anne she had sensed that something was terribly wrong he called out for her to come in its richard he picked up the sheaf of papers again just for something to occupy his hands his brain was in a daze to all appearances hes done that lakin hussy in oh christ id better get home fast of course kent will be here in the morning im not backing out of this other business no matter what were still going to fight em to the bitter end to the very last atom she admired him more at that moment than ever before a family crisis of the worst kind and still he was prepared to continue the fight hardly before coyle had got out of the car jane was at the front door she seemed to have aged a decade since breakfast the smooth skin on her face lined black marks beneath her eyes streaks of mascara where it had run with tears and even now she did not know the truth whats he done where is he her voice rose almost to a scream where is richard before replying he took off his coat and hung it up he needed time to think time to choose his words i dont know he said at last and went into the livingroom straight to the cocktail cabinet he poured two whiskies stiff ones youve got to tell me where is he ive no idea but why the police the lakin girls dead murdered oh my god no no no he slapped her hard across the face with the flat of his hand he had read somewhere that it was the best way to prevent someone becoming hysterical she staggered back the armchair happened to be in the right place and she sprawled back into it there was shocked silence murdered she gulped at last look theres no reason to connect it with richard its just that he was friendly with her they only want to ask him some questions he hated himself for the lie just stalling it would all have to come out in the end the link between their son and the dead girl would be mentioned on the television news probably that night he had to stop her from switching on though in her state she wasnt likely to look you said yourself the girl was a prostitute she snapped viciously you passed that off as mrs beans gossip ok so maybe i was wrong that means she had other men violent types maybe one of them she took the glass of whisky he offered her and sipped it then grimaced she had never much liked spirits yet suppose something turned richard into a violent type temporarily at least meaning you hit the boy viciously hes not a boy hes a grown man responsible for his own actions hes our son still you turned him into a monster of violence bob she stopped with a sob an uneasy silence ensued coyle swallowed his whisky and poured himself another jane merely toyed with her glass another thing bob her lips tightened into a thin line i spoke to mrs bean again today oh god no that woman what is it this time sarah what about her its as i suspected as ive been trying to get through your thick skull for months shes having an affair with a married man his name is david houston hes got three young children ill speak to her about it no you wont janes voice was low loaded with menace youre fast splitting this family up ill sort this one out as a husband and father youre a dead loss coyles eyes blazed his jaw tightened the day of confession had arrived i agree with you he spoke softly suddenly relieved that all these domestic falsehoods were collapsing around them and ill tell you something else too before mrs bean does i am having an affair with another woman not just a sexual relationship im in love with her its been going on for a very long time now youve been so confined within your own tiny little world that youve never once suspected a thing ive kept it from you trying to hold the family together but now now it doesnt matter any longer her whisky glass shattered into hundreds of tiny fragments on the wall behind him the contents caught him full in the face rupe had never had any inclination towards violence before indeed he had never had any inclinations towards anything requiring either physical or mental effort the kids at school had reduced him to the selfconscious nervous insignificant being that was to be his permanent character by the time he was ten years old rupert had always been a subject of ridicule the victim of bullies even after mr snell his formmaster had so kindly taken to referring to him as rupe it was too late then though he was glad when the time came for him to leave school though it meant being cast out into this vicious unfriendly new town where nobody paid him the slightest attention except maybe to push him roughly aside when he chanced to idle in a main thoroughfare he certainly didnt want to go back home again to suffer either his fathers drunken pummellings or his mothers obscene cursings which poured incessantly from those harsh lips so rupe just wandered aimlessly except there had been a kind of calling a message that had come to him in a rare dream a few nights ago from an old man speaking to rupe out of the midst of a blazing furnace the time is nigh the oppressed must rise up craiglowrie shall be destroyed by fire and only those who follow me shall live hide and wait until i come kill if necessary a kind of prophet rupe had decided a holy man who could survive in the flames a saviour like the ayatollah hed seen on tv calling to the people to rise up and overthrow authority it was all very exciting gave him a purpose in life as never before the condemned houses scheduled for demolition at some future date their boardings covered with fourletter words daubed blatantly in varied colours these provided him with shelter if not warmth even in this vanishing slum area the dustbins were always well stocked with edible refuse so he certainly wouldnt starve all he wanted was to be left alone to live in the only way he knew and to hate his fellow men and all around him the new town was replacing the old he could never easily accept change but he savoured the one that had been promised in his dream then he found loup or to be more precise loup found him he awoke one morning the weak rays of sunlight dancing on his face through a hole in the brickwork above his head and he knew that he wasnt alone the dog sat quietly inside the entrance beside a heap of rubble just watching him its greenishgrey eyes missing nothing it appeared to be mostly alsatian its coat was covered in mange yet its face was alert and knowing its pointed ears erect and listening to every sound it too was a loner rupe leaned over and threw the dog a few scraps of bread from the cardboard box beneath the tarpaulin which was his larder when the animal had devoured them never taking its eyes off him whilst it masticated he offered a hand in friendship and it licked his outstretched fingers with a deep red tongue displaying massive canine teeth so white and glistening in contrast to the poor quality of its coat rupe didnt know why he called his newly found friend loup he seemed to have heard the word somewhere maybe long ago in school and had stored it away in his memory anyway it rhymed with his own name and they were going to be partners for sure rupe and loup they had to lie low in the daytime scavenging for food at night under cover of darkness sometimes they would slink through the deserted streets together but usually loup would disappear on his own after supper returning before dawn to lie down on the length of frayed matting hi the corner licking his chops with the satisfaction of a dog which has hunted and fed well and ready to sleep for a few hours then came the moment when rupe killed not a bludgeoning or knifing on one of his nocturnal prowls but in a busy street in broad daylight he knew not why he had ventured out mingling with the jostling crowds hustled along like a cork in a millstream perhaps he was suddenly enjoying a sense of superiority a dawning of the knowledge that he was not as others a chosen disciple of the one who would surely come he was tied by no bonds of convention it happened on the pedestrian crossing the traffic lights showed green and the vehicles roared by the pedestrian control showed wait illuminated in red twenty or more people clustered together on each pavement impatiently watching for it to change to the green light and cross now the little old lady hi front of him picked up her heavilyladen shopping bags in anticipation at that moment rupe heard the old mans voice loud and clear as though he was standing next to him go on kill now rupe pushed her firmly but surreptitiously so that nobody would notice the movement her scream of terror was drowned by the clanking of an approaching articulated lorry before the driver realised what was happening she was beneath his front wheels with a screech of rubber the rear wheels came to rest on her already lifeless body rupe retired to the rear of the shocked sensationseeking crowd which gathered within seconds hed enjoyed that he felt great it had been so subtle a touch of perfection and the blood he liked the colour so richly delicious and the odour too hed never noticed the smell before such a delightful tangy aroma nobody even glanced at him as he slunk away and the voice those same mellow tones seeming further away this time said well done my son it was on one of his dustbin crawls on the edge of the old town that rupe met the girl he was on his own that night as was usually the case loup having gone off on a foray to the deserted openair market the moon was full and the young vagrant took extra care that he was not spotted by a patrolling panda car as he turned into a side street near the cinema he saw the girl standing in the shadows of the community centre he hadnt bothered with women before classing both sexes of mankind as his natural enemies but somehow he felt different at this moment perhaps it was the way she looked at him the smiling smirking invitation on her face caused a tightening of his muscles the fact that her hair was straggly her short topcoat creased and stained and there were holes in her tights was of no consequence to him he just stood and stared ow about it then lover boy she croaked it dont matter if you aint got no money elsie wont charge you this time for a few seconds they stood looking at each other in silence rupe anticipating a thrill hed never experienced before and elsie contemplating the enrolment of yet another regular client then he allowed her to take him by the hand and lead him towards the cinema carpark and he heard that voice again very faintly go with her my son enjoy yourself and then kill it was snug behind the deserted attendants hut and soon rupe forgot everything else until finally she pushed him off her partially clothed body christ she croaked yer dont arf stink a bath wouldnt do yer no arm nor a shave for that matter yer like a bloody edge og rupes fingers touched the face funny he thought i never noticed that before he hadnt expected a beard to start for another year at least but now suddenly he felt a roughness on his face as though his skin was corrugated but it was not hair it was something else entirely something which burned him as though he had passed through boiling steam yerll learn in time elsie was sneering now adjusting her coat only next time itll cost yer a couple o quid worth a fiver to put up with that stink suddenly his hands were around her throat but not the small slender hands of youth they were massive strong and they had choked the life out of the streetwalker before she had time to scream then with terrible ferocity he began to mutilate the dead body lying beneath him punching and tearing at the face with his bare hands finally kicking and stamping on the now unrecognisable form with his heavy boots at last he stood still smiling into the darkness waiting to hear those words of praise well done my son it was some hours later when rupe returned to the den he shared with loup all that sudden strength seemed to have ebbed from him and it required a supreme physical effort to peel the filthy rags from his grimy body he dropped them on the floor and then with a groan he flung himself on the stiff tarpaulin he did not sleep but just lay there watching the sky grow lighter every minute through the hole in the wall something was dreadfully wrong and he could not understand what loup had been asleep when he entered but now he opened his eyes and regarded his companion rupe looked back at him then he glanced down at his own body the dirt clinging to his flesh like scales he stared at the marks that now covered him like a series of red rashes millions of tiny pimples that oozed yellowish pus and burned with a scalding sensation he felt weak faint and frightened he tried to stand but fell his whole body stinging yet more painfully he knew he needed help urgently despite his hatred of his fellow men he would have to seek their aid no longer were those mystic words of encouragement to be heard he began to crawl slowly painfully dragging along on his stomach instinctively heading towards the new suburbs the burning now seemed to be growing inside him as well as though his intestines were on fire he had covered almost two hundred yards and it was full daylight now the first rays of the rising sun lay on the rooftops soon the new town would be coming to life people scurrying to and fro then someone would find him he tried to shout for help but the sound was scarcely a whisper a hoarse croak that went unanswered that damned dog had deserted him in his hour of need he could hear footsteps no it was the thudding of his own heart pumping frantically faster than ever before sheer terror gripped him the burning he was like a human inferno except there were no flames never in his life had he known a days illness and now so suddenly he covered another ten yards and felt the flagstones of a pavement beneath him and as he lay there he heard laughter mocking tones inside his head a familiar voice all must die rupe you are the first of many this is the curse of balzur then he died chapter two bloody murders within twentyfour hours and one dead vagrant chief superintendent rollason addressed inspector mclane and sergeant conniston from behind his cigarette its half inch or so of ash liable to fall at any second and the vagrant kid could probably have done both mclane replied whatd he die of anyway looked like the bloody plague to me well have to wait for the autopsy rollasons ash finally fell into his lap but in the meantime weve got to find this coyle kid personally i dont think the murders are related but weve got to solve em even if the victims were only a couple of slags its getting like bloody jack the ripper round here well all the roadblocks are set up there was a note of pride in mclanes voice shouldnt be too difficult except that hes got eighteen hours or so start on us rollason muttered but well pick him up all right hes no hardened criminal on the run just one scared yobbo they were interrupted by a knock on the door a young uniformed constable entered a manila envelope clutched in his hand the postmortem sir thank you watkins that will be all the constable withdrew and roltasons podgy fingers tore at the envelope like a pools winner eager to see the cheque wondering whether or not his expectations will be realised three separate sheets of paper typewritten lakin first fractured skull multiple injuries regan the whore strangulation also a cracked skull rupert copeland the superintendents hand shook the papers fell on to the desk amidst another shower of cigarette ash his face was white the other two had never seen him react in that way before death was death to him only the means the motives mattered personalities never entered into it is is there something wrong sir mclane stepped forward but he would not risk the chances of promotion by reaching across for the reports without permission it all had to come from the super himself wrong rollasons cigarette bobbed up and down that is something of an understatement inspector the youth died from radioactive poisoning oxide it would appear he reached for the telephone and asked for a number clicking his tongue he fidgeted with impatience till he got through to the reprocessing plant hold please he swore under his breath minutes passed mr dyne is in conference sir would you care to speak to no i would not he barked this is chief superintendent rollason speaking will you fetch mr dyne out of the conference at once please i wish to speak with him concerning a matter of the utmost gravity three minutes later he was talking to winston dyne the pain was becoming worse every second richard coyle slowed his machine to a mere mph god he wished that hed risked the motorway but the police would have picked him up there for sure the old winding road through the lakes the full moon and clear skies helped he was totally blind in one eye now the agony in his genitals was so great that he was forced to half stand for long periods that made his course even more erratic and when the muscles in his legs could no longer stand the strain he relapsed back into the saddle it was almost as though his machine had a will of its own deliberately singling out every pothole and bump in the narrow twisting road an instrument of sadistic torture his stomach burned he retched and vomited the spew blowing back on to him but still he kept going not daring to stop even though his instincts told him to abandon the machine and crawl away into one of the adjacent forestry commission thickets like a fox a beast of the chase licking its wounds in some hole before it finally died a lingering death lake windermere on his right the large expanse of water shimmering in the moonlight was tempting it would cool his burning body death by drowning was said to be pleasant just hallucinations ones whole life returning in those few moments instead he increased his pressure on the throttle dawn the pain was no worse no better either kendal he rode slowly through the town passing a parked police patrol car the two officers were enjoying a quiet smoke they scarcely glanced at him full daylight the agony was not so intense now though it was spreading to other parts of his body he felt it on his chest and back bringing back memories of early childhood when his mother had rubbed him with vie ointment an unrelenting smarting sensation only this time it came from within his thoughts turned again to vd surely that poxy wench couldnt have given him all this he glanced down at the petrol gauge more than halffull got to keep going anywhere just keep going away from it all he thought about chancing the m but decided against it that was the route theyd expect him to take still heading south not much traffic they all used the motorways nowadays the towns presented few problems one just followed the main roads straight through them too many traffic lights mostly he found them on red and that was the worst part the waiting the day was clear dry and sunny no spray from other vehicles lancaster preston the big towns attracted him but somehow he could not bring himself to stop as long as there was petrol in the tank just keep going the pain remained constant no better no worse all over his body once whilst he waited for a set of traffic lights to change he felt his face the skin was rough like emery paper no growth of beard though he had not shaved for the past two days manchester on across the ship canal wigan he had often wondered about the mythical pier but this was certainly no time to investigate warrington the sun was well past its zenith under normal conditions he would have been a hundred miles further on by now however time had ceased to matter any more and mph was the most he could manage with one good eye the petrol was low in the tank which worried him now he began to think seriously about the coming night lichfield its three spired cathedral looming on his left a place of sanctuary he cursed himself for even thinking about it he wasnt going to turn back to god now that would be a return to his childhood the enforced church services hed make it on his own but now all thoughts of death had deserted him a fever of some sort perhaps not even the clap his spirits rose but he had killed the girl there was no getting away from that then he saw the signs for birmingham he had been there once before and they shone like welcoming beacons the teeming masses and young people sleeping rough in the subways he would simply be another dropout hed make it it would be much the same as london the last lap was the most difficult the coming dusk the sprawling suburbs the blindness in one eye and the burning in his body he recognised spaghetti junction but was forced to skirt it it would be ironical to be picked up by the law now he branched off to the left towards aston some youths were idling on the pavement west indians they shouted something at him he yelled back viciously but the norton drowned his stream of abuse a huge roundabout confusing he went round twice then chanced his exit he knew he was lost now another island his engine coughed spluttered picked up again he took an inconspicuous side road a salvation army hostel on his left an officecleaning firm nextdoor then a small car park no barrier or gate the attendants hut boarded up two cars were parked over on the far side they probably belonged to businessmen staying late at the office for the sole purpose of screwing their secretaries he decided it reminded him of his father and he laughed aloud then the engine petered out altogether he began wheeling his machine on to the tract of open ground it was as much as he could do to move it as though every vestige of strength had deserted his burning body he leaned up against the wall fighting for his breath surveying his surroundings in the falling darkness he did not relish the idea of approaching the salvation army then his gaze was drawn towards a churchlike building on the opposite side of the road he watched two nuns cross towards it their dark robes swishing as they moved some rough ground adjoining the building long grass pressed flat by the bodies that lazed their days and nights away amidst the strewn litter a narrow lighted entrance in the old stone wall further up a queue some young some old others sitting on the ground eating then realisation dawned upon him a nuns free handout centre charity something he had always despised up until now he had not realised just how hungry he was thirsty too he had never been governed by principles only one you took everything you could get your hands on nuns or no he was determined to eat and drink unsteadily he crossed the road and gained the pavement opposite a hiccough and a curse from the shadows irish without a doubt just another drunk in a city teeming with them seeking oblivion in their own way whisky on thursdays when they drew their social security meths the rest of the week by the time he had climbed the low wall and mounted the litterstrewn bank he was breathing even more heavily the burning was in his lungs now everything around him was in shadow twice he almost fell over inert forms men already bedded down for the night but he didnt fancy sleeping outside in the autumnal atmosphere then he noticed the underpass opposite it would be warmer in there already others seemed to have the same idea he joined the end of the queue and hoped he would not have long to wait the scramble for beddingdown places was already in progress several in front of him were quarrelling three youths were pushing an old man about the latter slipped to the ground and lay there cursing them the others stepped over him richard followed them it was clearly a case of dogeatdog here the old man clutched at richards foot and received a weakened kick which sent the vagrant flat on his back laughter richard leaned against the wall he must not let them know how weak he was otherwise his own place in the queue would be in jeopardy god he could barely stand next please the sister of mercy was ladling broth into a tin mug she pushed it across the scrubbed trestle table towards him her other hand reaching for thick chunk of bread their eyes met his were glazed expressionless hers showed disbelief horror she recoiled her scream already rising to a shrill pitch her hand clutching the mug and knocking it over another nun came running down the passage she too stopped abruptly her hand going to her mouth to stifle her wail of terror richard stepped back half turned a dozen men blocked his flight back down the narrow stone passage young men old men dropouts drugaddicts methsdrinkers the scum of the city some of them would willingly have murdered for a fivepence piece but not this time the light from the single hanging bulb fell full upon his features the paindistorted face the weeping rashes the puffed eye the blazing hatred for his fellow creatures tis a demon from hell a drunken irishman muttered sprawling headlong over the prostrate old man in his own attempt at flight the fuckin plague mother ogod one of the nuns was still screaming the other had fallen to the ground in a faint fear lent new strength to richards ailing body those blocking his escape route parted only too readily to let him pass crossing themselves fervently eyes closed lest they might be gazing upon the evil one himself his progress was unimpeded across the litterstrewn forecourt screams and wails ringing in his burning ears he fell rather than climbed over the wall which separated st chads convent from the maze of underpasses dimlylit passages faced him lighting long smashed by vandals his breath came in fiery gulps searing his own face he fled blindly though there was no pursuit only footsteps coming towards him sneaker pumps padding frenziedly the two parties met at an unlit junction three youths two of them carrying homemade coshes the third held an open flickknife in his right hand an unopened handbag in the other muggers they were breathing heavily after their fast sprint from the scene of the mugging in nearby st philips churchyard all four pulled up abruptly the one with the handbag acted first his knifearm went back then plunged forward swiftly richard fell to the ground the blade embedded deep in his abdomen fingers clawing desperately at the smooth concrete beneath him dirty broken nails split his blood formed a spreading scarlet pool but there was no further pain everyone has his limit and richard coyles had been reached at last the three youths paused momentarily the killer intent on retrieving his knife reluctant to leave behind any evidence with his foot he rolled the limp body over on its back as a faint beam of light from the adjoining passageway fell directly upon the festering face a single eye stared up at him slowly reddening as though liquid fire blazed within it all three froze in immobility for fucks sake the murder weapon was forgotten as three terrorstricken muggers fled blindly evil in all its forms was abroad this night that face belonged to satan himself kent looked no different from when bob coyle had last seen him three years ago the london journalist had an agelessness about him short cropped fair hair that rendered flecks of grey invisible a reddish bronzed complexion that somehow buried any lines that might since have appeared he had a square jaw that bespoke determination a stockiness that would not turn to fat or at least would disguise it five feet eight he had something else too a kind of sex appeal which was not apparent until a woman came to know him well that seldom happened for he was a loner he had told coyle once that he was forty coyle had happened to know that he was fortythree but he did not expose the lie there was no point kent was kent a good friend if he took a liking to you a bastard if he didnt nobody used his first name few even knew it just kent kent walked into the offices of the herald at am everything about him was immaculate perhaps he had driven straight up from london without pause maybe he had snatched a couple of hours sleep behind the wheel of his mercedes in a layby either way there was not so much as a crumple in his saville row suit hi no handshake just an easing of his body into the one vacant chair he might even have been part of the regular setup for he had a knack of adapting himself to any situation a politicians scandal or an oxide leak it mattered not he was the man for the job kent and coyle it was a natural teamup they spent a full hour in uninterrupted conversation coyle doing most of the talking several tunes they heard the telephone ring in the outer office and annes muffled voice answering it they were not disturbed even a call from the highest authority would not get past her impenetrable line of defence coyle told kent everything his suspicions about an oxide leak jane anne sarah richard and balzurs curse the other listened intently filling and lighting his aluminiumstemmed pipe with meticulous care the tiny room was soon filled with tobacco smoke something else too tension jesus kent was one of the few pipesmokers who inhaled the strong smoke regularly youve sure got problems mate big ones any ideas about richard the last time i knew him he was a rebellious sixteenyearold who would oppose authority in every form he hasnt changed but he wasnt a killer im a pretty good judge of character something drastic has happened to him a complete mental reversion youre right but he wasnt the sort to go berserk overnight different if hed gone on to drugs but it wouldnt be easy up here not like london if you want drugs badly enough you find em kent said anywhere however the problem can wait until he turns up in the meantime weve got to get cracking on this oxide business were up against a brick wall there in your case yes kent tapped out his pipe in the ashtray and immediately began to refill it i dont wish to belittle you bob you were one of the best on fleet street once youd have made it big if youd stayed there but up here you just dont count a small local paper expanding yes but youre too easy to gag they cant do that with me to some extent youve cooked your own goose by direct opposition to the unions to the men in power i agree with your views but these tin gods cant silence me freedom of the press still exists coyle nodded he wished that he had sent for kent earlier and hoped it was not too late now kent picked up the telephone coyle pushed across a scrap of paper with some digits scribbled on it the londoner nodded as he dialled dyne as usual was unavailable a conference kent said he would ring back in half an hour he declined the offer to speak to either stafford or tyler soon the two of them went out to lunch together a newly opened restaurant some five minutes walk from the herald offices kents gaze took in his surroundings as they walked down the street old properties sound enough in construction yet scheduled for demolition queues forming outside confectionery and butchery shops the premises not yet expanded to cope with the sudden increase in population a town that was bursting at the seams a valley that could barely accommodate the sprawling suburbs a place that could disintegrate in a matter of seconds with one nuclear accident and not just here either the whole country too as they ate he casually observed those seated at the tables around them it was a modern restaurant that had everything an extensive menu sophisticated soft lighting background music good service yet something was missing he was well into his main course before he realised what it was there was no buzz of conversation a crowded room the diners virtually silent occasional comments but no flow of smalltalk already he knew that this was a town of fear a population trapped by its own environment each and every one of them knew they knew too that there wasnt a damned thing they could do about it they were all victims of the new society the plutonium society the pluto pact and whether it was balzurs or oxide reprocessings mattered not at pm kent managed to get dyne on the telephone coyle listened intently to his colleagues words from across the desk and it was soon evident that this time there would be no rebuff once again coyle recognised the power of fleet street and particularly of kent the man the name it made all the difference dyne was doing most of the talking coyle could not catch the words but was aware that the big man was not now resorting to his usual mode of bluff so pm tomorrow then kent concluded coyle will be coming with me yes two passes please well collect them at the checkpoint oh all right send them down here if you wish goodbye he replaced the receiver and his expression was grim crisis meeting tomorrow followed by a press conference at two oclock that means you and me and half the journalists from fleet street are probably already making plans to head north something really big that they cant hide any longer but they havent shut down the whole plant just that one section the secretary of state for energy will be arriving in the morning thish be my big story boy by the way do you really believe that stuff you wrote i mean about the curse some sixteenthcentury wizard condemning craiglowrie to cremation and damnation stranger things have happened coyles expression was grave what is plutonium except a tool of pluto ruler of the fiery underworld is it coincidence that out of the whole of britain this accursed valley was chosen for reprocessing the stuff still id like to think theres nothing in it a lot of the locals are getting scared and the authorities are blaming me for scaremongering but i felt a responsibility to my readers to put the picture before them the internal phone rang annes voice was apprehensive chief superintendent rollason bob put him on there was an abruptness caused by fear in coyles voice any news of my boy not yet the superintendents voice had a trace of weariness in it three hours sleep snatched in twentyfour cannot easily be disguised another murder oh my god a known prostitute she was killed by a youth known to us rupert copeland he was found dead some distance away from her body the news is official now if you want to print it maybe he did the lakin girl in no chance hopes raised and dashed instantly what did copeland die of its all in the autopsy official secret at the moment maybe itll be disclosed at the press conference tomorrow so you know about that too tm attending a crisis meeting up at the nuclear station in the morning thanks anyway coyle realised the futility of asking further questions let me know the moment you have any news of my boy he replaced the receiver and turned to kent another whore murdered and a young local vagrant dead they wont reveal the circumstances until tomorrow anyway i see kent puffed at his pipe more furiously than ever well all we can do is wait ill look in at one of the hotels before the fleet street army arrives youre welcome to kent shook his head youve got your problems mate some that i cant help you with ill phone through to my editor about the murder just to let him know i havent come up here for a holiday coyle put on his coat in the outer office he paused and slipped an arm around anne tm sorry about tonight darling therell be others plenty of them i hope meanwhile lets hope well have some news of richard soon whatever the news coyle knew it would be bad his son faced a murder charge there was no getting away from that fact and he would have to print the details in his own paper right now though there was another task which he did not relish he must return home and face his wife and daughter chapter there was an air of emptiness about the house as coyle let himself in the temperature gauge below the barometer was proof that the central heating had not been switched on that day fear stabbed at him almost in a frenzy he dashed from room to room returning finally to the kitchen the heart beating frantically for one brief moment he had feared the worst jane wasnt the type tobut he knew only too well that there wasnt such a thing as a type people took their own lives for a variety of reasons some for none at all and jane had reasons he stiffened as he heard a key being inserted and turned in the front door a slim silhouette was framed in the doorway sarah youre home early she did not meet his gaze as she took off her coat anne otherwise engaged tonight perhaps she doesnt want to associate with the father of a murderer for the second successive day he felt the urge to strike one of his children probably only the fact that she was a female spared her the blow his fists clenched then relaxed theres been another murder did you know i was informed officially no word of richard no i suppose id better get us something to eat there was a slight relaxing of the tension wheres your mother your wife is spending the day with mrs bean sarcasm and disapproval although i doubt theres much more the old bag can tell her she now knows all about your affair with anne and yours with houston well thats stale news now shes behind the times i sent david packing back to his wife i hope but hell find another woman coyle hoped she did not hear his sigh of relief at least something was turning out right suddenly came the shrill ringing of the telephone he lifted the receiver coyle rollason here the gravity of the superintendents tone conveyed the message ahead of the words i take it youve found my boy yes im afraid we have dead yes in birmingham christ coyle was trembling he sensed sarah listening at his side her face close to his shoulder how well knifed at least thats what finally killed him what do you mean im afraid i cant say any more official secrets i guess more than my jobs worth no doubt itll be revealed at the press conference tomorrow thanks thanks anyway coyle turned to sarah he slipped an arm around her and she made no move to resist him two people needing each other and afraid to show it hes dead then coyle nodded she buried her head in his chest sobs shaking her body they had never been close but he wished to god he could find some tears from somewhere right then instead he just had to bear it the buildup like a volcano that cant reach an eruption he steered her into the adjoining room still holding her he somehow managed to pour a couple of stiff whiskies fragments of broken glass still littered the carpet the stains on the wall had dried shortly before eleven oclock jane returned she took her time removing her coat hanging it up in the wardrobe went upstairs to the toilet almost as though she was afraid as though she knew and was postponing having to face them at last she entered the livingroom her face was white with black lines beneath her eyes where the mascara had run she had been crying she stood looking at the two of them wideeyed her voice low and husky when she finally spoke richards dead isnt he i know i dont know how but i know she sat down in the nearest armchair coyle knew that none of them would go to bed that night nobody spoke again they just sat there not looking at each other a family which had fallen apart and once again he was reminded of balzurs curse that morning mclellan was an hour earlier than usual as he walked the short distance from the municipal carpark to the council offices there were several matters that required his attention before his colleagues arrived there were a couple of letters concerning building contracts for the expanding estates which he preferred to type himself there would be no carbon copies corruption was in the headlines all too frequently these days he had nightmares about seeing his own name there in large type on the front page of one of the dailies yet he was still prepared to take the risks the financial rewards could not be ignored his foot kicked against a dead pigeon sending it bouncing and rolling into the gutter it was strange the way so many feathers flew up from the small corpse the wind whipping them into the air like a miniature snowstorm he felt momentary anger the old town was full of feral pigeons and had been for the past decade those socalled pigeonfanciers were to blame originally just like those other people who dumped unwanted pets to roam the streets the pigeon problem was worse though they shit all over the buildings and pavements the square stank of it he could have solved the whole problem two years ago when he first came to office alphachloralose was the answer a form of powdered chloroform which when mixed with scattered grain gave the birds a perfectly painless death once the ministry of agriculture had tested it on woodpigeons but too many other species of bird life had died as well the method had been declared illegal sod that it would have saved the town some thousands of pounds in labour each year and then he saw a second dead pigeon lying on its back in the centre of the road wings spread feet upwards a third lay less than a yard away squashed almost beyond recognition except for the mass of bluegrey feathers which the wind was whipping up funny how the feathers came away so easily exposing he had always believed pigeon meat was dark unwholesome looking with revulsion he now paused to study the flesh red raw and weeping a yellowish pus horrible mclellan felt the bile rising inside him and quickened his step three less anyway and he had far more important matters to attend to he rounded the corner into the square the only truly historical part of the town which still remained a cobbled rectangle in the centre a statue of robert burns copied from that in dumfries one day perhaps his own monument would stand alongside it burns and mclellan he stopped and stared dreams of future fame evaporating like the early morning mist as the sun began to creep over the peaks of the mountains which formed this valley the whole square was littered with dead pigeons dozens of them most lying on their backs a few had clustered together as though seeking company in their last moments some were lodged on parapets and most of the gutterings were blocked mclellan stood amazed but felt no pity relief and excitement yes but why had they all suddenly died overnight even during recent severe winters only a few had perished of course he laughed aloud as it dawned upon him someone had acted on the idea he had put forward two years ago alphachloralose some wellmeaning citizen had distributed the doped grain during the nocturnal hours so that the birds would find it at dawn it was mass extermination and long overdue mclellan walked carefully across the cobbled square stepping over the dead birds noting with continued revulsion how clusters of feathers still fell away from the lifeless bodies his small eyes darted everywhere looking for scraps of the poisoned food but there was not a grain of corn or a crust of bread to be seen only dead birds their feathers still blowing in the wind exposing more patches of bright red festering flesh he retched and was grateful that he never breakfasted otherwise he would have vomited a lorry trundled through the town centre the driver apparently oblivious of the dead birds in his path a veritable blizzard of feathers followed in the vehicles wake leaving crushed birds blood and bones in a trail of wholesale destruction otherwise there was no sign of human life too early still a dim fear gripped mclellan he would have welcomed the presence of the old roadsweeper with his heavy barrow and broom but mclellan remembered that the fellow had been made redundant only last week the refusecart had taken over his duties now much more efficiently and it did not start out until am mclellan glanced up at the clock on the townhall a sudden movement startled him in this place of death squinting without his spectacles across at an alley opposite he tried to discern the shape which was still halfhidden in the gloom then recognition a dog an alsatian it was watching him too involuntarily mclellan stepped back a pace never a doglover he certainly did not uke the look of this one its coat was covered with mange its pointed ears erect lean and hungrylooking it reminded him of a wolf he stood watching it grateful that the entrance to the townhall was only yards away but it appeared to lose interest in him and moved forward to pick up one of the dead pigeons in the still morning air mclellan could hear the large teeth crunching on frail bones with an exclamation of disgust he hurried into the townhall and hurried up the stairs which led to his private office those two letters had to be typed at any cost at am he managed to contact the refuse department and spoke to a junior clerk giving orders for the dead pigeons to be removed as soon as possible after that he stood in the window of his office over the square observing the reactions of people passing on their way to work horror disgust bewilderment an overall fear that went deeper than the scene of feathered death all around them many of them were still nervous because of that silly article coyle had written in the herald damn him by he was growing angry there was still no sign of the refuse cart that bloody coyle would be printing yet another piece in the herald about local government inefficiency mclellan was on the point of picking up the telephone to give the refuse department a bollocking when he saw two large yellow vans enter the square and halt in the midst of the carnage but they were not council vehicles mclellans curiosity was aroused what was going on four men climbed down from the rear of each vehicle all clad in white protective clothing made from some stiff material their faces hidden behind visors in the squareshaped headpieces kneelength boots of the same substance caused them to move jerkily and unnaturally as if in an early silent film elbowlength gloves also hampered their movements and soon they were operating huge pairs of tongs to pick up the dead pigeons and deposit them in rows of polythene sacks throughout the whole operation inquisitive bystanders were brusquely ordered away but a small crowd gathered at the far end of the square the men worked diligently ignoring them like bloody astronauts mclellan muttered to himself but he was too intrigued by the bizarre proceedings to make enquiries at this stage perhaps the refuse department had invested in new equipment if so he had not been informed he would oppose the matter at the next meeting such luxuries could not be tolerated during these times of drastic cuts in public expenditure the full sacks were stowed in the vans and a series of aluminium collapsible ladders were produced the ascent to the parapets and gutterings looked exceedingly dangerous mclellan was forced to look away he had always suffered from vertigo the remaining pigeons lodged on the buildings were also collected and stowed away in the vans next came the brooms long handles wide heads pliable steel bristles all six men swept the feathers working downwind driving them into a corner where two walls met they seemed determined to gather every single one by midday the job was nearing completion and the groups of bystanders had drifted away roadsweeping was hardly the most exciting of spectator sports except seemingly for mclellan for nearly two hours he had remained in that window watching as though hypnotised now the vans were loaded sacks of dead pigeons and feathers ladders and brooms all stowed away the drivers were back behind their wheels engines ticking over two of the strangely clad men walked slowly purposefully towards that alleyway opposite this time mclellan was wearing his bifocals and could see everything plainly they stooped and lifted something of considerable weight then began to lug it towards the nearer van a shiver ran down mclellans spine and he moistened his dry lips as the men below him slung their load into the vehicle even in death its form was only too recognisable the alsatian dog the vans drove slowly away and only then did mclellan move from the window it was ten minutes to one by his wristwatch he picked up the telephone and dialled the number of the refuse department no reply after a couple of minutes he slammed the receiver down angrily the fact that they were clearly taking an extended lunchhour would not go unnoticed he rang again at but the line was engaged permanently it seemed he tried a variety of other departments highways transport and vehicles but none could assist him in his enquiries at four oclock the refuse departments line was still engaged mclellan experienced a peculiar sense of foreboding coyle and kent approached the checkpoint at pm in the latters mercedes the same stolid sentry emerged from his box from the passenger seat coyle could see the face of the man in the upper box peering down at them through the small aperture this time the entry was much easier almost as though they were welcome coyle was sure they werent but there was no delay in the raising of the barriers once their passes had been scrutinised kent noticed three cars following them the press was certainly here in force beyond the second checkpoint coyle noticed an array of cars parked outside the administrative offices and counted them there were twentyfour including two rollsroyces three mercedes four jags maybe the secretary of state for energy had not yet left possibly the crisis meeting was still in progress in that case the press conference would be late starting what the hell i want to know what all that business in the square was about this morning he said to kent thats just one of a hell of a lot of questions i want to ask the other replied dead pigeons dead whores dead vagrants details of your lads death in brum officially withheld and its all going to come out this afternoon no halftruths the whole story remember one thing pal its these boffins who are doing the sweating the advantage is ours weve got the easy part weve only got to ask the questions theyve got to answer them after parking the mercedes they made their way to the main entrance the same guard was on duty and coyle wondered idly what shifts they worked holocaust had a kind of permanency about it and a dedication shown by its servants again coyle was struck by the number of intersecting corridors the closed doors on either side the ceaseless murmur of voices the distant hum of machinery this time they took a different route or at least he thought so it was difficult to be certain the atomic energy authoritys armed private policeman marched stoically ahead of them indeed they had to increase their pace to keep up with him reaching an unmarked door on their right they were ushered inside a large room with no windows lit solely by fluorescent strips it was crowded some twenty men of varying ages occupied the available seats others stood hi there kent wondered when youd be turning up kent nodded to several but there was no hint of friendship even towards those whom he had known for years they were the fleet street army with some provincial journalists and reporters too ruthless newshounds with one single quest in mind later all the lines to london would be jammed coyle felt strangely insignificant a sensation akin to that of a student at a senior debate it annoyed him damn it hed started all this without his initial perseverance none of them would be crowded into this waitingroom now nobody was smoking even the might of the press had conceded to the rules kent toyed with his pipe in his pocket but left it there he only ever contested major issues seems like this crisis meeting is continuing longer than they anticipated kent said to coyle it was already other reporters fidgeted only kent appeared to be entirely at ease he had played the waiting game too often through his career some of the others were already making anticipatory notes on their pads kent smiled softly to himself impetuosity but there would be no jumping to conclusions on his part he would make very few notes anyway yet his story would be the first and the best to hit the country no sensationalism just the facts and the way he interpreted them suddenly the door was thrown open kent was already moving towards it coyle at his side it was this way gentlemen please only as they reemerged into the featureless corridor did coyle realise just how tense he really was soon they would know the truth soon the entire country would know that was what worried him most of all balzur hadnt just cursed craiglowrie and its inhabitants his evil was now stretching out to embrace the whole world chapter the large room was again windowless and illuminated by striplighting rows of seats facing a raised platform a psychological advantage for the men seated at the long curved table above it might have been a television quiz programme in which competitors would be made to feel nervous a sensation of confronting superior knowledge well that was what it was coyle reminded himself those men up there were the ones who knew but there was one important difference they were the ones who had to supply the answers kent noted immediately that the secretary of state for energy was not present there was one empty seat so he had already made his departure a tactical move or more pressing business back in the capital it could have been either the journalist reserved his judgement he counted the panel eight in all coyles gaze focused on each of them in turn winston dyne sat in the centre still outwardly confident but a man like that would be capable of maintaining a bluff exterior at all times no matter how grave the situation stafford representative of british nuclear fuels kept his eyes fixed on some papers in front of him expressionless tyler representative of britains hazardous materials group seemed decidedly nervous he drummed incessantly with his fingers on the table top chief superintendent rollason was stolid as usual but without the eternal cigarette there were four others all bearing the stamp of highranking governmental service one would almost certainly be from the radiological protection board they sat with elbows resting on the table fingertips pressed together a longpractised pose intended to convey a calmness an illusion that all was perfectly under control there was an uneasy silence broken only by a few coughs from the press they were eager to begin dyne appeared to be in no hurry another ploy to dispel any sense of panic kent decided finally the head of oxide reprocessing rose to his feet his composure was perfection itself gentlemen his eyes flicked briefly over the audience below him my colleagues and i are here this afternoon to counter certain rumours which appear to have escalated to enormous heights firstly i shall explain the true position to you exactly what has happened here and i beg you to bear with me until i have finished after that we will do our best to answer your questions but in an orderly fashion please i assure you that no facts will be withheld from the public he paused his eyes met coyles and lingered for a brief second hatred coyle did not drop his gaze it pleased him to think that perhaps he had brought about this conference brought the facts to light dynes gaze elevated he stared at the rear of the room addressing them all kent noticed the four ae a policemen standing at the rear total security no chances were being taken the whole country is aware winston dyne began of the exact purpose of this place to recycle imported nuclear waste and give a boost to the economy the rewards if successful will be a thousand times greater than from north sea oil however there are risks to quote a much used phrase nothing ventured nothing gained get to the point somebody muttered in the background but the remark was ignored dyne was not the type to be ruffled in his carefully prepared speech we have taken risks and most unfortunately we have experienced a setback you will no doubt recall the leak at windscale in well a similar thing happened here although on a much smaller scale to begin with we located the leak in section number eight and laid off those workers concerned whilst repairs were carried out this harvest process although far more advanced presents greater problems in the case of a mishap however the blocks stored for an eternity in a bed of granite more than a thousand feet below ground level are perfectly safe the leak did not come from there but from a backlog of waste brought in and not yet processed the delay was due both to increased importation from other countries and the fact that the reprocessing system can only operate at a certain speed unfortunately some radioactivity escaped into the atmosphere we have rectified that by the installation of a traptower the whole of our stock is now confined within this and no further radioactivity can escape into the environment you have my word on that a government ban on further importation of nuclear waste is being brought in today the secretary of state for energy has just left for a cabinet meeting to take place in london in a few hours time i expect the prime minister to make a broadcast to the nation sometime tonight why the panic if youve already contained the leakage the question came from a reporter somewhere at the rear the full effects of radioactivity in the environment can only be guessed at dynes answer revealed a note of irritation at being interrupted before the completion of his carefully prepared oration a man has died in this town another a worker actually engaged upon the section in question fled south and also died animal and bird me seem to be particularly vulnerable some pigeons and a stray dog died here this morning however the spread of radioactivity is governed by climatic conditions winds may carry and deposit it over a relatively harmless area a note of optimism kent smiled wanly to himself official pills always had a sweetener has the leak been fully checked apart from being contained within a structure carefully prepared for such an occurrence it was kent who spoke hesitation on dynes part a hint of embarrassment but only for seconds no it has only been contained then there is a buildup continuing in your structure the equivalent of godknowshowmany atom bombs reporters were on their feet a barrage of angry questions kent remained seated coyle gripped the edge of his chair how are you going to stop it let it all out poison everybody the jumbled questions were shouted by numerous angry voices order please dyne held up a hand and coyle noted with satisfaction that the mans composure had been visibly shaken his face was white and he seemed to have aged decades silence please the four security policemen had moved away from the corners of the room poised for action any hint of a riot and they would move in at once doubtless a score of others were within call let me finish but it wasnt dyne who restored order and caused the reporters to resume their seats it was the threat of state police something hitherto unknown in britain it registered on every one of them big brother thank you dyne glanced at those seated on either side of him t am merely putting the facts before you and trying to cover up a few too a sullen reporter heckled shut up a hardfaced policeman one who craved for such action loader chief of the aeas private police force it is not our intention to withhold anything dyne had almost a note of pleading in his voice facts that is what im giving you so you can go from here and phone your respective papers i am stating that there is a dangerous buildup of radioactivity which currently is only being contained our only remedy at this moment is total reprocessing all nuclear waste contained in this station now stored in section number eight must be reprocessed in the quickest possible time and the blocks laid to rest in granite with a minimum escape of radiation all men previously laid off have now been recalled twentyfour hours of nonstop work is in process in the hope in the hope that a disaster may be averted only two alternatives are open to us we can either release this buildup of radiation and accept the terrible consequences or face the possibility of a nuclear explosion the like of which mankind can never fully comprehend our gauges show a slow but steady rise in radioactive leakage within section eight it is a race against time gentlemen can we complete the reprocessing and thus avert a catastrophe how long have we got it was kent who spoke softly but his voice carried to every corner of the room which had suddenly become unnaturally silent it was the question everybody wanted to ask though fearing the answer i dont honestly know dyne replied slowly that is something none of us knows britains hazardous materials group british nuclear fuels and the radiological protection board are all working in conjunction it is estimated that reprocessing could take up to ten days to complete even with our much advanced systems but can we beat the rate of radioactive leakage and buildup none of us can answer that one the prime minister himself will inform the nation of the situation there will of course be an official state of emergency right away people will panic but we cannot hide the truth it will be impossible to evacuate the whole country but the effects of such a disaster would reach wider than britain itself coyle was now on his feet questions hammered inside his brain matters of national urgency yet his parental instincts predominated the bodies of the two men who died from radioactive contact his voice was unsteady fighting to get the words out copeland and my own son what will happen to he could not finish dyne looked down at the table as he replied cremation a total extermination of the whole body including disposal of the ashes is the only answer we dared not contemplate anything else dared not im afraid it was impossible for you to be informed before this press conference but there had to be no delay everything the two men the women the pigeons the dog they have all been cremated coyle felt his senses spinning his vision blurred a fleeting fiery flash in his memory a face illuminated by flames so very old almost recognition then it was gone as though shutters had closed to blank it out for a moment he thought that he was going to faint a firm hand pulled him back into his seat kent knew that words would be superfluous so that is the position gentlemen dynes voice droned on he had said it all now told them everything the barrage of questions was already beginning but there were no real answers no excuses although there would be scapegoats himself mainly a country a world less than ten days away from potential annihilation has little patience questions and more questions and still more dyne was grateful to stafford and tyler for helping him out eventually he glanced at his watch he was already late for his appointment with the representative of the powerworkers union there could be no question of a walkout by the labour force a state of emergency would be officially declared within a matter of hours no negotiations pay what the hell did pay matter the men would be forced to work under armed guards if necessary tons of nuclear waste had to be committed to its last resting place in the shortest possible time and the end justified the means his sympathies lay with the prime minister in the event of the worst happening he would have to make the decision release the radioactivity or risk an explosion it was the sort of decision to be determined by a referendum but there was no time to consult the country an hour a minute might determine success or failure at the very end coyle was aware of kent leading him from the meeting questions were still being asked parried partially answered it might go on for another hour nothing further was to be gained by remaining a policeman escorted them to the mercedes and kent drove back to the herald offices anne looked up from her typewriter as they entered she could tell from their expressions that something had gone drastically wrong everybody in the town sensed it those pigeons it wasnt natural at lunchtime fellow diners in the wimpy bar had talked of nothing else pluto himself was bent on their destruction with a curse more terrible than even their primitive forefathers had dreamed of ill make some tea she moved towards the kettle strong and sweet kent attempted to smile pulled out his wallet and dropped a tenpound note on her desk the whisky appears to have run dry of course she picked it up and hurried outside it was quite obvious to her that coyle was badly shaken she had never seen him quite that way before and it hurt her five minutes later she returned with the whisky and a tray of tea and withdrew there are times when men need to be alone kent swallowed a strong measure of whisky and let his tea go cold whilst he telephoned his editor in london he talked for twenty minutes before he replaced the receiver he shook his head trying to gather his thoughts the prime minister will speak to the nation tonight kent said my story will be in the early morning editions along with everyone elses by then the nation will know and all hell will be let loose were going to witness something which has hitherto only been the figment of fiction writers imaginations ill put a fiver on one thing though a coalition government that figures and canverdale for prime minister you reckon hes the best weve had since winston churchill winnie had a fleshandblood enemy to fight but this is different nothing tangible reminds me of something my dad once said about the danger of electricity you cant see it or hear it coming until it gets you this is the same if it blows well probably never know a thing about it canverdales still our man kent poured some more whisky for both of them maybe hes the one person who can keep the country calm bob were staring anarchy in the face god knows whats going to happen but whatever it is itll be breaking within a matter of hours coyle fell silent thinking again of richard theyd burned his boys body in a furnace along with a vagrant a couple of whores some sacks full of pigeons and a dead dog and he had to explain it all to jane she would not understand but all the same he had to tell her there was anne too he wanted her to know about everything before the broadcasts started kent seemed to read his mind ill leave you to it for the rest of the day he stood up glancing at his watch it was going back to london the other shook his head last place i want to be right now somehow i dont fancy fleet street any more maybe in ten days time it wont exist at all funny thought no dailies no one to read em i guess this is as good a place to die as any it used to be coyle said bitterly they made it like this dyne and his boffins used to be just heather grouse and sheep now these scientists are going to destroy it a dead world just as an old wizard prophesied four hundred years ago the contamination will last a quarter of a million years i wonder if life will begin again then and what form itll take if it does anyway thanks a million kent just having you around but kent was gone gratitude always embarrassed him he looked up at the sky as he walked slowly back to his hotel it was blue and cloudless the surrounding mountains already hazy with the gathering autumnal mist an unexpected sadness engulfed him somehow he had missed out on an awful lot of life and now time was running out ten days perhaps less the span of his life was now determined by the radioactivity rising within that single giant reactor known as section eight anne listened in silence as coyle talked she was not afraid in some ways she was glad she wondered vaguely in whose arms her lover would decide to spend his last hours hers or janes weve a lot of living to do in just ten days she ventured when he had finished well go out together the words she had hoped to hear i shall have to tell jane about richard tonight shell hate me even more after that maybe ill tell my parents about us too she smiled it would be nice to clear up all these lies and deceptions before thats up to you he said and what about the herald not much point in bringing out another edition is there i mean everything will be in the dailies nobodyll be interested in local news we could always print a mass obituary in advance they both laughed morbid but anything that made light of the situation seemed funny every minute every second was precious an embrace a lengthy one those few nights apart had seemed an eternity tomorrow night bob i promise he drove home slowly through the traffic reluctant to reach his destination any diversion would have been welcome a breakdown a puncture but the old avenger was determined to remain faithful to the very end coyle was surprised to find another vehicle blocking his driveway a tenyearold morris minor immaculately clean in spite of the corrosion on the sills he parked in the roadway the car was familiar and he had decided upon its ownership before he stepped into the house the elderly male voice coming from the sittingroom confirmed his guess the local clergy had called in person the reverend james mortimer coyle took off his coat and lingered over hanging it up in the hail wardrobe mortimer and he were acquainted on business terms mostly through the printing of church notices hi the herald obituaries special services and such that was where it ended though coyle had little time for organised religion mortimer had a ruddy face that was just too cherubic to be true a black homburg hat and kneelength overcoat a longstemmed black rustic briar pipe he smoked a strongsmelling latakia mixture much in contrast to kents sweet bonded flake the clergyman was seated in an armchair still wearing the coat hat on his lap pipe between his teeth jane sat opposite wearing a charcoalgrey dress and it was obvious that she had been crying for most of the day mr coyle the reverend mortimer rose shakily plump pink hand outstretched my deepest sympathies in your tragic loss i came as soon as i heard i have spent the afternoon with your wife and i trust that ive been of some comfort to her during this terrible time janes eyes met her husbands they narrowed there was no forgiveness in them she did not speak a very painful subject mortimer resumed his seat talking incessantly bob wished the clergyman would leave but a freshly poured cup of tea told him that would not happen for the next quarter of an hour the funeral mortimer struck a match and proceeded to relight his pipe your wife is in favour of cremation its already been carried out coyle broke in cruelly recent events bringing about a desire to hurt jane and if he offended the vicar as well well that couldnt be helped richard was cremated this morning along with a couple of slags a tramp ninetyseven pigeons and one alsatian of doubtful pedigree there was stunned silence and mortimers pipe fell into his lap jane just stared with disbelief then contempt it was clearly a joke in very bad taste youre very unkind and hurtful she restrained a whiplash of words and held back the tears were arranging it with mr wain for next tuesday then forget it coyle snapped the bodies were radioactive theres been a leak up at holocaust as will be described by the prime minister on television tonight i was at a press conference there this afternoon its no longer an official secret ten days and we live or bust its as simple as that they had to get rid of the dead bodies as quickly as possible it hurt me just as much as you but there was no other way we must face up to facts there isnt much time left jane was becoming hysterical again the reverend mortimer moved quickly to her side and a comforting arm saved the situation temporarily coyle wished he could find some excuse to leave them to it your statement confirms rumours which have been circulating in town recently mr coyle coyle was surprised how philosophically mortimer took the news possibly it was easier at his advanced age for five years apart from christenings weddings and funerals my congregation has barely exceeded three full pews three weeks ago it began filling up at communion matins and evensong pleasing to some extent but in my heart i knew the reason fear a turning back to a forsaken god repenting praying for deliverance deliverance from this hell which has sprung up in our very midst our valley turned into hades itself i noted your recent article on balzurs pact with pluto to destroy the people of craiglowrie a very old legend referred to in some of the church archives passed on by word of mouth down the generations i wish you hadnt printed it old beliefs can be very frightening at times like these of course theres no truth in it just an old fable nevertheless with peoples nerves now stretched to breaking point it could spread hysteria i beg of you not to print anything more about balzur the ruddy cheeks had paled coyle lit a cigarette he wished mortimer would go away and leave them to it this was the end of his marriage to jane and he wanted to get it over with there would be no time for divorce proceedings what the hell did it matter anyway but we mustnt overlook the fate of your poor boy satisfied that jane was not going to break down the vicar returned to his chair and once more attempted to light his pipe of course he was not responsible for his actions we must proceed with the memorial service as arranged mrs coyle leave everything to me tuesday at pm coyle showed him to the door but did not remain to see him reverse hesitantly out into the road he went straight back into the livingroom jane sat still and silent with no sign of tears they had all been shed only the bitterness remained in the awkward silence he poured himself a whisky he decided against offering her one there were still fragments of glass on the carpet is it true what you said jane spoke at last her eyes fixed on her husband id hardly lie about a thing like that would i no i suppose not only lifes been nothing but lies lately lies lies and more lies still itll all soon be over wont it over for all of us this crazy balzur youre obsessed with will have his way in the end it rather looks that way with a radioactive leak either itll have to be released into the atmosphere which will poison us all or else therell be the equivalent of countless atomic bombs exploding just up the road exactly who will make the decision ive no idea and even if the level of radioactivity isnt reached jane said theyll be left with a cloud of deadly vapour which they wont know what to do with theyll probably find some way of solidifying it and disposing of it along with the rest of this bloody waste and well all live she laughed this time hysteria predominant i pray god that we dont oh god how i pray that we dont have to live on any longer any of us chapter friday midnight the prime ministers broadcast to the nation followed the latenight horror movie fantasy suddenly becoming reality earlier announcements meant that many people stayed up late for it though most had no idea of its context beforehand possibly the pound had crashed others went to bed at their usual time it would all be in the morning papers anyway coyle sat beside a silent jane neither had spoken for the past three hours the television had blared on none of the programmes registering in their bemused brains at last came the special announcement coyle wondered why all earlier programmes had not been suspended no that would have been a mistake the facts had to be put before the nation with a total absence of melodrama the full effects would be felt on the morrow in spite of everything life had to maintain a level of routine everything could not suddenly come to a halt coyle became aware that the prime minister was simply reading the same speech which dyne had delivered at the press conference earlier that day word for word it was like sitting in a cinema watching the whole performance for the second time the pm looked grave as he had every reason to be but his job was much easier than dynes there were no questions to answer no live audience to vent their wrath on him and the very fact that this disaster could happen he concluded has forced the government to introduce an immediate state of emergency all airports private airfields and shipping ports are henceforth closed down and this action will be under the direct supervision of the armed forces i must stress that these bans may be lifted within a matter of days all steps taken are of a temporary nature with the interests of the public foremost the sweetener coyle smiled grimly to himself the treat after the medicine the nation was being treated like a small child but this was how it suited the government stop panic and rioting at all costs democracy itself was at stake coyle wondered how many planes had already left the country carrying people who had received a tipoff from friends in high places their efforts to find sanctuary would only be temporary a disaster of this nature would have worldwide repercussions there would be no escape for any of them he switched off the television all over the country now people would be sitting in their homes staring in shock at a square of nothingness a crystalball forecasting their futures oblivion he resumed his seat and lit a cigarette wondering if the two of them would sit there all night not speaking totally divorced from every human relationship they had known he glanced sideways at jane maybe he ought to make some coffee wheres sarah the thought suddenly came to him he remembered his daughters admission that she had terminated her affair with houston without him she had no reason to stay out late of course there were other men upstairs in bed she went straight up when she came in from work or maybe you didnt notice bitterness he did not reply sarah would be upset at the breakup with houston coyle wondered whether he should go up and check if she was all right he decided against it she would be in total ignorance of the threat they afi faced no point in telling her now she could use all the sleep she could get finally he got up and made some coffee strong and black jane drank hers in silence everywhere right now coyle realised people would be making coffee beds would be ignored a long night lay ahead for the nation sustained by alcohol coffee and tobacco whilst their brains reluctantly accepted the situation saturday morning dawned cold and grey the mist was thicker than the met office had forecast and slower to clear the surrounding mountains were invisible as kent made his way along the deserted streets towards the herald offices coyle had given him a key but he had no idea what he was going to do there no point in ringing london again yet perhaps towards midday he would try and get hold of dyne attempt to discover how fast the radioactivity level was rising and then make another report the newsagents stall on the corner of the square was not open yet that angered him a world crisis but one had to wait until normal opening time to read about it he had half expected to see crowds on the streets people loading their precious belongings into their cars in an attempt to put even a couple of hundred miles between themselves and this impending doom he was almost at his destination when he heard the rumble of heavy vehicles the pavement beneath him vibrated slightly the leading vehicle rounded the corner an armoured truck another three four five he counted ten in all as they passed him slowly and came to a halt in the square soldiers began disembarking kent stood in the doorway of the herald automatically stuffing tobacco into the bowl of his pipe his keen eyes missing nothing he noted how the heavy vehicles were parked in a line that completely blocked the road running through the centre of the valley perfectly positioned from kerb to kerb the soldiers moved with quiet efficiency no bawled orders from a senior nco each man knew what was expected of him each carried a slung rifle kent wondered if the bullets were rubber he noted too the riot shields being unloaded and the open crate on the tailboard of the centre vehicle tear gas soldiers stood around the vehicles wary not lounging steel helmets too not a beret to be seen a couple of officers wore battledress and peaked hats they merely watched the proceedings all so thorough in every aspect kents eyes wandered up towards the still invisible mountain peaks possibly the southern ones would remain shrouded hi mist throughout the day he knew the army would be there too blocking the pass the road that led down through moniaive towards dumfries he admired their sheer efficiency he had seen it before on his several trips to belfast the army just moved in nothing spectacular but one knew they were ready for any eventuality this platoon had probably come direct from edinburgh their orders issued prior to the prime ministers speech last night a nocturnal military takeover this the dawn squad would have been the last to arrive nobody would be entering or leaving the valley he let himself into the building fully aware that the soldiers were watching his every move until the door closed behind him they were not concerned with what he did inside contrary to his earlier plans he picked up the telephone as an experiment he guessed what would happen and he was correct no sooner had his forefinger dialled the first two digits than the disengaged signal was sounding a perpetual monotone communications had been suspended kent sat down hi the swivel chair and relit his pipe then reached in the cupboard for the whisky bottle his recent promise to coyle to remain here until the end was now an enforced one mclellan had sat in a daze throughout the hours of darkness his wife edith a small frail woman was virtually in a state of collapse after the broadcast and having helped her upstairs to bed he had come downstairs again by am the ashtray was full of chewed cigar butts and the atmosphere in this spacious room was thicker even than the rolling mist outside his first fear was of dying he would never forget the sight of those dead pigeons and the alsatian in the square yet until this massive conurbation had claimed the valley he had looked forward eagerly to the weekly grouseshoots that was a form of death that had pleased him elated him when a dead grouse rolled on the sparse heather a measure of his skill it had put him amongst the landed gentry it was pursuit of this sport that had resulted in his first meeting with mcloughlin he remembered word for word those two letters he had typed mcloughlins tender for the new estate would be granted mclellan would see to that would have seen to it he chewed angrily on yet another cigar the houses would not be built now nobody would need them those already erected would be blown up with the rest of the valley the whole country a movement hi the corner of the room caught his eye a sudden stiffening of his corpulent body a tensing of every nerve he saw that alsatian again skulking in the alleyway scavenging the diseased pigeons the way it had regarded him steadily as if to say youre going to die just like me then he relaxed again with a sigh of relief the yellow labrador ageing now moved out from its resting place and came towards him it too remembered those glorious days amidst the heather the dead birds waiting to be retrieved mclellan stroked the smooth head something to occupy his restless flabby hand he would have had the dog put down after the grouse moor had been built over if it hadnt been for edith she loved this dog a lot more than she loved him it was funny he hadnt petted the animal for ages perhaps all this business had something to do with it a kind of reconciliation his thoughts moved to the gun in the hall wardrobe a purdey worth at least a couple of grand a sign of affluence at any shooting party there were cartridges too maybe half a box one shell would be sufficient so easy he could opt out of this waiting game settle for death and have done with it he half rose but flopped back in the chair he tried to find excuses why he would not go through with it the radioactive level might fall life would revert to normal mcloughlins tender would be accepted and mclellan would get his payoff all in hard cash as agreed perhaps he would move out leave edith here in this place with her beloved dog she wouldnt object another cigar more melancholy thoughts again everything closing in upon him something in the prime ministers speech came back to him animal and bird life is apparently more vulnerable to radioactivity than are humans he sat bolt upright gripping the upholstered arms of the plush chair damn it those grey squirrels that infested the garden every morning surely the squirrels would be affected too and he could stop them something to do he had to take it out on someone or something one small shred of satisfaction before he struggled out of the chair and lumbered into the hall listening for a moment there was no sound from upstairs he did not want edith to hear him assembling the purdey she might jump to the wrong conclusion he returned to the lounge with the guncase and that last box of cartridges there was a clinking of steel as he fumbled assembling stock and barrels snapping the foreend loudly to secure the weapon the welloiled breech opened noiselessly he dropped a cartridge into each chamber and closed it then he flopped back into the chair breathing heavily the dog ears pricked in anticipation of an outing nuzzled against him roughly he pushed it away with a whimper of disappointment it retired to its earlier resting place behind the settee gun across his knees mclellan lit another cigar and settled back to await the coming of daylight his cigar smouldered for a while then went out his eyes closed and he fell into a fitful doze somewhere far away he heard the rumble of heavy wheels probably more waste being brought in for reprocessing it was full daylight when he awoke stirring slowly at first then struggling to his feet as everything came flooding back to him a moment of panic as he stumbled towards the bow windows overlooking his large garden perhaps he was too late he opened one of the windows quietly his head ached abominably but he ignored it only one thing mattered so long as the creatures had not already come and gone this damned mist he cursed as he saw it swirl around these upper reaches of the valley resting the gun on the sill whilst he put on his spectacles to see more clearly he peered intently a faint movement a breath of sudden mountain breeze which temporarily cleared away a patch of the grey vapour he pushed the window even wider and picked up the shotgun the squirrels were there again as he knew they would be they hadnt missed a morning in his garden for a month now horrible ratlike grey creatures they scuttled through the small orchard ravaging the unpicked fruit he stood and watched from behind the open window revulsion building up inside him his hands clasping the loaded twelvebore were clammy he glanced at his watch am the yellow labrador by his side growled softly the dog knew they were out there too it looked at the door and whined softly not today old son mclellan muttered grimly naturally the labrador didnt understand it wasnt worth the risk of radioactive contact anyway mclellan turned his attention to the squirrels again four of them were in the nearest tree the two old ones and a couple of youngsters somewhere there were two more he eased the safetycatch forward on the gun he should have shot them weeks ago all too easy he raised the gun to his shoulder he had already gone over in his mind last night how he was going to do it the old ones first they wouldnt know what had hit them then a rapid reload the young ones would be too surprised to run he took a bead on the adult male first she was looking towards the house beady eyes glinting evilly but didnt appear to see mclellan the creature was munching ravenously his fruit his hand shook but he steadied his aim and squeezed the trigger gently the report was deafening in the confined space of the room the dog jumped up and ran to the door whining and scratching at it mclellan moved the twin barrels a foot to the left and followed the course of the female as she ran out on to a thick branch the other two followed in her wake she had sounded the retreat mclellan winced under the recoil of the second explosion but he saw the squirrel drop instantly plummeting earthwards to disappear into the long grass beneath her offspring stopped looking about them fear evident in their tiny eyes orphans at his mercy he opened the breech of the shotgun and the two spent cases bounced across the room he grabbed two more from the open carton on the windowsill fumbling them into the chambers fearful that his next two victims would suddenly spring from sight and be lost but they still crouched there on the branch he took aim again a sense of elation surging through him it had been easy and he had enjoyed it this time two shots rang out in quick succession as he transferred the barrels to the two younger squirrels squeezing the rear trigger almost before the dead creature in the lead had hit the ground four shots four kills as he opened the door he felt something squeeze past his legs then simon the labrador was dashing into the garden nose to the ground in search of a scent come back he yelled heel you bloody idiot it was no good the dog had always run intoshot and this occasion was going to be no exception whatever else he lacked simon certainly made up for it with his nose even as mclellan rounded the corner of the house he saw the labrador emerging from the long grass with a squirrel in his mouth then mclellan stared in horror it wasnt dead it was kicking furiously in the dogs jaws head darting upwards trying to reach the throat it was the female and she was squeaking with rage determined to inflict her revenge upon those who had killed her family suddenly the dog dropped her and bent to pick her up again intent on securing a grip that would crush the life from her she was too swift for him a wriggle and a leap and she was hanging on to his lower lip the still morning air was disturbed by a canine yelp of pain mclellan stood transfixed as he watched this duel to the death simon flung his head upwards which dislodged the squirrel and sent her spinning a yard in to the air catching her on the way down this time he made no mistake her tiny bones crunched in his jaws and then he dropped her a lifeless bloody grey bundle in the grass blood dripped from the dogs lower lip but he turned and went in search of the others minutes later four dead squirrels lay on the path at mclellans feet simon wagged his tail and looked up his lip had almost stopped bleeding now mclellan glanced at the corpses and thought again about radioactivity well they looked healthy enough but he could not take any chances suddenly he vomited forgetting the dog for a moment then it happened it was all so sudden that mclellan had no time to think out of the corner of his eye he saw simons lips drawn back in a vicious snarl his eyes rolling and he was bounding towards his master snarling ferociously it was the sight of the open mouth which panicked mclellan into instant action the dogs jaws were foaming those squirrels he had been right about them after all and if simon bit him mclellan had automatically reloaded after the last two shots he threw the gun to his shoulder fumbled and pulled both triggers simultaneously his eyes were tightly shut as the recoil threw him backwards he sprawled headlong fearful lest those awful frothing jaws should fasten in his throat aghast at the possible consequences he lay there listening afraid to look apart from the cooing of woodpigeons in some distant trees there was silence then he went back inside the house the local telephone exchange appeared to be functioning normally as he put through a call to the radiological protection board a van arrived within ten minutes its colour yellow reminded mclellan of the larger ones used to clear up the dead pigeons in the square the two men also wore protective clothing where are they mate mclellan stared at a pair of eyes behind the mask instinctively he found himself backing away pointing towards the rear garden with a trembling hand the voice reminded him of a transistor radio which was not properly tuned to the right station everything about them their puppetlike movements total impartiality suggested robots he forced himself to follow them at a distance holding his throat they went to the squirrels first picking them up one by one a cursory examination aided by some kind of matchboxsized instrument placed against the rough fur all four were cast to one side rolling over and lying inert on the gravel path their instrument had not detected any radioactivity they were satisfied all just routine only the dead dog remained unexamined well i suppose wed better have a look at him together the two visored men pulled this dead labrador on to the path both knelt down as they applied the small detector again one shook his head slowly his companion had prised open the dogs jaws with gloved hands look at this a nod of a head indicated that mclellan should step closer he approached hesitantly to within a yard of them the dead dogs mouth was still held wide mclellan peered forward adjusted his spectacles bloodied gums something else too a swelling the size of a songbirds egg at the back of the throat he looked for the familiar yellow puss but could see none thats wot is trouble was a cockney accent discernible even through the filtered mouthpiece as the man from the radiological protection board released the jaws bloody wasp stung im in the mouth the two of them were already on their way back to their van callouts would be many some genuine others false alarms but none could be overlooked sent im crazy with pain ed ave been all right though appens to lots o dogs no need to ave shot im squirrels neither still spose you cant take chances these days pity about the dog though the engine purred into life and mclellan watched the van disappear around the bend in the drive beyond the rhododendrons after some minutes he walked slowly into the house the effort of climbing the wide staircase was greater than usual for the first time since he had met her mclellan felt afraid of edith for thirty years he had dictated dominated and she had cowered before him and now he had destroyed the only living thing for which she had any love he quietly pushed open the bedroom door the curtains were still drawn and he could barely discern the details of the room he moved towards the bed walking on tiptoe she lay on the nearside still sleeping clumsily his hand knocked against something on the bedside table a small bottle it fell on to the thick carpet and rolled a few inches even in his dazed condition he knew that it should have rattled it sounded empty he did not trouble to unscrew the cap to ascertain his worst fears neither did he pull back the bedclothes his sudden fear of a timid woman blended into another kind of cowardice he retraced his steps more slowly than before down the stairs across the hall into the room where the purdey lay on the table the window was still wide open the mist outside had thickened again infiltrating the house a slight acrid smell as he opened the breech again only one cartridge this time the lefthand chamber he had no idea why he went back out into the garden perhaps it was an inbred respect for his domestic chattels the rewards of corruption he experienced some difficulty in reversing the shotgun barrels so that the cold steel penetrated his open mouth whilst enabling his short arms to bring his stubby thumb to bear upon the lower of the two triggers after several attempts he managed the required stance a short laugh trumpeted down the gun barrels mcloughlin certainly wouldnt get his tender accepted now even if the booming report echoed around the surrounding hills dying away slowly in the still atmosphere in the offices of the herald kent and coyle regarded each other grimly they had counted the number of shots during the past hour maybe seven some stupid bastards are trying to break out over the hills coyle said the army cordon must form a complete circle they dont mean anybody to get out or in theyre trying to isolate this radioactivity hoping that whatever has already escaped into the atmosphere will be contained in this valley by the surrounding mountains all depends on whether a strong wind gets up not even the mountains could stop it then were caged in its like putting a mesh fence around a warren of rabbits which have contracted myxamatosis chapter even in a time of nationwide crisis saturday is a day of leisure amongst the british people sport predominates no matter what it is estimated that on average half a million people normally attend soccer matches on that day thousands follow racing rugby and other outdoor pursuits millions more follow radio and television coverage in this respect the prime ministers broadcast was well timed saturdays sporting fixtures remained unaffected the full implication of the impending disaster would not be realised for another few hours a breathing space had been gained by those in authority except in one sprawling town within the valley of the shadow of death coyle was surprised to see anne walk in shortly before eleven oclock normally the herald offices were closed on saturdays she smiled but could not hide the strain she was feeling you neednt have bothered i felt i had to get out just go somewhere i knew youd be here youd better join us in a whisky then an hour later kent managed to contact winston dyne hows it going the reporter came to the point quickly still rising not as fast as it might though the shifts are working very hard trouble is theres only room for the allocated number of men too many would get in each others way any trouble with the workers i mean a spot of bother with the shopstewards to begin with the men were out for twenty minutes theyve gone back on treble pay quadruple for the weekend work i tried to phone my paper all external communications have been suspended except that youve got a direct line to whitehall a shrewd guess on kents part naturally i can get messages out for you so long as they go through me personally ok fair enough but ill need a couple of passes to get in and out of your place a couple coyle and myself i see a pause well i suppose it can be arranged seeing that you do all the arranging i dont see any problems we cant declare an open day you know but ill see to it cant fix it before monday though ill have them delivered but you wont be allowed anywhere near section eight thats the last place in this goddamned valley i want to go kent replaced the receiver well weve season tickets for the show he laughed softly lets hope it isnt another mousetrap in the meantime im going to take a stroll around town i want to see how the maninthestreet is reacting to military law coyle was grateful to be alone with anne it seemed an eternity since they had last been together in private how did your folks take it he asked the news about us a bit shocked i think they were under the illusion that it was some kind of platonic relationship maybe just a flirtation they didnt make the fuss i expected though by the way where are we going tonight originally to the nith hotel in glencaple best meal on the west coast of scotland followed by a couple of hours of passion down by brow well robbie burns area ill bet he laid more than one wench down there however well never get out of this valley so i guess we might as well try that new chinese restaurant that opened last week and youll be going home afterwards she had to make an effort to voice her innermost fear he scratched his head thoughtfully no privacy at either your place or mine suppose we bring sleepingbags and a blowup mattress down to the office here anywhere her arms were around him their lips crushed together just anywhere bob so long as were together times running out fast i want to spend every possible minute with you attendances at football grounds throughout britain more than doubled on that saturday afternoon following the pms announcement yet many sensed it was but a brief respite before anarchy commenced one last spree and indeed there was trouble brewing at every ground before the ninety minutes were up no ardent fan likes to see his team defeated especially when it could be the last match the club would ever play ibrox was packed beyond capacity the disaster of the early seventies was forgotten and police diverted to crowd control had not a hope of enforcing the attendance limit if they had tried to do so the riots would have begun even before the game kicked off the old firm rangers versus celtic trouble was brewing and it had to come to the boil a final to end all cup finals the ultimate victors only in the end everybody would lose teams and supporters alike at old trafford safetyfences had a frail look about them with sixtyfive thousand king kongs about to burst their chains and go on the rampage the hooligan element had already devised a human ladder by which followers could gain access to the pitch the bottom rungs would soon be crushed beneath the clambering stampede but that was immaterial londoners were willing to spill blood at highbury where an influx of spurs supporters had infiltrated the home terraces and so it was nationwide and all of this was preceded by a mad saturdaymorning shopping and drinking spree money would soon be useless so spend it now on anything to hell with the law too no prison sentences would be completed a total breakdown in the system was beginning but sport must come first by midday saturday decisions had been reached about a coalition government canverdale was appointed prime minister although it would not be announced until monday morning meanwhile the rest of the world just watched and waited police forces throughout britain were stretched beyond their limits even with help from the armed forces all leave was cancelled and tanks occupied the entrances to heathrow and major airports still the crowds formed laden with suitcases and holdalls huddling together but mechanics had rendered the huge standing aircraft temporarily immobile trouble arose at biggin hill when an angry group of owners of small private aircraft demanded their machines when an official informed them from a distance by megaphone that all flights had been suspended this provoked outrage a dozen men with fully qualified pilots licences marched out in a column towards their silent machines suddenly a shot was fired over their heads by a young soldier sweat pouring down his youthful face praying to god that they would stop fortunately they did there was a huddled conversation some arguments a few wanted to risk it the majority decided against so they returned to their parked cars there had to be other ways the royal navy was doing its best to close all seaports their task was a much more difficult one than that of the army or the raf destroyers formed a barrier across the harbour entrances of dover southampton and portsmouth only foreign ships were allowed to leave this meant a thorough search of all vessels but no doubt a few stowaways made it safely but some smaller boats managed to leave from various points around the coastline with little trouble aberdovey harbour carnivallike with its multicoloured sails throughout the summer now presented a drab picture one or two crafts bobbing restlessly at anchor the season was at an end and most owners had towed their boats back inland for the winter months a decision regretted by those enthusiasts who could have waited another couple of weeks but some had fled out to sea small crafts riding low in the water dangerously overloaded with children pets and valuables the incoming tide brought many of them back dozens of lifeless bodies strewn amongst the debris of capsized dinghies and driftwood small parties of beachcombers ignored the corpses jewellery and rings were left untouched but occasionally an outboard motor was discovered still attached to the remains of some small boat which had failed miserably in its mammoth task then eager hands seized it angry voices quarelled over who had sighted it first sometimes there was a fight before the victor hurried from the beach with his prize a hurried rebuilding would occupy his next few days skilled or otherwise then another attempt at crossing to the irish shore it was a continual process fleeing from death dying in the process britain was now in total isolation from the rest of the world messages of sympathy flooded in from all parts of the globe and offers of help were unceasing but there was no time a whole country cannot be evacuated in a matter of ten days so canverdale adopted a policy of total impartiality nobody would be allowed to leave he and his ministers would remain to share the fate of the british people perhaps that gauge needle in section eight would drop back canverdale believed in facing reality but he was also an optimist that saturday the towns were packed with a christmaslike rush that lacked any atmosphere of festivity the stores exceeded all previous trading records but there was no gaiety it was indiscriminate buying almost in silence except for the jostling of bodies and the ringing of tills wines and spirits were most in demand for alcohol offered oblivion football fans flocked into the towns but the usual prematch rampages were few and far between instead there was a tension a hint of terrible things to come a buildup of frustration that would explode before the day was over by pm almost every means of access to football stadiums throughout the country had been officially closed but that made no difference to the crowds still queuing in the streets outside officials and stewards watched helplessly as young and old clambered over the locked turnstiles or crawled beneath them police made no move to intervene except to break up one or two brawls some early trouble began in the stands when seasonticket holders found their seats occupied by types who normally stood on the open terraces despite no standing signs the gangways were packed with longhaired hooligans determined to support their more fortunate companions who had taken over the seating a welldressed man with a large cigar was bodily thrown from his customary place in the waterloo road stand at molineux wolverhampton down into the enclosure below he suffered a fractured arm and injured two young children in his fall it took the st johns ambulance men twenty minutes to force their way through and their attempts to reach the ambulance outside were hampered by an unyielding mob cars were doubleparked everywhere and in his frustration the driver ripped the wing off a mini a pack of chanting hooligans was charging down the centre of the road waving their scarves like banners of victory as they anticipated fighting their way into the already overcrowded ground this mob barred the path of the ambulance ignoring its flashing blue light and blaring siren the driver kept his foot on the accelerator they would jump aside at the last moment but they left it until the very last second and the driver felt a bump on the nearside wing he did not stop rage welling up inside him gladly would he have run over the whole bloody lot of them more traffic jams fortyfive minutes before they finally pulled into the hospital one of the children a girl of about nine was certified dead on arrival but in all the stadiums a kind of hush prevailed amongst the fans as coins were tossed and teams lined up many of the spectators had not been to a match for years and for some it was a totally new experience an involuntary instinct to congregate a nationwide blowing of referees whistles synchronised for pm was followed by the expected roar as frustrations pentup during the preceding week were relieved at last but on this particular saturday afternoon this roar was magnified a thousand fold the plutonium threat was temporarily relegated and the national sport took over for a brief period ninety minutes at the most people fainted in their dozens amongst the throngs under normal circumstances they would have been passed over the heads of surrounding fans or down a gangway but today the fallen bodies went unnoticed as the remaining spectators swarmed over them a multitude of voices in one continuous roar as the football matches got underway the more violent fans felt increasingly inclined to take their revenge on opposing supporters as they might never get another chance they were determined to turn this into the bloodiest clash in soccer history before the final whistles brought it al to a close the mode of play was noticeably lacklustre that day packed grounds and deafening crowds usually lift players spurring them beyond the normal limits but today this was not in evidence passes went astray and good opportunities were missed possibly the players experienced that feeling known only too well by the veteran playing his final match before retirement this was the end after today they might never kick a ball again what the hell did it matter so roars of encouragement turned to hoots of derision there began a monotonous thumping of feet throughout britains football grounds regardless of the bodies of the fallen the bower boys had never had it so good unprotected heads to kick in blood trickling down the stone terraces and nobody taking the slightest bit of notice halftime radiocommentators conveyed the news to those listening in the comparative safety of their homes a host of draws game after game mostly scoreless as though the incentive to win had gone before the players had even taken the field bars within the grounds had been deserted by their regular staff the drinks were simply left for the taking in most cases everything was gone before the kickoff the regular hooligans helping themselves to everything in sight vandalism was only slight to begin with but followed in earnest during the interval stalls and vending equipment were smashed but the police remained unmoved all over the country when the players emerged for the second half the tension went far beyond football itself the shouting was now incessant but jeers predominated more bodies lay beneath the masses but nobody cared tension was rising fast and the explosion was bound to come before the remaining time was up facts and figures gathered later showed an almost coincidental timing of events it was certainly no more than minutes into the second half before it all began ibrox first or was it old trafford nobody really knew and still no goals the human ladders went into action the dead and dying forming the lower rungs youths clambered on to others shoulders sometimes a whole human structure collapsed screams muffled in the pileup and that made it all the easier for those following on clambering over the dead and injured breaching the security fences disaster resulted as exits collapsed beneath the mass exodus of the terrified rival factions battled on pitches everywhere players sought refuge in the dressingrooms vainly the police tried to intervene at villa park a giant hooligan with a pockmarked face was wielding an axe the blade honed to razorsharpness even his own comrades screamed and scattered before him a madmen bent on destruction there was no logic in his final gruesome act before being pulled down by four policemen a claret and blue scarf knotted around his waist villa in the lead and he beheaded the referee with one powerful swing it just didnt make sense at wolverhampton a linesman was knifed highbury saw the bloodiest battle of all twentyseven dead their blood staining the lush green september grass one hundred and eighty wounded seventyfive not expected to live but that did not include the number who had died on the terraces and in the stands it was the same story everywhere military vehicles assisted ambulances in transporting the injured hospital emergency services reached their limits and temporary centres were set up in civic centres and townhalls doctors worked ceaselessly alongside skilled surgeons but there was a limit to what could be accomplished many died before they received that vital surgery bodies remained on football pitches overnight covered by tarpaulins the mortuaries were full as many carried no means of identification a television announcement was made asking friends or relatives to report missing persons a terrible ordeal was in store for many a slow walk down row upon row of mutilated bodies hoping to god that one did not recognise a son or brother at police stations the telephone lines were permanently jammed eventually the football grounds were empty except for the dead the floodlights enhancing the gruesome scene but still the battles raged outside now the mobs rampaged through the towns hellbent on destruction of every kind not just the hooligan element now there were officeworkers bankclerks shopassistants normal people under abnormal circumstances in glasgow shop windows were smashed and a fire begun at a petrol station resulted in a devastating explosion which killed eleven people instantly it was the same story everywhere the battle of highbury was moving south rival factions appeared to have formed a coalition redandwhite and blueandwhite scarves were brandished side by side other groups joined them crazy mobs with no interest in either team football was forgotten it was plain moblaw now they had remembered the threat and they had a destination westminster and downing street they blazed a trail of destruction as they marchedshop windows private houses parked cars overturned mass frenzy then suddenly it all came to a stop as a line of armoured trucks barred their way soldiers fired shots into the air the retreat was disorderly panicstricken a total anti climax three rioters were trampled to death the oc was not fooled by the simplicity of it all a dangerous mob had been halted by one volley of shots over their heads simply because they had never come up against military resistance before they would retreat lick their wounds but next time a few warning shots would not halt them a bluff is seldom successfully called twice canverdale had snatched a few hours sleep following his appointment as prime minister and by midday sunday he was working with the efficiency of a welloiled machine tall and lean almost totally bald he had a resilience that was wellknown to all who had worked with him in his party in the past odds meant nothing to him he never gave up he ate sandwiches at his desk as he talked on the telephone he had no reservations about speaking with his mouth full and he had little patience with those who asked him to repeat a sentence the reestablishment of law and order was his priority for no government can tackle a crisis efficiently in the midst of anarchy he had the facts and figures of the previous days rioting on his desk before him they did not make pleasant reading his first call was direct to belfast he wanted uptodate information ahead of the press already he had contemplated a partial withdrawal of troops from northern ireland an auxiliary force a show of extra strength to curb the rising anarchy he groaned at the news saturday had been the worst night of terror in belfast for six years he had no time to listen to the details he sat through a call to the head of oxide reprocessing dyne sounded weary as though he had not been to bed all night well canverdale barked whats the current reading on our very own atomic bomb bad dynes sigh was audible over the line its risen three degrees during the night at the previous rate of escaping radioactivity it wouldnt have attained this level until tuesday which brings doomsday two days nearer canverdale pushed the plate of ham sandwiches away next saturday in fact a decision will have to be made on friday maybe sooner ring me if the pressure shows any signs of a further rate of increase he replaced the receiver and then made another call chapter sunday transistor radios had conveyed into the valley the news of the widespread rioting throughout britain coyle and anne lay listening to the extended bulletin it was warm between the folds of the two sleepingbags which they had zipped together the inflated mattress beneath gave them added comfort apart from the stark surroundings of filing cabinets and a desk heaped with pending correspondence they might as well have spent an adulterous night in some threestar hotel still clasped in the embrace in which they had slept they listened to every detail of the early morning london news the night of terror had now subsided somewhat the rioters were licking their wounds their losses heavy it was emphasised that no casualties were due to action by military law those who had suffered had done so through their own behaviour many unwittingly swept along in a tide of human madness there was no hint of further measures being taken to safeguard life and property the situation was static emergency services would be maintained people were urged to go to work as usual on the morrow there was optimism in the newscasters voice all part of the policy keep the people calm there was no mention of fuel rationing either coyle supposed there were sufficient supplies to enable britain to carry on until it disintegrated or by some miracle normality returned he leaned over to switch off the tiny transistor wondering what jane was doing without him the thought troubled his conscience it was bloody selfish of him he hadnt intended being absent the whole night but it had been impossible to drag himself away from anne there was so little time left dyou know what id like most from you bob she murmured beginning to fondle him again whats that id like to be pregnant a baby by you the idea flattered him something they had guarded against throughout the whole of their affair and now when she no both of them wanted it most it was impossible a strange quirk of fate he sighed deeply well we certainly didnt take any precautions last night and were not going to now she took the initiative and clambered on top of him the time of the month is right too even even if there isnt time left id still know how intuition something you just cant put into words some women are sure within a couple of days just something you know but cant explain they fell silent except for a quickening of their breath and the movement of their bodies she was pressing down hard on him then they were jerking in harmony clutching at each other her fingernails gouging his shoulders rolling out of the warmth of the sleepingbag on to the hardness of the floor they never even noticed it lying coupled for some time afterwards basking in the warmth of mutual love coyle hoped that he had given her what she wanted though precious few days were left intuition or not he wanted to hear those words from her own lips youve given me a baby bob the ringing of the telephone caused them to disengage with reluctance who the hell can be ringing the office on a sunday morning he muttered picking up the receiver and perching on the edge of the desk stark naked coyle speaking rollason here i tried to get you at home but your wife said you didnt come in last night getting a special edition out a hint of sarcasm no i just had things to catch up on i wondered if you were going to bring out a a final edition of the herald youre being pessimistic rollason it may not happen thats something we wont know until it either does or doesnt anyway i just wanted to ask you to play it down as much as possible a personal favour you must be fully aware of whats happening outside throughout the rest of the country im worried about when its going to start here so id appreciate it if you didnt dig up any more legends the military seem to be pretty well in control too much people are resenting it particularly the younger generation they might try and organise a mass exit from the valley or else storm the reprocessing centre either way itll mean bloodshed the army will open fire a few warning shots first but after that its a possibility coyle admitted a probability id say by the way have you heard about mclellan no all this must have sent him round the twist he slaughtered some grey squirrels in his garden then shot his dog his wife had already taken an overdose of sleeping tablets so he shot himself i see coyle did not experience one twinge of regret therell be a lot of suicides before this business is concluded people whod sooner get it over and done with coyle wished he could hang up anne was becoming impatient now stroking herself with her fingertips so that coyle could watch her every movement coyle dropped his free hand to his lower regions anne smiled then they heard a key turning in the outer door ill have to ring off coyle spoke quickly someones just arrived he replaced the receiver be with you in a minute he called out struggling with a shirt and slacks as anne dressed with haste also who the hell could it be the printers foreman ross not on a sunday surely they heard the rasping of a match then the aroma of sweetsmelling pipe tobacco crept under the door and their nostrils twitched with relief of course it was kent you can come in the london journalist looked like someone who had enjoyed a good nights sleep he seemed perfectly relaxed as always smoke curling lazily from the pipe between his teeth his eyes noted the crumpled sleeping bags but dismissed them tm sorry a genuine apology if id thought you couldnt be expected to coyle no longer resented the intrusion just the need to be up and about i find hotels claustrophobic particularly on sundays anne will make some coffee she was already filling the kettle there are some biscuits somewhere ive already breakfasted thanks but dont let me stop you three cups of coffee a tin of biscuits which nobody seemed interested in coyle seated in the swivelchair anne reclining on the inflated mattress kent leaning with his back against the wall one of many conferences taking place all over the world right now on the universal subject rollason just rang me coyle said said his main concern was rioting starting here in the valley hes got a point i passed the church on my way down kent spoke softly never seen anything like it ive seen folks queuing at cinemas for top billings at wembley for cup finals beats me why a place this size has only one church they never filled it before coyle replied it was adequate in the old days the regulars were a few devout parishioners the town mushroomed but the newcomers had no use for religion old mortimer had the cushiest job in the valley visited the aged and sick free meals wherever he chose to get em well hes working bloody harder now than hes ever done in his life before ill warrant kent placed his pipe in the ashtray and picked up his cup not only is the church bursting at the seams but theyre packing the churchyard outside communion therell never be enough bread or wine to go round unless he can conjure up some miracle akin to the feeding of the five thousand all types youngsters too the kind wholl pray today and riot tomorrow still i suppose it gives the authorities a breathing space ill be in church myself on tuesday coyle failed to keep the huskiness out of his voice a memorial service my boy i was hoping it would just be a small private affair maybe the army could keep the crowds out for you kent said just for half an hour but we dont know what the situation will be by then id better be getting home anne rose to her feet sunday lunch is a sort of ritual there always has been ever since i was a kid mum and dad arent happy if im not there id like to make this one something special for them it could be the last one ever she donned her coat and moved towards the door then turned her gaze moved from the sleepingbag to coyle her eyes asked a question coyle nodded they would both return here tonight no matter what the two men listened to her footsteps receding across the outer office the gentle closing of the door any plans for today coyle asked at length not really nothing much i can do for the moment except hang around and await developments like everybody else maybe ill take a stroll around the town ill come with you together they stepped out into the street the mist was clearing more quickly today the towering mountain peaks were silhouetted against the skyline through the thinning haze later on it would probably be warm and sunny another bonus for those maintaining law and order inclement weather is always an inducement to depression neither spoke as they crossed the deserted square a couple of pigeons flew from the head of robert burnss statue and alighted on one of the upper parapets of the townhall the two birds cooed softly and contentedly the drifting cloud of radioactivity had passed on coyle wondered if it had crossed the range of mountains how far it had travelled and in which direction it had to go somewhere this speculation was interrupted by the sound of voices hundreds of them low incantations not in unison the words incomprehensible unceasing the church congregation kent told him he looked at his watch tenthirty communion started at eight still going strong or maybe theyve gone straight on to matins somehow the voices seemed to draw their footsteps coyle found himself turning right at the end of the square kent had intended to bypass the crowd this time but instead he followed his companions route it was strange two selfconfessed atheists but still they headed towards the church both told themselves that it was just curiosity a few minutes later they saw the massed congregation men women and children temporarily united in worship no that was the wrong term coyle decided none of them worshipped anything outside their own little lives it was a gathering of people seeking to allay the terror which hung over them clutching at ageold beliefs just as their ancestors had done in balzurs day maybe elsewhere others were delving into the occult god or the devil they would sell themselves to whichever they thought might save them they had turned their fearcrazed minds back centuries resorted to the old ways a terrible realisation this was all part of the curse a subtle surrender to the left hand path not one of them realised it but subconsciously they were making a pact willing to trade their souls for an extended period of life coyle and kent stood and watched from the opposite pavement looking across the low wall surrounding the churchyard coyle had no difficulty in recognising the figure of the reverend james mortimer moving with difficulty amongst the crowds who were kneeling with heads bowed oblivious of the dewsoaked grass of the churchyard the vicars long black cassock was creased as he moved from person to person chalice in one hand gold plate in the other the server a youth in his early teens wearing a soiled surplice hampered by a large carton carried in his free hand additional supplies of wine and bread mortimers voice carried to the two spectators above the incessant murmurings in the name of the father the son the holy ghost this is my body take eat this is my blood drink may god save us all have mercy on our souls coyle and kent watched as though hypnotised neither feeling any cynicism suddenly coyle stiffened his fingers instinctively clutching at the arm of the man beside him kent followed his gaze an attractive woman in her midthirties and a girl in her late teens knelt side by side their features griefstricken he recognised them both jane and sarah almost in a trance coyle crossed the road looking neither to right nor left his movements jerky like a human automaton kent made as if to follow then checked himself this was one time coyle did not need him coyle pushed his way over kneeling muttering figures his progress slow finally he reached the two kneeling persons he sought jostling for a place alongside jane the ground was cold and wet saturating his trousers where he knelt he bowed his head after a time he sensed his wife glancing sideways at him and he turned his head their eyes met no surprise on her part certainly no forgiveness not even hatred nothing for her he was just another one amongst this multitude she turned her head away praying everybody prayed except coyle the reverend mortimers voice was closer now this is my blood take drink may god have mercy on us all face to face coyle noted the amazement in the vicars large round eyes the chalice was thrust into his hands he took it clumsily almost dropped it the wine was tasteless watered liberally to cater for the numbers the bread dissolved on his palate before he could swallow it he managed to mumble amen as mortimer moved on to jane and sarah it was only then that coyle remembered that he had never been confirmed as more people arrived in the street those who had taken communion left to make room for them coyle rose unsteadily to his feet but jane and sarah had moved on ahead they were lost to his view soon he found himself out in the street again where an even larger queue had formed awaiting their turn a sudden shout and bowed heads lifted in unison a man rose up amidst the praying throng a ragged vagrant his tattered garments exposing glimpses of grimy skin an almost skeletal hand held aloft his face was hidden amidst a mangy beard so that it was virtually impossible to determine his age his highpitched voice was rising to a frenzied crescendo eyes blazing insanely his mouth was a toothless cavity fools he yelled do you not realise that this is the day of judgement the long awaited day that balzur prophesied when pluto shall come to claim his own to take us down into his fiery underworld where there is nothing but eternal agony a gasp of horror rippled through the congregation a woman began screaming a child crying then with unbelievable agility the speaker leaped away hurdling the cringing people in his path until he was lost to sight his shrill warning still echoing in their minds silence except for the monotonous apparently unmoved tones of the reverend mortimer as he shuffled between the rows take eat this is my blood the opposite pavement was deserted coyles eyes scanned it for kent but there was no sign of the londoner out of this teeming mass only kent had not turned back to god he would see it through on his own right up until the end whichever way it went an atheist and a fatalist coyle debated with himself for some minutes his wife and daughter had doubtless gone home he could follow them but he knew he would not be welcome alternatively he could roam the streets in search of kent in the end he decided to go back to his office he could prepare some copy for an edition which would probably never reach the printing presses at least it was something to do until anne returned as he moved slowly away an armoured truck rounded the corner and drew up some fifty yards away from the packed churchyard the military were taking no chances for firmly held between two soldiers was the miserable tramplike figure now silent and subdued canverdale spent the rest of sunday attempting to list his new duties in order of priority everything of course was a priority nowadays especially with the unexpected three degrees rise in the radioactivity pressure gauge earlier that day but nevertheless certain things had to take precedence the public would be informed on television at the end of the evenings programmes that the prime minister had another broadcast to make that meant that at midday on the monday the coalition would be officially announced canverdale would then be fully in charge the banks would remain closed tomorrow also building societies and post offices that too would be announced on tonights latenight news but only as a temporary measure and not in any way to provoke sensationalism he decided against closing the stock market shares would crash obviously but there might remain some spark of hope if he allowed trading to continue likewise the foreign exchange market countries abroad must not presume that britain had capitulated to the disaster bluff and stall and keep in constant touch with dyne he sighed with relief at having made these decisions and fitted a cigarette into his long ivory holder flicking his lighter he considered some other factors the safety of the public the map in front of him showed the sitings of special shelters for use in the event of nuclear attack he approved the efforts of the authorities in constructing them but there were two main drawbacks firstly they could only accommodate a small percentage of the populations within easy reach of them and secondly this was no ordinary nuclear attack it was not a case of one or two atomic bombs but the effect of thousands of them exploding simultaneously with fallout coming like a raging blizzard the london undergrounds would be packed with people perhaps there was some way of filtering the ventilation shafts against fallout he made a note to investigate this possibility further then added another concerning the length of time it would be necessary for people to remain below ground he envisaged a new ratlike population human savages existing in tunnels of squalor there would be neither lighting nor sewage nor any of the other amenities which had been taken for granted for years finally the main decision would have to be made by himself release the buildup or chance an explosion die above or below ground he drank yet another cold cup of tea and put through a call to dyne a slight sigh of relief the needle had risen only one more degree since the morning the expected rate that still made saturday dday and the needle might decide to jump madly at any moment hardly had he replaced the receiver when another call came through the sabbath was over one day of respite and now saturdays madness had returned he jotted down the names of the places as he listened notting hill birmingham wolverhampton leicester coventry nottingham bradford alert all troops canverdales voice was weary the order was superfluous but he could not think of anything better the riots had begun again it was the desperate rebellion of frightened people trapped on an island of death canverdale knew that he would not have the chance of any sleep anarchy had forestalled his predictions by some twentyfour hours how long before it spread to other countries whole continents a worldwide holocaust was imminent chapter monday again coyle and anne had spent the night in the office but they were up and dressed before kent arrived whats the programme for today anne enquired as she adjusted her skirt same as for any normal monday coyle smiled wanly im just wondering how many will turn up doesnt matter really but weve got to make a pretence of some kind of normality the copy i worked on yesterday can go to the typesetters the printers will be kept fully occupied for the next couple of days with the parish magazine i see theres a lot of forthcoming weddings in the next fortnight poor sods maybe a few will be brought forward anyway its only a technicality a few words a bit of paper stupid really but thats the society in which we live bob she hesitated met his gaze dropped her eyes bob we are you and i i mean were married to each other arent we i mean well you know what i mean id just like to think that yes he slipped an arm around her slender waist and drew her close to him were married i guess bits of paper legal documents have lost all their meaning now to just about everybody morally jane has already divorced me of course i shall have to help her through tomorrow it will be a difficult day for all of us a funeral service always is but this type of memorial service is worse people feel a lot better after it its a sort of release afterwards you heave a sigh of relief shed a few more tears and life returns to normal anne fell silent a lot of things worried her after the church service on the morrow would there be a reconciliation between coyle and jane perhaps the marital ties were stronger than they appeared perhaps sarah would try to bring her parents back together and what if all this business up at the reprocessing centre turned out to be a damp squid no explosion no radioactive release what then had her own affair with coyle escalated to such heights simply because there was so little time left under normal conditions would they have simply remained clandestine mistress and lover until finally the affair petered out she too had prayed along with millions of others on the previous day she had asked god to grant her a pregnancy whatever happened she would not give up her man without a fight kent arrived shortly before ten oclock a few minutes later a uniformed man in a chauffeurdriven car delivered a sealed envelope addressed to the london journalist two checkpoint passes coyle noted the date of expiry the following saturday maybe they dont want us around for the big blow on monday kent pocketed both green cards picked up the telephone and was through to dyne within a couple of minutes a meeting was arranged for twothirty no delay or excuses this time seems like weve got the worlds most important press conference all to ourselves kent laughed as he replaced the receiver all those other silly buggers raced back to london with their redhot stories and now theyre not allowed back into the valley im hoping dyne will let me use his london line to speak to my editor coyle stared out of the window across the untidy yard only two absentees this morning and even they had taken the trouble to phone in with excuses perhaps here in this valley life would continue more or less as normal for a day or two a kind of isolated sanity cut off from the violence which raged elsewhere he phoned rollason the superintendent promised to seek the help of the military in keeping the crowds away from the church during the twenty minutes whilst grief dominated a small disunited family the meeting with dyne was a mere formality the head of oxide reprocessing did not reveal that the danger level had jumped an unexpected three degrees on the previous day it was a closely guarded secret if the public was to be warned of the advance of doomsday then that was up to the prime minister the initial escape of radiation kent made an attempt to establish what he and coyle had discussed earner it seems quite clear to me and surely to others too that it has moved out of this valley yes it probably has moved away dyne fidgeted uneasily however there have been no reports of contamination elsewhere in the country so we cross our fingers and hope that it has just evaporated kent said until there are reports of people breaking out in festering rashes or birds and animals dying in great numbers in a particular area it may not happen like that atmospheric conditions are capable of reducing its density obviously the square suffered its most concentrated form before it had had a chance to disperse fortunately it happened at a time when the resident population was absent what other effects might it have on animals or humans who can say mild skin irritations blindness deafness madness we can only speculate it could take years for a person to succumb to it id like to phone my editor dyne nodded but insisted on dialling the number himself he ascertained that he was in touch with the chief editor himself before passing the receiver across to kent the conversation lasted less than five minutes with kent doing most of the listening after all there was little to report from the valley the government was keeping the public constantly informed of events telling them only as much as it wanted them to know the riots are the worst problem at the moment kent said as he replaced the receiver bloody fullscale war but fortunately confined to certain areas so long as the army can contain them otherwise itll be total anarchy there are rumours in fleet street of us troops being flown in but that could present a dangerous threat to world peace russia has made a similar offer apparently just imagine it american and russian troops meeting on top of the biggest nuclear bomb in existence rumours dyne became his abrupt self once more rising to his feet to make it clear that the meeting was at an end thats half the trouble in a crisis such as this everybody speculates particularly the press if only people would stick to facts coyle and kent were escorted back to the mercedes and drove slowly back through the checkpoints nothing much gained there im afraid coyle muttered as they reached the outskirts of the town it isnt what they tell you that counts its what they dont tell you you have to learn to read between the lines danger level still rising at the estimated rate but is it how the hell would anybody know except them they dont know where the escaped radioactivity has gone however im sure of that our only means of communication with the outside world is through batteryoperated radios transistors homemade crystalsets they dont want us to see television the nearest transmitter has been temporarily put out of action why ill tell you because they dont want the people of this valley to see the things happening outside its one thing to read or hear about something quite another to view it with your own eyes see what i mean yes theyve got to prevent rioting in the valley at any cost coyle replied they cant take any risks of the centre being stormed that might set the whole thing off days before its time is up in other words theyre still desperately trying to buy time by letting you talk to your editor dyne knows you cant tell him anything that hasnt already been officially announced a good move on his part id love to be able to bug the line when he talks to canverdale though apart from one valley in the southwest of scotland the whole nation watched the ten oclock tv news portable sets occupied prominent places on the bars of crowded public houses hotel lounges were crowded without a doubt it was record viewing a number of cities were covered brief glimpses of the aftereffects of street battles the damaged property the fires still blazing despite the unceasing efforts of local brigades the worst scene was kept until last a halfdemolished street army vehicles blocking one end an inferno engulfing a row of terraced houses fireengines ambulances blankets discarded clothing covering huddled corpses yet to be collected a vicious multiracial mob having been forced to retreat some two hundred yards still shouting hurling missiles which were parried by riotshields halfbricks broken tiles anything no gunfire though so far the rioters had not been able to obtain weapons they had relied upon numbers but in the end they had been driven back volatile leaders urged the hordes to stand their ground there were promises of guns and already crude firebombs had devastated much property bottles half filled with petrol or paraffin burning rags for fuses many of the blazing houses belonged to the people themselves they did not care they would fight on until the city was razed to the ground the army would not be able to hold them in the end the television reporter was shielded behind a reinforced champ a relic of the same model used in the campaign against rommel with a rollsroyce engine which was why it was still in use the camera crew however were forced to expose themselves to the dangers of the missilethrowing crowd to obtain the most spectacular and horrific of the days events on film the reporter a stubble of beard on his chin eyes redrimmed clothing smokestained raised his voice in an effort to make himself heard rioting began early yesterday evening and continued throughout the night this is just one of many similar cases troops firemen and ambulances have fought an unceasing battle in this area alone it is estimated that the number of dead exceeds fifty the wounded many more military casualties have been slight but its clear that these mobs have no intentions of letting up and the cost of damage is already into millions of pounds tonight there will be no sleep for either troops or auxiliary forces however in the city centre itself today life has continued fairly normally given the conditions most officeworkers have reported for work as usual and public transport has been operating satisfactorily but after another night of terror it is doubtful whether many commuters will venture into the city tomorrow gerald watson news at ten birmingham monday pm canverdale made another broadcast in the calmest voice he could muster he advised commuters to stay out of the cities on the following day he added hopefully that soon the army and police would have everything under control the moment he was off the air he fitted a cigarette into the long holder applied the flame with a shaking hand and drew the smoke deep into his lungs if there was one thing he detested it was having to lie deliberately the truth was that in many areas the troops and police were being forced back the tide had turned and a backwash of bloody terror was swamping britain already a military escort waited outside for the evacuation of downing street canverdale was well aware that his next broadcast would be made from a secret underground headquarters in hertfordshire chapter on monday night coyle returned home and anne reluctantly went back to her parents just for a few hours out of the precious few left jane and sarah were seated before the small electric fire in the livingroom and both looked up as he entered their forced smiles meant nothing more than an acknowledgement they had guessed he would come sarah prepared a snack which none of them really wanted but they must pretend to eat something in the midst of this forced family reunion nobody spoke but the silence was worse than any backlash of words and coyle wondered how they would get through the long evening ahead the television was out of action of course and his transistor radio was still at the office he knew sarah had one in her room but that was not really a solution to their problem he took upon himself the chore of washing the dishes simply as something to do the thought of the long night frightened him at halfpast eight the frontdoor bell rang and sarah went to answer it from the kitchen he recognised the voice of the caller the reverend james mortimer the vicar had come on a mission of solace it was a valuable diversion coyle decided as he made some coffee he hoped that mortimer would not refer to his presence at the communion service the memory was distasteful to coyle because in his own mind he felt he had capitulated to everything he had opposed in the past no longer could he claim openly to be an atheist he had knelt and asked god for deliverance along with everybody else jane and sarah probably despised him for it and perhaps mortimer thought he had won a long battle and converted yet another to his fold coyle winced at the thought superintendent rollason telephoned me mortimer drank coffee even slower than he consumed tea with constant stirrings purely a habit because he did not take sugar the authorities will keep the crowds out of the church tomorrow just for the service of course i want to leave it a family affair just for you the population of this town are not interested in your grief jane and sarah looked at coyle he dropped his gaze there would be no reconciliation that was obvious their last outward show of unity would be a bereavement after that it was all over the vicar left an hour later sarah came back from seeing him out kissed her mother briefly ignored her father and went upstairs to her room at ten oclock coyle suggested that they too go to bed they would need every bit of rest they could get to prepare for the morrow he was somewhat surprised when jane followed him upstairs they undressed it was a sort of brother and sister affair as though both were being forced to use the same room she turned away from him as she took her clothes off unwilling even to allow him a brief glimpse of her naked breasts she was in bed before him on the far side facing the wall her back towards him he switched off the bedside light and climbed in beside her he could tell by her breathing that she was still awake and he contemplated slipping an arm around her one small gesture of comfort perhaps understanding he thought about it for a minute decided against it and turned over back to back their marriage was finished all right and he realised there was nothing he could do to save it he told himself that he had no regrets margaret houston was surprised when for the second evening in succession her husband did not go out a small flame of hope kindled inside her and she made a halfpromise to herself to visit the hairdresserss the following day perhaps she could start a diet too since her husbands affair began she had let herself go seeking solace in the company of the children eating the foods she enjoyed most heedless of calories she had no intention of finding another man even if david left her for good nobody could replace him she had seen sarah coyle about town attractive a young body but it could not be any more willing than her own but now david had stayed at home for two evenings sullen certainly but that gave margaret encouragement the affair bore all the signs of having come to an end perhaps sarah had found a younger lover a real boyfriend margaret was determined to seize the opportunity she would win david back again at least it was nice to go upstairs to bed together he did not make love to her on the sunday night but she did not expect it it would take time to get back together again deep within him david houston smouldered with hatred that stupid little bitch all he had given her too that was all she had wanted from him her wardrobe was full so was her jewellery box that made her no better than a prostitute as surely as if she solicited on the streets damn her he was well rid of her but his eager sexual appetite was already crying out for another woman he could have taken margaret of course but he dismissed the thought too easy too familiar he craved for a woman who would excite him with unexpected techniques one who would take the initiative he knew a woman who would fill his purpose though he had not visited her for six months he had no doubts he would be welcome but there was one serious snag the military the girl in question lived in dumfries and the fucking army was trapping him and his incessant lust in this bloody valley he thought a lot about it in bed on that sunday night at one stage he was almost tempted to pull his wife towards him and take her on monday his mind was made up he formulated his plans carefully throughout the day the pass was blocked there was no chance there there was a cordon around the moors beyond the surrounding mountains but how effective was it probably soldiers stationed at intervals crouched down in the springy heather for warmth during the cold nocturnal hours they did not know the moors like david houston did the old sheeptrack up to comharrow peak treacherous if one was not familiar with the climb a long crawl across the manquhill moor past the sentries then less than half a mile to the road down to moniaive he would follow it keeping to the edges diving into the undergrowth at the approach of every vehicle three miles to moniaive he knew he could pick up a car there donald would lend him his he would understand the army wouldnt bother barricading the roads into dumfries they would be too concerned with patrolling the solway shores to prevent people leaving the country in small boats with luck he could be in dumfries by eleven oclock in bed with this freeandeasy wench by midnight and of course he would not be coming back nobody in their right mind would return to this valley of death once they had escaped from it he left the house at nine oclock on the monday night margarets hopes fell but rose again when she realised he had not taken the car once clear of the sprawling suburbs david houston moved stealthily the moon would not be up for another couple of hours and by then it would not matter his keen eyes quickly grew accustomed to the darkness picking out any obstacles in his path several times he stumbled catching his foot in an unseen rabbit hole then the ground began to rise becoming steeper with every step he was now on the narrow sheeptrack leading up to cornharrow peak the most difficult part twenty yards or so one slip he tried to push from his mind that accident two or three years ago a couple of hikers both had gone over the one who slipped grabbing at the other and taking him too houston held his breath he felt the pounding of his heart a brief spell of vertigo then the path widened levelled out and the springy heather of manquhill moor was beneath his feet he breathed a long sigh of relief he needed a smoke but it was too risky all around him a black void no need even to crawl just tread warily jubilation it had come off he had beaten them they were too busy turning back cars at the pass but he had overlooked one factor a scientific innovation infrared lenses on telescopic riflesights realisation came to him in the vicious whine of an m carbine bullet passing a foot above his head the sharp report followed a tenth of a second later he remained standing the idea of flinging himself headlong into the heather never even occurred to him he stood in total surprise as footsteps approached one man not even using a torch damn the fucking army stay where you are mate that one was intended to miss the next wont just a vague shape denser than the enveloping darkness houston did not move the voice was young just a kid not too old to have his arse tanned except for that rifle houston wondered if there were others with him sure to be but how close back the way you came mate and dont hang about he could not think of a suitable reply not even curses he had made the attempt and failed now he had to go back move the command had more than just a ring of authority about it power after hours of boredom the soldier would probably delight in shooting again houston contemplated the return trip along that eighteeninchwide sheeptrack with an almost sheer drop on the one side for almost twenty yards are you going or aint you a metallic click he turned slowly away a finger rested on that trigger all the more dangerous because it belonged to a raw recruit margaret houston did not speak as her husband came into the bedroom and began to undress without switching on the light he was earlier than usual but he had been out tonight just when she thought that it was all over she couldnt hold back the sobs as he slid into bed alongside her tuesday the church was cold the primitive heating off too spacious for just four people three of them in the front pew coyle jane and sarah the reverend james mortimer stood on the altar steps his voice was low and at times the three could not discern his words no tears those had all been shed coyle felt the absence of a coffin made a mockery of it all the two women wished the vicar would get it over quickly so that they could return home no longer did this place have an aura of a sanctuary so much had changed since sunday it was more like a tomb as was this whole valley and the living just waiting to be buried balzurs curse was now a grim reality the ministers voice droned on the clamouring of the crowd outside was louder now penetrating the almost empty building they resented the army cordoning them off from their god some were threatening to rush the line of soldiers coyle sighed with frustration and risked a surreptitious glance at his watch no more than five minutes surely then they could go and the masses would fill the pews once more they would not notice the cold as they huddled together united in a common cause prayer overshadowed by terror a last plea for deliverance outside the soldiers had unslung their rifles a demonstration of military authority which the oc hoped would be sufficient the bullets were no longer rubber let us through you cant keep us out of the church for gods sake what next a man had pushed his way through the milling crowd his face white and strained he wore an oldfashioned mackintosh reaching below his knees he came to a halt barely five yards away from the muzzle of the nearest rifle it was david houston get back im a relative the service will be over in a few minutes couldnt get through the crowds let me go in just for the end please the soldier glanced sideways at his commanding officer the barrel of his rifle unwavering the latter sighed nodded reluctantly houston walked forward through the line of soldiers hastening towards the rotting wooden porch of the church they had not even asked for proof of his identity his nerve was almost at breaking point sheer desperation blind vengeance swamping all reason nothing else mattered there was nothing else to live for he clutched at something beneath the raincoat it weighed the garment down on the one side but nobody noticed everything now depended upon the gun which bulged in houstons pocket his long dead fathers favourite poaching weapon a singlebarrelled folding shotgun less than three hours ago it had undergone a few improvisations carried out with a hacksaw the skeleton wire stock had been removed leaving only the pistolgrip the barrel had been reduced in length cut down to five inches just above the chamber the range and penetration had gone along with the choke all that remained was a scatterpistol capable of inflicting a terrible wound if fired at close range after a lengthy search houston had discovered a cartridge hi the toolbox in the shed the paper case was damp and swollen and he had needed to force it into the breech yet the percussion cap was sound it would ignite threeeighths of an ounce of no shot destined for sarah coyles head her features would be unrecognisable afterwards as for himself he did not care everybody was under sentence of death anyway there would not be time left for a trial his tense fingers closed over the handle of the church door but it refused to yield he used his shoulder restraining the panic which suddenly engulfed him the bastards they had locked the door determined to go through with their memorial service to that useless lout uninterrupted houston stood back knowing he could not force an entrance a hail of bullets would cut him down if he tried instead he listened above the shouting of the crowd he could hear the reverend mortimers voice inside a low monotone may the blessing of god almighty holy ghost now and always followed by a halfhearted almost inaudible amen the service was over houston shook his head and retreated slowly down the gravelled path as far as the dilapidated gates hanging precariously on rusted hinges his mac was undone his right hand gripping the gun inside its spacious folds they would have to pass this way they took their time coming out and the crowd in the street was becoming even more restless only the rifles holding them at bay then the door opened slowly a gasp of relief from the surging watchers two hundred or more mortimer first a black cape over his white cassock jane unseeing coyle eyes on the ground sarah she looked up and saw him recognition and hate but no fear she had no suspicions looking away in contempt that was the moment when houstons rage erupted a red haze before his eyes as he saw her finely moulded almost aristocratic features his hate boiled then was icecold in the same instant the homemade pistol was aligned with the striking speed of a cardsharpers derringer three yards separated them ample his finger tightened on the trigger nobody would ever look upon that face again a shot rang out crisp and clear somebody screamed continued to scream jane coyle was ashenfaced rendered immobile by the suddenness of it all the crowd fell silent staring in stunned horror jane stopped screaming there was a faint mechanical sound scarcely audible as another shell replaced the spent one in the rifle held by the nearest soldier his features revealed a bitterness towards life itself death meant nothing to him it was routine a twoyear posting in belfast had made him that way it had also taught him to shoot fast accurately and instinctively you sensed trouble before it began and it was the first shot that counted determining who lived and who died a wisp of smoke trickled upwards from the barrel of his rifle he looked coldly at the body of the man in the raincoat lying less than ten yards away the gaping bloody hole in the back of the head the unfired still clutched in the lifeless fingers then sarah began to sob the crowd burst forward in one human tidal wave the scene before them a minor diversion as they fought their way into the church chapter tuesday night winston dyne was still at his desk he ate there and snatched the odd half hour of troubled sleep slumped across the paperstrewn surface leaving the room only to answer the most urgent calls of nature he was afraid to leave the telephone even more afraid when it jangled harshly but it was the dreams which frightened him most nightmares that vanished on waking leaving instead a fear that he could not recall nevertheless he was left with a feeling that something was dreadfully wrong something he ought to know then came the headache throbbing like a distant jungle drum as he drew the back of his hand across his forehead the fingers came away warm and damp his vision too was affected as though he was standing across the room watching his own feeble actions as though he no longer had full control of himself his head dropped forward his eyelids heavy fighting to keep awake in case the dreams came back at pm he was suddenly aware that he was wide awake again with a feeling almost of being totally refreshed perhaps he had reached his tiredness peak and surpassed it he would not need to rest again for another few hours he picked up some reports and began to browse through them old ones like newsreels of past events this disaster had been forecast a couple of years ago but not on this scale nobody not even the most sensationseeking reporter had envisaged the whole of britains nuclear reprocessing being carried out in one unit they warned of the mere possibility of people dying by tens of thousands in an area stretching six miles downwind of any particular reactor mentally dyne tried to multiply those figures to fit the current threat soon he gave up mostly because it hurt his conscience and read on for apart from the immediate danger zone there could be a toll of human life for as much as one hundred and twenty miles downwind thousands more would die mostly from cancer during the following decades one report stated that a radius of sixty miles from the exploded reactor would need to be kept clear of human habitation for a couple of years but at that period the true extent of contamination and its lasting effect was unknown nowadays they knew that in fact the radioactivity would last for up to a quarter of a million years he shuddered at the ignorance of his predecessors and continued reading as though some strange compulsion had him in its hold somebody had even believed that in calm weather there would possibly be no casualties outside the reactor complex the report concluded that this postulated combination of circumstances itself very unlikely combined with the severe and extremely unlikely accident to the reactor would cause several thousand deaths within a few weeks of the accident dyne wondered whose the italics were somebody trying to play it down he wished he had him here now sitting at this very desk he would have put him on a direct line to canverdale convince the rioters mate restore the country to a normality until saturday or else come up with a solution still more reports sheets of them mostly about a plan to turn marshland into radioactive dumps there were fears that thousands of acres of land surrounding rainham marshes in essex could be rendered sterile as a result all that had been solved by making one huge dump here in this valley what had coyle called it holocaust the ruddy man hadnt been far wrong there was one further note that future contracts were likely to include an option to return highactivity material once it had undergone the new harvest process of course to the country of origin that most certainly was out of the question now he wondered how the recycling was going his was the worst job of all being chained to this desk helpless god if only they could find some way of speeding up the process bury it all in that bed of granite a thousand feet below ground before danger level was reached that would be just one problem solved even then they would still be left with what resembled a giant pyramid filled with radioactivity tyler and his fellow boffins were working on a new process for solidifying it then it too could go down into that granite grave with all the rest untried of course everything here was untried experimental there had been outcries over reactors throughout the country so they had picked on one remote valley and now they had something a million times worse this was the plutonium society indeed he folded up all the reports and dropped them back into the file he referred to it as the dead file the understatement of the century just then the telephone rang dyne recognised tylers voice at once the gravity of the others tone warned him to expect the worst they had tolerated the usual onedegree daily rise it was too much to hope for even a steadying certainly not a drop until the new solidifying system was tried two degrees tyler said dyne sighed as he replaced the receiver doomsday was one day nearer friday he phoned canverdale at once when he replaced the receiver for the second time that earlier sensation of drowsiness crept back over him only this time it was different a kind of numbing of his brain a slowing down of his movements and something else a strange sort of smug satisfaction that brought a slow smile to his thick lips freezing them into a grimace like a childs halloween mask there was not even shock when full realisation filtered through to him just sitting there at his desk with that same glib expression knowing that which he had failed to recognise earlier and he remembered the dreams too understood them winston dyne laughed softly a harsh sound like the croaking of a distant raven he knew why section eight was going to explode in a very short time only he could stop the imminent holocaust but he wasnt going to at pm canverdale again spoke to the nation this time from his secret headquarters in hertfordshire his speech was the frankest he had ever made in his whole political career he did not however confess to the people about his former omission concerning the advance of dday from monday to friday he simply stated that because of an increased rate of escaping radioactivity assuring them at the same time that it was being contained friday would be crisis day his cabinet would meet tomorrow and on thursday night a decision would be announced obviously he concluded this radioactivity will not be released into the environment until the last possible moment when it is absolutely clear that an explosion is inevitable the like of which cannot be comprehended by mankind it has been pointed out to me that in the event of this holocaust the radioactivity will enter the atmosphere anyway the margin hi deciding between the lesser of the two evils is minute sanity must prevail every one of us clings to the hope that the structure in which the vapour is at present contained can withstand the pressure perhaps even beyond the limit our scientists have imposed upon it work is continuing ceaselessly in an attempt to deal with the remaining nuclear waste and thus reduce the rate of escape it is a fight against time a battle which can only be fought by a limited number of men within section eight tomorrow night i shall disclose the locations of nuclear shelters situated in or near major cities unfortunately these places can only accommodate a small percentage of the population the ministry of environment will issue instructions about the most suitable evasive action for the less fortunate to take i beseech you every single one of you to remain calm for only in this way can we avert the most terrible disaster in the history of mankind mass hysteria will only hamper our efforts and has already resulted in an alarming deathtoll once his address had been delivered canverdale felt somewhat easier of course releasing the radioactivity would be preferable to an explosion and if the rate of escape was consistent the problem would be much easier yet twice the gauge had risen alarmingly and unexpectedly the reactor could go up at any minute even before he had finished smoking this very cigarette he wondered if they would make it to friday the phones rang incessantly five secretaries taking the calls and bringing him only the most urgent messages throughout the night rioting everywhere an infection now spreading to all corners of the globe scotland had made panicstricken attempts to evacuate itself flee south was the cry that resulted in a twentymile tailback of traffic over shap and on all other routes vehicles soon came to a total standstill there was no longer any regard for the highway code a small minority drove north the ghouls who head for any major disaster in quest of horrific spectacular this accounted for several headon collisions major accidents which blocked roads completely vehicles were abandoned and their occupants set off on foot over fields and hills trudging for miles along fastflowing rivers in search of a shallow crossing place some were drowned whole families totally exhausted slept out hi the open with not even a blanket to cover them many died during this pilgrimage of terror towns were looted battles raging between those fleeing from the north and southern residents who were determined to protect their property at all costs fires raged unchecked wednesday am canverdale received an offer from the kremlin fleets of airliners would be sent in the following day to evacuate as many people as possible soviet troops would repel rioters at every airfield canverdale rejected this offer with dignity but was curtly advised that the rescue bid would still take place it was not a promise but a threat and under present circumstances it would be difficult to interpret as an act of war the cunning of the soviet bear knew no limits the prime minister consulted three of his leading ministers immediately by telephone and then called washington it took him less than ten minutes to locate the president of the united states at am the white house contacted the kremlin tactfully at first voluntarily offering to take over the rescue bid the offer was abruptly refused america then sternly warned the ussr to desist from their scheme at loam the president of the usa telephoned canverdale the prime ministers hands were visibly shaking as he addressed the crisis cabinet meeting half an hour later gentlemen he began his voice disclosing the weariness now threatening to engulf him we have another cuba situation on our hands and we are absolutely powerless to intervene in any way we are the meat in the sandwich for a third world war i can offer neither suggestions nor a solution one way or another britain is finished perhaps it would be best after all if section eight exploded in his hotel bedroom kent listened to canverdales broadcast on the transistor radio eventually he switched off intending to retire to bed then he had a change of mind which surprised even himself instead of donning his pyjamas he put on his threequarterlength sheepskin coat walked downstairs and outside to his parked mercedes every action was slow with none of his usual decisiveness even the way he drove almost as though he was unsure of himself even of his destination a man who had finally lost hope and run out of ideas the streets were crowded and twice he had to pull up to avoid a bunch of pedestrians idling in the middle of the road gatherings some small some large some quiet others noisy everybody had heard the broadcast perhaps like himself they were trying to reach a decision desperately seeking a way to escape death as the mercedes nosed its way through the square he slowed momentarily taking in the scene before him several hundred townspeople packed the cobbled area a man had climbed on to the pedestal of burnss statue to address them he was a volatile speaker fists clenched gesticulating wildly frequently pointing back towards the north end of the valley constant cheers drowned his words a continual oration an incitement kent knew only too well that before long this ugly throng joined by countless others would be marching on the nuclear station david versus goliath only this time no wellaimed stone would win the battle it was lost before it had even begun he took the lefthand road accelerating once he was clear of the crowds the sound of their voices growing fainter now the sidestreets were deserted once again indecision caused him to ease up on the throttle it would be so much simpler to turn around and head back to the hotel but there are times when even a loner needs company so he kept on driving he saw coyles house at the end of the road an ordinary semidetached suburban dwelling he slowed to a crawl almost prepared to pass it by and carry on elsewhere maybe for a drink in a bar the garage doors were wide open and there was no sign of the avenger but a light showed in one of the front downstairs rooms a last moment of hesitation then he pulled the mercedes into the drive switching off the engine and lights previous doubts were now replaced by an unaccustomed nervousness of what after all he only sought company he had been a man alone too long he had half expected to find coyle at home particularly after todays events but evidently the heralds proprietor had gone to visit anne kent pulled the pipe from his pocket its bowl was still full of halfsmoked tobacco he lit it and drew deeply savouring the flavour of the tobacco in his lungs at last he rang the bell a long wait perhaps there was nobody there then he could go back to his hotel satisfied that it was not he who had backed down it was stupid but he just needed somebody to talk to about what anything except nervousness again he couldnt even pretend that he was looking for coyle the absence of the avenger made it clear that coyle was not at home another thing it was no time to call upon a bereaved family then he heard footsteps in the hall the click of the lock and jane stood there looking at him surprise filtered through her grief one hand rested on the door handle the other sought the support of the lintel im sorry kent thought that his voice sounded distant like a transatlantic telephone call barely audible i come in she held the door wide indicating him to enter the livingroom slip your coat off i was just about to make some coffee half an hour passed two empty cups two people who needed company but spoke little kent still had not told her why he had come nor had she asked sarahs in bed it was as though she suddenly felt the need to talk had forced herself to break the barrier of silence i called the doctor it didnt really hit her until later a terrible experience for any girl no mention of coyle they lapsed into an uneasy silence there was so much they did not want to discuss kent realised just how poor he was as a conversationalist a man of many words in print but when it came to situations like this he was paying the penalty for being a loner unsociable by nature he glanced up at the clock on the mantle shelf god hed been here an hour already and so much remained unsaid what was there to say at last it was jane who broke the lingering silence the uneasy tension which existed between them it was she who put into words everything he had thought about since leaving the hotel whats it like being alone kent she smiled faintly a hint of sadness in her eyes that was noticeably distinct from her previous smouldering grief i mean really alone no ties nobody depending on you it has its advantages he spoke slowly staring at the glowing electric bars then raising his eyes to meet hers but sometimes it can be hell you brood over things bottle problems up inside thats why you came here tonight he nodded slowly partially the truth maybe even he was not sure now why he had come kent she hesitated as though struggling to choose her words carefully maybe fearful of offending him do do you ever miss not having a woman i mean a regular woman he gave a deep sigh she had asked the question he most wanted her to ask also the one he feared kent of fleet street the man who interviewed politicians personalities and tricked them into revealing facts they desperately sought to withhold now everything was in reverse he knew now how it felt to be on the receiving end its hell sometimes a confessional mood was on him now i know a lot of women in london i can always have one when i need one not prostitutes women who just need a man the same way i need them call it lust if you like something just physical but afterwards you feel a thousand times worse loneliness is made so much more apparent to you so you work it off work like hell try and forget it but sooner or later you have to go in search of another woman sex is like a curse then you wish you could do without it but you cant and you know it i know she leaned back in her chair and the movement brought a faint stirring in his loins he wanted to fight it off hell her husband was his best friend she had just lost a son her daughter was asleep upstairs under sedation kent her voice was more decisive now her eyes meeting his i know precisely how you feel thats exactly the position im in now but you have a husband he felt he had to make some kind of token resistance i dont have a husband she sat up again leaning towards him hes gone he wont come back hes hi love with that girl i can only supply him with his physical needs as you just said it isnt enough tonight after id given sarah her sleeping tablets i sat with the pill bottle in my hand for a long time the way out would have been so easy richards gone so is bob it was only the thought of sarah that prevented me from taking all those tablets myself she needs me id only just made the decision to carry on with life see it through to the end then you arrived god i was glad to see you she stood up seeming to tower above him he noted the fullness of her bosom the sum hips legs ankles he preferred her to anne in every way although he would not have admitted it every man has his own particular fancy kent certainly had his right now kent she moved a step nearer would you stop here with me tonight he nodded smiling watching in a daze as she switched off the fire he stood up and followed her out of the room then up the narrow staircase following every movement of her buttocks just ahead of him the bed looked the most comfortable and inviting thing he had ever seen even now she was starting to undress by the time he had removed his shirt and tie she was naked beneath the sheets waiting for him it was silly to turn off the light he told himself but somehow he had to make it different from all his previous relationships this was not just another physical encounter jane really wanted him he hoped that he would not disappoint her she was groping for him even as he crawled in beside her chapter section eight exploded shortly after midnight coyle was aware of the time because even as the walls of the office came in at him the huge fireball which lit the sky showed up the face of the cheap alarm clock on the desk doomtime am in that split second he was forcing his numbed sleepbemused mind to work heedless of his own safety he flung himself across the sleeping bag as a human shield to protect anne then came the awful shock a terror that divorced him from the holocaust all around his body hit the limp quilt with jarring force it was empty anne was gone there was flying debris everywhere cascading brickwork showered all around him yet miraculously left him unscathed thick choking dust glowing orange like hazy sunlight was filtering through the grimy window pane heat scorched his naked flesh withering it on his body but he ignored the pain scrambling over piles of rubble clawing at it frantically trying to shout annes name but no words came out not even a hoarse whisper he was outside in the open though to be precise there was no longer any indoors or outdoors a fiery sky lit up the whole scene revealing the entire length of the valley a flattened landscape over which the towering mountains were starting to avalanche with mighty rock falls that slid and bounced slowly and silently and everywhere there was total silence because bob coyle could no longer hear he was reduced to a panicstricken human robot that staggered haphazardly tearing at immovable heaps of rubble crying inwardly because his tears were dried by the heat as soon as they began alone where was everyone else oh god why could he not have died along with everybody else yes he wanted to be dead to be with anne fires were erupting everywhere small blazes starting up and spreading the hot wind fanning their flames to an inferno flashes of reason came to him anne must have crept out soon after hed fallen asleep but why perhaps shed crossed the yard to the toilet he looked around trying to shield his smarting eyes from the glare and the smoke everywhere was totally unrecognisable he didnt even know where the office had stood or if he was in the right street total destruction just as they had forecast the last and greatest holocaust of all still wandering searching his brain couldnt cope with the situation much longer maybe he was shouting maybe he wasnt inside he still cried once he paused to glance down at his own tortured body just a mass of blisters that wept thick matter like melted syrup hands and feet that no longer bled because the thick ooze stemmed the blood flowing from the abrasions hairless a walking festering cinder still searching although hed given up hope then he saw the man coyle stood staring scraping at his eyes in an attempt to make the mirage go away a thing in human shape that stood atop a blazing pyre seemingly unharmed by the crackling flames it was clothed in ragged garments that neither burned nor shrivelled its revolting flesh clearly visible through the tatters its head had a sparse covering of hair and seemed too large for the frail body on which it rested its eyes picked him out of the smoke and forced bob coyle to meet a gaze that blazed with contempt and hatred that had him shivering in spite of the terrible heat the lips moved over a toothless cavity of a mouth i balzur have returned to witness the fruits of my curse sent here by pluto who will soon come to rule over this fiery hell you wretch are the last survivor of those who tried to destroy me in vain you live only because i decreed it and your sufferings are only just beginning for you will experience the eternal fire witchfinder yea you are of his bloodline and so you shall suffer the agonies of hell coyle wanted to shrink away but he could not move it was as though every muscle in his body had melted condemning him to remain watching with eyes that burned in their sockets seeing understanding and oh god suddenly he understood his terror came in shuddering waves with the realisation of what he saw before him for now he recognised the face before him reflected in this weird unearthly glow features he had seen in those recent nightmares but had been snatched from his memory on waking balzur the wizard of old craiglowrie had come back to walk amongst them in human form and he coyle had been blind to it and now he knew when it was too late knew that balzur had returned in the person of winston dyne insane mocking laughter inflicting the last wounds on a tortured soul too late you realise too late and you shall suffer for eternity witchfinder everything was starting to go black for coyle a cooling wave of unconsciousness was coming out of the fires to calm him and he wasnt going to fight against it rage and disbelief appeared on those centuriesold features as balzur saw what was happening now it was coyles turn to mock screaming incomprehensible insults with blistered lips that somehow found they could move crying real tears that were wet again screaming because of anne writhing on a welcoming bed of cinders trying to fight off hands that gripped rum then suddenly coyle was back in a world of cool darkness the familiar office with walls and ceiling intact his naked flesh unscathed still struggling trying to control his confused brain but it was not the talonlike fingers of balzur which brought him back to consciousness instead the hands were soft and sensuous there was a heady aroma of musk where previously he had smelled only acrid burning anne bob snap out of it she shook him again less urgently now that his eyes were open youve had a nightmare a bad one he nodded choking with sheer relief crying now for a different reason yes it had been a bad one the worst ever only this time it was different he remembered those evil features and knew to whom they belonged ill make some coffee sure he managed a smile and hoisted himself to his feet you do that darling but first ive got to ring kent try to make him believe me pull yourself together there was a sudden flicker of fear on her face fear that the enormity of his nightmare had disturbed his reasoning you cant go fetching kent out in the night just because of a bad dream dont worry im not going round the bend he forced another smile something thats been eluding me these past nights the dreams a face now i know that balzur has come back that hes been amongst us for some time a reincarnation maybe or some inexplicable evil psychic force thats taken over a human body and soul balzur is now winston dyne head of oxide reprocessing life appeared to be full of totally new experiences for kent at present yet another assailed him on arrival at the herald premises the following morning guilt it was crazy the neatly folded sleepingbags in coyles tiny office served as a tiny sop to his conscience but all the same he knew he would have to tell coyle and the sooner he got it over with the better by the way kent was grateful that he did not gulp or stammer when the words came out t stayed at your place overnight coyle regarded him slowly surprise but certainly no resentment a moments silence he too was searching for the right words thanks he smiled thanks for telling me kent i guess it took a lot of guts and thanks for what you did i hope it was successful mutually kents relief was evident t have an invitation to return there tonight if please do coyle experienced a sudden unburdening of responsibilities which he knew he had previously shirked it made him feel a lot easier hows sarah still asleep when i came out shell be ok their conversation was drowned by the drone of a lowflying helicopter they listened to its progress the noise fading slightly then shutting off altogether sounds like its landed at the nuclear station coyles eyebrows were raised no helicopter had entered the valley not even a military air patrol since the army had moved in must be somebody visiting dyne and his friends kent suggested some vip come to see for himself judging from the mass meetings in town last night it wont be long before the crowds try to storm the station suicidal everythings suicidal these days by the way coyle felt suddenly foolish everything seemed so different so realistic since dawn had blended into full daylight and swept away the nocturnal terrors something silly but well you know my feelings concerning the ancient curse maybe youll think my minds snapped under the pressure but i believe balzur has come back somehow in the person of winston dyne kent pursed his lips then he nodded slowly ive come across stranger things when i was out in uganda doing some stories on amins atrocities i met up with things that i didnt dare write about for fear id be laughed out of fleet street come on bob lets hear your theory briefly coyle related the dream and when he had finished kent was silent stuffing tobacco into the bowl of his pipe his rugged features were grim its up to us to stop him he spoke in matteroffact tones you and me bob as simple as that its no good trying to convince anybody else there isnt time anyway but well have to play our cards carefully because we wont get a second chance my guess is the devil will invite us up there again today another load of pr shit then well have to play it by ear it was pm the three of them had eaten sandwiches in the office rather than go into town where the stormclouds of rioting were gathering shouting and chanting reached their ears and they guessed that the square was packed to capacity kent wondered just how long it would be before the storm finally broke not just yet he hoped because he needed time at pm dyne telephoned kent and coyle were both invited to attend a crisis meeting at the reprocessing centre in an hours time dyne sounded harassed carefully chosen words too as though there were others in his office men of higher authority than himself well be there coyle replied replacing the receiver a gathering of chieftains kent muttered well be right in the heart of the action i guess my name will be mud in the cheshire cheese if i ever get back to fleet street but this is it bob our big chance lets hope we dont fall down on it they travelled in the mercedes passing through the initial checkpoint was a mere formality but coyle was surprised to note that the guard in the outer sentrybox was loader himself why had the atomic energy authoritys private police chief taken such a menial task upon himself certainly not because of a shortage of security forces army reinforcements were also in evidence and obviously the military now considered defence of the nuclear station of greater importance than attempting to quell the unrest in the town itself funny about loader being there coyle mused as they drove slowly towards the second checkpoint perhaps he needed some fresh air kent dismissed the affair as one of minor importance he had briefly summed up the man during the inspection of their green passcards mean with a killer instinct shoot first and ask questions later the routine guard had been no less surprised when loader had suddenly transferred him to duties within the compound there had to be a reason but he wasnt paid to think just obey the usual escort down the maze of corridors this time into the core of the main building they took an elevator and alighted at the fourth floor then into a small room with three walls of floortoceiling windows the whole extent of holocaust lay spread out below them the pyramid trap towering like a monument to death and destruction section eight the bomb that could wipe out civilisation tyler gave them a nod but there was no sign of winston dyne it was strange indeed that the big man himself was missing a couple of vacant chairs were placed in readiness for them a dozen other men occupied seats at the long table kent recognised canverdale at once also stafford and some resident boffins there were three others who looked like governmental men probably canverdales private staff aea police were noticeable by their absence this was no press conference so no trouble was envisaged canverdale spoke first a brief summary of recent events the ussr airliners would be landing at all major airports tomorrow afternoon he fully believed that they had no intention of taking off again in other words it was an advance invasion force parachutists would drop into the valley with a rearguard to back them up on manquhill moor the usaf intended to beat them to it there could only be one outcome tonight the nation would be told he canverdale would broadcast from this very room at pm coyle and kent looked grimly at each other they had never envisaged such a turn of events not at such short notice anyway but time was running out for everybody it really made very little difference to the british anyway the rest of the world would suffer in due course both men spared a thought for their women just one more night tyler was on his feet the moment canverdale sat down the representative of britains hazardous materials group produced a sheaf of blueprints from a manilla folder and spread them out on the table before him complicated diagrams and figures meaningless to almost everyone else in that room tyler had not slept in fortyeight hours twice he swayed slightly on his feet gripping the table for support two whole days of rapid calculations the early stages proved the latter still theory three floors below in one of the many laboratories skilled technicians were working frenziedly on a copy of these final plans constructing two radioactive solidifying instruments no larger in size than the average cheststyle deepfreeze the solidifiers will be completed within two hours gentlemen a note of triumph penetrated the weariness of his normally slow semiamerican drawl we cannot afford to wait a second longer than completion these must be put into operation right away even whilst reprocessing and waste disposal is being carried out in section eight but there have been no experiments stafford interrupted the machines might not work in which case we shall be no worse off than we are at this very moment tyler snapped irritably our only hope of checking the rise in radioactivity is to solidify it and dispose of it as it escapes i myself will join a team of three men wearing the same protective clothing as the labour force we hope to commence work at pm we shall not know the results for twelve hours i would advise you prime minister to delay your broadcast for a few more hours we are playing our last card win or lose lets hope that its an ace an internal telephone buzzed interrupting him stafford answered it thank you he replaced the receiver and mustered all the dignity which his state of exhaustion would allow a report from section eight the pressure gauge has jumped a further two degrees tomorrow gentlemen is dday it could even be sooner if theres another rise canverdale gasped inwardly my broadcast must go ahead as previously scheduled he said may god grant you success mr tyler tyler nodded folded his blueprints and hurried from the room his men would be spurred to even greater efforts you may remain here if you wish gentlemen stafford addressed the journalists knowing full well that they would we have canteen facilities should you require them one thing kent was on his feet wheres dyne stafford seemed taken aback by the suddenness of the question or the lack of respect shown for his chief by this upstart journalist when he replied there was a note of reprimand in his voice mr dyne is temporarily confined to his quarters a migraine headache brought on by long hours without sleep a short rest and doubtless he will be back in charge kent glanced down at coyle and both of them knew the time of the apocalypse was speeding up unless something drastic happened quickly tomorrow would never dawn somehow they had to locate winston dyne at pm tyler and his assistants wheeled their bulky radioactivitysolidifying machines into the pyramid of death which was officially known as section eight the immediate fate of a nation rested upon their shoulders but their protective headgear hid their individual expressions at pm a column of angry frightened people marched out of the square in the old town heading north the few remaining soldiers watched from a distance at the moment it was little more than a demonstration with homemade banners and painted slogans held aloft yet beneath this semiorderliness fear and anger seethed soon it would come to the boil and sheer terror would destroy all reason loader was the first to hear the shouts of the advancing columns possibly because his ears were tuned in anticipation he wanted them to come christ how he wanted that mob to show up the inbred killer instinct in loader dominated his every action he recalled the special powers act now a state of emergency reigned throughout the country he could do just anything he wanted in the interests of the security of the reactor they would back him up that was why he had this job because he was the best there was totally ruthless and an obedient servant to authority so long as it suited him he had even resented the arrival of the army within the centre took it as a personal insult he didnt need them nobody got into the compound unless it suited him personally now he had to prove it to them he wished he could fry every one of the bastards now headed this way one at a time hed stop em all right hed stop the riot before the fucking army even knew it had begun nearer louder the shouting more frenzied with every passing second now he could see them even more than he had anticipated five hundred at a rough estimation with banners and sticks mostly just yelling abuse terrified every single one of them and not even a shotgun amongst them loader remained inside the shelter he eased the heavy autmatic pistol out of its leather holster the very feel of it sent the blood coursing through his veins it was fully loaded and there was a spare clip in his left hand he eased the safetycatch forward his narrowed eyes measuring the marchers progress the range two hundred yards one hundred and fifty one hundred fifty he stepped out into the open pistol dangling almost casually in his right hand nostrils flared lips compressed into a narrow bloodless line feet slightly apart timing stance all perfect one against five hundred the kind of odds he liked thirty yards hold it stay where you are it was doubtful whether his voice was heard above the clamour twenty yards they saw him now and they werent stopping for anybody get out of our way you fucking bastard the very words he wanted to hear a half crouch a blur of movement his whole body perfectly coordinated the shots so close together that they might have come from a machinegun with every one he picked a target moving from one to another instinctively the speaker from the statue in the square went down first two more exworkers men laid off only the other day when only a small highlyskilled labour force had been retained on section eight a woman stupid bitch four more yobbos there was screaming chaos the marchers tripping over each other as they fell back in total disarray the brief pause loader needed again his hands moved fast efficiently the spare clip the aligned this time he was going to fire from the hip show those watching from behind him that all that marksmanship training twohanded pistol shooting the left used as a support was a load of nonsense loader just needed a gun nothing else a single shot rang out the report heavier this time loader straightened up swaying uncertainly the ml carbine bullet entering his body between the shoulderblades passing out through the chest and then smashing the skull of one of the fleeing mob a young girl no more than fifteen bowling her over and over until she came to a stop in a bloody heap of pulped flesh and bone the slipped from loaders fingers as he fell he dropped to his knees slumped forward somehow he managed to roll over on to his back a mammoth effort numbness rather than pain he could not understand it hed beaten them they were running scattering yelling their curses back as they fled and yet loader tried to raise his head it was impossible he could not move he did not need to he could see it all from where he lay a rifle barrel still protruded through the slit hi the box on the upper platform the barrel smoking it was where barraclough was stationed you fucker loader couldnt speak he was choking drowning in his own blood and nobody came out to him tyler and his colleagues laboured tirelessly inside section eight the labourers sweated beneath their heavy protective clothing in a scene like the bizarre setting for some sciencefiction film tyler glanced continually from his watch to the pressure gauge both seemed to stand still it was mental torture it would be several hours before they knew one way or the other the solidifiers needed a full twelve hours trial to prove or disprove their worth any impatient attempt to open them up to ascertain their current efficiency might result in a total breakdown which could not be rectified in time all they could do was wait chapter canverdales broadcast from scotland on radio only was a bit of a nonevent by now the british people were resigned to their fate the threat of a third world war horrific in all its aspects did not cause undue sensation by then the holocaust would have exploded with full force as for the russian airliners supposedly attempting to carry out a rescue operation on the morrow most of the population would be hiding hi every conceivable place of shelter the airports would be deserted canverdale did not mention the current attempts to solidify the escaping radioactivity this was no time to raise a nations hopes and then possibly dash them a few hours later the worst of the rioting had subsided no longer did crowds surge through city streets bent on blind destruction there was still some fighting of course but mostly amongst groups competing for places which might conceivably offer some protection all official nuclear shelters were already filled the living awaiting the end in their mass graves londons undergrounds were crowded all trains had ceased to run and the electric currents had been switched off the ventilation shafts had not yet been closed the authorities would leave that until the very last moment to do so now would certainly condemn many to death by suffocation and in the valley itself there was an uneasy calm those who had attempted to demonstrate outside the nuclear station had now retreated dejectedly to their homes to await the end the sudden burst of gunfire had shocked them into reality again fourteen dead nine killed by the gunfire five trampled in the stampede to get away from it all many others injured chief superintendent rollason sat at his desk an ashtray heaped with cigarette ends in front of him another of his favourite brand smouldering between his lips occasionally he was forced to remove it during a bout of coughing he had had that cough for years lately it had become much worse he wondered why he had never given so much as a passing thought to cancer before but did so now perhaps because he realised that now millions would probably die from the disease ironic he wished somebody would phone him anybody it was the quietest night he had known for years he wished to god that one of his men would bring in a drunk just to relieve the monotony every officer was out in the town on some duty or other but there were no reports nothing fear had turned into boredom and that in turn brought a new kind of terror just waiting for the end dynes headache did not lessen any in spite of the darkness and the tranquillity of his private quarters rather it increased to alarming proportions the pounding seemed to reverberate right down to his chest this frightened him his father had died from a sudden angina attack experts said that heart trouble was hereditary alone here in the dark he experienced a trapped feeling a need for the company of the others something he had never felt before maybe he should go down to the compound below and get some fresh air he had difficulty in walking staggering from side to side to the deserted corridor he could barely see his vision tunnelled everywhere dark as though with the approach of dusk but that was ridiculous the centre was always fully lit night and day he finally located the elevator and experienced dizziness as it plunged downwards coming to a gentle halt which threw him from one wall to the other christ his eyes hurt nobody about either not even a guard on the main doors probably everybody was congregated around section eight the focal point of the whole world at this very moment the wind met him with an icy gust as he pushed his way out through the swingdoors he shivered he should have brought a top coat but he wasnt going back inside jesus no out here he felt a kind of freedom an urge to run blindly to put as much distance between himself and craiglowrie as possible but no he had to remain go up with the rest of them if the reactor exploded maybe ten minutes out here would do the trick already his headache seemed to have lessened but there was definitely something wrong with his vision he glanced back and felt a mounting terror he couldnt even see the reprocessing centre not so much as a glimmer of light to denote its presence it was as though winston dyne stood on a barren hillside the ground beneath him bereft even of sprouting weeds whilst all around him the moorland wind moaned its loneliness across miles of gorse and heather he stared hard but could see nothing in the blackness he rubbed his eyes oh god had he gone blind then he sensed a presence the wind seeming to whisper words in his ears like strange angry incantations he fell to his knees and flung up his arms instinctively to protect his head words again and this time he could make them out the time is nigh balzur destroy with the power i have given you pluto commands you now where the hell is he coyle followed on kents heels out into the open compound unhindered by a security guard who glanced in their direction but relaxed as he recognised them hes not in his quarters theyre searching the building for him without result so far so hes got to be out here but for christs sake why kent broke into a run without answering almost as though hed seen something the soft springy grass beneath his feet suddenly petering out into rock and shale that crunched under the soles of his shoes and that was when they hit the blackness as though they had suddenly stepped into a void kent pulled up abruptly and coyle cannoned into him what the hell coyle stared all around and could not believe that he saw nothing except the blackness of night his skin prickled and he clutched at kents arm whats going on kent wheres everything gone listen a whispered command they both strained their ears a soft soughing of the mountain breezes bearing on them angry voices unintelligible as though they were centuriesold echoes suddenly released from some secret cleft escalating to a tearing gale that had the two men fighting to keep their balance my god kent pointed ahead of him bob do you see it jesus man do you see what i see coyle saw but he could not understand why it was now possible to see in what only seconds earlier had been total darkness now the scene was lit up by an inexplicable radiance that seemed to come from the mountains above as though some hidden fire burned somewhere and its glow radiated the sky a mountainside thick with gorse and heather except for one bare and blackened patch that appeared to have been ravaged by fire kents nostrils twitched he smelled charred ashes something else the odour of decaying flesh and in the midst of the ashes stood a man his upturned features clearly lit up by the strange light a ragged cloaked figure with an oversize puppetlike head thick festering lips moving as he spoke to the sky above arms held aloft its him coyle breathed the one in my dreams balzur dyne whoever now dyou believe me or is this another nightmare its real there was awe in the london journalists voice bob what you see now is a combination of the past arid the present some kind of astral projection thats both dangerous and evil and unless im wrong its also the fuse that will fire section eight and blast civilisation into oblivion what can we do do you believe in god bob yes yes i do i thought i didnt but now then your power will be stronger than mine i just know the words words ive learned from reporting exorcisms in this country and abroad ill whisper them to you and you shout them out aloud and try to believe in them its the only way deliver this place coyle found himself yelling pausing only to catch the words whispered in his ear by his companion from all evil spirits all vain imaginations projections and phantasms and all deceits of the evil one and bid them harm no one but depart to the place appointed them there to remain for ever lord beat down satan god incarnate god who came to give peace bring peace and he added of his own volition amen the gale came rushing with hurricane force now the tatters streaming like fairground bunting from the clothing of that terrible figure in front of them for a second the strange light seemed to grow brighter time enough for the two watchers to see the terror and agony on balzurs face the animal grimace of one suddenly thwarted from a fourcenturiesold ambition despair and pain the body stiffening jerking as though from the impact of a snipers bullet the shadows surged back and now everything was seen only in silhouette a pathetic figure sinking until lost from view in the ashes all around it one last rush of wind and then all was silent in the pitch darkness a tranquillity that dispelled fear a period that was timeless as though the evil forces had been vanquished a moment of sheer peace the light came back with a dazzling brightness that had coyle and kent covering their eyes stark artificial light from the reprocessing centre shadowless as it illuminated the barbedwire enclosure shining on the grass and weeds outlining that strange area called plutos patch in which nothing grew and the crumpled body which lay in the middle a figure whose tattered garments had changed to a thick tweed suit it was winston dyne and there was little doubt that he was dead christ almighty the two men whipped round at the sound of voices and saw a dishevelled stafford and two aea policemen coming towards them at a run thats dyne wed better get the mo i believe hes dead kent forced the words from his confused brain heart attack probably bob coyle shook his head once again it all seemed yet another of those terrible nightmares only this time the proof of what had happened lay before them they turned and walked slowly back towards the centre the gauge in section eight was still the criterion canverdales hand rested close to the internal telephone his fingers drumming noiselessly on the surface of the table nobody spoke all ears were awaiting the promised buzz it would only buzz once then would be snatched up before it had a chance to ring a second time a group of men silently awaited the fate of their nation the whole world am the phone remained silent looks were exchanged but no words the allotted time was up surely tyler must know by now whether his experiment had succeeded or failed perhaps it had failed and he had decided to persevere a little longer clinging vainly to a vanishing hope afraid to admit defeat am still nothing canverdale lit a cigarette in his long holder kent followed suit with his pipe minor regulations were being waived am a whirring noise that became louder with every second then stopped abruptly the elevator footsteps outside in the corridor measured steps neither slow nor fast the door opened it was tyler with stafford just behind him im sorry for the delay gentlemen the hazardous materials group man said his voice scarcely louder than a whisper but youll appreciate that we had to undergo decontamination procedure before coming up here you could have phoned canverdale almost shouted and added well a moments silence possibly for effect gentlemen tyler moved towards his vacant chair but did not sit down i am pleased to announce that the radioactive solidifier technically known as slr is an undoubted success not only has it already solidified some of the escaped vapour but the pressure gauge has dropped by four degrees a moment in history to be savoured that of course was why tyler had come up in person for once in his life he had not discarded credit that was due to him he had seized his moment of glory even at the expense of keeping a prime minister waiting a normally retiring personality had surfaced from the very ocean depths to quell the tidal wave handshakes all round canverdale debated how soon he could broadcast the news to the nation first though the ussr and the united states must be told the former would need some convincing he feared lest they might come anyway and there was no time to lose he moved towards the telephone to call to his deputy in hertfordshire from the small village of stanstead abbots messages were soon relayed to the governments of the world at large whose nations breathed a loud sigh of relief with some reluctance soviet aircraft were recalled the white house ordered their planes to ascertain that there would be no russian intervention and then return immediately the president was taking no chances canverdale regarded the whole business as a personal triumph beginning with his a m announcement to the british people and the rest of the world that the danger was now past doomsday had been averted by a matter of hours he would of course endeavour to impose a permanent ban on any further reprocessing of nuclear waste eventually only tyler and stafford remained in that elevated room overlooking section eight together they watched the first faint streaks of light in the eastern sky then the golden glow of a morning sunrise on the surrounding mountain peaks neither spoke the time for congratulations was over yet there was still one unsolved problem which everybody else appeared to have forgotten that first escape of radioactivity it was somewhere in the environment it would remain there for the next quarter of a million years they wondered where and when it would show up again perhaps not in their lifetime or even during that of the next generation it was a very disturbing thought wearily they rose to their feet a few hours sleep and then back to work on the solidifiers slr there were one or two modifications to be carried out on the instruments before they could be classed as one hundredpercent effective but basically the idea had worked and as a result the world lived on kent dropped coyle off at the offices of the herald the londoner kept the engine running there were several reasons why he did not want to go inside see you tomorrow he said i take it you wont be coming in today no weve both plenty of sleep to catch up on they shook hands a gesture that said more than any amount of words coyle stood watching the mercedes until it was out of sight then slowly turned and went inside the world lived on and that still meant one or two problems right now though he had to get to work on next weeks herald it just had to be a special edition a kind of celebration issue
