many eons ago the children of gikuyu who was himself the first kikuyu lived on the slopes of the holy mountain kirinyaga which men now call mount kenya there were many serpents on the mountain but the sons and grandsons of gikuyu found them repulsive and they soon killed all but one then one day the last serpent entered their village and killed and ate a young child the children of gikuyu sought out their mundumugu their witch doctor and asked him to destroy the menace the mundumugu rolled the bones and sacrificed a goat and finally he created a poison that would kill the serpent he slit open the belly of another goat and placed the poison inside it and left it beneath a tree and the very next day the serpent swallowed the goat and died now said the mundumugu you must cut the serpent into one hundred pieces and scatter them on the holy mountain so that no demon can breathe life back into its body the children of gikuyu did as they were instructed and scattered the hundred pieces of the serpent across the slopes of kirinyaga but during the night each piece came to life and became a new serpent and soon the kikuyu were afraid to leave their bomas the mundumugu ascended the mountain and when he neared the highest peak he addressed ngai we are beseiged by serpents he said if you do not slay them then the kikuyu shall surely die as a people i made the serpent just as i made the kikuyu and all other things answered ngai who sat on his golden throne atop kirinyaga and anything that i made be it a man or a serpent or a tree or even an idea is not repellant in my eyes i will save you this one time because you are young and ignorant but you must never forget that you cannot destroy that which you find repulsive for if you try to destroy it it will always return one hundred times greater than before this is one of the reasons why the kikuyu chose to till the soil rather than hunt the beasts of the jungle like the wakamba or make war on their neighbors like the maasai for they had no wish to see that which they destroyed return to plague them it is a lesson taught by every mundumugu to his people even after we left kenya and emigrated to the terraformed world of kirinyaga in the entire history of our tribe only one mundumugu ever forgot the lesson that ngai taught atop the holy mountain on that distant day and that mundumugu was myself when i awoke i found hyena dung within the thorn enclosure of my boma that alone should have warned me that the day carried a curse for there is no worse omen also the breeze hot and dry and filled with dust came from the west and all good winds come from the east it was the day that our first immigrants were due to arrive we had argued long and hard against allowing any newcomers to settle on kirinyaga for we were dedicated to the old ways of our people and we wanted no outside influences corrupting the society that we had created but our charter clearly stated that any kikuyu who pledged to obey our laws and made the necessary payments to the eutopian council could emigrate from kenya and after postponing the inevitable for as long as we could we finally agreed to accept thomas nkobe and his wife of all the candidates for immigration nkobe had seemed the best he had been born in kenya had grown up in the shadow of the holy mountain and after going abroad for his schooling had returned and run the large farm his family had purchased from one of the last european residents most important of all he was a direct descendant of jomo kenyatta the great burning spear of kenya who had led us to independence i trudged out across the hot arid savannah to the tiny landing field at haven to greet our new arrivals accompanied only by ndemi my youthful assistant twice buffalo blocked our path and once ndemi had to hurl some stones to frighten a hyena away but eventually we reached our destination only to discover that the maintenance ship which was carrying nkobe and his wife had not yet arrived i squatted down in the shade of an acacia tree and a moment later ndemi crouched down beside me they are late he said peering into the cloudless sky perhaps they will not come at all they will come i said the signs all point to it but they are bad signs and nkobe may be a good man there are many good men i replied not all of them belong on kirinyaga you are worried koriba asked ndemi as a pair of crested cranes walked through the dry brittle grass and a vulture rode the thermals overhead i am concerned i said why because i do not know why he wants to live here why shouldnt he asked ndemi picking up a dry twig and methodically breaking it into tiny pieces is it not utopia there are many different notions of utopia i replied kirinyaga is the kikuyus and nkobe is a kikuyu so this is where he belongs said ndemi decisively i wonder why because he is almost years old why did he wait so long to come here perhaps he could not afford to come sooner i shook my head he comes from a very wealthy family they have many cattle asked ndemi many i said and goats i nodded will he bring them with him no he will come emptyhanded as we all did i paused frowning why would a man who owned a large farm and had many tractors and men to do his work turn his back on all that he possessed that is what troubles me you make it sound like the way he lived on earth was better said ndemi frowning not better just different he paused for a moment koriba what is a tractor a machine that does the work of many men in the fields it sounds truly wonderful offered ndemi it makes deep wounds in the ground and stinks of gasoline i said making no effort to hide my contempt we sat in silence for another moment then the maintenance ship came into view its descent creating a huge cloud of dust and causing a great screeching and squawking by the birds and monkeys in the nearby trees well i said we shall soon have our answer i remained in the shade until the ship had touched down and thomas nkobe and his wife emerged from its interior he was a tall wellbuilt man dressed in casual western clothes she was slender and graceful her hair elegantly braided her khaki slacks and hunting jacket exquisitely tailored hello said nkobe in english as i approached him i was afraid we might have to find our way to the village ourselves jambo i replied in swahili welcome to kirinyaga jambo he amended switching to swahili are you koinnage no i answered koinnage is our paramount chief you will live in his village and you are i am koriba i said he is the mundumugu added ndemi proudly i am ndemi he paused someday i will be a mundumugu too nkobe smiled down at him im sure you will suddenly he remembered his wife and this is wanda she stepped forward smiled and extended her hand a true mundumugu she said in heavilyaccented swahili im thrilled to meet you i hope you will enjoy your new life on kirinyaga i said shaking her hand oh im certain i will she replied enthusiastically as the ship disgorged their baggage and promptly took off again she looked around at the dry savannah and saw a trio of maribou storks and a jackal patiently waiting for a hyena to finish gorging itself on the wildebeest calf it had killed earlier in the morning i love it already she paused then added confidentially im really the one who got tom to agree to come here oh she nodded her head i just couldnt stand what kenya has become all those factories all that pollution ever since i learned about kirinyaga ive wanted to move here to come back to nature and live the way we were meant to live she inhaled deeply smell that air tom it will add ten years to your life you dont have to sell me any more he said with a smile im here arent i i turned to wanda nkobe you yourself are not kikuyu are you i am now she replied ever since i married tom but to answer your question no i was born and raised in oregon oregon repeated ndemi brushing some flies away from his face with his hand thats in america she explained she paused by the way why are we speaking swahili rather than kikuyu kikuyu is a dead language i said most of our people no longer know it i had rather hoped it would still be spoken here she said obviously disappointed ive been studying it for months if you had moved to italy you would not speak latin i replied we still use a few kikuyu words just as the italians use a few latin words she was silent for a moment then shrugged at least ill have the opportunity to improve my swahili i am surprised that you are willing to forego the amenities of america for kirinyaga i said studying her closely i was willing years ago she answered it was tom who had to be convinced not me she paused besides i gave up most of those socalled amenities when i left america and moved to kenya even kenya has certain luxuries i noted we have no electricity here no running water no we camp out whenever we can she said and i placed a hand on ndemis shoulder before he could chide her for interrupting the mundumugu im used to roughing it but you have always had a home to return to she stared at me an amused smile on her face are you trying to talk me out of moving here no i replied but i wish to point out that nothing is immutable any member of our society who is unhappy and wishes to leave need only inform maintenance of the fact and a ship will arrive at haven an hour later not us she said were in for the long haul the long haul i repeated she means that were here to stay explained nkobe putting an arm around his wifes shoulders a hot breeze sent the dust swirling around us i think i should take you to the village i said shielding my eyes you are doubtless tired and will wish to rest not at all said wanda nkobe this is a brandnew world i want to look around her gaze fell upon ndemi who was staring at her intently is something wrong she asked you are very strong and sturdy said ndemi approvingly that is good you will bear many children i certainly hope not she said if theres one thing kenya has more than enough of its children this is not kenya said ndemi i will find other ways to contribute to the society ndemi studied her for a moment well he said at last i suppose you can carry firewood im glad i meet with your approval she said but you will need a new name continued ndemi wanda is a european name it is just a name i said changing it will not make her more of a kikuyu i have no objection she interjected im starting a new life i ought to have a new name i shrugged which name will you take as your own she smiled at ndemi you choose one she said he furrowed his brow for a long moment then looked up at her my mothers sister who died in childbirth last year was named mwange and now there is no one in the village of that name then mwange it shall be she said mwange wa ndemi but i am not your father said ndemi she smiled at him you are the father of my new name ndemi puffed his chest up proudly well now that thats settled said nkobe what about our luggage you will not need it i said yes we will said mwange you were told to bring nothing of kenya with you ive brought some kikois that i made myself she said surely that must be permissible since i will be expected to weave my own fabrics and make my own clothes on kirinyaga i considered her explanation for a moment then nodded my consent i will send one of the village children for the bags its not that heavy said nkobe i can carry it myself kikuyu men do not fetch and carry said ndemi what about kikuyu women asked mwange obviously reluctant to leave the luggage behind they carry firewood and grain not bags of clothing responded ndemi those he said pointing contemptuously toward the two leather bags are for children then we might as well start walking said mwange there are no children here ndemi beamed with pride and strutted forward let ndemi go first i said his eyes are young and clear he will be able to see any snakes or hyenas hiding in the tall grass do you have poisonous snakes here asked nkobe a few why dont you kill them because this is not kenya i replied i walked directly behind ndemi and nkobe and mwange followed us remarking upon the scenery and the animals to each other after about half a mile we came to an impala ram standing directly in our path isnt he beautiful whispered mwange look at the horns on him i wish i had my camera with me said nkobe we do not permit cameras on kirinyaga i said i know said nkobe but to be perfectly honest i cant see how something as simple as a camera could be a corrupting influence to your society to have a camera one needs film and one must therefore have a factory that manufactures both cameras and films to develop the film one needs chemicals and then one must find a place to dump those chemicals that havent been used to print the pictures one needs photographic paper and we have barely enough wood to burn in our fires i paused kirinyaga supplies us with all of our desires that is why we came here kirinyaga supplied you with all of your needs said mwange that is not quite the same thing suddenly ndemi stopped walking and turned to her this is your first day here so you are to be forgiven your ignorance he explained but no manamouki may argue with the mundumugu manamouki she repeated what is a manamouki you are said ndemi ive heard that word before said nkobe i think it means wife you are wrong i said a manamouki is a female you mean a woman asked mwange i shook my head any female property i said a woman a cow a sow a bitch a ewe and ndemi thinks im some kind of property you are nkobes manamouki said ndemi she considered it for a moment then shrugged with amusement what the hell she said in english if wanda was only a name manamouki is only a word i can live with it i hope so i replied in swahili for you will have to she turned to me i know we are the first immigrants to come to kirinyaga and that you must have your doubts about us but this is the life ive always wanted im going to be the best damned manamouki you ever saw i hope so i said but i noticed that the wind still blew from the west i introduced nkobe and mwange to their neighbors showed them their shamba where they would grow their food pointed out their six cattle and ten goats and recommended that they lock them in their boma at night to protect them from the hyenas told them how to reach the river to procure water and left them at the entrance to their hut mwange seemed enthused about everything and was soon engaged in animated conversation with the women who came by to look at her strange outfit she is very nice commented ndemi as i walked through the fields blessing the scarecrows perhaps the omens you read were wrong perhaps i said he stared at me but you do not think so no well i like her he said that is your right do you dislike her then i paused as i considered my answer no i said at last i fear her but she is just a manamouki he protested she can do no harm under the proper circumstances anything can do harm i do not believe it said ndemi do you doubt your mundumugus word i asked no he said uncomfortably if you say something then it must be true but i cannot understand how i smiled wryly that is because you are not yet a mundumugu he stopped and pointed to a spot some yards away where a group of impala does were grazing can even they do harm he asked yes but how he asked frowning when danger appears they do not confront it but run away from it ngai has not blessed them with horns so they cannot defend themselves they are not large enough to destroy our crops they cannot even kick an enemy as can the zebra i do not understand i shall tell you the tale of the ugly buffalo and then you will understand i said ndemi smiled happily for he loved stories above all things and i led him to the shade of a thorn tree where we both squatted down facing each other one day a cow buffalo was wandering through the savannah i began the hyenas had recently taken her first calf and she was very sad then she came upon a newborn impala whose mother had been killed by hyenas that very morning i would like to take you home with me said the buffalo for i am very lonely and have much love in my heart but you are not a buffalo i too am very lonely said the impala and if you leave me here alone and unprotected i surely will not survive the night there is a problem said the buffalo you are an impala and we are buffalo you do not belong with us i will become the best buffalo of all promised the impala i will eat what you eat drink what you drink go where you go how can you become a buffalo you cannot even grow horns then i will wear the branches of a tree upon my head you do not wallow in the mud to protect your skin from parasites noted the buffalo take me home with you and i will cover myself with more mud than any other buffalo said the impala for every objection the buffalo raised the impala had an answer and finally the buffalo agreed to take the impala back with her most of the members of the herd thought that the impala was the ugliest buffalo they had ever seen ndemi chuckled at that but because the impala tried so hard to act like a buffalo they allowed her to remain then one day a number of young buffalo were grazing some distance from the herd and they came to a deep mud wallow that blocked their way we must return to the herd said one of the young buffalo why asked the impala there is fresh grass on the other side of the wallow because we have been warned that a deep wallow such as this can suck us down beneath the surface and kill us i do not believe it said the impala and bolder than her companions she walked out to the center of the mud wallow you see she said i have not been sucked beneath the surface it is perfectly safe soon three of the young buffalo ventured out across the mud wallow and each in turn was sucked beneath the surface and drowned it is the ugly buffalos fault said the king of the herd is was she who told them to cross the mud wallow but she meant no harm said her foster mother and what she told them was true the wallow was safe for her all she wants is to live with the herd and be a buffalo please do not punish her the king was blessed with more generosity than wisdom and so he forgave the ugly buffalo then a week later the ugly buffalo who could leap as high as a tall bush jumped up in the air and saw a pack of hyenas lurking in the grass she waited until they were almost close enough to catch her and then cried out a warning all the buffalo began running but the hyenas were able to catch the ugly buffalos foster mother and they pulled her down and killed her most of the other buffalo were grateful to the ugly buffalo for warning them but during the intervening week there had been a new king and this one was wiser than the previous one it is the ugly buffalos fault he said how can it be her fault asked one of the older buffalo it was she who warned us of the hyenas but she only warned you when it was too late said the king had she warned you when she first saw the hyenas her mother would still be among us but she forgot that we cannot run as fast as she can and so her mother is dead and the new king though his heart was sad decreed that the ugly buffalo must leave the herd for there is a great difference between being a buffalo and wanting to be a buffalo i leaned back against the tree my story completed did the ugly buffalo survive asked ndemi i shrugged and brushed a crawling insect from my forearm that is another story she meant no harm but she caused harm nonetheless ndemi traced patterns in the dirt with his finger as he considered my answer then looked up at me but if she had not been with the herd the hyenas would have killed her mother anyway perhaps then it was not her fault if i fall asleep against this tree and you see a black mamba slithering through the grass toward me and you make no attempt to wake me and the mamba kills me would you be to blame for my death i asked yes even though it would certainly have killed me had you not been here ndemi frowned it is a difficult problem yes it is the mud wallow was much easier he said that was surely the ugly buffalos fault for without her urging the other buffalo would never have entered it that is true i said ndemi remained motionless for a few moments still wrestling with the nuances of the story you are saying that there are many different ways to cause harm he announced yes and that it takes wisdom to understand who is to blame for the foolish king did not recognize harm of the ugly buffalos action while the wise king knew that she was to blame for her inaction i nodded my head i see said ndemi and what has this to do with the manamouki i asked he paused again if harm comes to the village you must use your wisdom to decide whether mwange who wants nothing more than to be a kikuyu is responsible for it that is correct i said getting to my feet but i still do not know what harm she can do neither do i i answered will you know it when you see it he asked or will it seem like a good deed such as warning the herd that hyenas are near i made no reply why are you silent koriba asked ndemi at last i sighed heavily because there are some questions that even a mundumugu cannot answer ndemi was waiting for me as usual when i emerged from my hut five mornings later jambo koriba he said i grunted a greeting and walked over to the fire that he had built sitting crosslegged next to it until it removed the chill from my aging bones what is todays lesson he asked at last today i will teach you how to ask ngai for a fruitful harvest i answered but we did that last week and we will do it next week and many more weeks as well i answered when will i learn how to make ointments to cure the sick or how to turn an enemy into an insect so that i may step on him when you are older i said i am already old and more mature how will you know when i am more mature he persisted i will know because you will have gone an entire month without asking about ointments or magic for patience is one of the most important virtues a mundumugu can possess i got to my feet now take my gourds to the river and fill them with water i said indicating two empty water gourds yes koriba he said dejectedly while i was waiting for him i went into my hut activated my computer and instructed maintenance to make a minor orbital adjustment that would bring rain and cooler air to the western plains this done i slung my pouch around my neck and went back out into my boma to see if ndemi had returned but instead of my youthful apprentice i found wambu koinnages senior wife waiting for me bristling with barelycontrolled fury jambo wambu i said jambo koriba she replied you wish to speak to me she nodded it is about the kenyan woman oh yes said wambu you must make her leave what has mwange done i asked i am the senior wife of the paramount chief am i not demanded wambu that is true she does not treat me with the respect that is my due in what way i asked in all ways for example her khanga is much more beautiful than mine the colors are brighter the designs more intricate the fabric softer she wove her khanga on her own loom in the old way i said what difference does that make snapped wambu i frowned do you wish me to make her give you the khanga i asked trying to understand her rage no then i do not understand i said you are no different than koinnage she said obviously frustrated that i could not comprehend her complaint you may be a mundumugu but you are still a man perhaps if you told me more i suggested kibo was as silly as a child she said referring to koinnages youngest wife but i was training her to be a good wife now she wants to be like the kenyan woman but the kenyan woman i said using her terminology wants to be like you she cannot be like me wambu practically shouted at me i am koinnages senior wife i mean that she wants to be a member of the village impossible scoffed wambu she speaks of many strange things such as it does not matter you must make her leave for wearing a pretty khanga and making a good impression on kibo i said bah she snapped you are just like koinnage you pretend not to understand but you know she must go i truly do not understand i said you are my mundumugu not hers i will pay you two fat goats to place a thahu on her i will not place a curse on mwange for the reasons you gave me i said firmly she glared at me for a long moment then spat on the ground turned on her heel and walked back down the winding path to the village muttering furiously to herself practically knocking ndemi down as he returned with my water gourds i spent the next two hours instructing ndemi in the harvest prayer then told him to go into the village and bring mwange back an hour later mwange resplendant in her khanga climbed up my hill accompanied by ndemi and entered my boma jambo i greeted her jambo koriba she replied ndemi says me that you wish to speak to me i nodded that is true the other women seemed to think i should be frightened i cannot imagine why i said perhaps it is because you can call down the lightning and change hyenas into insects and kill your enemies from miles away suggested ndemi helpfully perhaps i said why have you sent for me asked mwange i paused for a moment trying to think of how best to approach the subject there is a problem with your clothing i said at last but i am wearing a khanga that i wove on my own loom she said obviously puzzled i know i responded but the quality of the fabric and the subtlety of the colors have caused a certain i searched for the proper word resentment she suggested precisely i answered grateful that she so quickly comprehended the situation i think it would be best if you were to weave some less colorful garments i halfexpected her to protest but she surprised me by agreeing immediately certainly she said i have no wish to offend my neighbors may i ask who objected to my khanga why id like to make her a present of it it was wambu i said i should have realized the effect my clothing would have i am truly sorry koriba anyone may make a mistake i said as long as it is corrected no lasting harm will be done i hope youre right she said sincerely he is the mundumugu said ndemi he is always right i dont want the women to be resentful of me continued mwange perhaps i could find some way to show my good intentions she paused what if i were to offer to teach them to speak kikuyu no manamouki may be a teacher i explained only the chiefs and the mundumugu may instruct our people thats not very efficient she said it may very well be that someone besides yourself and the chiefs has something to offer it is possible i agreed now let me ask you a question what is it did you come to kirinyaga to be efficient she sighed no she admitted she paused for a moment is there anything else no then i think id better go back and begin weaving my new fabric i nodded my approval and she walked back down the long winding path to the village when i become mundumugu said ndemi watching her retreating figure i will not allow any manamoukis to argue with me a mundumugu must also show understanding i said mwange is new here and has much to learn about kirinyaga i shook my head about manamoukis life proceeded smoothly and uneventfully for almost six weeks until just after the short rains then one morning just as i was preparing to go down into the village to bless the scarecrows three of the women came up the path to my boma there was sabo the widow of old kadamu and bori the second wife of sabana and wambu we must speak with you mundumugu said wambu i sat down crosslegged in front of my hut and waited for them to seat themselves opposite me you may speak i said it is about the kenyan woman said wambu oh i said i thought the problem was solved it is not did she not present you with her khanga as a gift i asked yes you are not wearing it i noted it does not fit said wambu it is only a piece of cloth i said how can it not fit it does not fit she repeated adamantly i shrugged what is this new problem she flaunts the traditions of the kikuyu said wambu i turned to the other women is this true i asked sabo nodded she is a married woman and she has not shaved her head and she keeps flowers in her hut added bori it is not the custom for kenyan women to shave their heads i replied i will instruct her to do so as for the flowers they are not in violation of our laws but why does she keep them persisted bori perhaps she thinks they are pleasing to the eye i suggested but now my daughter wants to grow flowers and she answers with disrespect when i tell it her is more important to grow food to eat and now the kenyan woman has made a throne for her husband nkobe put in sabo a throne i repeated she put a back and arms on his sitting stool said sabo what man besides a chief sits upon a throne does she think nkobe will replace koinnage never snarled wambu and she has made another throne for herself continued sabo even wambu does not sit atop a throne these are not thrones but chairs i said why can she not use stools like all the other members of the village demanded sabu i think she is a witch said wambu why do you say that i asked just look at her said wambu she has seen the long rains come and go times and yet her back is not bent and her skin is not wrinkled and she has all her teeth her vegetables grow better than ours added sabo and yet she spends less time planting and tending to them than we do she paused i think she must be a witch and although she carries with her the worst of all thahus that of barrenness she acts as if she is not cursed at all said bori and her new garments are still more beautiful than ours muttered sabo sullenly that is true agreed bori now sabana is displeased with me because his kikoi is not so bright and soft as nkobes and my daughters all want thrones instead of sitting stools added sabo i tell them that we have scarely enough wood for the fire and they say that this is more important she has turned their heads they no longer respect their elders the young women all listen to her as if she were the wife of a chief instead of a barren manamouki complained wambu you must send her away koriba are you giving me an order wambu i asked softly and the other two women immediately fell silent she is an evil witch and she must go insisted wambu her outrage overcoming her fear of disobeying her mundumugu she is not a witch i said for if she were then i your mundumugu would certainly know it she is just a manamouki who is trying to learn our ways and who as you note carries the terrible thahu of barrenness with her if she is less than a witch she is still more than a manamouki said sabo more in what way i asked just more she answered with a sullen expression which totally summed up the problem i will speak to her again i said and you will make her shave her head demanded wambu yes and remove the flowers from her hut i will discuss it perhaps you can tell nkobe to beat her from time to time added sabo then she would not act so much like a chiefs wife i feel very sorry for him said bori for nkobe i asked bori nodded to be cursed with such a wife and further to have no children he is a good man agreed sabo he deserves better than the kenyan woman it is my understanding that he is perfectly happy with mwange i said that is all the more reason to pity him for being so foolish said wambu have you come here to talk about mwange or nkobe i asked we have said what we have come to say replied wambu getting to her feet you must do something mundumugu i will look into the matter i said she walked down the path to the village followed by sabo bori her back bent from carrying firewood all her life her stomach distended from producing three sons and five daughters all but nine of her teeth missing her legs permantly bowed from some childhood disease bori who had seen but long rains stood before me for a moment she really is a witch koriba she said you have only to look at her to know it then she too left my hill and returned to the village once again i summoned mwange to my boma she came up the path with the graceful stride of a young girl lithe and lean and filled with energy how old are you mwange i asked as she approached me she replied i usually tell people that im though she added with a smile she stood still for a moment is that why you asked me to come here to talk about my age no i said sit down mwange she seated herself on the dirt by the ashes of my morning fire and i squatted across from her how are you adjusting to your new life on kirinyaga i asked at last very well she said enthusiastically ive made many friends and i find that i dont miss the amenities of kenya at all then you are happy here very tell me about your friends well my closest friend is kibo koinnages youngest wife and i have helped sumi and kalena with their gardens and have you no friends among the older women i interrupted not really she admitted why should that be i asked they are women of your own age we dont seem to have anything to talk about do you find them unfriendly i asked she considered the question ndemis mother has always been very kind to me the others could be a little friendlier i suppose but i imagine thats just because most of them are senior wives and are very busy running their households did it ever occur to you that there could be some other reason why they are not friendly i suggested what are you getting at she asked suddenly alert there is a problem i said oh some of the older women resent your presence because im an immigrant she asked i shook my head no then why she persisted genuinely puzzled it is because we have a very rigid social order here and you have not yet fit in i thought i was fitting in very well she said defensively you were mistaken give me an example i looked at her you know that kikuyu wives must shave their heads and yet you have not done so she sighed and touched her hair i know she replied ive been meaning to but im very fond of it ill shave my head tonight she seemed visibly relieved is that what this is all about no i said that is merely an outward sign of the problem then i dont understand it is difficult to explain i said your khangas are more pleasing to the eye than theirs your garden grows better you are as old as wambu but appear younger than her daughters in their minds these things set you apart from them and make you more than a manamouki the correlary which they have not yet voiced but must surely feel is that if you are somehow more then this makes them somehow less what do you expect me to do she asked wear rags and let my gardens go to seed no i said i do not expect that then what can i do she continued youre telling me that they feel threatened because i am competent she paused you are a competent man koriba you have been schooled in europe and america you can read and write and work a computer and yet i notice that you feel no need to hide your talents i am a mundumugu i said i live alone on my hill removed from the village and i am viewed with awe and fear by my people this is the function of a mundumugu it is not the function of a manamouki who must live in the village and find her place in the social order of the tribe thats what i am trying to do she said in frustration do not try so hard if youre not telling me to be incompetant then i still dont understand one does not fit in by being different i said for example i know that you bring flowers into your house doubtless they are fragrant and pleasing to the eye but no other woman in the village decorates her hut with flowers thats not true she said defensively sumi does if so then she does it because you do it i pointed out can you see that this is even more threatening to the older women than if you alone kept flowers for it challenges their authority she stared at me trying to comprehend they have spent their entire lives achieving their positions within the tribe i continued and now you have come here and taken a position entirely outside of their order we have a new world to populate you are barren but far from feeling shame or grief you act as though this is not a terrible thahu such an attitude is contrary to their experience just as decorating your house with flowers or creating khangas with intricate patterns is contrary to their experience and thus they feel threatened i still dont see what i can do about it she protested i gave my original khangas to wambu but she refuses to wear them and i have offered to show bori how to get a greater yield from her gardens but she wont listen of course not i replied senior wives will not accept advice from a manamouki any more than a chief would accept advice from a newlycircumcised young man you must simply here i switched to english for there is no comparable term in swahili maintain a low profile if you do so in time the problems will go away she paused for a moment considering what i had told her ill try she said at last and if you must do something that will call attention to yourself i continued reverting to swahili try to do it in a way that will not offend i didnt even know i was offending she said how am i to avoid it if im calling attention to myself there are ways i answered take for example the chair that you built tom has had back spasms for years she said i built the chair because he couldnt get enough support from a stool am i supposed to let my husband suffer because some of the women dont believe in chairs no i said but you can tell the younger women that nkobe ordered you to build the chair and thus the stigma will not be upon you then it will be upon him i shook my head men have far greater leeway here than women there will be no stigma upon him for ordering his manamouki to see to his comfort i paused long enough for the thought to sink in do you understand she sighed yes and you will do as i suggest if im to live in peace with my neighbors i suppose i must there is always an alternative i said she shook her head vigorously ive dreamed of a place like this all my life and nobody is going to make me leave it now that im here ill do whatever i have to do good i said getting to my feet to signify that the interview was over then the problem will soon be solved but of course it wasnt i spent the next two weeks visiting a neighboring village whose chief had died quite suddenly he had no sons and no brothers and the line of succession was in doubt i listened to all the applicants to the throne discussed the situation with the council of elders until there was unanimity presided at the ceremony that installed the new chief in his ceremonial robes and headdress and finally returned to my own village as i climbed the path to my boma i saw a female figure sitting just outside my hut i drew closer and saw that it was shima ndemis mother jambo koriba she said jambo shima i responded you are well i trust as well as an old man can feel after walking for most of the day i responded sitting down opposite her i looked around my boma i do not see ndemi i sent him to the village for the afternoon because i wished to speak to you alone does this concern ndemi i asked she shook her head it is about mwange i sighed wearily proceed i am not like the other women koriba she began i have always been good the mwange so she has told me her ways do not bother me she continued after all someday i shall be the mother of the mundumugu and while there can be many senior wives there can be only one mundumugu and one mundumugus mother this is true i said waiting for her to get to the point of her visit therefore i have befriended mwange and have shown her many kindnesses and she has responded in kind i am pleased to hear it and because i have befriended her continued shima i have felt great compassion for her because as you know she carries the thahu of barrenness and it seemed to me that since nkobe is such a wealthy man that he should take another wife to help mwange with the work on the shamba and to produce sons and daughters she paused my daughter shuni as you know will be circumcised before the short rains come and so i approached mwange as a friend and as the mother of the future mundumugu to suggest that nkobe pay the bride price for shuni here she paused again and frowned she got very mad and yelled at me you must speak to her koriba a rich man like nkobe should not be forced to live with only a barren wife why do you keep calling nkobe a rich man i asked his shamba is small and he has only six cattle his family is rich she stated ndemi told me that they have many men and machines to do their planting and harvesting thank you for nothing little ndemi i thought irritably aloud i said all that is back on earth here nkobe is a poor man even if he is poor said shima he will not remain poor for grain and vetegables grow for mwange as for no one else as if this is ngais blessing to make up for his thahu of barrenness she stared at me you must talk to her koriba this would be a good thing shumi is very obedient and hardworking and she already likes mwange very much we will not demand a large bride price for we know that the mundumugus family will never go hungry why did you not wait for nkobe to approach you as is the custom i asked i thought if i explained my idea to mwange she would see the wisdom of it and speak to nkobe herself for he listens to her more than most husbands listen to their wives and surely the thought of a fertile woman who would share her chores would appeal to her well you have presented your idea to her i said now it is up to nkobe to make the offer or choose not to but she says that she will permit him to marry no one else answered shumi more puzzled than outraged as if a manamouki could stop her husband from buying another wife she is ignorant of our ways koriba and for this reason you must speak with her you must point out that she should be grateful to have another woman with whom to speak and share the work and she should not want nkobe to die without having fathered any children just because she has been cursed she hesitated for a moment and then concluded and you should remind her that shumi will someday be sister to the mundumugu i am glad that you are so concerned about mwanges future i said at last she caught the trace of sarcasm in my voice is it so wrong to be concerned about my little shumi as well she demanded no i admitted no it is not wrong oh said shima as if she had suddenly remembered something important when you speak to mwange remind her that she is named for my sister i do not intend to speak to mwange at all oh no i said as you yourself pointed out this is not her concern i will speak to nkobe and you will mention shumi she persisted i will speak to nkobe i answered noncommittally she got to her feet and prepared to leave you can do me a favor shima i said oh i nodded have ndemi come to my boma immediately i have many tasks for him to do here how can you be sure since you have only just returned i am sure i said adamantly she looked across my boma still the protective mother i can see no chores that have been left undone then i will find some i said i went down to the village in the afternoon for old siboki needed ointments to keep the pain from his joints and koinnage had asked me to help him settle a dispute between njoro and sangora concerning the ownership of a calf that their jointly owned cow had just produced when i had finished my business there i placed charms on some of the scarecrows and then in midafternoon i walked over to nkobes shamba where i found him herding his cattle jambo koriba he greeted me waving his hand jambo nkobe i replied approaching him would you like to come into my hut for some pombe he offered mwange just brewed it yesterday thank you for the offer but i do not care to drink warm pombe on a hot afternoon like this its actually quite cool he said she buries the gourd in the ground to keep it that way then i will have some i acquiesced falling into step beside him as he drove his cattle toward his boma mwange was waiting for us and she invited us into the cool interior of the hut and poured our pombe for us then began to leave for manamoukis do not listen to the conversation of men stay here mwange i said youre sure she said yes she shrugged and sat on the floor with her back propped up against a wall of the hut what brings you here koriba asked nkobe sitting gingerly upon his chair and i could see that his back was troubling him you have not paid us a visit before the mundumugu rarely visits those who are healthy enough to visit him i replied then this is a special occasion said nkobe yes i replied sipping my pombe this is a special occasion what is it this time asked mwange warily what do you mean this time said nkobe sharply there have been some minor problems i answered none of which concern you anything that affects mwange concerns me responded nkobe i am not blind or deaf koriba i know that the older women have refused to accept her and im getting more than a little bit angry about it she has gone out of her way to fit in here and has met them more than halfway i did not come here to discuss mwange with you i said oh he said suspiciously are you saying we have a problem that concerns him demanded mwange it concerns both of you i replied that is why i have come here all right koriba what is it said nkobe you have made a good effort to fit into the community and to live as a kikuyu nkobe i said and yet there is one more thing that you will be expected to do and it is this that i have come to discuss with you and what is that sooner or later you will be expected to take another wife i knew it said mwange im very happy with the wife i have said nkobe with unconcealed hostility that may be i said draining the last of my pombe but you have no children and as mwange gets older she will need someone to help her with her duties now you listen to me snapped nkobe i came here because i thought it would make mwange happy so far shes been ostracised and shunned and gossiped about and now youre telling me that i have to take another wife into my house so that mwange can keep being spat on by the other women we dont need this koriba i was just as happy on my farm in kenya i can go back there any time i want if that is the way you feel then perhaps you should return to keyna i said tom said mwange staring at him and he fell silent it is true that you do not have to stay i continued but you are kikuyus living on a kikuyu world and if you do stay you will be expected to act as kikuyus theres no law that says a kikuyu man must take a second wife said nkobe sullenly no there is no such law i admitted nor is there a law that says a kikuyu man must father children but these are our traditions and you will be expected to abide by them to hell with them he muttered in english mwange laid a restraining hand on his arm there is a coterie of young warriors who live beyond the forest she said why dont they marry some of the young women why should the men of the village monopolize them all they cannot afford wives i said that is why they live alone thats their problem said nkobe ive made many sacrifices in the name of communal harmony said mwange but this is asking too much koriba we are happy just the way we are and we intend to stay this way you will not remain happy what does that mean she demanded next month is the circumcision ritual i said when it is over there will be many girls eligible for marriage and since you are barren it is only reasonable to suppose that a number of their families will suggest that nkobe pay the bride price for their daughters he may refuse once he may refuse twice but if he continues to refuse he will offend most of the village they will assume that because he comes from kenya he feels their women are not good enough for him and they will be further offended by the fact that he refuses to have children with which to populate our empty planet then ill explain my reasons to them said nkobe they will not understand i answered no they will not understand agreed mwange unhappily then they will have to learn to live with it said nkobe firmly and you will have to learn to live with silence and animosity i said is this the life you envisioned when you came to kirinyaga of course not snapped nkobe but nothing can make me we will think about it koriba interrupted mwange nkobe turned to his wife stunned what are you saying i am saying that we will think about it repeated mwange that is all that i ask i said getting to my feet and walking to the door of the hut you demand a lot koriba said mwange bitterly i demand nothing i replied i merely suggest coming from the mundumugu is there a difference i did not answer her because in truth there was no difference whatsoever you seem unhappy koriba said ndemi he had just finished feeding my chickens and my goats and now he sat down beside me in the shade of my acacia tree i am i said mwange he said nodding his head mwange i agreed two weeks had passed since i had visited her and nkobe i saw her this morning when i went to the river to fill your gourds said ndemi she too seems unhappy she is i said and there is nothing that i can do about it but you are the mundumugu i know you are the most powerful of men continued ndemi surely you can put an end to her sorrow i sighed the mundumugu is both the both the most powerful and the weakest of men in mwanges case i am the weakest i do not understand the mundumugu is the most powerful of men when it comes to interpreting the law i said but he is also the weakest of men for it is he of all men who must be bound by that law no matter what else happens i paused i should allow her to be what she can be instead of being merely a manamouki and failing that i should make her leave kirinyaga and return to kenya i sighed again but she must behave like a manamouki if she is to have a life here and she has broken no law that would allow me to force her to leave ndemi frowned being a mundumugu can be more difficult that i thought i smiled at him and placed a hand upon his head tomorrow i will begin to teach you to make the ointments that cure the sick really he said his face brightening i nodded your last statement tells me that you are no longer a child i have not been a child for many rains he protested do not say any more i told him with a wry smile or we will do more harvest prayers instead he immediately fell silent and i looked out across the distant savannah where a swirling tower of dust raced across the arid plain and wondered for perhaps the thousandth time what to do about mwange how long i sat thus motionless i do not know but eventually i felt ndemi tugging at the blanket i had wrapped around my shoulders women he whispered what i said not comprehending from the village he said gesturing toward the path that led to my boma i looked where he indicated and saw four of the village women approaching there was wambu and sabo and bori and with them this time was morina the second wife of kimoda should i leave asked ndemi i shook my head if you are to become a mundumugu it is time you started listening to a mundumugus problems the four women stopped perhaps ten feet away from me jambo i said staring at them the kenyan witch must leave said wambu we have been through this before i said but now she has broken the law said wambu oh i said in what way wambu grabbed morina by the arm and shoved her even closer to me tell him she said triumphantly she has bewitched my daughter said morina obviously uneasy in my presence how has mwange bewitched your daughter i asked my muri was a good obedient child said muri she always helped me grind the grain and she dutifully cared for her two younger brothers when i was working in the fields and she never left the thorn gate open at night so that hyenas could enter our boma and kill our goats and cattle she paused and i could see that she was trying very hard not to cry all she could talk about since the last long rains was her forthcoming circumsion ceremony and who she hoped would pay the bride price for her she was a perfect daughter a daughter any mother would be proud of now a tear trickled down her cheek and then the kenyan woman came and muri spent her time with her and now suddenly the single tear became a veritable flood now she tells me that she refuses to be circumsized she will never marry and she will die an old barren woman morina could speak no more and began beating her breasts with her clenched fists that is not all added wambu the reason muri does not wish to be circumcized is because the kenyan woman herself has not been circumsized and yet the kenyan woman has married a kikuyu man and has tried to live among us as his manamouki she glared at me she has broken the law koriba we must cast her out i am the mundumugu i replied sternly i will decide what must be done you know what must be done said wambu furiously that is all i said i will hear no more wambu glared at me but did not dare to disobey me and finally turning on her heel she stalked back down the path to the village followed by sabo and the stillwailing morina bori stood where she was for an extra moment then turned to me it is as i told you before koriba she said almost apologetically she really is a witch then she too began walking back to the village what will you do koriba asked ndemi the law is clear i said wearily no uncircumcised woman may live with a kikuyu man as his wife then you will make her leave kirinyaga i will offer her a choice i said and i will hope that she chooses to leave it is too bad said ndemi she has tried very hard to be a good manamouki i know i said then why is ngai visiting her with such unhappiness because sometimes trying is not enough we stood at haven mwange nkobe and i awaiting the maintenance ships arrival i am truly sorry that things did not work out i said sincerely nkobe glared at me but said nothing it didnt have to end this way said mwange bitterly we had no choice i said if we are to create our utopia here on kirinyaga we must be bound by its rules the fact that a rule exists does not make it right koriba she said i gave up almost everything to live here but i will not let them mutilate me in the name of some foolish custom without our traditions we are not kikuyu but only kenyans who live on another world i pointed out there is a difference between tradition and stagnation koriba she said if you stifle every variation in taste and behavior in the name of the former you achieve only the latter she paused i would have been a good member of the community but a poor manamouki i said the leopard may be a stealthy hunter and fearsome killer but he does not belong among a pride of lions lions and leopards have been extinct for a long time koriba she said we are talking about human beings not animals and no matter how many rules you make and no matter how many traditions you invoke you cannot make all human beings think and feel and act alike its coming announced nkobe as the maintenance ship broke through the thin cloud cover kwaheri nkobe i said extending my hand he looked contemptuously at my hand for a moment then turned his back and continued watching the maintenance ship i turned to mwange i tried koriba she said i really did no one ever tried harder i said kwaheri mwange she stared at me her face suddenly an emotionless mask goodbye koriba she said in english and my name is wanda the next morning shima came to me to complain that shumi had rejected the suitor that had been arranged for her two days later wambu complained to me that kibo koinnages youngest wife had decorated her hut with colorful ribbons and was beginning to let her hair grow and the morning after that kimi who had only one son announced that she wanted no more children i thought it had ended i said with a sigh as i watched sangora kimis distressed husband walk back down the path to the village that is because you have made a mistake koriba why do you say that because you believed the wrong story answered ndemi with the confidence of youth oh he nodded you believed the story about the ugly buffalo and which story should i have believed the story of the mundumugu and the serpent why do you think one story is more worthy of belief than the other i asked him does not the story of the mundumugu and the serpent tell us that we cannot be rid of that which ngai created simply because we find it repugnant or unsettling that is true i said ndemi smiled and held up three fingers shumi kibo kimi he said counting them off three serpents have returned already there are yet to come and suddenly i had the awful premonition that he was right
