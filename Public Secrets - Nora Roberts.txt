public secrets by nora roberts prologue los angeles she slammed on the brakes ramming hard into the curb the radio continued to blare she pressed both hands against her mouth to hold back hysterical laughter a blast from the past the disk jockey had called it a blast from her past devastation was still rocking somehow her brain functioned to take care of little matters turn off the ignition take out the key pull open the door she was shaking in the late evening heat an earlier rain and rising temperatures caused mist to spiral up from the pavement she ran through it looking frantically right left back over her shoulder the dark shed nearly forgotten there were things that hid in the dark the noise level rose as she pushed open the doors the fluorescent lights dazzled her eyes she continued to run knowing only that she was terrified and someone anyone had to listen she raced along the hallway her heart beating a hard tatoo a dozen or more phones were ringing voices merged and mixed in complaints shouts questions someone cursed in a low continual stream she saw the doors marked homicide and bit back a sob he was kicked back at his desk one foot resting on a torn blotter a phone tucked between his shoulder and ear a styrofoam cup of coffee was halfway to his lips please help me she said collapsing into the chair facing him someones trying to kill me chapter one london the first time emma met her father she was nearly three years old she knew what he looked like because her mother kept pictures of him meticulously cut from newspapers and glossy magazines on every surface in their cramped threeroom flat jane palmer had a habit of carrying her daughter emma from picture to picture hanging on the waterstained walls and sitting on the dusty scarred furniture and telling her of the glorious love affair that had bloomed between herself and brian mcavoy lead singer for the hot rock group devastation the more jane drank the greater that love became emma understood only parts of what she was told she knew that the man in the pictures was important that he and his band had played for the queen she had learned to recognize his voice when his songs came on the radio or when her mother put one of the s she collected on the record player emma liked his voice and what she would learn later was called its faint irish lilt some of the neighbors tuttutted about the poor little girl upstairs with a mother who had a fondness for the gin bottle and a vicious temper there were times they heard janes shrill curses and emmas sobbing walls their lips would firm and knowing looks would pass between the ladies as they shook out their rugs or hung up the weekly wash in the early days of the summer of the summer of love they shook their heads when they heard the little girls cries through the open window of the palmer flat most agreed that young jane palmer god no one ever before or since had matched him in bed there was a hunger in him a wild hunger he hid so well under his cool and cocky exterior she had known him since childhood had been his on again offagain lover for more than ten years no one knew better what brian was capable of when fully aroused she allowed herself to fantasize just for a moment what it would be like when he peeled the dress away when his eyes roamed over her when his slender musicians fingers unhooked the frilly corset theyd been good together she remembered as she felt herself go damp they would be good together again bringing herself back she picked up the brush and smoothed her hair she had spent the last of the grocery money at the hairdressers getting her shoulderlength straight hair colored to match emmas turning her head she watched it sway from side to side after today she wouldnt have to worry about money ever again her lips were carefully painted a pale pale pinkthe same shade she had seen on supermodel jane ashers recent vogue cover nervous she picked up her black liner and added more definition near the corner of each eye fascinated emma watched her mother thday she smelled of tigress cologne instead of gin tentatively emma reached out for the lipstick tube her hand was slapped away keep your hands off my things she gave emmas finger an extra slap havent i told you never to touch my things emma nodded her eyes had already filmed over and dont start that bawling i dont want him seeing you for the first time with your eyes all red and your face puffy he should have been here already there was an edge to janes voice now one that had emma moving cautiously out of range if he doesnt come soon she trailed off going over her options as she studied herself in the glass she had always been a big girl but had never run to fat true the dress was a little snug but she strained against it in interesting places skinny might be in fashion but she knew men preferred round curvy women when the lights went out shed been making her living off her body long enough to be sure of it her confidence built as she looked herself over and she fancied she resembled the pale sulkyfaced models who were the rage in london she wasnt wise enough to note that the new color jpb was unflattering or that the arrowstraight hair made the angles of her face boxy and harsh she wanted to be in tune she always had he probably didnt believe me didnt want to men never want their children she shrugged her father had never wanted hernot until her breasts had begun to develop you remember that emma girl she cast a considering eye over emma men dont want babies they only want a woman for one thing and youll find out what that is soon enough when theyre done theyre done and youre left with a big stomach and a broken heart she picked up a cigarette and began to smoke it in quick jerky puffs as she paced she wished it was grass sweet calming grass but shed spent her drug money on emmas new dress the sacrifices a mother made well he may not want you but after one look he wont be able to deny youre his eyes narrowed against the smoke she studied her daughter there was another tug almost maternal the little tyke was certainly pretty as a picture when she was cleaned up youre the goddamn image of him emma luy the papers say hes going to marry that wilson slutold money and fancy mannersbut well see well just see about that hell come back to me i always knew hed come back she stubbed the cigarette in a chipped ashtray and left it smoldering she needed a drinkjust one taste of gin to calm her nerves you sit on the bed she ordered sit right there and keep quiet mess with any of my stuff and youll be sorry she had two drinks before she heard the knock on the door her heart began to pound like most drunks she felt more attractive more in control once shed had the liquor she smoothed down her hair fixed what she thought was a sultry smile on her face and opened the door he was beautiful for a moment in the streaming summer sunlight she saw only him tall and slender his wavy blond hair and full serious mouth giving him the look of a poet or an apostle as nearly as she was able she loved brian so nice of you to drop by her smile faded immediately when she saw the two men behind him traveling in a pack these days bri he wasnt in the mood he was carrying around a simmering rage at being trapped into seeing jane again and put the bulk of the blame on his manager and his flancee now that he was here he intended to get out again as quickly as possible you remember johnno brian stepped inside the smell gin sweat and grease from yesterdays dinner reminded him uncomfortably of his own childhood sure jane nodded briefly to the tall gangly bass player he was wearing a diamond on his pinky and sported a dark fluffy beard come up in the world havent we johnno he glanced around the dingy flat some of us this is pete page our manager miss palmer smooth thirtyish pete offered a whitetoothed smile and a manicured hand ive heard all about you she laid her hand in his back up an invitation to lift it to his lips he released it you made our boys stars i opened a few doors performing for the queen playing on the telly got a new album on the charts and a big american tour coming up she looked back at brian his hair fell nearly to his shoulders his face was thin and pale and sensitive reproductions of it were gracing teenagers walls on both sides of the atlantic as his second album complete devastation bulleted up the charts got everything you wanted damned if hed let her make him feel guilty because hed made something of himself thats right some of us get more than they want she tossed her long hair back the paint on the swingy gold balls she wore at her ears was chipped and peeling she smiled again posing a moment at twentyfour she was a year older than brian and considered herself much more savvy id offer tea but i wasnt expecting a party we didnt come for tea brian stuck his hands in the wide pockets of his lowriding jeans the sulky look hed worn throughout the drive over had hardened true he was young but hed grown up tough he had no intention of letting this old ginsoaked loner make trouble for him i didnt call the law this time jane thats for old times sake if you keep ringing keep writing with all your threats and blackmail believe me i will her heavily lined eyes narrowed you want to put the hobbies on me you go right ahead my lad well see how all your little fans and their stickinthemud parents like reading about how you got me pregnant about how you deserted me and your poor little baby girl while youre rolling in money and living high how would that go over mr page think you could get bri and the boys another royal command performance miss palmer petes voice was smooth and calm hed already spent hours considering the ins and outs of the situation one glance told him hed wasted his time the answer here would be money im sure you dont want to air your personal business in the press nor do i think you should imply desertion when there was none ooh is he your manager brian or your blinking solicitor you werent pregnant when i left you didnt know i was pregnant she shouted and gripped brians black leather vest it was two months later when i found out for sure you were gone by then i didnt know where to find you i could have gotten rid of it she clung harder when brian started to pry her hands off i knew people who could have fixed it for me but i was scared more scared of that than of having it so she had a kid johnno sat on the arm of a chair and pulled out a gauloise which he lit with a heavy gold lighter in the past two years hed gotten very comfortable with expensive habits that dont mean it was yours bri its his you freaking fag my my unperturbed johnno drew on the cigarette then blew the smoke lightly but directly into her face quite the lady arent we back off johnno petes voice remained low and calm miss palmer were here to settle this whole matter quietly and that she thought was her ace in the hole ill just bet youd like to keep it quiet you know i wasnt with anybody else back then brian she leaned into him letting her breasts press and flatten against his chest you remember that christmas the last christmas we were together we got high and a little crazy we never used anything emma shell be three next september he remembered though he wished he didnt hed been nineteen and full of music and rage someone had brought cocaine and after hed snorted for the first time hed felt like a thoroughbred stud quivering to tick so you had a baby and you think shes mine why did you wait until now to tell me about her i told you i couldnt find you at first jane moistened her lips and wished shed had just one more drink she didnt think it would be wise to tell him shed enjoyed playing the martyr for a while the poor unwed mother all alone and thered been a man or two along the way to ease the road i went on this program they have them for girls who get in trouble i thought maybe id give her away you know for adoption after i had her i couldnt because she looked just like you i thought if i gave her up youd find out about it and get mad at me i was afraid you wouldnt give me another chance she started to cry big fat tears that smeared her heavy makeup they were uglier and more disturbing because they were sincere i always knew youd come back brian i started hearing your songs on the radio seeing posters of you in the record store you were on your way i always knew youd make it but jesus i never knew youd be so big i started thinking ill bet you did johnno murmured i started thinking she said between her teeth that youd want to know about the kid i went back to your old place but youd moved and nobody would tell me where but i thought about you every day look taking his arm she pointed to the pictures shed crowded on the walls of the flat i cut out everything i could find about you and saved it he looked at himself reproduced a dozen times his stomach turned jesus i called your record company and i even went there but they treated me like i was nobody i told them i was the mother of brian mcavoys baby daughter and they had me tossed out she didnt add that shed been drunk and had attacked the receptionist i started reading about you and beverly wilson and i got desperate i knew she couldnt mean anything to you not after what we had but i had to talk to you somehow calling bevs flat and raving like a maniac wasnt the best way to go about it i had to talk to you to make you listen you dont know what its like bri worrying about how to pay the rent whether youve got enough for food i cant buy pretty dresses anymore or go out at night is money what you want she hesitated just an instant too long i want you bri i always have johnno tapped out his cigarette in the base of a plastic plant you know bri theres been a lot of talk about this kid but i dont see any sign of her he rose and in a habitual gesture shook back his gleaming mop of dark hair ready to split jane sent him a vicious look emmas in the bedroom and im not having all of your troop in there this is between brian and me johnno grinned at her you always did your best work in the bed room didnt you luy their eyes held for a moment the disgust they had always felt for each other clear bri she was a firstrate whore once upon a time but shes secondrate now can we get on you bloody queer jane leaped at him before brian caught her around the waist you wouldnt know what to do with a real woman if she bit you on the dick he continued to grin but his eyes frosted over care to give it a shot dearie always could count on you to keep things running smoothly johnno brian muttered as he twisted jane around in his arms you said this business was with me then keep it with me ill have a look at the girl not them two she snarled at johnno as he shrugged and pulled out another cigarette just you i want to keep it private fine wait here he kept his hand on janes arm as she walked to the bedroom it was empty im tired of the game jane shes hiding all these people put her off thats all emma come here to your mam right now jane dropped to her knees beside the bed then scrambled up to search through the narrow closet shes probably in the loo rushing out she pulled open a door off the hallway brian johnno signaled from the kitchen doorway something here you might want to see he held up a glass toasting jane you dont mind if i have a drink do you luy the bottle was open he jerked the thumb of his free hand toward the cabinet under the sink the stale scent was stronger there old liquor ripening garbage molding rags brians shoes stuck to the linoleum as he crossed to the cupboard then crouched he pulled open the door and peered inside he couldnt see the girl clearly only that she was hunched back in the corner her blond hair in her eyes and something black hugged in her arms he felt his stomach turn over but tried to smile hello there emma buried her face in the furry black bundle she held nasty little brat ill teach you to hide from me jane started to make a grab but a look from brian stopped her he held out a hand and smiled again i dont think i can fit in there with you would you mind coming out a minute he saw her peep up over her folded arms no ones going to hurt you he had such a nice voice emma thought soft and pretty like music he was smiling at her the light through the kitchen window was on his hair making the deep rich blond shine like an angels hair she giggled then crawled out her new dress was smeared and spotted her wispy baby hair was damp from a leak under the sink she smiled showing little white teeth with a crooked inciser brian ran his tongue over a similar one in his own mouth when her lips curved a dimple winked at the left corner of her mouth a twin of his eyes as deep and blue as his own stared back at him i fixed her up real nice there was a whine in janes voice now the smell of the gin was making her mouth water but she was afraid to pour a glass and i told her it was important to stay tidy didnt i tell you to stay tidy emma ill wash her up she grabbed emmas arm hard enough to make the girl jump let her be i was only going to let her be brian repeated his voice flat and dull and threatening if he hadnt been staring at her still emma might have dashed under the sink again his child for a moment he could only continue to stare at her his head light and his stomach fisted hello emma there was a sweetness in his tone now one women fell in love with what have you got there charlie my doggie she held the stuffed toy out for brian to examine and a very nice one he had an urge to touch her to brush his hand over her skin but held back do you know who i am from the pictures too young to resist impulses she reached out to touch his face pretty johnno laughed and swallowed some gin leave it to a female ignoring him brian tugged on emmas damp curls youre pretty too he talked nonsense to her watching her closely his knees were like jelly and his stomach tightened and loosened like fingers snapping to a beat her dimple deepened as she laughed it was like watching himself it would have been easier to deny it and a great deal more convenient but impossible whether he had meant to or not he had made her but guidance didnt come along with acceptance he rose and turned to pete weld better get to rehearsal youre leaving jane dashed forward to block his path just like that you only have to look at her to see i know what i see he felt a pang of guilt as emma inched back toward the cupboard i need time to think no no youll walk out like before youre only thinking of yourself like always whats best for brian whats best for brians career i wont be left back anymore he had nearly reached the door when she snatched up emma and raced after him if you go ill kill myself he paused long enough to look back it was a familiar refrain he could have set it to music that stopped working a long time ago and her desperate she flung out the threat then let it hang as they both considered it the arm she had banded around emmas waist tightened until the girl began to scream he felt a bubble of panic as the childs his childs screams bounced off the walls let her go jane youre hurting her what do you care jane was sobbing now her voice rising higher and higher to drown out her daughters youre walking out no im not i need a little time to think this through time so your fancy manager can make up a story you mean she was breathing fast gripping the struggling emma with both arms youre going to do right by me brian his hands had balled into fists at his sides put her down ill kill her she said it more calmly this time having centered on it ill slit her throat i swear it and then my own can you live with that brian shes bluffing johnno muttered but his palms were sweating ive got nothing to lose do you think i want to live like this raising a brat all on my own having the neighbors gossip about me never being able to go out and have fun anymore you think about it bri think about what the papers will do when i call in the story ill tell them everything right before i kill us both miss palmer peter held up a soothing hand i give you my word well come to an arrangement that suits everyone let johnno take emma into the kitchen jane well talk brian took a careful step toward her well find a way to do whats best for everyone i only want you to come back im not going anywhere braced he watched her grip relax well talk he signaled johnno with a slight nod of the head well talk it all through why dont we sit down reluctantly johnno pried the girl from her mother a fastidious man he wrinkled his nose a little at the grime shed accumulated under the sink but carried her into the kitchen when she continued to cry he sat down with emma on his lap and patted her head come on now cutie give over johnno wont let anything bad happen to you he jiggled her trying to think what his mother might have done want a biscuit dampeyed hiccuping she nodded he jiggled some more under the tears and dirt he decided she was a taking little thing and a mcavoy he admitted with a sigh a mcavoy through and through got any we can pinch she smiled then and pointed to a high cupboard thirty minutes later they were finishing up the plate of biscuits and the sweet tea hed brewed brian watched them from the kitchen doorway as johnno made faces so that emma giggled when the chips were down brian thought you could always depend on johnno going in brian ran a hand down his daughters hair emma would you like to ride in my car she licked crumbs from her lips with johnno yeah with johnno im a hit johnno popped the last biscuit into his mouth id like you to stay with me emma in my new house bri he cut johnno off lifting a hand palm up its a nice house and you could have your own room i have to im your dad emma and id like you to live with me you could try it and if youre not happy well think of something else emma studied him her full bottom lip pushed out in a pout she was used to his face but it was different somehow from the pictures she didnt know or care why his voice made her feel good safe is my mam coming no her eyes filled but she picked up her battered black dog and hugged it close is charlie sure brian held out his arms and lifted her hope you know what youre doing son brian sent him a look over emmas head so do i emma had her first look at the big stone house from the front seat of the silver jag she was sorry that johnno with his funny beard was gone but the man from the pictures let her push buttons on the dash he wasnt smiling anymore but he didnt scold he smelled nice the car smelled nice she pushed charlies nose into the seat and babbled to herself the house looked enormous to her with its arching windows and curvy turrets it was stone weathered gray and all the windows were made up of diamond shapes the lawn around it was thick and green and there was a scent of flowers she grinned bouncing with excitement castle he smiled now yeah i thought so too when i was little i wanted to live in a house like this my dadyour granddaused to work in the garden here when he wasnt passed out drunk brian added to himself is he here no hes in ireland in a little cottage brian had bought with money pete had advanced him a year before he stopped the car at the front entrance realizing he would have to make some calls before the story hit the papers youll meet him someday and your aunts and uncles your cousins he gathered her up amazed and baffled at how easily she cuddled against him you have a family now emma when he walked inside still carrying her he heard bevs light quick voice i think the blue the plain blue i cant live with all these flowers growing on the walls and those beastly hangings have to go its like a cave in here i want white white and blue he turned into the parlor doorway and saw her sitting on the floor dozens of sample books and swatches around her part of the wallpaper had already been stripped part of the replastering was finished bev preferred tackling a single job from a dozen angles she looked so small and sweet sitting amid the rubble her dark cap of hair was cut short and straight to angle down toward her chin big gold hoops glinted at her ears her eyes were exotic both in shape and color they were longlidded with gold lights flecked in pale seagreen she was still tanned from the weekend they had spent in the bahamas he knew exactly how her skin would feel how it would smell she had a small triangularshaped face and a small angular body no one looking at her sitting crosslegged in snug checked pants and a tidy white shirt would suspect she was two months pregnant brian shifted his daughter in his arms and wondered how his pregnant lover would react brian i didnt hear you she turned half rising then went still oh her color drained as she stared at the child in his arms recovering quickly she stood and signaled to two decorators who were bickering over samples brian and i want to discuss our choices a little more ill call you by the end of the week she hurried them out making promises flattering when she closed the door on them she took a deep breath holding a hand over the baby growing inside her this is emma bev forced a smile hello emma lo suddenly shy she buried her face in brians neck emma would you like to watch the telly for a while brian gave her bottom a reassuring pat when she only shrugged he went on desperately cheerful theres a nice big one in this room over here you and charlie can sit on the sofa i have to pee she whispered oh well bev blew her bangs out of her eyes if she hadnt felt so much like crying she might have laughed ill take her but emma clung tighter to brians neck i guess im elected he took her to the powder room across the hall sent bev a helpless look then closed the door do you ah pulled down her panties and sat he trailed off when emma i dont wet my pants she said matteroffactly mam says only stupid nasty girls do youre a big girl he said stifling a fresh flow of rage very pretty and very smart finished she struggled back into her panties can you watch the telly in a little while i need to talk to bev shes a very nice lady he added as he lifted her up to the sink she lives with me too emma played with the running water a moment does she hit no he pulled her into his arms holding tight no ones going to hit you again i promise then he carried her out past bev to a sitting room with a cushy sofa and a big console television he switched it on settled on a loud comedy show and said ill be back soon emma watched him walk out relieved when he left the door open maybe wed better go in here bev gestured to the parlor inside she sat on the floor again and began poking at samples it seems jane wasnt lying no shes mine i can see that bri she looks so much like you its scary she felt tears well up and hated herself oh christ bev no dont she said when he started to slip an arm around her i need a minute its a shock it was one for me too he lit a cigarette drew hard you know why i broke things off with jane you said it felt like she could eat you alive she wasnt stable bev even when we were kids she was never quite right she couldnt look at him not yet she reminded herself that it had been she who had pressured him into seeing jane again into finding out the truth about the child folding her hands in her lap bev stared into the dusty marble fireplace youve known her a long time she was the first girl i ever slept with i was barely thirteen he rubbed his hands over his eyes wishing it wasnt so easy to remember my father would get drunk go on one of his famous rages before he passed out id hide out in the cellar of the flat one day jane was there like she was waiting before i knew it she was on top of me you dont have to go into all this bri want you to know he took his time drawing in smoke letting it out we seemed a lot alike jane and i somebody was always fighting at her house too there was never enough money then when i started getting interested in music i spent more time with that than her she went crazy she threatened me threatened herself i kept away from her then not long after the guys and i got together when we were struggling so hard to get a break she showed up again we were playing in dives barely making enough for food i guess it was because she was someone i knew someone who knew me mostly it was because i was an asshole bev sniffled gave a watery laugh youre still an asshole yeah we got back together almost a year toward the end she was outrageous trying to start trouble between me and the others shed break up rehearsals make scenes she even came to the club and went after one of the girls in the audience afterward shed cry and beg me to forgive her it got to the point where it stopped being easier to say sure fine forget it she said shed kill herself when i broke it off with her wed just hooked up with pete and had a series of gigs in france and germany he was working on the first record deal we got out of london and i put her out of my mind i didnt know she was pregnant bev i hadnt even thought of her in over three years if i could go back he broke off thinking of the child in the next room with her crooked tooth and little dimple i dont know what id do bev drew up her knees and leaned over them she was a young practical woman from a stable family it was still difficult for her to understand poverty and pain though those were the very things in brians background that had drawn her to him i guess its more to the point what youre going to do now ive already done it he stubbed out the cigarette in a nineteenthcentury porcelain bowl bev didnt bother to mention it what have you done bri ive taken emma shes mine shes going to live with me i see she took a cigarette shed cut out drinking and her dabbling with drugs since her pregnancy but tobacco was a harder habit to break you didnt think we should talk it over the last i heard we were going to be married in a few days are going to be he took her by the shoulders then shaking her afraid that she like so many others would turn awqy from him goddamnit bev i wanted to talk to you i couldnt he released her to spring up and kick at the sample books i walked into that filthy stinking flat intending to do no more than threaten jane if she didnt stop harassing us she was exactly the same screaming one minute pleading the next she said emma was in the bedroom but she wasnt there she was hiding he pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes jesus bev i found the kid hiding under the sink like a frightened animal oh god bev dropped her head on her knees jane was going to beat hershe was going to beat that tiny little girl because she was frightened when i saw her bev look at me please when i saw her i saw myself can you understand i want to she shook her head still fighting tears no i dont i want things to be the way they were when you left this morning do you think i should have walked out on her no yes she pressed her fisted hands on each side of her head i dont know we should have talked we could have arranged some sort of settlement he knelt beside her to take her hands i was going to leave drive around a little and think before i came home to talk to you jane said shed kill herself oh bri i might have handled that i think i was furious enough to egg her on but then she said shed kill emma too bev pressed a hand against her stomach over the child that was growing inside her a child that was already beautifully real to her no oh no she couldnt have meant it she did he tightened his grip on her hands whether she would have followed through i dont know but at that moment she meant it i couldnt leave emma there bev i couldnt have left a strangers child there no she took her hands from his to lift them to his face her brian she thought her sweet caring brian you couldnt have how did you get her away from jane she agreed brian said shortly petes having documents drawn up so it will all be legal bri her hands firmed on his cheeks she was in love but she wasnt blind how i wrote her a check for a hundred thousand pounds in the agreement shell get twentyfive thousand a year every year until emma reaches twentyone bev let her hands drop away christ brian you bought that baby you cant buy whats already yours he bit off the words because it made him feel dirty i gave jane enough to be sure she would stay away from emma from us he laid a hand on her stomach from ours listen to me theres going to be press some of it will be ugly im asking you to stick with me ride it out and to give emma a chance where would i go bev she shook her head she would stick with him but she needed a little time yet ive been reading a lot of books lately im pretty sure you shouldnt leave a toddler alone for this long right ill go take a look well take a look she was still on the sofa her arms curled tight around charlie the blare of the television didnt disturb her as she slept there were tears drying on her cheeks seeing them bevs heart broke a little i guess wed better get the decorators busy on a bedroom upstairs emma lay in the bed between fresh soft sheets and kept her eyes tightly closed she knew if she opened them it would be dark there were things that hid in the dark she kept a hammerlock on charlies neck and listened sometimes the things made swishing noises she couldnt hear them now but she knew they were waiting waiting for her to open her eyes a whimper escaped and she bit her lip mam always got mad if she cried at night mam would come in and shake her hard tell her she was stupid and a baby the things would slink under the bed or into the corners while her mam was there emma buried her face in charlies familiar stalesmelling fur she remembered that she was in a different place the place where the man from the pictures lived some of the fear vanished in curiosity he said she could call him dad that was a funny name keeping her eyes closed she tried it murmuring it into the dark like a chant they had eaten fish and chips in the kitchen with the darkhaired lady there had been music it seemed music played in the house all the time whenever the dad man spoke it sounded like music the lady had seemed unhappy even when she had smiled emma wondered if the lady was going to wait until they were alone before she hit hed given her a bath emma remembered that hed had a funny look on his face but his hands hadnt pinched and he hadnt gotten much soap in her eyes he asked about her bruises and she had told him what her mam had warned her to say if anyone asked she was clumsy she fell down emma had seen the angry look come into his eyes but he hadnt smacked her hed given her a shirt to wear and she had giggled because it had come all the way to her toes the lady had come with him when he had put her in bed shed sat on the edge and smiled when he had told a story about castles and princesses but they had been gone when shed awakened theyd been gone and the room was dark she was afraid afraid the things would get her snap their big teeth eat her she was afraid her mam would come and slap her because she wasnt home in her own bed what was that she was sure she had heard a whispering noise in the corner breathing through her teeth she opened one eye the shadows shifted towering reaching muffling her sobs against charlie emma tried to make herself smaller so small she couldnt be seen couldnt be eaten by all the ugly squishy things that hid in the dark her mam had sent them because shed gone with the man in the pictures the terror built so that she was shuddering sweating it burst out of her in one high wall as she scrambled out of bed and stumbled into the hallway something crashed she lay sprawled clutching the dog and waiting for the worst lights came on they made her blink the old fear dissolved in a new one as she heard voices emma scooted back against the wall and sat frozen staring at the shards of china from the vase shed broken they would beat her send her away shut her up in a dark room to be eaten emma still dazed with sleep floating a bit on the joint hed smoked before he and bev had made love brian walked toward her she curled into herself bracing for the blow are you all right they broke it she told him hoping to save herself they the dark things mam sent them to get me oh emma he dropped his cheek to the top of her head brian what still belting her robe bev rushed out she saw what was left of her dresden vase gave a little sigh then crossed to them avoiding the shards is she hurt i dont think so shes terrified lets have a look she took emmas hand it was fisted her arm taut as a wire emma her voice had firmed but there was no meanness in it cautious emma lifted her head did you hurt yourself still wary emma pointed to her knee there were a few drops of blood on the white tshirt bev lifted the hem it was a long scratch but shallow still she imagined most children would have wailed over it perhaps emma didnt because it was nothing compared to the bruises brian had found on the girl when hed bathed her in a gesture more automatic than maternal bev lowered her head to kiss the hurt when she saw emmas mouth drop open in shock her heart was lost all right sweetie well take care of it she picked emma up and nuzzled her neck there are things in the dark emma whispered your daddy will chase them away wont you bri the irish in him or perhaps the drug made him weepy when he looked at the woman he loved holding his child sure ill chop them up and toss them out after you do youd better sweep this up bev told him emma spent the night the first of her new life snuggled with her family in a big brass bed as she had every day for nine days emma sat on the big window seat in the front parlor and looked through the mullioned glass she stared beyond the edges of the garden with its nodding foxglove and bushy columbine to the long graveled drive and waited her bruises were fading but she hadnt noticed no one in the big new house had hit her yet shed been given tea every day and presents of sugar plums and china dolls from the friends who came and went so casually in her fathers house it was all very confusing for emma she was given a bath every day even if she hadnt been playing in the dirt and cleansmelling clothes to wear no one called her a stupid baby because she was frightened of the dark the lamp with the pink shade was turned on in her room every night and there were little rosebuds on the walls the monsters hardly ever came into her new room she was afraid to like it because she was sure her mam would be coming soon to take her away again bev had driven her in the pretty car to go shopping in a big store with bright clothes and beautiful smells she had bought bags and boxes of things for emma emma liked a pink organdy dress with a frilly skirt the best shed felt like a princess when shed worn it the day her dad and bev had been married shed had shiny black shoes with little straps as well and white tights no one had scolded when shed smudged the knees the wedding had seemed very strange and solemn to emma with everyone standing out in the garden and the sun fighting off clouds one of the men everyone called stevie had worn a long white shirt and baggy white pants hed sung in a husky voice while strumming a glossy white guitar emma had thought he was an angel but when shed asked johnno hed only laughed bev had worn a circle of flowers in her hair and a flowing multicolored dress that had swept her ankles to emma she was the most beautiful woman in the world for the first time in her young life she had been struck by true envy th be beautiful and grownup and standing beside dad shed never be afraid again or hungry again and like the girls in the fairy tales brian was so fond of she would be happy ever after when the rain had started they had gone inside to have cake and champagne in a room with fabric books and flowers and fresh paint more guitars had been played and people had sung along and laughed beautiful women in slim short skirts or flowing cotton dresses had roamed the house some of them had cooed over her or patted her head but for the most part shed been left to herself no one noticed that shed had three pieces of cake and smeared icing on the collar of her new dress there had been no other little girls to play with and emma was too young to be dazzled by the names and faces of the luminaries of the music business who had wandered through the house bored a little queasy from cake shed gone off to bed lulled by the sounds from the party later shed woken restless she had dragged charlie out of bed to go downstairs but the heavy scent of pot smoke had stopped her she was familiar with it too familiar like the stink of gin the sweet scent of marijuana was firmly linked in her mind with her mother and the shakings and beatings that had come whenever jane had crashed from her highs miserable she had huddled on the steps cooing reassurances to charlie if her mam was here now she would take her away emma had known she would never again wear the pretty pink dress or hear her dads voice or go into the big bright stores with bev shed cringed when she heard the footsteps on the stairs and waited for the worst hello there emma luy soaring at peace with the world brian had dropped down beside her whatre you doing nothing shed curled tighter over the stuffed dog she made herself small very small if they couldnt see you they couldnt hurt you its quite the party leaning back on his elbows hed grinned at the ceiling never in his wildest fantasies had he believed he would one day entertain giants like mccartney jagger daltrey in his own house and his wedding too good christ he was married a married man with a gold ring on his finger tapping his bare foot to the beat of the music that crashed its way up the stairs hed studied the ring no going back hed thought comfortably he was catholic enough and idealistic enough to believe that now that the deed was done it was forever it was one of the biggest days of his life hed thought as hed fumbled in his shirt pocket for the pack of cigarettes hed left downstairs one of the biggest hed thought again with a sigh and if his father had been too drunk or too lazy to pick up the bloody tickets hed sent to ireland what did it matter brian had all the family he needed right here hed pushed thoughts of yesterdays out of his mind from now on there would only be tomorrows a lifetime of them how about it emma want to go down and dance at your dads wedding shed kept her shoulders rounded and barely shook her head the smoke twining mystically in the air had made her temples throb want some cake he had reached out to give her hair a gentle tug but shed cringed away whats this baffled hed patted her shoulder already queasy emmas stomach had rolled with a combination of terror and too many sweets after one hiccup shed lost her cake and tea all over her fathers lap wretched she managed a single moan before curling back over charlie as she lay too sick to defend herself from the beating she was certain was coming hed begun to laugh well i imagine youre feeling a good bit better too high to be disgusted hed staggered to his feet then held out a hand lets get cleaned up to emmas amazement there had been no beating no cruel pinches or sudden smacks instead he had stripped them both down to the skin in the bathroom then hauled her into the shower hed even sung as the water had poured over them something about drunken sailors that had made her forget to be sick when they were both bundled in towels he had woven his way to her room to slip her into bed his hair had been wet and sleek around his face as hed fallen over the foot of the bed within seconds hed been snoring cautious emma had crawled out from under the covers to sit beside him gathering her courage shed leaned over and pressed a damp kiss to his cheek in love for the first time she had tucked charlie under brians limp arm and gone quietly to sleep then he had gone away only days after the wedding the big car had come and two men had carried out luggage he had kissed her and had promised to bring her a present emma had only been able to watch wordlessly as hed ridden away and out of her life she hadnt believed he was coming back even when she heard his voice over the phone bev said he was in america where girls screamed every time they saw him and people bought his records almost as fast as they were made but while he was gone there wasnt as much music in the house and sometimes bev cried emma remembered jane crying and the smacks and shoves that had usually accompanied the tears so she waited but bev never hit her not even at night when the workmen were gone and they were all alone in the big house day after day emma would cuddle up on the window seat with charlie and watch she liked to pretend that the long black car was cruising down the drive and when it stopped and the door opened her dad came out each day when it didnt come she became more certain it never would he had left because he didnt like her didnt want her because she was a nuisance and bloody stupid she waited for bev to go away too and leave her alone in the big house then her mam would come what went on in the girls mind bev wondered from the doorway she watched as emma sat in her now habitual position on the window seat the child could sit for hours patient as an old woman it was rare for her to play with anything except the ratty old stuffed dog shed brought with her it was rarer still for her to ask for anything shed been in their lives now for almost a month and bev was a long way from resolving her feelings only a few weeks before her plans had been perfectly laid she wanted brian to succeed certainly but more she wanted to make a home and family with him shed been raised in the church of england in a calm uppermiddleclass family morals responsibilities and image had been important parts of her upbringing shed been given a good solid education with the idea that she would make a sensible marriage and raise solid sensible children she had never rebelled mostly because it had never occurred to her to rebel until brian she knew that although her parents had come to the wedding they would never completely forgive her for moving in with brian and living with him before marriage nor would they ever comprehend why she had chosen to marry an irish musician who not only questioned authority but wrote songs defying it there had been no doubt that they had been appalled and baffled by brians illegitimate child and their daughters acceptance of her yet what could she do the child existed bev loved her parents a part of her would always desperately want their approval but she loved brian more so much more that it was sometimes terrifying and the child was his whatever she had wanted whatever her plans had been that meant the child was now hers as well it was difficult to look at emma and not feel something she wasnt a child who faded into the woodwork no matter how quiet and unobtrusive she tried to be it was her looks certainly those same elegantly angelic looks of her father more it was that sense of innocence an innocence that was in itself a miracle considering how the child had lived the first three years of her life an innocence and an acceptance bev thought she knew if she walked into the room right now shouting slapping emma would tolerate the abuse with barely a whimper that struck bev as more tragic than the miserable poverty shed been saved from brians child instinctively bev laid a hand over the life she carried shed wanted so desperately to give brian his first child that wasnt to be yet every time she felt resentment she had only to look at emma for it to fade how could she resent someone so utterly vulnerable still she couldnt bring herself to love not as unquestioningly as automatically as brian loved she didnt want to love bev admitted this was another womans child a link that would forever remind her of brians intimacy with someone else five years ago or ten it didnt matter as long as there was emma jane would be a part of their lives brian had been the first man shed slept with and though she had known when theyd become involved that there had been others for him it had been easy to block it out to tell herself that their coming together had been an initiation for them both dammit why had he had to leave now when everything was in upheaval there was this child slipping around the house like a shadow there were workmen hammering and sawing hour after hour and there was the press it was as ugly as brian had warned her it would be with headlines screaming his name and hers and janes how she hated how she detested seeing her picture and janes on the same page of a paper how she loathed those nasty gloating little stories about new wives and old lovers it didnt fade quickly as she had prayed it would there was speculation and questions about the most personal areas of her life she was mrs brian mcavoy now and public property she had told herself countless times that because marrying brian was what she wanted most she would be able to tolerate the public dissections the lack of freedom the smirking headlines and she would somehow but when he was away like this thousands of miles away she wondered how she could bear a lifetime of being photographed and hounded of running away from microphones of wearing wigs and sunglasses to do something as ordinary as buy shoes she wondered if brian would ever understand how humiliating it was for her to see something as intimate as her pregnancy splashed in headlines for strangers to read over their morning tea she couldnt laugh at the stories when he wasnt with her and she couldnt ignore them so she rarely left the house when he was gone in less than two weeks the home she had envisioned for them with its cozy rooms and sunny windows had become a prison one she shared with brians child but she was enough her parents daughter to know her duty and to execute it unwaveringly emma bev fixed a bright smile on her face as emma turned i thought you might be ready for your tea there was nothing emma recognized quicker or distrusted more than a false smile im not hungry she said and gripped charlie tighter i guess im not either if they were stuck there together bev decided at least they could talk to each other its hard to have a nice tea with all the hammering going on taking the step she sat on the window seat beside emma this is a nice spot i think i should plant more roses though dont you emmas lip poked out a little as she moved her shoulders we had a lovely garden when i was a girl bev continued desperately i used to love to go out in the summer with a book and listen to the bees hum sometimes i wouldnt read at all but just dream its funny the first time i heard brians voice i was in the garden did he live with you she had emmas attention now bev thought it only took a mention of brians name no it was over the radio it was their first singleshadowland it went at night midnight when shadows hug the moon bev started the tune in her soft lilt then stopped when emma picked it up in a clear surprisingly strong alto and the land is hot and still breathless i wait for you yes thats the one without realizing it bev reached out to stroke emmas hair i felt he was singing it just for me im sure every girl did emma said nothing for a moment remembering how her mother had played it over and over on the record player drinking and weeping while the words had echoed around the flat did you like him because he sang the song yes but after i met him i liked him much more why did he go away his music his work bev glanced down to see emmas big eyes shiny with tears here was kinship where she hadnt wanted or expected it oh emma i miss him too but hell be home in a few weeks what if he doesnt come back it was foolish but bev sometimes woke with that same awful fear in the middle of the night of course he will a man like brian needs people to listen to his music and he needs to be there while they do hell often go away but hell always come back he loves you and he loves me as much for comfort as to comfort she took emmas hand and theres one more thing do you know where babies come from men stick them in ladies but then they dont want them bev broke off an oath she could cheerfully have throttled jane at that moment although bevs own mother had always been reserved unable to speak of intimacy in more than a vague fashion bev firmly believed in openness men and women who love each other make babies together and most of the time they both want them very much i have a baby right here she pressed emmas hand against her stomach your fathers baby when its born it will be your brother or sister after a moments hesitation emma slid her hand over bevs stomach she didnt see how there could be a baby in there mrs perkins across the alley had had a big bloated belly before little donald had come where is it inside its very very small now it has almost six months more to grow before its time for it to come out will it like me i think so brian will be its dad just like hes your dad enchanted emma began to stroke bevs stomach as she sometimes stroked charlie ill take good care of the baby no one will hurt it no no one will hurt it with a sigh bev slipped an arm around emmas shoulders and looked out toward the hedgerow this time emma didnt inch away but sat still fascinated one hand over bevs stomach im a little afraid of being a mum emma maybe you can let me practice on you after a deep breath bev stood up bringing emma with her were going to start right now lets go up and put on your pretty pink dress were going out to tea the hell with reporters the hell with starers and gawkers were going to make ourselves into the two prettiest ladies in london and have our tea at the ritz for emma it was the beginning of her first relationship with another female that wasnt based on fear or intimidation over the following days they shopped at harrods walked in green park and lunched at the savoy bev ignored the photographers who snapped them when she discovered emmas love of beautiful materials and bright colors she indulged them shamelessly within two weeks the little girl who had come to her with only the shirt on her back had a closet bulging with clothes but at night the loneliness crept back when each lay in bed pining for the same man emmas longings were more direct she wanted brian to come back because he made her feel good love wasnt something shed learned to define or agonize over but bev agonized she worried that he would grow tired of her that he would find someone more in step with the world he lived in she missed the good strong sex they shared it was so easy to believe he would always love her always be with her during that calm drugging time after love and before sleep but now alone in the big brass bed she would wonder if he filled up his loneliness with women as well as music the sky was just beginning to lighten when the phone rang bev groped for it on the third ring yes she cleared her throat hello bev brians voice was urgent instantly awake she shot up in bed bri what is it whats happened nothing everything were a smash bev there was a dazed and dashing edge to his laughter every night the crowds get bigger theyve had to double security to keep the girls from flinging themselves on stage its wild bev insane tonight one of them grabbed stevies sleeve as we were making the dash for the limo ripped his coat clean off the press is calling us vanguards of the second wave of the british invasion vanguards sinking back onto the pillows bev struggled to drum up enthusiasm thats wonderful brian thereve been some snippets on the telly here but not much to go by its like being a gladiator standing there on stage and listening to the roars he didnt think he could explain even to her the thrill and the terror i think even pete was impressed bev smiled thinking of his pragmatic businessfirstandlast manager then you must be something yeah he drew on the joint he had lit to extend the high i wish you were here she heard the background noises loud music male and female laughter mixed with it so do i then come he pushed away a blonde half naked and glazedeyed who tried to crawl into his lap pack a bag and fly over do what i mean it its not half as good as it would be if you were here across the room a brunette nearly six feet tall slowly stripped stevie the lead guitarist popped a quaalude like rock candy look i know we talked about it and decided it was best for you to stay home but we were wrong you need to be here with me she felt tears well in her eyes even as laughter bubbled you want me to come to america as soon as you can you can meet us in new york inshit johnno when are we in new york sprawled on a couch johnno poured the last of the jim beam where the fuck are we now never mind brian rubbed his tired eyes and tried to concentrate his mind was bloaty with booze and smoke ill get pete to work out the details just pack she was already out of bed what should i do with emma bring her too on a burst of family feeling brian grinned at the blonde pete will figure out how to get her a passport someone will call you this afternoon and tell you what to do christ i miss you bev i miss you too well be there as soon as we can i love you bri more than anything i love you talk to you soon moody and restless brian reached for the brandy bottle the moment hed hung up he wanted her with him now not a day from now not an hour from now just listening to her voice had him hard and hurting she had sounded just as she had on the night hed met her shy a little hesitant shed been so sweetly out of place in the smoky pub where his band had been playing yet even with the shyness there had been something so solid so true about her he hadnt been able to get her out of his mind not that night not any night since he lifted the brandy and drank deeply it seemed as though the brunette and stevie werent going to bother to move to the privacy of one of the bedrooms to have sex the blonde had given up on johnno and was rubbing her long limber body against pm their drummer half amused half envious brian drank again pm was barely twentyone his face still round and youthful with its sprinkle of acne on the chin he looked both appalled and delighted as the blonde slid down to bury her face in his lap brian closed his eyes and with music filling his head fell asleep he dreamed of bev and the first night they had spent together sitting crosslegged on the floor of his flat talking earnestly about music about poetry yeats and byron and browning dreamily passing a joint back and forth hed had no idea it had been her first encounter with drugs just as hed had no idea until he had slipped into her there on the floor with the candles guttering in their own wax that it was her first encounter with sex shed wept a little instead of making him feel guilty her tears had brought out feelings of protectiveness hed fallen completely and somehow poetically in love that had been more than a year ago but he had never been with another woman during that time whenever the temptation came strongly he would see bevs face the marriage had been for her and the child his child she carried he didnt believe in marriage the foolishness of a contract on love but he didnt feel trapped for the first time since his miserable childhood he had something more than music to comfort and excite him i love you more than anything no he couldnt say that to her with the ease and honesty she could say it to him he probably would never be able to say that to her but he did love and where he loved he was loyal come on my lad barely rousing him johnno dragged brian to his feet its bed for you bevs coming johnno brow lifted johnno glanced over his shoulder at the tangle of bodies sos everyone else shell meet us in new york with a halflaugh brian slung a rubbery arm around johnnos neck were going to new york johnno new tucking york because were the best thats dandy isnt it grunting only a little johnno dumped brian on the bed sleep it off bri weve got to go through the whole bloody business again tomorrow got to wake pete brian mumbled as johnno pulled off his shoes passport for emma tickets i have to do the right thing by her you will weaving a little courtesy of the jim beam johnno studied his newly purchased swiss watch he didnt imagine pete was going to appreciate being awakened but he staggered off to do the deed on her first transatlantic flight emma traveled first class and was miserably sick she could not as bev periodically urged her look out at the pretty clouds or page through any of the colorful picture books bev had stuffed into her carryon bag even empty emmas stomach pitched and rolled she was vaguely aware of bevs helpless little hand pats and the stewardesss soothing voice it didnt matter that she had a new outfit with a short bright red skirt and a flowered fussy blouse it didnt matter that shed been promised a ride to the top of the empire state building the nausea was so unrelenting that it no longer mattered that she was going to see her father by the time the plane banked over jfk airport she was too weak to stand frazzled bev carried her through the gate after clearing customs she nearly gave way to tears when she spotted pete in his impeccable savile row suit he took a long look at the pastyfaced child and the edgy woman rough trip instead of tears bev found laughter bursting through oh no it was a delight from start to finish wheres brian he wanted to come but i had to veto it he took bevs carryon bag then her arm the lads cant even open a window for a breath of air without causing mass hysteria and you love it he grinned steering her toward the exit of the terminal optimist that i am i never expected this brians going to be a very rich man bev were all going to be rich money doesnt come first with bri no but i cant see him kicking it out of his way as it comes pouring in come on ive got a car waiting she shifted emma but the girl only moaned and hung limply in bevs arms the bags theyll be delivered to the hotel he shuffled her out of the terminal there are plenty of pictures of you in the fan mags too it was a white mercedes limo as big as a boat at bevs puzzled look pete grinned again as long as youre married to a king luy you might as well travel in style saying nothing bev settled back and lit a cigarette she hoped it was the long miserable flight that made her feel so out of place and hollow between her and pete emma curled on the seat and sweatily slept through her first limo ride pete didnt pause in the lobby at the waldorf but rushed them through and onto an elevator he wasnt sure if he was relieved or disappointed that their luck had held a mob scene at the airport or on the street in front of the hotel would have been inconvenient but it would have made great copy and copy sold records ive got you a twobedroom suite the extra expense bothered his practical soul but he justified it by knowing that bevs presence would make brian more cooperative and more creative and it wouldnt hurt for the press to know that brians family was traveling with him if he couldnt promote brian as a sexy single man he could promote him as a loving husband and father whatever worked were all on the same floor he went on and securitys very tight in washington dc two teenage girls managed to get into stevies room in a maids cart sounds like a laugh a minute he only shrugged remembering that stevie had been drunk enough to appreciate the girls offers the guitarist had rationalized that two sixteenyearolds equaled one thirtytwoyearold that had made them into one older woman the lads have some interviews scheduled today then the sullivan show tomorrow brian didnt say where we were going next philadelphia then detroit chicago st louis never mind bev heaved a long grateful sigh as the elevator doors opened the hell with where they were going she was here now it didnt matter a damn that she was enormously tired or that her arms ached from carrying the sleeping emma she was here and could all but feel brians energy in the air just as well pete said as he pulled out a key youve a couple of hours before the boys interview its with some new mag thatll publish its first issue later this year rolling stone she took the key pleased that he was sensitive enough not to intrude on the two hours hed given her with brian thanks pete ill make sure hes ready for it the moment she opened the door brian came racing out of the adjoining bedroom to sweep both her and emma into his arms thank christ he murmured raining kisses over bevs face he took the limp drowsy emma whats wrong here nothing now bev dragged her free hands through her hair she was dreadfully sick on the plane hardly slept i think shell do fine once shes tucked up right then dont move he carried emma into the second bedroom she stirred only once as he slipped her between the sheets dad yes it still rocked him you sleep now awhile everythings fine comforted by the sound of his voice she took it on faith and drifted to sleep again he automatically left the door ajar then just stood and looked at bev she was pale with fatigue the shadows under her eyes making them huge and dark love welled up in him stronger needier than any hed ever known saying nothing he crossed to her picked her up in his arms and carried her to his bed he didnt have words though he was a man always filled with them words to poetry poetry to lyrics later he would be filled with them reams of words flowing through him all stemming from this what might have been his most precious hour with her she was in that hour so completely his the radio beside the bed was on as was the television at the foot of it hed chased away the silence of his rooms with voices when he touched her she was all the music he needed so he savored he undressed her slowly watching her absorbing her the shudder of traffic outside the windowlater he would remember it in bases and trebles the small yielding sounds she made were pitched low in countermelody he could even hear the whispering song of his hands gliding over her skin there was sunlight pouring through the window and the big soft bed yielding under them her body was already changing subtly with the life growing in it he spread his hand over her rounded stomach amazed dazzled humbled reverently he lowered his lips to her flesh it was foolish he thought but he felt like a soldier returning from war covered with scars and medals perhaps not so foolish the arena in which hed fought and won wasnt one he could take her to she would always wait for him it was in her eyes in her arms as they tenderly enfolded him that promise and patience was on her lips as they opened for his her passion was always steadier than his less selfish balancing his edgier and more dangerous urges with her he felt more of a man less of a symbol in a world that seemed so hungry for symbols when he slipped inside of her he spoke at last saying her name on a long fluid sigh of gratitude and hope later when she lay half dozing under the tangled sheets brian sat at the foot of the bed in his underwear she was sated with sex but his mind was in overdrive everything hed ever wanted ever dreamed of was at his fingertips pete had film taken of the atlanta concert jesus it was wild bev not just the fans screaming though there was plenty of that sometimes you could hardly hear yourself sing for the noise it was like i dont know being on the runway of an airport with planes taking off all around but mixed with the noisy ones were people who were really into it just listening you know sometimes you could see through the lights and the pot smoke and thered be a face you could sing just for that one face then stevie would go into a rill like in undercover and theyd go wild again it was like i dont know like great sex sorry i didnt applaud laughing he tugged on her ankle im so glad youre here this summer is special you can feel it in the air see it in peoples faces and were part of it were never going back bev she tensed watching him th london no he was half impatient half amused by her literal mind th the way things were begging to play in some grimy pub grateful if we got free beer and chips for pay christ bev were in new york and after tomorrow millions of people will have heard us and its going to matter were going to matter its all ive ever wanted she sat up to take his hands youve always mattered bri no i was just one more scruffy singer not anymore bev and never again people listen the moneys going to make it possible for us to experiment a bitdo more than the boygirl rock theres a war going on bev a whole generations in upheaval we can be their voices she didnt understand big sweeping dreams but it had been his idealism that had attracted her from the beginning just dont leave me behind i couldnt he meant it sincerely completely im going to give you the best bev you and the baby i swear it ive got to get dressed he kissed both her hands then shook back his tousled hair petes really high about us being in the first issue of this new mag thatll come out in november he tossed her a tiedyed tshirt come on i thought id stay in here bev theyd been through all this before youre my wife people want to know about you about us he bit back annoyance when she simply sat running the shirt through her hands if we give them a little they wont hound us for so much when he said it he believed it its especially important because of emma i want everyone to see that weve made ourselves into a family a family should be a private thing maybe but the stories about emma are already out there hed seen them dozens of them labeling emma as a love child there could be worse things he mused since emma hadnt been made out of anything remotely resembling love it was his other child he thought as he laid a gentle hand on bevs stomach again who had been made of love i need you with me on this hating it she climbed out of bed and began to dress twenty minutes later she answered a knock on the door johnno he gave bev a quick grin i knew you couldnt stay away from me swooping her into an exaggerated dip he kissed her as she laughed he looked over her head to where brian was coming through the doorway ah well hes found us out wed better come clean whered you get that ridiculous hat was all brian said after setting bev back on her feet johnno straightened the floppy white fedora like it its a happening makes you look like a pimp brian commented before he walked to the bar there i knew id made the right choice nearly cost me my life but i managed to break out of here and do some shopping on fifth avenue ill have one of those luy he nodded to the whiskey brian was pouring you went out brian stood with the bottle in one hand and a glass in the other sunglasses a flowered tunic he wrinkled his nose and love beads worked nicely as far as disguises go until i tried to get back in lost the love beads he helped himself to the glass brian held with a pleased sigh he flopped on the couch this is the place for me brian my lad i am new york pete will have your head if he finds you went out on your own bugger pete johnno said cheerfully though hes not precisely my style grinning he downed the whiskey so wheres the little brat shes sleeping bev picked up a cigarette brian answered the next knock stevie strolled in and after an absent nod to bev headed straight to the bar pm followed and looking a little pale dropped into a chair word from pete is well do the interview here he said hell be bringing the reporter along whered you get the hat he asked johnno its a long sad story son glancing over he spotted emma standing at the crack in her bedroom door dont look now but weve company hello there prune face she giggled a little but didnt come in at the moment her eyes were all for brian he crossed over and picking her up patted her bottom emma how does it feel to be an international traveler she thought shed dreamed it that one moment where hed tucked her in bed and kissed her cheek but it wasnt a dream because he was there smiling at her his voice making all the nastiness in her stomach disappear im hungry she said and offered him a huge grin im not surprised he kissed the dimple at the corner of her mouth how about some chocolate cake soup bev put in cake and soup he amended and some nice tea he set her down to go to the phone and ring room service come over here emma i have something for yon johnno patted the cushion beside him she hesitated her mother had often said just that and the something had been a smack but johnno was smiling a true smile when she settled beside him he took a small clear plastic egg from his pocket inside was a toy ring with a gaudy red stone emma gave a little gasp as he put it in her hand speechless she turned the egg this way and that watching the ring slide from side to side it had been a careless thing johnno thought a machine that took american quarters and hed had change left after his speedy shopping spree more touched than he wanted the others to see he opened the egg for her then slipped the ring on her finger there were engaged emma beamed at the ring then at him can i sit on your lap all right then he leaned close to her ear but if you wet your pants the engagements off she laughed settled on his lap and began to play with her ring first my wife then my daughter brian commented youd only have to worry if you had a son stevie tossed off the words as easily as he tossed off the drink then wished hed cut off his tongue sorry he muttered as the room fell silent hangover puts me in a filthy mood at the knock on the door johnno gave a lazy shrug better put on that famous smile son its show time johnno was angry but hid it well as the young bearded reporter sat down with them they had no idea what it was like he thought none of them save brian who had gone to school with him had befriended him the names hed been calledfag pussy queer they had hurt a great deal more than the occasional beatings hed taken johnno knew he would have had his face smashed into a pulp more than once if it hadnt been for brians ready fists and loyalty they had been drawn together two tenyearold boys with drunken fathers poverty wasnt uncommon in londons east end and there were always toughs ready to break an arm for pence there were ways of escaping for both him and brian the escape had been music elvis chuck berry muddy waters they would pool whatever money they could earn or steal to buy those precious s at twelve theyd collaborated on their first songa really poor one johnno remembered now lots of moon june rhymes set to a threechord rhythm theyd pounded out on their battered guitar theyd traded a pint of brians fathers gin for that guitar and brian had taken an ugly beating but theyd made music such as it was johnno had been nearly sixteen before he realized what he was hed sweated over it wept over it pounded himself into any girl who would have him to turn his fate around but sweat tears and sex hadnt changed him finally it had been brian who had helped him to accept theyd been drinking late at night in the basement of brians flat this time johnno had pinched whiskey from his father the stench of garbage had been rank as they sat with a candle between them passing the bottle back and forth on the dented portable record player roy orbison had been soaring with only the lonely johnnos confession had come out with drunken weeping and wild threats of suicide im nothing and ill never be nothing else living like a bleeding pig hed guzzled whiskey my old man stinking up the room and mum whining and nagging and never doing nothing to make it change my sisters working the streets and my little brothers been arrested twice this month its up to us to get out of it brian said with boozy philosophy with his eyes half closed he listened to orbison he wanted to sing like that with that otherworldly melancholy weve got to make a difference for ourselves johnno and we will difference i cant make it any different not unless i kill myself maybe i will maybe ill just do it and be done with it what the bloody hell are you talking about brian searched in their crumpled pack of pall malls and found one im queer johnno dropped his head on his folded arms and wept queer brian paused with the match an inch from the tip of the cigarette come on johnno dont be daft i said im queer his voice rose as he lifted his tearstained desperate face to brian i like boys im a freaking flaming fag though he was shaken the drink was enough of a cushion to make him openminded you sure why the bloody hell would i say it if i wasnt sure the only reason i could make it with alice ridgeway was because i was thinking of her brother now that was disgusting brian thought but kept his feelings to himself theyd been friends for more than six years had stood up for each other lied for each other had shared dreams and secrets brian struck another match lit the cigarette and pondered well i suppose if youre made that way then youre made that way nothing to slit your wrists over youre not queer no he fervently hoped notand vowed to spend the next few weeks proving it to himself with every girl he could charm into spreading her legs no he wasnt queer he assured himself the sexual acrobatics hed experienced with jane palmer should have been a good indication of his preferences thinking of her he hardened and shifted his legs it wasnt the time to get horny but to think of johnnos problem lots of people are queer he said like literary people and artists and such were musicians so you could think of it as part of your creative soul thats shit johnno mumbled but wiped his dripping nose maybe but its better than slitting your wrists id have to find a new partner with a ghost of a smile johnno picked up the bottle again are we still partners then sure brian passed the cigarette as long as i dont start making you hot and bothered and that had been the end of it when johnno took a lover he took him discreetly and never discussed it his sexual preference was common knowledge within the band but for his own privacy and at petes insistence he cultivated an image of a heterosexual stud for the most part it amused him there were regrets though he hated to acknowledge them it came to him now as he bounced emma on his lap that he would never have a child of his own and with frustration he was forced to admit as he watched brian slip an arm around bev that the one man he truly loved would never be his lover emma was dazzled by new york after a late breakfast where brian indulged her with strawberry jam and sugary pastries she was left in bevs hands it didnt worry her not this time her dad was going to be on the telly that night and hed promised that she could go to the place where the telly pictures were made and watch in the meantime she and bev drove around the city in the big white car she giggled at the blond wig and big round sunglasses bev wore though bev didnt smile much at first emmas excitement soon distracted her emma liked watching the people rush along the sidewalks jostling each other streaming across intersections while horns blared there were women in short skirts and high heels their bouffant hairdos as steady as carved stones there were others in denim and sandals with their manes of hair hanging straight as rain down their backs on the corners there were vendors selling hot dogs and soft drinks and ice cream which the pedestrians snapped up as the temperature soared outside the cool cocoon of the limo there was a nervy aggression to the traffic that emma didnt understand but enjoyed unruffled and proper in his tan uniform and stiffbrimmed hat the driver pulled to the curb he didnt think much of music himself unless it was frank sinatra or rosemary clooney but he was sure his two teenagers would go wild when he brought them home autographs at the end of his twoday job here we are maam oh a little dazed bev stared out the window the empire state building he explained with a gesture toward the doors would you like me to pick you up in an hour an hour yes bev took emmas hand firmly in hers when the driver opened the door come on emma devastations not going to the top alone there was a long winding line with wailing babies and whining children they started at the end two bodyguards silently falling in behind and were soon swallowed up a group of french students filed in seconds later all carrying macys shopping bags and talking in their fast flowing language amid the mix of perfume sweat and wet diapers emma caught the dreamy aroma of pot no one else seemed to notice or care they were shuffled onto an elevator long stuffy minutes later they were led off to wait again she didnt mind as long as her hand was firmly caught in bevs she could crane her neck and look at all the people bald heads floppy hats scraggly beards when her neck got tired she switched to shoes rope sandals shiny wing tips snowy white sneakers and black pumps some people shuffled their feet others tapped a few shifted from side to side but hardly a one was still when she grew tired of that she just listened to the voices she heard a group of girls arguing nearby as teenagers they had emmas immediate envy stevie nimmons is the cutest one of the girls insisted hes got big brown eyes and that groovy mustache brian mcavoy another corrected hes really fab to prove her point she took a photo cut from a fan magazine out of her madras purse a communal sigh went up as the girls crowded around it every time i look at it i just about die they squealed were glared at then muffled giggles with their hands both pleased and baffled emma looked up at bev those girls are talking about dad ssh bev was amused enough to want to relay the story to brian but she was also aware that she was wearing the wig and sunglasses for a reason i know they are but we have to keep who we are a secret why ill explain later she said relieved when their turn at the elevators arrived emmas eyes widened when her ears popped as they had on the airplane for a moment she was terrified that she would be sick again she bit her lip closed her eyes and wished desperately for her dad she wished she hadnt come she wished shed brought charlie for comfort and she prayed as fervently as a threeyearold could that she wouldnt lose her wonderful breakfast all over her shiny new shoes then the doors opened and the dreadful swaying motion stopped everyone was laughing and talking and crowding out eying bevs tug on her hand she kept close to her while still fighting the nausea there was a big stand with shelves of bright souvenirs and wide wide windows where she could see the sky and the spread of buildings that was manhattan dumbfounded she stood still while people swarmed around them sickness passed into wonder its something to see isnt it emma is it the world though she was as amazed as emma she laughed no only a small part of it come on then lets go out the wind barreled over them sending emmas skirts flying up as she staggered back but the sensation excited rather than frightened as bev laughing again plucked her up were on top of the world emma as they looked over the high wall emma felt her stomach do playful little leaps and bounces it was all spread out below the crisscross of streets in the canyons made by the buildings the tiny cars and buses that looked like toys everything ran so straight and true when bev put a coin in a box she looked through the telescope but she preferred her own view through her own eyes can we live here bev fiddled with the telescope until she focused on the statue of liberty here in new york here on top no one lives here emma why not because its a tourist attraction she answered absently and one of the wonders of the world i think you cant live in a wonder but emma looked out over the high wall and thought that she could the television studio didnt impress emma it didnt look as pretty or as big as it did onscreen the people were ordinary she did like the cameras though they were big and bulky and the people behind them seemed important she wondered if looking through one of the cameras was like looking through the telescope on the empire state building before she could ask bev a skinny man began talking in a loud voice it was the oddest american accent shed heard yet she couldnt understand half of what he said but she caught the word devastation then came the explosion of screams after the first shock emma stopped cringing into bevs skirts and leaned out though she didnt understand the screaming she realized it wasnt a bad sound it was a good young noise that bulleted off the walls and slammed off the ceilings it made her grin though bevs hand trembled lightly in hers she liked the way her father moved across the stage prancing and strutting as his voice strong and clear merged with johnnos then stevies his hair glowed gold under the bright lights she was a child and easily recognized magic as long as she lived she would hold this picture in her mind and her heart of four young men standing on stage drenched in light in luck and in music three thousand miles away jane sat in her new flat there was a pint of gilbeys and an ounce of colombian gold on the table beside her shed lit candles dozens of them using those and the drugs to mellow her mood brians clear tenor played on her stereo shed moved into chelsea with the money shed taken from brian there were young people there musicians and poets and artists and the ones who followed them she thought she would find another brian in chelsea an idealist with a beautiful face and clever hands she could pop off to the pubs whenever she liked listen to the music pick out a likely companion for the night she had a sixroom flat with shiny new furniture in every room her closets bulged with clothes from fashionable boutiques on her finger was a fat diamond ring shed bought the week before when shed been feeling blue she was already bored with it she had thought that one hundred thousand pounds was all the money in the world she ran one hand down the silk robe she wore pleased very pleased with its sinuous feel shed soon discovered that large amounts were as easily spent as small ones she still had enough to last her awhile but it hadnt taken long for her to realize shed sold emma cheap hed have paid twice as much she thought as she nursed her gin more than twice no matter how much the bastard pete had frowned and muttered brian had wanted emma he had a soft spot for children shed known it but she thought in disgust hadnt been clever enough to exploit it a lousy twentyfive thousand a year how was she supposed to live on that she wondered a little bleary with gin she rolled a sloppy joint she still took in a john now and then but that was as much for the company as the extra cash shed had no idea she would miss emma as the weeks passed the concept of motherhood took on new emotional meanings shed given birth shed changed nasty nappies shed spent her hardearned money on food and clothes now the little brat probably didnt remember she existed shed hire a solicitor shed hire the best with brians money there was justice in that there wasnt a court in the country that wouldnt see that a child belonged with her mother shed get emma back or better shed get twice as much money once shed bled them a bit brian and his snotty new wife wouldnt forget her no one would forget her not the stinking press not the stupid public or her own little brat with this thought dangling in her mind she brought out her cache of methedrine and prepared to go flying emma couldnt wait much longer there was a nasty sleet falling outside but she continued to press her face against the window to try to see through it they would be coming soon johnno had said so she was wise enough to know that if she asked him how soon again hed snarl at her but she couldnt wait after her nose grew cold she stepped back to dance from one foot to another her dad was coming home with bev and her new baby brother darren her brothers name was darren she tried the name out to herself in a whisper just the sound of it made her smile nothing in her life had ever been so huge so important as having a brother he would be her own and he would need her to tend him to look out for him shed been practicing for weeks and weeks on the dolls that now filled her room she knew you had to hold their heads ever so carefully or they fell way back and broke off sometimes babies woke in the middle of the night crying for milk she wouldnt mind emma thought she rubbed her own flat chest and wondered if darren would find milk there they hadnt let her go to the hospital to see him that had upset her so that for the first time since she had come to her new home emma had hidden in a closet she was still angry about it but she knew it mattered very little to adults if children were angry weary of standing she sat on the window seat to pet charlie and wait she tried to think of other things her time in america humming to herself emma let herself picture all the things shed seen there had been the big silver arch in st louis there had been the lake in chicago that had seemed as big as the ocean to her and hollywood shed liked the big white sign and remembering it tried to picture all the letters her father had played at a huge theater there right outside they had called it a bowl she had thought that strange but it had been fun to listen to the cheers and screams rising on the open air shed celebrated her birthday her third birthday in hollywood everyone had come to eat the white cake with the little silver balls on top they had gotten into a plane almost every day and every day it had scared her but shed been able to battle back the sickness there had been a lot of people with them readies her father called them which seemed silly since they were so often in the air and not on any road at all shed liked the hotels best with room service and new beds almost every night shed liked looking out the window at new places and new people every morning with a yawn she settled back with the dog snuggled under her arm when they went to a hotel again darren could go with them everyone would love him watching the sleet made her sleepy and she thought of christmas it had been the first shed ever had with a stocking hanging from the mantel with her name on it under the tree they had decorated had been stacks and stacks of presents thys and games and dolls in pretty dresses theyd all played snakes and ladders in the afternoon even stevie hed pretended to cheat to make her laugh then had taken her on a screaming piggyback ride through the house afterward her father had carved a big christmas goose when gluttony had made her sleepy she had curled up in front of the fire and had listened to the music it had been the best day of her life the very best until this one the sound of a car roused her pressing her face against the window again she peered out with a screech she leaped off the seat johnno johnno theyre here she went flying down the hallway her shoes clattering on the wood floor that had been painstakingly refinished and polished hold on johnno stopped scribbling the lyrics that had been playing in his head to catch her on the run whos here my dad and bev and my baby your baby is it he tugged on her nose then turned to stevie who was experimenting with chords at the piano shall we go welcome the newest mcavoy be right along im coming pm stuffed the last of a tea cake into his mouth before he rose from the floor wonder if they managed to get out of the hospital without being mobbed the precautions pete took makes james bond look like a piker two decoy limos twenty burly guards and the final escape in a florist truck with a laugh he started down the hall with emma in tow fame makes beggars of us emma luy and dont you forget she didnt care about fame or beggars or anything else she only wanted to see her brother the moment the door opened she pulled her sweaty hand from johnnos and shot down the hall let me see him she demanded brian bent over shifting the blanket from the bundle in his arms for emma the first sight of her brother was love unconditional allencompassing it was so much more than anything shed expected he wasnt a doll even as he slept she could see the gentle flutter of his dark lashes his mouth was small and moist his skin thin and delicately pale he wore a little blue cap over his head but her father had told her that he had hair as dark as bevs his hand was curled in a fist and she touched it gently with her fingertips warmth and the faintest of movements love burst through her like light what do you think brian asked her darren she said the name softly savoring it hes the most beautiful baby in the world got that pretty mcavoy face johnno murmured feeling foolishly sentimental nice job bev thanks and she was glad it was done none of the books she had read had prepared her for the exquisite draining pain of childbirth she was proud to have brought her son into the world naturally though it had been touch and go during those last hours now she wanted nothing more than to settle down and be a mother the doctor doesnt want bev on her feet much for the next few days brian began do you want to go up and rest the last thing i want is to get into another bed come on in and sit then and uncle johnno will fix you a nice cup beautiful ill go up and put the baby down brian grinned at the way pm stood back and gawked he doesnt bite old man he doesnt have teeth pm grinned and stuffed his hands in his pockets just dont ask me to touch him for a while entertain bev she really had a rough go of it weve got a nurse coming in this afternoon but i dont want her doing anything strenuous in the meantime that i can handle he wandered back toward the parlor well put the baby to sleep emma announced and kept one hand on the edge of the blanket i can show you how they started up the stairs with emma leading the way the nursery had been finished with frilly white curtains and rainbows painted on the pale blue walls the bassinet had a skirt of snowy irish lace dotted with satin ribbons of pink and blue an oldfashioned pram stood in the corner guarded by a sixfoot teddy bear an antique rocker waited by the window emma stood beside the bassinet as her father laid darren down once the little cap was removed she reached in to carefully stroke his downy black hair will he wake up soon i dont know i get the feeling babies are pretty unpredictable brian crouched down beside her we have to be very careful with him emma hes so helpless you see i wont let anything happen to him not ever she put her hand on her fathers shoulder and watched the baby sleep emma wasnt sure she liked miss wallingsford the young nurse had pretty red hair and nice gray eyes but she rarely allowed emma to touch baby darren bev had interviewed dozens of applicants and was well satisfied with alice wallingsford she was twentyfive of good family and had excellent references and a pleasing manner in the first months after darrens birth bev was so tired and moody alices services became invaluable more she was another woman to talk with about things like teething breastfeeding and diets bev was as determined to gain back her willowy figure as she was to be a good mother with brian closed up writing songs with johnno or in meetings with pete about the next recording she struggled to make the home she wanted so badly for them she listened when he spoke of things like war in asia race riots in america but her world centered on whether the sun would shine warm enough to take darren for a stroll she taught herself how to bake bread and tried her hand at knitting while brian wrote songs and spoke out against war and bigotry as her body returned to normal her mind eased for bev this was the sweetest time of her life her son was chubbily healthy and her husband treated her like a princess in bed with darren at her breast and emma at her feet she rocked in the chair by the nursery window there had been rain that morning but the sun was out now and bright she thought that by afternoon she could take the baby and emma for a walk in the park im going to put him down now emma bev shifted her blouse to cover her breast hes fast asleep can i hold him when he wakes up yes but only when im with you miss wallingsford never lets me hold him shes just being cautious bev smoothed the blanket over darren before she stepped back he was nearly five months old now she thought already she couldnt imagine her life without him lets go down and see about baking a nice cake your dad loves chocolate cake knowing she had to be satisfied with that emma followed her out alice paused in the hallway holding fresh linens for the nursery he should sleep awhile alice bev told her his tummys full yes maam emma and i will be in the kitchen an hour later when theyd taken the cake out to cool the front door slammed your dad must be home early bev automatically fluffed her hair before she hurried out of the kitchen to greet him bri i didnt expect you until whats wrong he was dead pale his eyes redrimmed and bleary he shook his head as if to clear it as bev held out her hands to him theyve shot him what her fingers clamped down hard on his who shot who kennedy robert kennedy theyve killed him oh my god oh sweet god she could only stand and stare horrified she remembered when the american president had been killed and the shocked world had mourned now his brother his bright young brother we were rehearsing for the album brian began pete came in hed heard it on the radio none of us believed it not until wed heard it ourselves goddamnit bev just a few months ago it was king and now this whats happening to the world mr mcavoy alice started down the stairs her face as white as her apron is it true are you certain yes it should be just a nightmare but its true oh that poor family alice wrung her apron in her hands that poor mother he was a good man brian managed he would have been their next president he would have stopped that bloody war i know it it disturbed emma to see tears in her fathers eyes the adults were much too involved with their own grief to notice her she didnt know anyone named kennedy but she was sorry he was dead she wondered if he had been a friend of her dads maybe hed been a soldier in the war her father always talked about alice fix some tea please bev murmured as she led brian toward the parlor what kind of a world have we brought our children into when will they understand bev when will they finally understand emma went upstairs to sit with darren and leave the adults to their tears and tea they found her there in the nursery an hour later she was singing one of the lullabies bev often sang at bedtime while she rocked darren panicked bev started in only to have brian catch her arm no theyre fine cant you see it eased some of the rawness inside him to watch them emma rocked with her feet dangling far from the floor and the baby carefully supported in her arms emma looked up and smiled beautifully he was crying but hes happy now he smiled at me she leaned over to kiss his cheek as he gurgled he loves me dont you darren yes he loves you brian moved over to kneel in front of the rocker and wrap his arms around both of them thank god for all of you he said as he held out a hand for bev i think id go mad without you brlm kept his fatlily closer during the next weeks whenever possible he worked at home and even toyed with the idea of adding a recording studio onto the house the war in southeast asia preyed on his mind the horrible and useless fighting in his homeland of ireland tore at him his records soared up the chart but the satisfaction that had rushed through him in the early days paled he used his music both as a projection of his feelings and a buffer against the worst of them his need for family kept him level they were sanity he was certain it was bev who gave him the idea to take emma to the recording studio they were about to lay the first tracks for their third album an album brian considered even more important than their debut this time he had to prove that devastation wasnt a fluke nor a pale imitation that was clinging to the coattails of groups like the beatles and rolling stones he had to prove to himself that the magic which had dimmed so during that last year would still be there he wanted something unique a sound distinctively their own hed shuffled aside a dozen solid rock numbers he and johnno had written they could wait despite petes objections the rest of the group was behind him in his decision to pepper the cuts with political statements downanddirty rebel rock and irish folk songs electric guitars and penny whistles when emma walked into the studio she had no notion she was being allowed to witness the making of music history to her she was spending the day with her dad and his mates it seemed like an enormous game to her the equipment the instruments the tall glass room she sat in a big swivel chair sipping a coke straight from the bottle dont you think the tykes going to get a bit bored johnno asked as he fiddled with the electric organ he wore two rings now the diamond on one pinky and a fat sapphire on the other if we cant entertain one little girl wed best pack it in brian adjusted the strap of his guitar anyway i want to keep her close awhile janes making noise again bitch johnno said mildly then picked up a glass of coke liberally laced with rum she wont get anywhere this time either but its a nuisance he cast a quick look at emma and saw she was occupied with talking to charlie shes trying to say she was tricked into signing the papers petes handling it she just wants more money with a grim smile brian nodded she wont get more out of pete or out of me lets have a sound check here hello there enmy luy stevie stopped beside her to poke a finger into her belly you auditioning for the band im going to watch she stared up at him fascinated by the gold hoop he now wore in his ear thats fine then we always do better with an audience tell me something emmy he bent down close whispering truth and nothing but whos the best of thig lot here it had become a standard game by this time knowing the rules emma looked up then down then side to side hunching her shoulders she bellowed dad it earned her a snort of disgust and a lot of tickled ribs struggling not to wet her pants she squirmed to the back of the chair its illegal in this country to brainwash children stevie said as he joined brian the kid has taste right all bad he took his martin out of its case and ran loving fingers down the neck whats on first well lay down the instrumentals o outcry saving the best for first with a nod stevie sped through some experimental chords lets get to work mates of the four stevie was the only one who had grown up with real money in a true house with a garden and two livein servants he was used to the finer things expected them and was easily bored with them hed fallen in love with the guitar and had made his proper parents rue the day they had given it to him at fifteen hed formed his own band stevie and the rousers it had lasted six months before bitter infighting had broken it up undaunted hed formed another then another his natural flashy talent with the guitar had drawn many hopefuls to him but then theyd looked to him for leadership that hed been innately incapable of providing hed come across brian and johnno at a party in soho one of those candlelit smokeandincensechoked gatherings his parents were terrified of hed been attracted immediately to brians intensity about music and johnnos caustic careless wit for the first time in his life stevie had joined instead of formed hed followed brians lead with relief there had been lean days grubbing in pubs begging for a chance to play there had been heady days spent writing songs and creating music there had been women gloriously sweaty acres of them ready to fall on their backs for a fairhaired man with a guitar in his hand there had been sylvie the girl he had met on their first gig in amsterdam pretty roundchecked sylvie with her broken english and guileless eyes theyd made love like maniacs in a filthy little room where the roof leaked and the windows were coated with grime hed fallen in love as much as he believed himself capable hed even entertained ideas about bringing her back to london with him setting up house in some cramped coldwater flat but sylvie had gotten pregnant he remembered when shed told him her face pale and her eyes full of hope and fear he hadnt wanted children good christ hed only been twenty his music had come first had had to and if his parents had discovered hed fathered a child with a dutch cocktail waitress it had been lowering to realize that no matter how far hed run how much hed protested what his parents thought had still mattered so much pete had arranged for an abortion discreetly expensively sylvie with the tears flowing down her cheeks had done what hed asked once she had she had walked out of his life until she had gone stevie hadnt realized hed loved her even more than hed believed himself capable he didnt want to think of it hated to remember it and her but just lately it had begun preying on his mind it probably had to do with emma he thought as he glanced over and saw her sitting flushed and delighted in her swivel chair his child whatever it had been would have been about her age now the day in the studio was fun for emma so much fun her only regret was that darren wasnt there to share it watching her father and his friends play now was different from seeing them in the theaters and auditoriums across america there was a different energy here she didnt understand it but she felt it on tour emma had begun to see them as a unit like a body with four heads the picture that made in her mind made her laugh to herself but it seemed a true one today they argued and swore joked or just sat silently during playbacks she didnt know the meaning of the technical terms being tossed back and forthdidnt need to she amused herself when they huddled together or was amused by them when they took a moment to tease her she ate gobs of greasy chips and bloated her belly with cokes during a break she sat on pms lap and bashed away at the drums she said her name into one of the mikes and heard her voice echo through the room with a spare drumstick in her hand she dozed in the swivel chair her head pillowed on the faithful charlie and she awoke to her fathers voice soaring in a ballad of tragic love spellbound she watched rubbing the sleep from her eyes and yawning into charlies fur her heart was too young to be touched by the lyrics but the sound reached her she would never hear the song again without remembering the moment when shed awakened to hear his voice filling her head filling the world when he had finished she forgot that she was supposed to be quiet bouncing on the chair she clapped her hands together dad in the engineering booth pete swore but brian held up a hand leave that on with a laugh he turned to emma leave it on he repeated as he held out his arms to her when she reached them he tossed her into the air what do you think emma ive just made you a star if brmns faith in man had been shaken in with the assassination of martin luther king then robert kennedy it was expanded during the summer of with woodstock it was a celebration for him of youth and music of love and brotherhood it symbolized the chance to turn around the year of bloodshed and war of riots and discontent he knew as he stood on stage and looked out at the sea of bodies that he would never do anything so huge or so memorable again even as it thrilled him to be there to leave his mark it left him by turns depressed and terrified that the decade and its spirit were ending he rushed through his three days in upstate new york at a fever pitch of emotional and creative energy fueled by the atmosphere heightened by the drugs that were as handy as popcorn at a saturday matinee and pushed by his own fears about where success had taken him he spent an entire night alone in the trailer the band used composing for a marathon fourteenhour stint while cocaine stormed through his system on one illuminating afternoon he sat in the woods with stevie listening to the music and the cheers of four hundred thousand with the help of lsd he saw whole universes created in a maple leaf brian embraced woodstock the concept of it the reality of it his only regret was that nothing he had said had persuaded bev to come with them she was once again waiting for him this time she waited in the house they had bought in the hollywood hills brians love affair with america was just beginning and his second american tour felt like a homecoming it was the year of the rock festival a phenomenon brian saw as demonstrating the strength of rock culture he wanted needed to recapture that towering high of excitement when success had been new when the band the unit of them had been like one electric force smashing through the world of music and public recognition over the past year he had sensed that electricity that unity slipping away like the sixties themselves hed felt it forge again at woodstock when they boarded the plane leaving the faithful at woodstock behind brian fell into an exhausted sleep beside him stevie carelessly popped a couple of barbiturates and zoned out johnno settled back to play poker with some of the road crew only pm sat restlessly by the window he wanted to remember everything it annoyed him that unlike brian he saw beneath the symbolism and statement of the festival to the miserable conditions the mud the garbage the lack of proper sanitary facilities the music good christ the music had been wonderful almost unbearably so but often too often hed felt the audience had been too blissed out to notice still even someone as pragmatic and simple as pm had felt the sense of commitment and unity of peacea peaceful trio of days with four hundred thousand living as family but there had also been dirt prolific and heedless sex and a careless abundance of drugs drugs frightened him he couldnt admit it not even to the men he considered his brothers drugs made him sick or silly or put him to sleep he took them only when he saw no graceful way not to he was in turn amazed and appalled at the cheerfulness with which brian and stevie experimented with whatever came their way and he was more than a little frightened by the ease with which stevie was quietly and consistently shooting smack into his veins johnno was more particular about what he pumped into his system but johnnos personality was so strong no one would laugh at him for refusing to indulge in acid or speed or snow pm knew personality wasnt his strong point he wasnt even a musician not like the others oh he knew he could hold his own with any drummer out there he was good damn good but he couldnt write music couldnt read it his mind didnt run to poetry or political statements he wasnt handsome even now at twentythree he was plagued by occasional outbreaks of pimples despite what he considered his many disadvantages he was part of one of the biggest most successful rock groups in the world he had friends good and true ones who would stand for him in two years he had earned more money than he had ever expected to make in the whole of his life and he was careful with it pms father ran a small repair shop in london he knew about business and books of the four he was the only one who ever asked pete questions about expenses and profits he was certainly the only one who bothered to read any of the forms or contracts they signed having money pleased him not only because he could send checks homea kind of tangible proof to his doubting parents that he could succeed it pleased him to have it jingling in his pocket he hadnt grown up as poor as johnno and brian but hed been a long way from knowing the comforts of stevies childhood now they were on their way to texas another festival in a year crammed with them he didnt mind really after that it would be another performance in another city they were all blurring together the months the stages yet he didnt want it to stop when it did he was desperately afraid he would sink back to obscurity he knew that when the summer was well and truly over they would head to california to hollywood for a few weeks they would live among the movie stars and for a few weeks he thought with twinges of guilt and pleasure he would be close to bev the only person pm loved more than brian was brians wife emma set up the letmred blocks she was very proud of the fact that she was learning to read and spell and was determined to teach darren emma she said tapping each block in turn emma sayemma ma laughing darren pushed the blocks into a jumbled pile ma ma emma but she leaned over to kiss him heres an easy one she set up two blocks da dad dad dad dad dad delighted with himself darren climbed onto his sturdy legs to race to the doorway and look for brian no dads not there now but mums in the kitchen were having a big party tonight to celebrate the new album being finished well be going home to england soon she was looking forward to it though she liked the house in america just as much as the castle outside of london for more than a year she and her family had flown back and forth over the ocean as casually as other families drove across town she had turned six in the autumn of and had a proper british tutor at bevs insistence when they settled back in england again she knew she would go to school with others her age the idea was both frightening and wonderful when we get back home im going to learn lots more and teach you everything as she spoke she piled the blocks into a neat tower look heres your name the best name darren on a cry of glee he pranced back to crouch and study the letters d a z l m n p after sending emma a wicked smile he swooped his arm through it blocks crashed and tumbled darren he shouted darren mcavoy you can say that well enough cant you boyo in three years the flow and cadence of her voice had come to mirror brians she smiled as she began to build something a little more intricate for him to demolish he was the light of her life her little brother with his dark thick hair and laughing seagreen eyes at two he had the face of a botticelli cherub and the energy of a demon hed done everything early crawling weeks before the baby books had warned bev to expect it his face had been on the cover of newsweek photoplay and rolling stone the world had an ongoing love affair with darren mcavoy he had the blood of irish peasants and staunch british conservatives in his veins but he was a prince no matter how careful bev was the paparazzi managed to snap new pictures of him on a weekly basis and the fans clamored for more they sent him truckloads of toys which bev meticulously shipped off to hospitals and orphanages offers poured in for endorsements baby food a line of childrens clothing a chain of toy stores they were unilaterally refused through all the attention and adulation darren remained a happy healthy toddler who was currently enjoying with relish his terrible twos if he had known about the attention no doubt he would have cheerfully agreed he deserved it this is the castle emma told him as she arranged blocks and youre the king im the king he plopped down to bounce on his padded bottom yes king darren the first first he repeated he knew very well the meaning of that word and enjoyed being put there darrens first youre a very good king and kind to all the animals she pulled the ever faithful charlie closer dutifully darren bent to give him a wet kiss and here are all your good and courageous knights meticulously she set up dolls and stuffed toys theres dad and johnno stevie and pm and heres pete hes ah prime minister this is the beautiful lady beverly pleased emma posed her favored ballerina doll mum darren kissed the doll in turn mums pretty shes the prettiest lady in the world theres a horrible witch after her who locked her in a tower emma had a vague image of her own mother but it passed quickly all the knights go out to save her making galloping noises she pushed the toys toward the doll but only sir dad can break the spell sir dad the combination of words struck darren as so funny he rolled and smashed the castle well if youre going to go around knocking down your own castle i give up ma darren wrapped his arms around her and squeezed my ma ma lets play farm all right but we have to pick up the blocks or prissy miss wallingsford will come in and say were noisy messy children pissy pissy pissy darren emma clapped both hands over her mouth and giggled dont say that because it made her laugh he said it again at the top of his voice what a word to come out of a nursery not sure if she should be amused or stern bev stopped in the doorway he means prissy emma explained i see bev held out her arms as darren ran to her thats a very important r my lad and what are you two up to we were playing castle but darren liked knocking it down better darren the destructor bev nuzzled against his neck until he squealed with laughter his little legs locked around her so that she could hold him in his favorite position upside down she hadnt known it was possible to love so much even the passion she felt for brian paled beside the love she felt for her son he gave back without even knowing he was giving it was simply there a hug a kiss or a smile always at the right time he was the best and brightest part of her life here now go help your sister tidy up the bloicks i can do it after setting darren down bev smiled at emma he has to learn to pick up his own messes emma however much you and i would like to do for him always she watched them together the delicate fairheaded girl and the dark sturdy boy emma was a neat wellmannered child who no longer hid in closets brian had made a difference for her and bev hoped she herself had had a hand in forming emma into the bright cheerful child she was today but it was darren she knew who had truly tipped the scales in her devotion to him emma forgot to be frightened she forgot to be shy in turn darren loved her completely even as a baby he had stopped crying more quickly if emma soothed him each day the bond between them only strengthened bev had been pleased the day a few months before when emma had begun to call her mum it was a rare thing for her to look at emma and think of her as janes child now she didnt couldnt feel for emma the fierce almost desperate love she felt for darren but the love she did feel was warm and steady because he liked the clattering they made darren dropped the blocks back in their box d he said holding his favorite letter over the opening dog drum darren he let it fly satisfied when his letter made the most noise certain hed done his duty he hopped on his red and white rocking horse and headed west we were going to play farm emma took the big fisherprice barn and silo off the shell it only took the word farm to have darren leaping off his horse he dragged off the top to shake the animals and roundfaced people out of the silo lets go lets go he chanted while his still clumsy fingers struggled to set the white plastic fence pieces straight emma steadied his hand before she glanced up at bev can you play too she had a million things to do bev thought with all the people brian had asked over that evening in a few hours the house would be full it always seemed to be full as if brian were afraid to spend a few hours in his own company what he was running from she didnt know and doubted that he did when we get back to london she thought everything would click into place again when they got home she looked down at the children her children and laughed id love to play an hour later brian found them as the turkey rug which stood in for the cornfield was plowed under by a fleet of tonka trucks before he could speak emma was scrambling up dads home she rushed forward ending on a bound sure that his arms would be there to catch her he scooped her up planting a noisy kiss on her cheek before sweeping his free atm around darren give us a big one he told darren then staggered as the boy pressed a hard wet kiss on his chin hefting them both brian stepped around the white plastic fences and stubby figures spread around the floor farming again its darrens favorite bev waited for him to sit then grinned brian was always at his best in the circle of his family im afraid youve just plopped down smack in the manure pile oh he leaned over to pull her against him wouldnt be the first time ive sat in shit shit darren repeated his diction perfect good going bev murmured brian only grinned and tickled his sons ribs so whats the plan she settled back as darren wiggled out of brians hold to sit in her lap were plowing under the corn since weve decided to plant soybeans very wise quite the gentleman farmer arent you old man he poked a finger into daffens pudgy stomach well have to take that trip to ireland then you can ride on a real tractor lets go lets go darren bounced on bevs lap chanting his favorite phrase darren cant ride on a tractor until hes bigger emma said sedately folding her hands over her knee quite right with a smile bev nodded toward brian just like he cant use the cricket bat or the bicycle someone bought him women brian said to darren they dont understand macho stuff pissy darren recited pleased with his new word i beg your pardon brian managed over a laugh dont ask after a quick hug bev set darren aside lets clean up this business so we can go have our tea excellent idea brian sprung up and grabbed bevs hand emma youre in charge luy mum and i have something to do before tea brian miss wallingsfords just downstairs he continued to pull bev from the room dont forget to wash up brian the nurserys in a shambles emmall take care of it shes tidy as a pin he pulled bev into the bedroom besides she likes to even so i she caught his hands as he started to tug off her tshirt bri we cant do this now ive a million things to see to and this is top of the list he closed his mouth over hers pleased when her halfhearted struggles ceased it was top of the list last night she murmured running her hands down to his hips and again this morning its always top of the list he unhooked her jeans it amazed him how small how firm she was after two children no one child he reminded himself he often forgot perhaps deliberately that she hadnt given birth to emma no matter how familiar her body became touching her like this took him back to their first nights together theyd come a long way from a tworoom flat with a single creaky bed they owned a pair of homes now in two countries but the sex was as strong and sweet as it had been when he had had nothing in his pockets but desperate hopes and shiny dreams they rolled over the bed limbs tangled mouths growing hungrier as she rose over him he watched her aching pleasure reflected on her face shed changed so little her hair swung to her shoulders now sleek and straight her skin was milk pale delicately flushed from the passion that heated it pushing up he circled her breasts with slow whispery kisses when her head fell back he sucked greedily excited by the small helpless sounds she made with bev he wanted the beauty with bev he found it gripping her hips he lifted her up and onto him letting her set the pace letting her take him exactly where he wanted to go nm d she stretched then curled up against him with her eyes half closed she could see the sun pouring through the windows she wanted to pretend it was morning some lazy morning when they could stay just as they were for hours i didnt think id like staying here this time for all these months while you recorded but its been wonderful we can stay a bit longer his energy was beginning to build as it always did after making love with her we could take a few weeks lie around go to disneyland again darren already thinks its his own personal amusement park then well have to build him one he rolled over propping himself on his elbow bev i had a quick meeting with pete before i came home outcry has gone platinum oh bri thats marvelous its more than marvelous i was right he pulled her by the shoulders until she sat beside him people are listening really listening outcry has become like an anthem for the antiwar movement its making a difference he didnt hear the faint desperation in his voice the desperation of a man trying to convince himself were going to release another single from the album love lost i think though petes muttering about it not being commercial enough its so sad thats the point the words snapped out and he bit off the impatient rest to continue more calmly id like to pipe it into parliament and the pentagon and the un all those places where the smug fat bastards make decisions we need to do something bev if people listen to me because i have hit records then i have to make sure i have something important to say in me pewhouse hed renmd in the heart of la pete page sat at his desk and considered the possibilities like brian he was delighted with outcrys success with him it was a matter of sales generated more than social conscience but thats what they paid him for as he had predicted only three years before brian and the others were very rich he was going to see to it that they all became a great deal richer their music was sterling he had known that since hed listened to their first demo six years before it had been a little rough a little raw and exactly the right sound for its time he had already managed two other groups to solid record contracts but devastation had been his chancefor glory he had needed them they had vieeded him hed gone on the road with them sat in dives hustled record producers called in all of his markers it had paid off far beyond his initial expectations but his expectations were flexible he wanted more for them he wanted more for himself the band individually and as a group was beginning to worry him they wandered off on their own too much these days johnno with his frequent trips to new york stevie spending weeks at a time god knew where pm was always within arms reach but he was taken up in an affair with some ambitious starlet pete no longer believed it was a fling there was brian of course spouting antiwar politics at the drop of a hat they were a band dammit a rock and roll band and what they did separately affected what they did as a group what they did as a group affected their sales already they were backing off planning a tour after the new album was released he wasnt going to see them cracked down the middle as the beatles had been after a deep breath he settled back to think about them as they had been and as they were it pleased him to see johnnos collection of cars the bentley the rolls the ferrari there was one thing about johnno pete thought with a small smile the man knew how to enjoy money hed nearly stopped worrying that johnnos sexual preferences would leak over the years pete had gained a strong respect for johnnos intelligence common sense and talent no he didnt have to worry about johnno pete decided as he glanced over the papers on his desk he was one who could keep his private affairs private and the public loved him for his outlandish outfits and glib tongue then there was stevie the drugs were a bit of a problem it wasnt affecting his performance yet but he had noticed that stevies mood swings were wider and more frequent hed been stoned during the last two recording sessions and even brian no slouch in the drug department himself had been annoyed yes hed have to keep his eye on stevie pm was as dependable as a sunrise it was true that pete was by turns amused and irked that the drummer pored over every word in a contract but the boy was investing his money well and earned petes respect there it had also been a surprise a pleasant and profitable one when the girls took so giddily to his homely face where pete had once worried that pm would prove the weak link he had turned out to be one of the strongest brian pete poured himself two fingers of chivas regal sat back in his overstuffed leather chair and considered brian was without doubt the heart and soul of the group he was the creative drive the conscience it had been fortunate that the business with emma hadnt set them back pete had worried about it then had been delighted when the whole affair had generated sympathy and record sales true pete still had to cross swords with jane palmer from time to time but the mess had never put a dent in the groups popularity nor had brians marriage it had frustrated pete that he hadnt been able to portray the group as four young single men but brians family life had turned into a bounty of press the pity was the peace rallies the speeches brians affection for the students for a democratic society his outspoken support of american draft dodgers theyd nearly had the cover of ime before brian had popped off with a few illchosen criticisms of the chicago seven trial pete understood the power of the press how one careless statement could have the masses the recordbuying masses turning against you john lennon had opened his own can of worms a few years earlier with an offhand sarcastic comment about the beaties being bigger than jesus brian had come close too close to making the same mistake he was entitled to his politics of course pete thought as he sipped his whisky but there was a point where personal beliefs and public success parted ways between stevies enchantment with drugs and brians idealism there was bound to be a disaster there were ways to avoid it of course and he had already begun to consider a few he needed the public to see stevie not just as a druggedout rocker but as an extraordinary musician he needed them to see brian as not only a peacenik but a devoted father with the right balance of images not only the youth would be buying records and magazines but their parents as well they stayed in california another two weeks basking in long lazy days making love in the afternoon giving allnight parties there were midweek trips to disneyland in careful disguises the photographers pete hired to record the outings were so discreet bev never noticed them she decided to throw out her birth control pills and brian wrote love songs as the time to go back to england drew near the group made peace within themselves and set up an informal headquarters in brians hillside home we should all go johnno carelessly passed his turn on the bong hair was the first important musical for our generation a rock musical he liked the phrase the grandeur of it already he was turning over ideas for one he hoped when they returned to london he and brian could put together a musical that would outdo hair and the whos current success tommy we can lay over in new york a couple of days he continued see the play raise some hell then head back to london do they really strip naked stevie wanted to know right down to the buff son that should be worth the price of a ticket we should go mellowed from the company and smoke brian rested his head on bevs knee hed already stayed in one place longer than he liked and the idea of new york appealed for the music and the statement you go for the statement stevie grinned ill go for the naked birds well get pete to fix it up what do you say bev she didnt like new york but she could see brians mind was set and she didnt want to spoil the easy peaceful mood of the last weeks itll be fun maybe we can take darren and emma to the zoo and through central park before we fly home emma was thrilled she remembered her first trip to new york well the big bed in the hotel room the soaring thrill of standing on top of the world the glorious rides on the carousel in central park she wanted to share all of that with darren she tried to explain all the wonders of it to him as they prepared for the trip as alice wallingsford packed up the nursery she kept darren out of mischief with his favored farm moo cow he said holding up the black spotted white piece from the set want to see a moo cow i dont think well see a moo cow but well see lions at the zoo she made a roar that had him squealing youre getting him too excited emma alice said automatically and its nearly bedtime emma just rolled her eyes as darren danced around her he was wearing his oshkosh overalls and little red keds for emmas approval he struggled to do a sloppy somersault all that energy alice clucked her tongue though in truth she was charmed by the boy i dont see how well get him to sleep tonight dont pack charlie emma put in before alice could drop the stuffed dog into a packing box he has to ride on the plane with me with a sigh alice set the worn dog aside he needs a good washing i dont want you sneaking him into the babys crib anymore emma i love charlie darren announced and tried another somersault he landed heavily on his playskool ti tool bench but instead of crying picked up the wooden hammer to play a tatoo on the colored pegs i love charlie he sang to his own rhythm be that as it may sweet thing hes getting a bit smelly i dont want germs in the bed with my baby darren sent her a sunny smile i love germs its a heartbreaker you are alice picked him up to bounce him on her hip now alice is going to give you a nide bath before bed with bubbles emma dont leave those pieces spread about she added as she paused in the doorway you can have your bath as soon as darrens finished then you can go down and say good night to your parents yes maam she waited until alice was out of sight before she got up to get charlie he did not smell she thought as she buried her face in his fur and she would put him in darrens crib because charlie watched over him when she was sleeping rly wish you mdnt asked all those people over tonight bev fluffed the pillows on the couch though she knew such niceties were a waste of time we have to say goodbye dont we he put on a jim hendrix album because it reminded him that though the artist was dead the music lived on besides once were back in london were back to work in a big way i want to relax while i can how can we relax with a hundred people milling about the house bev its our last night she opened her mouth again then closed it when alice ushered the children in theres my boy she scooped darren up on the fly before she winked at emma is charlie ready for his trip she knew and sympathized with emmas unease with planes and smoothed a hand over the girls hair hes just a little nervous hell be all right with me of course he will she pressed a kiss on the delicate area between darrens ear and throat already bathed shed wanted to take care of that evening chore herself there was nothing bev liked better than to play with darren in the tub smoothing the soapy cloth over his pale shiny skin all washed and ready for bed alice put in theyve just come to say good night before i tuck them up ill do that alice with all the confusion today ive hardly seen the children all right maam ill finish the packing dad emma gave brian her shy little smile can we have a story please what hed planned to do was roll a joint of good grass and listen to music but he had a hard time resisting that smile or his sons bright bubbly laughter he went upstairs with his family leaving hendrix wailing it took two stories before darrens eyes began to droop he fought sleep as he fought all sedentary activities he wanted to be doing to be running or laughing or turning somersaults most of all he wanted to be the brave young knight his father spoke of he wanted to take up the shining magic sword and slay dragons he yawned and cozied between his mothers breasts began to doze he could smell emma and went off to sleep happy that she was nearby he didnt wake when bev lifted him into his crib darren slept the way he did everything with a full heart she tucked the satinbordered blue blanket around his shoulders and tried not to think that he would soon be too big for a crib hes so beautiful unable to resist bev stroked her fingers across his warm cheek with emmas head resting on his shoulder brian looked down at his son when hes like this its hard to believe he can tear a room apart singlehanded with a soft laugh bev slipped an arm around brians waist he uses both hands and his feet ive never known anyone who loves life as much when i look at him i realize i have everything ive ever wanted i can see him a year from now five years from now it makes the idea of growing older pleasant somehow rock stars dont get old he frowned and for the first time bev heard a trace of sarcasm or was it disillusionment in his voice they could start playing vegas in white suits not you bri she tightened her arm around his waist ten years from now youll still be on top yeah well if i ever buy a white suit with sequins kick me in the ass with the greatest pleasure she kissed him lifting a hand to his cheek to soothe as she might with one of the children lets put emma down i want to do right by them bev shifting emma he started down the hall to her room by them and you you are doing right the worlds so tucked up i used to think if we made it really made it people would listen to what we had to say that it would make a difference now i dont know whats wrong bri i dont know he laid emma down wishing he could put his finger on the reason for the restless dissatisfaction hed begun to feel a couple of years ago when things really started to break for us i thought it was fab all those girls screaming our pictures in all the mags our music on every radio its what you wanted it was is i dont know how can they hear what were trying to say what difference does it make how good we are if they scream through every bloody concert were just a commodity an image petes polished up to sell records i hate that he stuffed his frustrated fists in his pockets sometimes i think we should go back to where we startedthe pubs where people listened or danced when we played when we could reach them i dont know he passed a hand through his hair i guess i didnt realize how much fun we were having then but you cant go back i didnt know you felt this way why didnt you tell me i didnt know myself really its just that i dont feel like brian mcavoy anymore how could he explain that the feeling hed revived at woodstock had stubbornly faded in the year following it i didnt know how frustrating it would be not to be able to go out and have a drink with the lads or sit on the beach without people swarming around wanting a piece you could stop you could pull back and write i cant stop he looked down at emma sleeping peacefully i have to record i have to perform every time im on stage or in the studio i know deep down that this is what i want to do need to do but the rest of it the rest of it sucks and i didnt know it would maybe its hendrix and joplin dying the way they did such a waste then the beatles breaking up its like the end of something and i havent finished not the end she laid a hand on his shoulder automatically kneading the tense muscles just a change if were not moving forward were moving back dont you see but he knew she couldnt and tried to put his feelings into more understandable words maybe its pete pressuring us to tour again or talking stevie into sitting in with other groups in studio sessions and doing that movie score all i know is its not just the four of us getting together and playing from the heart anymore its image and bloody marketing its brokers and tax shelters emma rolled over murmuring and i guess its worrying about emma going to school and darren going off one day whats it going to be like for them will people start picking at them wanting pieces of them because of what i am i dont want them to have the filthy childhood i did but am i doing any better by them making them a part of something thats gotten bigger than all of us and hungrier you think too much she turned to take his face in her hands thats what i love most about you the children are fine youve only got to look at them to see maybe their childhood isnt normal but theyre happy were going to keep them happy and safe whatever you are whoever you are youre their dad well work out the rest i love you bev i must be deft worrying about all this weve got everything he brought her closer to rest his head on her hair he wished he could understand why everything had turned out to be too much brims discontentment vanished after a couple of joints the house was full of people brian felt understood him what he wanted to do where he wanted to go the music was loud the drugs were plentiful and varied snow grass thrkish hash speed bennies the grinding soulwrenching rock of janis joplin poured out as his guests took their pick he wanted to listen to her again and again to hear her belt out ball and chain somehow it helped him grab onto the fact that he was alive he still had a chance to make it matter he watched stevie dance with a redhead in a purple miniskirt stevie didnt worry about beirfg a figurehead or turning into a poster for some girls wall brian mused as he washed down pretzels with smooth irish whiskey stevie gleefully jumped from woman to woman without a care in his head of course he was stoned most of the time with a halflaugh brian picked another joint out of the bowl and decided it was time to get stoned himself from across the room johnno watched brian settle back distancing himself johnno reflected as he chose a gauloise over grass it had been happening more and more recently perhaps because johnno was closest to brian he had been the only one to notice he thought now that the only time brian seemed truly in tune was when the two of them sat down to write melody countermelody phrases bridges he knew brian had been upset by the deaths of hendrix and joplin so had he in its way it had been as devastating as the kennedy assassinations people were supposed to grow old and decrepit before they died but though hed been shaken he hadnt mourned as brian was mourning then brian always cared more needed more like brian he glanced over at stevie he didnt like what he saw it didnt matter a damn if stevie screwed every woman on the continent though he felt it lacked a certain finesse it was the drugs and the fact that stevie was rapidly losing control over them that concerned johnno he didnt care for the image they were beginning to project the stonedout rockers shifting his gaze he looked at pm there was a bit of a problem there as well oh not with drugs poor old pm could barely function after one toke it was the busty blond bimbo that had attached herself to the drummer two months before pm didnt appear to be making any attempt to sheike her off johnno watched her now the longfaced sloeeyed blondeall legs and tits in a tight red dress she wasnt as softheaded as she made out to be johnno mused she was sharp as a tack and knew how to play the tune pm wanted to hear if they didnt watch themselves shed get him to marry her and she wouldnt stay quietly in the background like bev no not this one the three of them in their separate ways were on the verge of destroying the group and nothing mattered more to johnno when emma wok the floor was vibrating with the bass from the stereo she lay quietly a moment listening trying as she did from time to time to recognize the song from the beat alone shed gotten used to the parties her dad liked to have people around lots of music lots of laughing when she was older she would go to parties too bev always made sure the house was very clean before the guests arrived that was silly really emma thought in the morning the house was a terrible mess with smelly glasses and overflowing ashtrays more often than not a few of the guests would be sprawled over the sofas and chairs amid the clutter emma wondered what it would be like to sit up all night talking laughing listening to music when you were grownup no one told you when you had to go to bed or have a bath with a sigh she rolled over on her back the music was faster now she could feel the driving bass pulse in the walls and something else footsteps coming down the hall emma thought miss wallingsford she prepared to close her eyes and feign sleep when another thought occurred to her perhaps it was dad or mum passing through to check on her and darren if it was she could pretend to have just woken then she could persuade them to tell her about the party but the footsteps passed by she sat up clutching charlie shed wanted company even if only for a moment or two she wanted to talk about the party or the trip to new york she wanted to know what song was playing she sat a moment a smalk sleepy child in a pink nightgown bathed by the cheerful glow of a mickey mouse nightlight she thought she heard darren crying straightening she strained to listen she was certain she heard darrens cranky tears over the pulse of the music automatically she climbed out of bed tucking charlie under one arm she would sit with darren until he quieted and leave charlie to watch over him through the rest of the night the hallway was dark which surprised her a light always burned there in case emma had to use the bathroom during the night she had a bad moment at the doorway imagining the things that lurked in the shadowy corners she wanted to stay in her room with the grinning mickey then darren let out a yawling cry there was nothing in the corners emma told herself as she started down the dark hallway there was nothing there at all no monsters no ghosts no squishy or slithering things it was the beatles playing now emma wet her lips just the dark just the dark she told herself her eyes had adjusted to the dark by the time shed reached darrens door it was closed that was wrong too his door was always left open so he could be heard easily when awakened she reached out then jumped as she thought she heard something move behind her heart pumping she turned to scan the dark hallway shifting shadows towered into nameless monsters making sweat break out on her brow and back nothing there nothing there she told herself and darren was crying his lungs out she turned the knob and pushed the door open come together lennon sang over me there were two men in the room one was holding darren struggling to keep him still while the baby screamed in fear and anger the other had something in his hand something that the light from the giraffe lamp on the dresser caused to glint what are you doing the man whirled at her voice he wasnt a doctor emma thought as she made out the needle in his hand she recognized him and knew he wasnt a doctor and darren wasnt sick the other man swore a short spurt of ugly words while he fought to keep darren from wriggling out of his arms emma the man she knew said in a calm friendly voice he smiled it was a false smile an angry smile she noted it and that he still held the needle as he stepped toward her she turned and ran behind her she heard darren call out ma sobbing she raced down the hall there were monsters her panicked mind taunted there were monsters and things with snappy teeth in the shadows they were coming after her now he nearly caught the trailing edge of her nightgown swearing he dove for her his hand skimmed over her ankle slid off she yelped as though shed been scalded as she reached the top of the stairs she screamed for her father shrieking his name over and over again then her legs tangled she tumbled down the flight of stairs in the kitchen someone sat on the counter and ordered fifty pizzas shaking her head bev checked the freezer for ice no one used more ice than americans as an afterthought she dropped a cube in her warming wine when in rome she decided then turned toward the door she met brian on the threshold grinning he hooked an arm around her waist and gave her a long lazy kiss hi hi still holding the wine she linked her hands behind his neck bri hmm who are all these people he laughed nuzzling into her neck youve got me the scent of her had him hardening moving to the sinuous beat of the lennon mccartney number he brought her against him what do you say we take a trip upstairs and leave them the rest of the house thats rude but she moved against him wicked rude and the best idea ive heard in hours well then he made a halfhearted attempt to pick her up sent them both teetering wine spilled cool down his back as bev giggled maybe you can carry me he said then heard emma scream he rammed into a small table as he turned dizzy from drugs and booze he stumbled righted himself and rushed into the foyer there were people already gathered pushing through them he saw her crumpled at the foot of the steps emma my god he was terrified to touch her there was blood at the corner of her mouth with one trembling finger he wiped it away he looked up into a sea of faces a blur of color all unrecognizable his stomach clenched then tried to heave itself into his throat call an ambulance he managed then bent over her again dont move her bevs face was chalkwhite as she knelt beside him i dont think youre supposed to move her we need a blanket some quickwitted soul was already thrusting a daisy afghan into her hands shell be all right bri carefully bev smoothed the blanket over her shell be just fine he closed his eyes shook his head to clear it but when he opened them again emma was still lying deadwhite on the floor there was too much noise the music echoing off the ceilings the voices murmuring muttering all around he felt a hand on his shoulder a quick reassuring squeeze ambulance is on the way pm told him hold on bri get them out he whispered he looked up and into johnnos shocked pale face get them out of here with a nod johnno began to urge people along the door was open the night bright with floodlights and headlights when they heard the wall of the sirens im going to go up bev said calmly tell alice whats happened check on darren well go to the hospital with her shes going to be fine brian i know it he could only nod and stare down at emmas still pale face he couldnt leave her if he had dared he would have gone into the bathroom stuck a finger down his throat and tried to rid his body of some of the chemicals hed pumped into it that night it was all like a dream he thought a floaty unhappy dream until he looked at emmas face then it was real much too real the abbey road album was still playing the sly cut about murder maxwells silver hammer was coming down bri johnno put a hand on his arm move back now so they can tend to her what move back gently johnno eased him to his feet they need to have a look at her dazed brian watched the ambulance attendants move in and crouch over his daughter she must have fallen all the way down the stairs shell be all right johnno sent a helpless look toward pm as they flanked brian little girls are tougher than they look thats right a bit unsteady on his feet stevie stood behind brian with both hands on his shoulders our emma wont let a tumble down the stairs hold her up for long well go to the hospital with you pete moved over to join them together they watched as emma was carefully lifted onto a stretcher upstairs bev screamed and screamed and screamed until the sound filled every corner of the house lou kesselring snored like a wounded elephant if he indulged in a beer before bed he snored like two wounded elephants his wife of seventeen years coped with the nightly event by wearing earplugs lou knew marge loved him in her own steady nononsense way and he considered himself fortunate and smart for not sleeping with her before marriage he was honest but had kept this one little secret by the time shed discovered it hed had his ring on her finger he was really rattling the shingles tonight it had been nearly thirtysix hours since hed slept in his own bed now that the calarmi case was closed he was going to enjoy not only a good nights sleep but a whole weekend of sloth he actually dreamed about puttering around the yard pruning roses playing a bit of catch with his son theyd barbecue some burgers on the grill and marge would make her potato salad hed had to kill a man twelve hours before it wasnt the first time though thank god it was still a rare occurrence whenever his work took him that far he needed badly the ordinary the everyday potato salad and charred burgers the feel of his wifes firm body against his during the night his sons laughter he was a cop a good one in the six years hed been with homicide this was only the second time hed had to discharge his weapon like most of his colleagues he knew that law enforcement consisted of days of monotonylegwork paperwork phone calls and moments split seconds of terror he also knew as a cop that he would see things touch things experience things that most of the world was unaware ofmurder ghetto wars backalley knifings blood gore waste lou was aware but he didnt dream of his work he was forty and had never since picking up his badge at the age of twentyfour brought his work home but sometimes it followed him he rolled over breaking off in midsnore as the phone rang instinctively he reached out and with his eyes still closed rattled the receiver off the hook yeah kesselring lieutenant its bester what the fuck do you want he knew he was safe using what marge called the f word since his wife had her earplugs in sorry to wake you up but weve got an incident you know mcavoy brian mcavoy the singer mcavoy he scrubbed his hand over his face fighting to wake up devastation the rock group yeah yeah right he wasnt much on rock himselfunless it was preslay or the everly brothers what happened some kids turn up the music too loud and cook their brains somebody killed his little boy looks like it might have been a bungled kidnapping ah shit awake now lou switched on the light give me the address the light woke marge she glanced over saw lou sitting naked on the side of the bed and scrawling on a pad without complaint she got up tucked her arms into her cotton robe and went down to make him coffee lou found bran at the hospital he wasnt certain what hed been expecting hed seen brian a few times in newspapers or television when the singer had spoken out against the war a peacenik they called him lou didnt think too much of the bunch that went around getting stoned and growing their hair asslong and passing out flowers on street corners but he wasnt sure he thought much of the war either hed lost a brother in korea and his sisters boy had left for vietnam three months before but it wasnt mcavoys politics or his hairstyle that concerned lou now he paused studying brian who was sprawled on a flowerpatterned chair looked younger in person lou decided young a little too thin and oddly pretty for a man brian had that dazed dreamstruck look that came with shock there were others in the room and smoke billowed up from a number of ashtrays mechanically brian put a cigarette to his lips drew in set it down again blew out mr mcavoy repeating the routine with the cigarette brian glanced up he saw a tall leanly built man with dark hair carefully combed back from a long sleepy face he wore a suit a gray one and a conservative tie of nearly the same shade against a crisp white shirt his black shoes were glossy his nails neatly trimmed and there was a slight nick on his chin where hed cut himself shaving odd the things you notice brian thought as he pulled on the cigarette again yes im lieutenant kesselring he took out his shield but brian continued to look at his face not the id i need to ask you some questions cant this wait lieutenant pete page took a long hard look at the identification mr mcavoys not in any shape to deal with this now it would help us all if we got the preliminaries over with lou sat after replacing his badge he spread his hands on his knees im sorry mr mcavoy i dont want to add to your grief i want to find out whos responsible for this brian lit a cigarette from the butt of another and said nothing what can you tell me about what happened tonigmt they killed darren my little boy the took him out of his crib and left him on the floor sick at heart johrmo snatched up his styrofoam cup of coffee and turned away lou reached in his pocket for his pad and freshly sharpened pencil do you know of anyone who might have wanted to harm the boy no everyone loves darren hes so bright and funny brians throat locked up and he looked around blindly for his own cup i know this is difficult can you tell me about tonight we had a party we were all going to new york tomorrow and we had a party id like a list of the guests i dont know bev might he trailed off remembering that bev was in a room down the hall heavily sedated we should be able to put together a fairly accurate list between us pete put in he tried to drink more coffee but it was burning a hole in his gut but you can be sure that no one brian invited to his home would have done this lou intended to find out did you know everyone at the party mr mcavoy i dont know probably not he rested his elbows on his knees a moment to rub the heels of his hands hard against his eyes the pain was the closest he could get to comfort friends and friends of friends and like that you open the door and people come it just happens lou nodded as if he understood he remembered the parties marge planned the careful guest lists rsvps the detailed checks and rechecks of food their fifteenthanniversary party had been planned as meticulously as a state dinner well work on the list lou decided your daughter emma is it yes emma she was upstairs during the party yes asleep his babies tucked away safe and sound they were both asleep in the same room no they have separate rooms alice wallingsford our nanny was upstairs with them yes hed already had the report that the nanny had been found bound gagged and terrified in her own bed and the little girl fell down toucan carry me he said then heard emma scream he rammed into a small table as he turned dizzy from drugs and booze he stumbled righted himself and rushed into the foyer there were people already gathered pushing through them he saw her crumpled at the foot of the steps emma my god he was terrified to touch her there was blood at the corner of her mouth with one trembling finger he wiped it away he looked up into a sea of faces a blur of color all unrecognizable his stomach clenched then tried to heave itself into his throat call an ambulance he managed then bent over her again dont move her bevs face was chalkwhite as she knelt beside him i dont think youre supposed to move her we need a blanket some quickwitted soul was already thrusting a daisy afghan into her hands shell be all right bri carefully bev smoothed the blanket over her shell be just fine he closed his eyes shook his head to clear it but when he opened them again emma was still lying deadwhite on the floor there was too much noise the music echoing off the ceilings the voices murmuring muttering all around he felt a hand on his shoulder a quick reassuring squeeze ambulance is on the way pm told hilooks your wife mr mcavoy she found your son yes she went upstairs after we heard the ambulance she wanted to check on she wanted to be sure you see that he hadnt woke up i heard her screaming screaming screaming and i ran when i got into darrens room she was sitting on the floor with him holding him and screaming they had to give her something to put her out mr mcavoy have there been any threats against you your wife or your children no nothing no well theres some hate mail from time to time political stuff mostly pete has it screened wed like to see everything thats come in for the last six months thats quite a bundle of mail lieutenant pete told him well manage brian ignored them both and rose as the doctor came in emma was all he said all he could say shes sleeping she has a concussion a broken arm and some bruised ribs but no internal injuries shes going to be all right shell need to be watched carefully for the next few days but yes the outlook is very good he cried then as he hadnt been able to when hed seen his sons lifeless body as hed been incapable of doing when theyd taken his family from him and left him in the greenwalled waiting room hot tears poured through his fingers as he covered his face quietly lou closed his notebook and motioning to the doctor stepped into the hall im lieutenant kesselring homicide again lou flashed his id when will i be able to talk to the little girl not for a day perhaps two i need to question her as soon as possible he took out a card and handed it to the doctor if youd call me as soon as shes able to talk the wife beverly mcavoy sedated ten or twelve hours before she should come around even then i wont guarantee shell be able to talk or that ill be willing to allow it just call he glanced back toward the waiting room ive got a son of my own doctor emma had terrible dreams she wanted to call out for her dad for her mum but it was as though a hand were closed over her mouth over her eyes great weights seemed to press her down and down the baby was crying the sound echoed in the room in her bead until it seemed as though daffen were inside her mind screaming to get out she wanted to go to him had tobut there were twoheaded snakes and snarling snapping things with black dripping fangs all around her bed each time she tried to climb out they lunged at her hissing spitting grinning if she stayed in bed shed be safe but darren was calling for her she had to be brave brave enough to run to the door when she did the snakes disappeared beneath her feet the floor felt alive moving pulsing she looked back over her shoulder it was just her room with toys and dolls tidily on the shelves with mickey mouse smiling cheerfully as she watched the smile turned into a leer she raced into the hall into the dark there was music the shadows seemed to dance to it there were sounds breathing heavy wet breathing snarls and the movement of something dry and slithering on the wood as she ran toward the sounds of darrens cries she felt the hot breath on her arms the quick nasty nips at her ankles it was locked she pulled and pounded on the door as her brothers screams rose higher only to be drowned out by the music under her small fists the door dissolved she saw the man but there was no face she saw only the glint of his eyes the gleam of his teeth he started toward her and she was more afraid of him than of the snakes and monsters the teeth and the claws blind with fear she ran with darrens screams rising behind her then she was falling falling into a dark pit she heard a sound like a twig snapping and tried to scream out at the agony but she could only fall silently endlessly helplessly with the music and her brothers cries echoing in her head when she awoke it was bright there were no dolls on the shelves no shelves at all just blank walls at first she wondered if she was in a hotel she tried to remember but as she did the aching beganthe hot dull aching that seemed to throb everywhere at once moaning against it she turned her head her father was sleeping in a chair his head was back turned a bit to the side beneath the stubble of his beard his face was pale in his lap his hands were clenched into fists dad already on the edge of sleep he woke quickly he saw her lying against the white hospital sheets her eyes wide and a little afraid the tears welled up again clogging his throat burning his eyes he fought them with what little strength he had left emma he went to her sitting on the edge of the bed and pressing his exhausted face against her throat she started to put her arm around him but it was weighed down with the white plaster cast that had the fear bubbling quick again she could hear in her mind the sound of that dry snap the screaming pain that had followed it hadnt been a dreamand if it had been real then the rest wheres darren she would ask that first brian thought as he squeezed his eyes tightly shut how could he tell her how could he tell her what he had yet to understand or believe himself she was only a child his only child emma he kissed her cheek her temple her forehead as if somehow that would ease the pain for both of them he took her hand do you remember when i told you a story about angels about how they live in heaven they fly and play music and never hurt each other oh he was clever brian thought bitterly so clever to have woven such a pretty tale yes thats right sometimes special people become angels he reached far back for his catholic faith and found it weighed heavily on his shoulders sometimes god loves these people so much he wants them with him up in heaven thats where darren is now hes an angel in heaven no for the first time since she had crawled out from beneath the dirty sink over three years before she pushed away from her father i dont want him to be an angel neither do i tell god to send him back she said furiously right now i cant the tears were coming again he couldnt stop them hes gone emma then ill go to heaven too and take care of him no fear clutched in his gut drying his tears his fingers dug into her shoulders putting bruises on her for the first time you cant i need you emma i cant get darren back but i wont lose you i hate god she said dryeyed and fierce so do i brian thought as he gathered her close so do i there wo been over a hundred people in and out of the mcavoy house on the night of the murder lous pad was overflowing with names notes and impressions but he was no closer to an answer both the window and the door of the boys room had been found open though the nanny was adamant that she had closed the window after putting the boy to bed she also insisted the window had been locked but there had been no signs of a forced entry there had been footprints beneath the window size lou mused but there had been no impressions in the ground a ladder would have made and no traces of rope on the windowsill the nanny was little help shed awakened when a hand had clamped over her mouth shed been blindfolded bound and gagged in the two interviews lou had had with her shed changed her estimate of the time shed been bound from thirty minutes to two hours she was low on his lists of suspects but he was waiting for the background check hed ordered it was beverly mcavoy that lou had to see now hed postponed the questioning as long as possible longer after hed scanned the police photos of little darren mcavoy keep this as brief as possible the doctor stood with lou outside the door shes been given a mild sedative but her mind is clear maybe too clear i dont want to make this any harder on her than it already is what could he wondered as the image of the young boy fixed itself in his mind i need to question the girl as well is she up to it shes conscious i dont know if shell talk to you she hasnt spoken more than two words to anyone but her father with a nod lou stepped into the room the woman was sitting up in bed though her eyes were open they didnt focus on him she looked very small and hardly old enough to have had a child and to have lost one she wore a pale blue bed jacket and the hands lying on the white sheets were absolutely still beside her brian sat in a chair his unshaven face an unhealthy shade of gray his eyes looked old red and puffy from tears and lack of sleep clouded with griel when he looked up lou saw something else in them fury im sorry to disturb you the doctor told us youd be coming brian didnt rise or gesture to a chair he simply continued to stare do you know who did this not yet id like to talk with your wife bev brian laid a hand over hers but there was no response this is the policeman whos trying to find to find out what happened im sorry he said looking back at lou i dont remember your name kesseiring lieutenant kesselring the lieutenant needs to ask you some questions she made no move she barely breathed bev please perhaps it was the despair in his voice that reached down deep to where she hadtried to hide herself her hand moved restlessly in his for a moment she closed her eyes held them closed wishing with all her heart that she was dead then she opened them again and looked straight at lou what do you want to know everything you can tell me about that night my son was dead she said flatly what else matters something you tell me could help me find who killed your son mrs mcavoy will that bring darren back to me no i dont feel anything anymore she stared at him with huge tired eyes i dont feel my legs or my arms or my head when i try to feel it hurts so its best not to try isnt it maybe for a while he drew up a chair beside the bed but if you could tell me what you remember from that night she let her head fall back and stared up at the ceiling her monotone description of the party was similar to her husbands and to those of the others lou had interviewed familiar faces strange faces people coming in going out someone on the kitchen phone ordering pizza that was a new one and lou noted it down thlking with brian then hearing emma screamfinding her at the foot of the steps people crowded around she murmured someone i dont know who called an ambulance we didnt move herwe were afraid to move her we heard the sirens coming i wanted to go to the hospital with her her and brian but i needed to check on darren first and to wake alice and let her know what had happened i stopped to get emmas robe i dont know why really i just thought she might need it i started down the hall i was annoyed because the lights were out we always leave the hall light on for emma shes afraid of the dark not darren she said with a halfsmile hes never been afraid of a thing we only keep a nightlight in his room because its easier for us if he wakes in the night he often does still he likes company she brought a hand to her face as her voice began to shake he doesnt like to be alone i know this is hard mrs mcavoy but she had been the first on the scene had found and had moved the body i need to know what you found when you went into his room i found my baby she shook off brians hand she couldnt bear to be touched he was lying on the floor by the crib i thought i thought oh god hes climbed up and fallen out he was lying so still on the little blue rug i couldnt see his face i picked him up but he wouldnt wake up i shook him and i screamed but he wouldnt wake up did you see anyone upstairs mrs mcavoy no there was no one upstairs just the baby my baby they took him away and they wont let me have him brian for gods sake why wont you let me have him mrs mcavoy lou rose im going to do everything i can to find out who did this i promise you that what difference does it make she began to cry huge silent tears what possible difference does it make it made a difference lou thought as he stepped into the corridor again it had to emma studied lou with a straightforward intensity that made him feel awkward it was the first time he could remember a child making him want to check his shirt for stains ive seen policemen on the telly she said when he introduced himself they shoot people sometimes he groped for something to say do you like television yes we like sesame street the best darren and l who do you like best big bird or kermit she smiled a little i like oscar because hes so rude because of the smile he took a chance and lowered the bed guard emma didnt object when he sat on the edge of the bed i havent seen sesame street in a little while does oscar still live in a garbage can yes and he yells at everyone i guess yelling can make you feel better sometimes do you know why im here emma she said nothing but gathered an old black stuffed dog to her chest i need to talk to you about darren dad says hes an angel now in heaven im sure he is its not fair that he went away he didnt even say goodbye he couldnt she knew that because she knew deep in her heart what you had to do to become an angel dad said that god wanted him but i think it was a mistake and god should send him back lou brushed a hand over her hair moved as much by her stubborn logic as he had been by the mothers grief it was a mistake emma a terrible one but god cant send him back her lip poked out but it was more defiance than a pout god can do anything he wants lou stepped uneasily onto shaky ground not always sometimes men do things and god doesnt fix it we have to i think you might be able to help me find out how this mistake happened will you tell me about that night the night you fell down the steps she shifted her eyes to charlie and plucked at his fur i broke my arm i know im sorry i have a little boy hes older than you almost eleven he broke his arm trying to rollerskate on the roof impressed she looked up again eyes wide really yes he broke his nose too he skated right off the roof and landed in the azalea bushes whats his name michael emma wanted to meet him and ask him what it had felt like to fly off a rooftop it sounded very brave like something darren would have wanted to try then she began to pluck at charlies fur again darren would have been three in february i know he took her hand after a moment she curled her fingers around his i loved him best of all she said simply is he dead yes emma and he cant come back even though it was a mistake no im very sorry she had to ask him ask him what she hadnt dared ask her father her father would cry and might not tell her the truth this man with his pale eyes and quiet voice wouldnt cry is it my fault her eyes were desperate as they shifted up to his why would you think so i ran away i didnt take care of him i promised i always would but i didnt what did you run away from snakes she said without hesitation remembering only the nightmare there were snakes and things with big teeth where around the bed they hide in the dark and like to eat bad girls i see he took out his notepad who told you that my mammy mam before bev bev says there arent any snakes at all but she just doesnt see them and you saw the snakes the night you fell they tried to stop me from going to darren when he cried darren was crying pleased that he hadnt corrected her about the snakes emma nodded i heard him sometimes he wakes up at night but he goes back to sleep again after i talk to him and take him charlie whos charlie my dog she held him out for lous inspection hes very handsome lou said as he patted charlies dusty head did you take charlie to darren that night i was going to her farce clouded as she struggled to remember i kept him with me to scare the snakes and the other things away it was dark in the hall its never dark in the hall they were there his fingers tightened on his pencil who was there the monsters i could hear them squishing and hissing darren was crying so loud he needed me did you go into his room emma she shook her head she could see herself clearly standing in the shadowed hallway with the sounds of hissing and snapping all around at the door there was light under the door the monsters had him did you see the monsters there were two monsters in darrens room did you see their faces they dont have faces one was holding him holding him too tight and making him cry hard he called for me but i ran i ran away and left darren with the monsters and they killed him they killed him because i ran away no he gathered her close letting her weep against his chest as he stroked her hair no you ran to get help didnt you emma i wanted my dad to come that was the right thing to do they werent monsters emma they were men bad men and you couldnt have stopped them i promised i would take care of darren that i wouldnt ever let anything happen to him you tried to keep that promise no one blames you baby but he was wrong emma thought she blamed herself and always would it was nearing midnight when lou got home hed spent hours at his desk going over each note every scrap of information hed been a cop for too long not to know that objectivity was his best tool but darren mcavoys murder had become personal he couldnt forget the blackandwhite photo of the boy barely out of babyhood the image had imprinted itself into his brain he had an image of the childs bedroom as well the blue and white walls the scatter of toys as yet unpacked the little overalls neatly folded on a rocking chair the scuffed sneakers beneath them and the hypodermic still full of phenobarbitol a few feet away from the crib theyd never had a chance to use it lou thought grimly they hadnt been able to stick it into a vein and put him soundly to sleep had they been going to carry him out the window would brian mcavoy have gotten a call a few hours later demanding money for the boys safe return there would be no call now no ransom rubbing his gritty eyes lou started up the steps amateurs he thought bunglers murderers where the hell were they who the hell were they what difference does it make it made a difference he told himself as his hands clenched into fists justice always made a difference the door to michaels room was open the soft sound of his sons breathing drew him he could see in the faint moonlight the wreckage of toys and clothes strewn over the floor heaped on the bed mounded on the dresser usually it would have made him sigh michaels cheertil sloppiness was a mystery to lou both he and his wife were tidy and organized by nature michael was a tornado a rushing wind that hopped from spot to spot and left destruction and chaos behind yes usually he would have sighed and planned his lecture for the morning but tonight the wild disarray brought tears of gratitude to his eyes his boy was safe picking his way through the rubble he crept toward the bed he had to push the traffic jam of matchbox cars aside to find a place to sit michael slept on his stomach the right side of his face squashed into the pillow his arms flung out and the sheets in a messy tangle at his feet for a moment then five then ten lou simply sat studying the child he and marge had made the thick dark hair hed inherited from his mother was tousled around his face his skin was tanned but still had the dewy softness of first youth his nose was crooked giving character to what might have been a face too pretty for a boy he had a firm compact little body that was already beginning to sprout bruises and scrapes colored it six years and two miscarriages lou thought now then finally he and marge had been able to unite sperm and egg into strong vital life and he was the best and brightest of both of them lou remembered brian mcavoys face the stunned grief the fury the helplessness yes he understood michael stirred when lou stroked a hand over his cheek dad yes i just wanted to say good night go back to sleep yawning michael shifted and sent cars clattering to the floor i didnt mean to break it he murmured with a halflaugh lou pressed his hands to his eyes he didnt know what it was and didnt care okay i love you michael but his son was fully back to sleep it was bright almost balmy the breeze from the atlantic ruffled the tall green grass emma listened to the secret songs it whispered over its music was the low solemn voice of the priest he was tall and ruddyfaced with his white white hair a shocking contrast to his black robes though his voice carried a lilt very similar to her fathers emma didnt understand much of what he was saying and didnt want to she preferred listening to the humming grass and the monotonous lowing of the cattle on the hill beyond the gravesite darren was to have his farm at last in ireland though he would never ride a tractor or chase the lazy spotted cows it was a lovely place with the grass so green it looked like a painting she would remember the emerald grass and the fresh vital scent of earth newly turned she would remember the feel of the air against her face air so moist from the sea it might have been tears there was a church nearby a small stone structure with a white steeple and little windows of stained glass they had gone inside to pray before the little glossy casket had been carried out inside it had smelled strongly and too sweetly of flowers and incense candles had been burning even though the sun ran through the stained glass in colorful streams there had been painted statues of people in robes and one of a man bleeding on a cross brian had told her it was jesus who was looking after darren in heaven emma didnt think anyone who looked so sad and tired could take care of darren and make him laugh bev had said nothing at all only stood her face pale as glass stevie had played the guitar ajain as he had at the wedding but this time he was dressed in black and the tune was sad and quiet emma didnt like it inside the church and was glad when they stood outside in the sunlight johnno and pm whose eyes had been red from weeping had carried the casket along with four other men who were supposed to be her ceiusins she wondered why it had taken so many to carry darren who hadnt been heavy at all but she was afraid to ask it helped to look at the cows and the tall grass and the birds that glided overhead darren would have liked his farm she thought but it didnt seem right it didnt seem fair that he couldnt be standing beside her ready to race and run and laugh he shouldnt be in that box she thought he shouldnt be an angel even if it meant he had wings and music if she had been strong and brave if she had kept her promise he wouldnt be she should be in the box she realized as tears began to fall she had let bad things happen to darren she hadnt saved him from the monsters johnno picked her up when she began to cry he swayed a little and the movement was comforting she laid her head on his shoulder and listened to the words he spoke along with the priest the lord is my shepherd i shall not want but she did want she wanted darren blinking tears from her eyes she tried to watch the grass move with the wind she heard her fathers voice thick with grief walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil but there was evil she wanted to shout there was evil and it had killed darren evil had no face she watched a bird swoop overhead and followed its path on the hilltop nearby she saw a man he stood overlooking the small grave and the grief silently taking pictures he would never be the same brian thought as he drank steadily a bottle of irish whiskey on the table near his elbow nothing would ever be the same the drink didnt ease the pain as he had hoped it would it only made it sink its roots deeper he couldnt even comfort bev god knew hed tried hed wanted to hed wanted to comfort her to be comforted by her but she was buried so deep inside the pale silent woman who had stood beside him as their child had been put in the ground that he couldnt reach her he needed her dammit he needed someone to tell him there were reasons for what had happened that there was hope even now in these the darkest days of his life that was why hed brought darren here to ireland why hed insisted on the mass and the prayers and the ceremony you were never more catholic than you were at times of death brian thought but even the familiar words and scents even the hope the priest had handed out as righteously as communion wafers hadnt eased the pain he would never see darren again never hold him never watch him grow all that talk about everlasting life meant nothing when he couldnt take his boy up in his arms he wanted to be angry but he was far too tired for that or any kind of passion so if there was no comfort he thought as he poured another glass he would learn to live with the griel the kitchen smelled of spice cakes and good roasted meat the scents hung on though his relatives had been gone for several hours they had comehe wanted to be grateful for that they had come to stand beside him to cook the food that was somehow supposed to feed the soul they had grieved for the loss of the boy most of them had never met he had pulled away from his family brian admitted because he had had his own had made his own now what was left of the family hed made was sleeping upstairs darren was sleeping a few miles away beneath the shadow of a hill beside the grandmother he had never known brian drained his glass and with oblivion on his mind poured another son looking up brian saw his father hesitating in the doorway he wanted to laugh it was such a complete and ironic role reversal he could remember clear as a bell creeping into the kitchen as a boy while his father sat at the table getting unsteadily drunk yeah lifting the glass brian watched him over the rim you should try for sleep he saw his fathers eyes dart and linger on the bottle without a word brian pushed it toward him he entered then liam mcavoy an old man at fifty his face was round and ruddy from the crossstitches of broken capillaries under his skin he had the blue dreamy eyes that had been passed on to his son and the pale blond hair now wiry with gray he was gaunt brittleboned no longer the big powerful i man he had seemed in brians youth when he reached for the bottle brian felt a jolt his fathers hands might have been his own longfingered graceful why had he never noticed before it was a fine funeral liam said groping your motherd be pleased you brought him here to lie with her he poured then thirstily downed three fingers outside the soft rain of ireland began theyd never drunk together before brian realized he poured more whiskey into both glasses perhaps at last they would find some common ground with a bottle between them heres a farmers rain liam said soothed by the sound and the whiskey a nice soft soaker a farmers rain his little boy had dreamed of being a farmer had he passed that much of liam mcavoy into darren i didnt want him to be alone i thought he should be back in ireland with family its right you done right brian lit a cigarette then pushed the pack toward his father had they ever talked before the two of them if they had brian couldnt remember it shouldnt have happened theres a lot that happens in this world shouldnt liam lit the cigarette then picked up his glass theyll catch the bastards who did this boy theyll catch them its been a week it already seemed like years theyve got nothing theyll catch them liam insisted and the bloody bastards will rot in hell then the poor little ladil rest easy he didnt want to think of vengeance now he didnt want to think of his sweet little boy resting easy in the ground time had passed and was lost there had to be reasons for it why didnt you ever come brian leaned forward i sent you tickets for the wedding when daffen was born for emmas birthday for his for gods sake you never saw him until his wake why didnt you come running a farms busy work he said between swallows liam was a man filled with regrets so that one easily melded into another cant go larking off anytime you please not even once suddenly it seemed vital that he have an answer a true one you could have sent ma before she died you couldve let her come a womans place is with her husband liam tilted his glass toward brian youd do well to remember that boy you always were a selfish bastard liams hand surprisingly strong clamped down on brians mind your tongue i wont run and hide this time dad his eyes his voice were steady in both was an eagerness he would have relished a battle here now slowly liam removed his hand then picked up his glass i wont butt heads with you today not the day my grandsons been laid to rest he was never yours you never even saw him until he was dead brian tossed back you never bothered just cashed in the tickets i sent to buy more whiskey and where were you these last years where were you when your mother died off somewhere playing your bloody music that bloody music put a roof over your head dad with the stuffed dog clutched in her arms emma stood in the doorway her eyes wide and frightened her lower lip trembling she had heard the angry voices smelled the hot odor of liquor before she stepped into the room emma a bit unsteady brian walked over to pick her up careful not to jar her arm with the cast what are you doing down here i had a bad dream the snakes had come back and the monsters she could still hear the echo of darrens cries hard to sleep in a strange bed liam got to his feet his hand was awkward but it was gentle as he patted her head your grandda will fix you some warm milk she sniffled as he took out an old dented pan can i stay with you she asked her father sure he carried her to a chair and sat with her on his lap i woke up and i couldnt find you im right here emma he stroked her hair studying his father over her head ill always be here for you even there lou thought even at such a time he studied the grainy tabloid pictures of darren mcavoys funeral hed seen the paper at the checkout of the supermarket when hed picked up the whole wheat bread marge had sent him out for like anything that had to do with the mcavoys it had caught his interest and his sympathy hed been more than a little embarrassed to have bought it in public from sally the checker in the privacy of his own home he felt even more like a voyeur for a few pieces of loose change he and thousands of others could witness the intimacy of grief it was there on all the faces though they were bluffed he could see the little girl her arm in a cast and sling he wondered how much she had seen how much she would remember the doctors he had consulted had all claimed that if she had witnessed anything she had blocked it she could remember tomorrow five years from tomorrow or never devastation atgravesite there had been other headlines dozens of others lou already had a drawerful didemmamcavoywffnessherbrothers horribledeath sonsdeathrocksdevastation child murdereddurng parents orgy pitualkilling ofrockers baby are mansonf rs responsible garbage lou thought it was all garbage he wondered if pete page managed to shield the mcavoys from the worst of it frustrated he rested his head in his hands and continued to stare at the picture he couldnt pull himself away from the case he was bringing his work home with him now and bringing it home with a vengeance files photos notes littered his desk in the corner of marges tidy living room though he had good men assigned with him he doublechecked all their work he had personally interviewed everyone on the guest list hed been given hed pored over the forensic reports then had gone back again and again to comb through darrens room more than two weeks after the murder and lou had absolutely nothing for amateurs they certainly covered their tracks he thought and they had been amateurs he was certain professionals didnt end up smothering a child that might have been worth a million in ransom nor would they made such a poor attempt to give the illusion of a breakin they had been in the house they had walked right through the front door that was something else lou was sure of that didnt mean their names were on the list page had managed to compile half of southern california could have walked into the house that nightand been given a drink or a joint or whatever party drugs had been available there hadnt been any fingerprints in the boys room not even on the hypodermic needle there were only fingerprints of the mcavoys and their nanny it seemed that beverly mcavoy was an excellent housekeeper the first floor had shown the disorder expected in the aftermath of a party but the second floor the family floor had been clean and ordered marge would have approved he thought as he imagined the rooms no fingerprints no dust no signs of struggle but there had been a struggle a lifeanddeath struggle sometime during it a hand had clamped over darren mcavoys mouth and perhaps inadvertently his nose that struggle had occurred sometime between the time emma had heard her brother cryif indeed she hadand when beverly mcavoy had gone up to check on her son how long had it taken five minutes ten certainly no longer according to the coroner daffen mcavoy had died between two and twothirty am the ambulance call for emma had been logged in at twoseventeen it didnt help lou thought now it didnt help to have the times correlated to have reams of notes and neatly labeled file folders he needed to find just one thing out of place one name that didnt fit one story that didnt jibe he needed to find darren mcavoys killers if he didnt he knew he would forever be haunted by the boys face and his young sisters tearful question was it my fault dad lou jolted then turned to see his son standing behind him tossing a football from hand to hand michael dont sneak up on me like that i didnt michael rolled his eyes when his father turned around again if he slammed doors and walked through the house like a normal person he was being too noisy if he tried to be quiet he was sneaking a guy couldnt win dad he said again hmmm you said youd pass me a few this afternoon when im finished michael michael shifted from foot to foot in his scruffy black sneakers in the past few weeks when im finished had been his fathers standard answer when will you be finished i dont know but ill be finished faster if you dont bother me hell michael thought wisely keeping the oath in his mind nobody had time for anything anymore his best friend was at his stupid grandmothers and his second best friend was sick with the dumb flu or something what good was a saturday if you didnt get to fool around he tried really to take his fathers advice there was the christmas tree to look at and all the presents stacked beneath it michael picked up one with his name on it the one wrapped in the paper with goofy elves dancing all over it he shook it carefully the rattle was only slight but brought tremendous satisfaction he wanted a remotecontrolled plane it had been first on his christmas list and written in capital letters then underlined three times just so his mom and dad knew he was serious he was sure dead sure it was inside that box he set it down again it would be days before he could unwrap it days before he could take it outside and make it do loops and dives he needed something to do now there were baking smells in the kitchen which pleased him but he knew if he wandered in there his mother would rope him into rolling out cookie dough or decorating gingerbread men girl stuff how was he ever supposed to play wide receiver for the la rams if nobody passed him the stupid football for crying out loud and what was so interesting about a bunch of dopey papers and pictures anyway wandering back toward the desk he ran his tongue over the tooth hed chipped the week before while practicing wheelies on his threespeed he liked the fact that his dad was a cop and bragged about it all the time of course when he bragged he had his dad shooting from the hip and locking up crazies like charlie manson for life it would be a sad state of affairs if he had to tell the gang that his father typed out forms and studied files might as well be a librarian theking the football under his arm he leaned over his fathers shoulder he had an idea that if he made a pest of himself his father would push the papers aside and come outside then his gaze fell on the picture of darren mcavoy jeez is that a dead kid michael lou turned but the lecture dried on his tongue as he looked into his sons shocked and fascinated eyes going with instinct he put a hand on michaels shoulder yes wow what happened did he get sick or something no he wondered if he should feel guilty for using the tragedy of one child as a lesson to another he was murdered hes just a little kid people arent supposed to murder little kids no but sometimes they do staring at the police photo michael faced his own mortality for the first time in his whirlwind eleven years why lou remembered telling emma that there were no monsters the longer he looked at what had been done to darren the more certain he was that there were i dont know im trying to find out thats my job to find out having a cop for a father had never stopped michael from embracing the television image of justice at work how do you find out by talking to people studying the evidence thinking a lot sounds boring but he couldnt take his eyes off the picture it is mostlyl michael was glad hed decided to be an astronaut he looked away from the picture and spotted the tabloid his father had just brought home he had a sharp mind and put it together quickly thats brian mcavoys little boy somebody tried to kidnap him or something but he died instead all the kidsre talking about it thats right lou slipped the picture of darren back into a folder wow wow youre working on that case did you get to meet brian mcavoy and everything i met him his father had met brian mcavoy michael could only stare in a kind of dazed awe thats boss really boss did you meet the rest of the group did you talk to them lou shook his head as he began to tidy his papers how simple life was when you were eleven and how simple it should be he added as he ruffled michaels dark untidy hair yes i talked to them they seem very nice nice michael goggled theyre the best the very best wait until i tell the guys i dont want you to tell anyone about this not tell michael pushed a hand through his tousled hair how come the guysll just about fall over dead ive got to tell them no no you dont i want you to keep this to yourself michael but why because some things are personal he glanced back at the glaring headlines or should be personal this is one of them come on he took the football fitted it to his hand lets see if you can catch my bomb pm wateed the sea roll up on the sand even after a month it still surprised him that this house was his the malibu beach house his malibu beach house had everything the real estate broker had promised high soaring ceilings a giant stone fireplace acres of glass in the bedroom upstairs where his lover still slept were twin skylights another fireplace and a balcony that roped around the second story even stevie had been impressed when hed passed through it had given pm a wonderful sense of accomplishment to show off the rooms the tasteful furniture the uptotheminute stereo unit hed had built in but now stevie was in paris johnno was in new york brian was in london and pm felt very much alone there was still talk about a tour when the new album was released that spring but pm wasnt sure brian would be up to it it was nearly two months since that horrible night and brian was still in seclusion he wondered if brian knew that love lost was topping the singles charts and had gone gold he wondered if it would matter to him pm knew the police were no closer to finding out who had killed darren he made it a point to stay in touch with kesselring it was the least he could do for brian and for bev he thought of bev how pale and stricken she had looked on the day of the funeral she hadnt spoken a word not to anyone hed wanted so badly to comfort her he hadnt known how and the fantasy hed had about taking her to bed tenderly loving her until her grief passed had shocked him so much hed been unable to do more than pat her cold rigid hand angie parks came down the circular stairs in a pink tshirt that barely covered her hips shed taken the time to add a bit of makeup a little mascara a touch of lip gloss shed brushed out the knots sleep and sex had tied in her long blond hair then had carefully arranged it to give it a tousled bedroom look the best way to get what you wanted from a man was with sex and she wanted quite a bit from pm she glanced around the big glasswalled living room it was a nice start she decided a very nice start shed like to keep it as a weekend place once shed talked pm into beverly hills that was where stars lived and she had every intention of being a star pm was her steppingstone her romantic liaison with him had already led to a handful of commercials and a nice supporting role in a tv movie she wanted better things bigger things and was willing to keep pm happy to get them she was grateful to him without the interest that had come her way since the press had picked up on their affair she might have had to take a turn doing some porno flicks a girl had to pay the rent angie flexed her wrist so that the light caught the diamonds and sapphires in the bracelet pm had given her she wouldnt have to worry about rent any longer she turned toward the glass doors and saw him standing on the deck as he stood in the early sunlight she thought he looked almost handsome and lonely even a heart as naturally ambitious as angies could feel some pity he hadnt been the same since the little boy had died she was sorry about it really but the tragedy had made pm even more dependent on her and the press was worth its weight in gold a smart woman took whatever opportunities came her way and made the most of them she ran a hand over her breasts pleased that they were firm enough to stand without a bra she walked up behind him pressed them against his back as she wound her arms around his neck i missed you honey he lifted a hand to hers embarrassed that his first thought had been of bev i didnt want to wake you up you know i love it when you wake me up she slipped around him her arms like long soft ropes with a little catchy sigh she closed her mouth over his i hate to see you looking so sad i was just thinking about bri im worried about him youre a good friend honey she played light quick kisses over his face thats one of the things i love most about you he drew her closer as always stunned and delighted to hear her say she loved him she was so beautiful with her big brown eyes and kewpiedoll mouth her breathy voice was like music she played only for him she only pressed closer when he ran his hands up her legs to knead the firm flesh of her buttocks her body was like a dream long and lush and tanned as golden as a peach when she shuddered he felt like a king i need you angie then take me she let her head fall back looking at him from under carefully darkened lashes slowly keeping her eyes on him she reached down and taking the hem of her shirt pulled it up and over her head in the sunlight she stood erotically naked her breasts rosily tipped and as golden as the rest of her he kept his senses long enough to pull her inside the doors before he lowered her to the floor she let him do whatever he liked enjoying most of it adding a few calculated groans and cries when she thought it appropriate it wasnt that he didnt excite her he did in a mild sort of way she would have preferred it if hed been a bit more forceful put a few bruises on her but pms chunky drummers hands were almost reverent as they skimmed over her even when his breath began to chug and the sweat began to roll he treated her like fine glass too considerate to put his frill weight on her too polite even in passion to ram himself into her and make her cries sincere he took her gently with a steady rhythm that brought her just inches from full satisfaction he lay on her only a moment while he collected himself and she studied the glossy wood of the ceiling ever mindful of his weight he rolled aside and cushioned her head with his arm oh that was wonderful she stroked his damp pale chest always practical she knew she could finish herself off when she went upstairs youre the best honey the very best i love you angie he let his hand linger in her hair this was what he wanted he realized all that crazed nameless sex had never been for him he wanted to know when he went on the road that there was someone waiting for him at home or in those miserable hotel rooms he wanted what brian had not bev pm assured himself on a painful twinge of disloyalty but a wife a family a home with angie he could have it all angie will you marry me she went very still it was everything shed hoped for and it was happening she could already see the casting agents scrambling for herand the huge white house in beverly hills the smile lit her face she nearly laughed with it then taking a deep breath she shifted there were tears in her eyes when she looked down at him do you mean it do you really want me ill make you happy angie look i know it cant be easy being married to someone whos part of what im part of the tours and the fans and the press but we can make something for ourselves just the two of us thats ours only ours i love what you are she told him with complete honesty then will you will you marry me and start a family ill marry you she threw her arms around him a family was a different matter altogether she thought as he lowered her to the floor again but as the wife of p m ferguson her career had no place to go but up brim didnt know how much more he could take kicking around the big house day after day sleeping night after night beside a woman who cringed away from his slightest touch he was on the phone nearly every day hoping kesseiring could give him something anything he needed a name a face that he could vent his helpless fury on he had nothing but an empty nursery and a wife who drifted through the house like the ghost of the woman he loved and emma thank god for emma rubbing his hands over his face he pushed back from the table where hed been trying to compose he knew if it hadnt been for emma over the past weeks hed have gone insane she was grieving too silently sadly often he sat up with her long past her bedtime telling her stories singing or just listening they could make each other smile and when they did the pain eased he was terrified every moment she was out of the house even the bodyguards hed hired to see her to school and back again didnt take away the gutknotting fear he felt when she walked out the door and how would he feel when it was time for him to walk out the door no matter how much he missed his son the day would come when he needed to go back to the stag back to the studio back to the music he could hardly tie a sixyearold girl around his waist and haul her with him and there was no leaving her with bev not now and not as brian saw it in the near future mr mcavoy excuse me yes alice they had kept her on though there was no child to nurse she nursed bev now brian thought and dug a cigarette from the pack hed tossed on the table mr page is here to see you brian glanced back at the table the scatter of paper the jumble of lyrics and halfphrases bring him on in here lo bri with one look pete took in the evidence of a man struggling to work without much success balls of paper a cigarette smoldering in an overflowing ashtray the faint scent of liquor though it was barely noon hope you dont mind me popping round i have some business and i didnt think youd care to come in to the office no he reached for the bottle that was never far from his hand have a drink ill hold off a bit thanks he sat trying for an easy smile the mood between them was stiff and uncharacteristically formal no one seemed to know how to behave around brian what questions to ask what questions to avoid hows bev he ventured i dont know remembering his cigarette brian plucked it out from among the butts she wont say very much wont go out at all he let out smoke with a long uneven sigh when he looked at pete there was both a plea and defiance in his eyes the same pete thought as there had been years before when brian had come to him asking for management pete she sits in darrens room for hours at a time even at night sometimes ill wake up and find her in there just sitting in that bloody rocking chair he took a swallow from his glass then another deeper i dont know what the hell to do have you thought of therapy you mean a psychiatrist brian pushed away from the table the ash from his cigarette crumbled onto the rug he was a simple man from simple people problems private problems were handled privately what good would it do for her to talk about her sex life and how she hated her father or some bloody thing its just an idea bri pete reached out a hand then dropped it to the arm of his chair something to think about even if i thought it might help i dont know if i could get her to agree maybe she just needs a bit more time its only been a couple of months hed have been three last week oh jesus saying nothing pete rose to pour more whiskey into brians glass he handed it over then eased brian into a chair do you hear anything from the police i talk to kesselring theyre no closer that makes it worse somehow not knowing who pete sat again they needed to get past this thing all of them and move ahead what about emma the nightmares have stopped and the cast comes off in a few weeks she has school to keep it off her mind but its always there you can see it in her eyes she hasnt remembered any more brian shook his head christ pete i dont know if she saw anything or just had a bad dream its all monsters with emma i want it behind her somehow weve got to put it behind all of us pete paused a moment considering thats one of the reasons im here i dont want to push you bri but the record company would very much like a tour to commence with the release of the new album ive put them off but i wonder if it might not be good for you a tour would mean leaving bev and emma i realize that dont give me an answer now think about it he took out a cigarette lighted it we can go through europe america japan if you and the lads are willing the work might be just what you need to help you through and it would sell plenty of records pete gave a thin smile theres that no pushing an album over the top these days without touring speaking of records i signed that new boy on robert blackpool i think i mentioned him yes you said you had high hopes and so i do youd like his style bri which is why i want you to let him recor on the wing simple surprise had brian pausing before he drank again we always record our own music so you have thus far but its good business all around to expand a bit pete waited a moment gauging brians mood because he sensed it was more responsive than hed expected he pressed on you pulled that particular piece from the last album and it suits blackpool to the ground it wouldnt hurt to have a new artist record a ditty you and johnno turned out in fact in this case itll only enhance your reputations as songwriters i dont know he rubbed his hands over his eyes it didnt seem to matter ill run it by johnno i already have pete smiled hes agreeable if you are brian found bev in darrens rm though it cost him he went inside trying not to look at the empty crib at the toys neatly stacked on the shelves at the huge teddy bear he and bev had bought before darren had been born bev he laid a hand on hers and waited fruitlessly for her to look at him she was too thin the bones in her face were too prominent for elegance now the luster in her eyes her hair her skin was gone he found himself gritting his teeth to keep from grabbing her by the shoulders and shaking her until life bloomed in her again bev i was hoping youd come down and have some tea she could smell the liquor it turned her stomach how could he sit and drink and scribble his music she took her hand from his and laid it in her lap i dont want any tea i have some news pms gotten himself mained she looked at him then a flick of a disinterested glance he was hoping wed come out for a short while hed like to show off his house at the beach and his chesty new wife ill never go back there there was such quick angry violence in her voice he nearly stepped back but it wasnt emotion that stunned him nearly so much as the look in her eyes when they met his loathing what do you want from me he demanded lie bent close gripping both arms of the rocker what the hell do you want just leave me alone i have left you alone ive left you alone to sit in here hour after hour ive left you alone when ive needed so badly just to hold on to you and at night ive left you alone when ive waited for you to turn to me just once to turn to me goddamn you bev he was mine too she said nothing but the tears began when he reached for her she jerked away dont touch me i cant bear it when he backed off she slipped out of the chair to go to the crib you cant bear me to touch you he began as his fury built you cant stand me to took at you or speak to you hour after hour day after day you sit in here as if youre the only one who hurts its time to stop bev its easy for you isnt it she snatched a blanket from the crib to press it to her breasts you can sit and drink and write your music as if nothing happened it is so bloody easy for you no weary he pressed his fingers to his eyes but i cant just stop living hes gone and i cant change it no you cant change it the helpless grief welled up to rub the wound raw you had to have the party that night all those people in our home your family was never enough for you and now hes gone you had to have more more people more music always more and one of those people you let into our home killed my baby he couldnt speak if she had taken a knife and slashed him from heart to gut there might have been less pain certainly less shock they stood with the empty crib between them he didnt let the monsters in emma stood in the doorway her books dangling from their strap her eyes dark against her white skin dad didnt let the monsters in before brian could speak she was rushing down the hall her sobs trailing behind her good job brian managed to say while his jaw clenched and unclenched since you want to be alone ill take emma and go she wanted to call after him but couldnt tired much too tired she sank into the rocker again it took him an hour to calm emma when her tears had put her to sleep he began his calls his decision made he ended with pete were leaving for new york tomorrow he said shortly emma and i well hook up with johnno take a few days i need to find her a good school and arrange security once shes settled and safe well go to california and begin rehearsals fix up the tour pete and make it a long one he took a hard pull of whiskey were ready to rock she doesnt want to go back brian watched emma wander around the rehearsal hall with her new camera hed given it to her during their tearful goodbye at saint catherines academy for girls in upstate new york shed barely been there a month before this springbreak thing johnno reminded him but he felt a twinge for the little girl as she snapped a picture of stevies martin on its stand in the corner give her a bit of time to adjust it seems all we do is adjust it had been eight weeks since hed walked out on bev and he still ached for her the women hed taken since were like a drug the drugs like women both only eased the pain for moments at a time you could call her johnno suggested reading his partners thoughts with the ease of a long relationship no hed considered it more than once but the papers had been full of their separation and his appetite since he doubted if he and bev would have anything to say to each other that wouldnt make things worse my concern nows for emma and the tour bothil be smashing johnno glanced over giving a pointed look toward angie with a few exceptions brian merely shrugged and began to noodle on the piano if she clinches that movie deal shell be out of our hair smarmy little bitch did you see that rock she had pm spring for johnno tilted his head and affected an upperclass accent too too tacky dearie draw the claws as long as pms honkers over her were stuck and weve more to worry about than our little angie he watched stevie come back into the hall he was spending more and more time in the bathroom brian noted and it didnt have anything to do with his bladder whatever stevie had jabbed or swallowed or snorted this time had him flying he stopped by emma to give her a quick swing then picked up his guitar as the amp was off his frantic rill was soundless best to wait until hes down to talk to him about it johnno suggested if you can catch him when he is he started to add something then decided that brian had enough on his mind it would hardly do any good to tell him what hed heard before theyd left new york imagine jane palmer writing a book of course someone else would do the work like putting sentences together still he imagined jane would get a princely sum for it and whatever she said in her little public diary wasnt likely to please brian best to let pete handle it he decided and not hit brian with what was already going on until after the tour emma paid little attention to the rehearsal when it got back into swing shed heard all the songs before dozens of times most of them were from the album her dad and the others had made when theyd been in california before shed been allowed to go to the studio a few times once bev had brought darren she didnt want to think of darren because it hurt too much then she was struck with a miserable wave of guilt because she tried to block him out she missed charlie too shed left him behind in london in darrens crib she hoped bev would take care of him and maybe one day when they went back home bev would talk to her again and laugh as she once had she didnt understand very much about penance but she thought leaving charlie behind was only right then there was school she was certain that having to go to that place so far away from everyone she loved best was her punishment for not taking care of darren as shed promised she remembered being punished before the slaps and shouts it seemed easier she thought now because once the slaps were over so was the punishment there seemed no end to her current banishment dad didnt call it a punishment she mused he said she was going to a good school where she would learn to be smart where she would be safe there were men there to watch her emma hated that they were big silent men with bored eyes not like johnno and the others she wanted to go from city to city with them even if it meant going on airplanes she wanted to stay in hotels and bounce on the beds and order tea from room service but she was going back to school back to the sisters with the kind eyes and firm hands back to morning prayers and grammar lessons she glanced back as her father peeled into soldier blues it was another song about the war its hardedged lyrics set to a harderedged beat she didnt know why it appealed to her perhaps it was pms cymbalcrashing style or stevies frantic bloodpumping guitar but when johnnos voice merged with brians she lifted her camera she liked to take pictures it never occurred to her that the camera was too expensive and difficult to master for a child of her age just as it had never occurred to her that giving it had been a sop to brians guilt for tucking her away in an obscure school emma she turned to study a tall dark man he wasnt one of the bodyguards she realized but there was something familiar about his face then she remembered she smiled a little because he had been kind when hed come to see her in the hospital and he hadnt embarrassed her when shed cried on his shoulder do you remember me lou asked her yes youre the policeman thats right he put a hand on the boy beside him trying to draw his sons attention away from the group rehearsing this is michael i told you about him she brightened even more but was too shy to ask him about rollerskating off rooftops hello hi he gave her a quick glance a fleeting smile it was all he could spare before his eyes were riveted to the four men in the center of the hall we need the horns brian began when he signaled a halt cant get the frill sound without them his heart stopped when he spotted the man beside emma then slywly thickly began beating again lieutenant mr mcavoy after a quick warning glance at his son lou crossed the hall im sorry to interrupt your rehearsal but i wanted to speak to you again and your daughter if possible do you no i have very little to add to what you already know but if i could have a few minutes of your time sure you chaps want to go for lunch ill catch up with you i could hang around johnno offered no brian gave his shoulder a quick squeeze thanks emma caught the look in michaels eyes shed seen the same expression in those of the girls at school when theyd discovered who her father was her lips curved a little she liked his face the slightly crooked nose the clear gray eyes would you like to meet them michael had to wipe his sweaty palms on his jeans yeah thatd be boss i hope you dont mind lou said to brian as he noted that emma had spared him from asking i brought my son along not strictly procedure but i understand brian took a long envious look at the boy as michael beamed up at johnno would darren have been so bright so sturdy at eleven why dont i send him an album the new one wont be released for a couple of weeks yet hell be the hit of the schoolyard thats very kind of you its nothing ive a strong feeling that youve put more time in on what happened to darren than youre required to neither one of us has ninetofive jobs mr mcavoy right i always hated cops he gave a thin smile i guess you do until you really need one ive hired a privatedetective firm lieutenant yes i know it was strange but brian felt the easiness of his own laugh yes i suppose you do they reported to me that youve covered more ground than five cops might in the last months thats the only thing theyve been able to tell me that you havent one would almost think you want them as much as i do he was a beautiful boy mr mcavoy yes by jesus he was he looked down at the guitar still in his hands because he wanted to fling it he set it with exaggerated care on its stand what would you like to talk to me about just a few details id like to go over again i know its repetitious it doesnt matter id also like to talk to emma again the easiness passed as quickly as it had come she cant tell you anything maybe i havent asked the right questions yet brian ran a hand through his hair hed had several inches cut off and was still surprised when his hand ran through it and into air darrens gone and i cant risk emmas state of mind shes delicate at the moment shes only six and for the second time in her life shes been uprooted im sure youve read that my wife and i are separated im sorry its hardest on emma i dont want her upset again i wont push he tabled his idea of suggesting hypnosis enjoying her role as hostess such as it was emma brought michael over to her father dad this is michael hello michael hello finding his tongue tied in knots michael could only grin foolishly do you like music oh yeah ive got lots of your records he wanted desperately to ask for an autograph but was afraid hed seem like a jerk it was great hearing you play and all just about the greatest thanks emma took a picture my dad can send you a copy she said admiring michaels chipped front tooth when lou left leading his reluctant son out of the rehearsal hall he had the beginnings of a headache and a nasty case of frustration hed kept his promise and hadnt pushed emma he hadnt been able to the moment he had mentioned the night her brother had died her eyes had gone blank and her body had stiffened instinct told him she had seen or heard something but her memory of that night was already bluffed it was peopled with monsters and snarling shadows he didnt care to admit that breaking the case depended on a terrified sixyearold whose memory of that night according to the psychologists hed interviewed might never return there was still the pizza man lou thought grimly it had taken him two days to locate the right shop and the clerk whod been working the graveyard shift hed remembered the order for fifty pizzas and had considered it a joke but hed also remembered the name of the person whod placed the order tom fletcher a session musician who played both alto and tenor sax had had a yen for pizza that night it had taken weeks to track him down and weeks more to put through the paperwork to bring the musician back from his gig in jamaica lou preferred pinning his hopes there whoever had been in darrens room hadnt come back down the main stairs or climbed out of the window that left the kitchen stairs where tom fletcher had been trying to convince the night clerk to deliver fifty pizzas with everything hey dad that was the best michael dragged his feet on the sidewalk to give himself a few more moments he pulled open the door of his fathers chevelle craning his neck to look at the upper windows of the building at his back the guys are going to go nuts when i tell them its okay to tell them now right everybody knows youve got the case yeah lou pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger he wasnt sure if the headache had been brought on by tension or the furious pulse of music everybody knows hed burrowed his way through a trio of press conferences how come they got all those security guards michael wanted to kncrw what guards those as his father settled into the drivers seat michael pointed to the four darksuited broadshouldered men near the entrance of the building how do you know theyre guards come on michael rolled his eyes you can always tell cops even rentacops lou wasnt sure if he should wince or laugh he wondered how his captain would feel if he knew the average elevenyearold could make an undercover cop th keep people from hassling them maybe hurting them and the little girl lou added someone might try to kidnap her jeez you mean theyve got to have guards all the time yes bummer michael murmured sincerely no longer sure he wanted to pursue the idea of becoming a rock star id hate to have people watching me all the time i mean how could you have any secrets its tough as his father pulled away from the curb michael cast one last look over his shoulder can we go to mcdonalds yeah sure i guess she doesnt get to do that much what the little kid emma i guess she doesnt get to go to mcdonalds no lou ruffled his boys hair i guess not it took only a few minutes to get michael settled in with a cheeseburger fries and a shake lou left his son in the booth to call in from the phone outside the window he could see michael dousing more ketchup on the burger kesselring he said ill be in the station in an hour i got some bad news for you lou what else is new its fletcher your pizza man didnt he make it into la yeah he made it in sent a couple of uniforms to pick him up this morning for questioning seems they were about six hours too late hed been dead that long shit looks like a standard d he had the works and some topgrade heroin were waiting on the coroners report thats great thats tucking great he slammed a hand against the wall of the booth hard enough to make a mother hurry her three children by have the lab boys been over his hotel room top to bottom give me the address he fumbled for his notebook i have to drop my kid at home after that ill have a look lou noted it down swore again and banged the receiver he opened the door then to give himself a moment leaned against it through the window he could see his son cheerfully plowing through the cheeseburger saint catherines academy two more weeks emma thought iwo more long boring rotten weeks and shed be out for the summer shed be able to see her father and johnno and the rest shed be able to breathe without being told she was breathing for god shed be able to think without being warned about impure thoughts as far as she could see the nuns must be full of impure thoughts or else they wouldnt be so sure everyone else had them she would be going back to the real world for a few precious weeks new york emma closed her eyes a moment trying to bring its noise its smells its life into her quiet room with a sigh she propped her elbows on her desk slouching in a way that would have made sister mary alice crack her ruler she didnt bend over the french verbs she was supposed to conjugate but looked out over the green lawns to the high stone walls that closed the school off from the sinful world not all the sinful world she thought she was full of sin and was grateful her roommate marianne carter was equally blighted her days at saint catherines would have been torture without marianne she grinned as she thought of her funny freckled redheaded roomie and best friend marianne was sinful all right and was even now doing penance for her latest transgression the caricature marianne had sketched of mother superior was worth a couple of hours scrubbing bathrooms if it hadnt been for marianne she might have run away though where she would have run she hadnt a clue there was really only one place she wanted to go and that was to her father and he would have shipped her right back it wasnt fair she was nearly thirteen nearly a real teenager and she was stuck in this antiquated school conjugating verbs reciting catechism and dissecting frogs gross it wasnt that she hated the nuns well she admitted perhaps she did hate sister immaculate the warden but who wouldnt hate someone with a pruny mouth a wart on her chin and a fondness for giving young girls extra chores for the teeniest infractions but dad had only been amused when shed told him about sister immaculate she missed him she missed all of them she wanted to go home but she wasnt sure where home would be often she thought about the house in london the castle where she had been so happy for such a short time she thought about bev and hated it that her father never spoke of her even though they had never divorced emma thought some of the girls at school had parents that were divorced but you werent supposed to talk about it she still thought of daffen her sweet little brother sometimes she could barely remember how he had looked how he had sounded but when she dreamed of him his face his voice were as clear as life she remembered almost nothing about the night he had died nuns tended to drum such pagan nonsense as monsters out of young girls heads but again if she dreamed of that night as she did when she was ill or upset she remembered the terror of walking down the dark hall the sounds all around the dark monsters holding darren as he cried and struggled she remembered falling and when she awoke she would remember nothing at all marianne came through the door in an exaggerated stagger she held out her hands ruined she dropped backward onto her bed what french count would want to kiss them now rough going emma asked struggling not to grin five bathrooms disgusting ugh when i get out of this joint im going to have a housekeeper for my housekeeper she rolled over on her stomach crossing her ankles in the air emma only smiled enjoying the sound of mariannes brisk american voice i heard mary jane witherspoon talking to teresa omalley shes going to do it with her boyfriend when she goes home this summer who i dunno his names chuck or huck or something no i mean mary jane or teresa mary jane you dork shes sixteen and built emma frowned down at her own flat chest she wondered if shed have boobs to speak of when she hit sixteen and if shed have a boyfriend to do it with what if she gets pregnant like susan did last spring oh mary janes folks would fix it up theyve got piles of money anyway shes got something a diaphragm everyone has a diaphragm not that kind dummy its birth control oh as always emma was ready to defer to mariannes greater knowledge you put it in you know inside the sacred vault with jelly and it kills off the sperm you cant get knocked up with dead sperm marianne rolled over to yawn at the ceiling i wonder if sister immaculata ever did it the thought was enough to bring emma completely out of the dumps i dont think so im pretty sure she bathes in her habit holy hell i nearly forgot marianne rolled again and digging into the pocket of her rumpled uniform pulled out a halfpack of marlboros i struck gold in the secondfloor john she scrambled up to search through her underwear drawer for a pack of matches somebody had them taped to the back of the tank and you took them the lord helps those who help themselves i helped myself lock the door emma they shared one blowing little puffs of smoke out the open window neither enjoyed the taste particularly but gamely dragged on it was adult and sinful two things both of them craved rvo more weeks emma said dreamily youre going to new york theyre sending me to camp again it wont be so bad sister immaculata wont be there thats something marianne tried to adopt a sophisticated pose with the cigarette im going to try to talk them into letting me stay with my grandmother for a couple of weeks shes pretty cool ill take lots of pictures marianne nodded thinking further ahead when we get out of this village or la someplace cool ill be an artist and youll be a photojournalist well have parties the biggest and well wear all kinds of gorgeous clothes she held out the hem of her uniform no plaids id rather die its only four more years emma turned to gaze out the window it was hard to think in terms of years when she wasnt sure how to get through the next two weeks aconnnent away michael kesselring studied himself in cap and gown he couldnt believe it it was finally over high school was behind him and life was just around the next bend there was college of course but that was a summer away he was eighteen old enough to drink to vote and thanks to president carter had no military draft to interrupt his plans whatever they were he thought he hadnt a clue what he wanted to do with the life that was ahead of him his parttime job at buzzards tee shirt shop was mainly for gas and date money he had no intention of spending his life screenprinting tshirts but just what he would do was still a cloudy mystery it was a little scary taking off the cap and gown like shedding his youth he held them both in his hands as he scanned his room it was cluttered with clothes mementos record albums and since his mother had long since given up on cleaning it herself his cache of playboys there were the letters hed earned in track and baseball the letters he remembered that had convinced rose anne markowitz to climb into the backseat of his secondhand pinto and do it to the tune of joe cockers feeling alght hed been blessed with a tough athletic body long legs and quick reflexes like his father his mother was fond of saying he supposed in some way he took after the old man though their relationship had had its share of battles over hair length wardrobe politics curfews captain kesselring was a stickler came from being a cop michael supposed he remembered being careless enough once to bring a single joint into the house hed been grounded for a month and a few lousy speeding tickets had cost him just as dearly the law was the law old lou was fond of saying michael thought now thank god he himself had no intention of being a cop he took the tassel from the cap before tossing it and the gown onto his unmade bed maybe it was sentimental to keep it but nobody had to know he routed through his dresser drawers for the old cigar box that held some of his most valued possessions the love letter lori spiker had written him in his junior yearbefore shed dumped him for a biker with a harley and tatoos the ticket stub from the rolling stones concert he had after a lot of blood and sweat convinced his parents to let him attend the pop top from his first illegal beer he grinned and pushing it aside found the snapshot of himself and brian mcavoy the little girl had kept her word michael thought the picture had arrived in the mail only two weeks after the incredible day his dad had taken him to meet devastation the new album had come with it the hotoffthepresses copy he had been the envy of his contemporaries for weeks michael thought back to that day the almost unendurable excitement hed felt the sweaty armpits he hadnt thought about that day in a long time now perhaps because of his newly acquired adult status it occurred to him that it had been a terrific thing for his father to do and uncharacteristic not that the old man couldnt come up with terrific things but he had gone to the rehearsal hall on police business captain lou kesselring never mixed police business and personal pleasures but he had that day michael thought it was strange but now that he was remembering it all he could picture his father dragging home files night after night as far as michael could recollect his father had never brought home work that way before or since the little boy brian mcavoys little boy had been murdered it had been in all the papers and still cropped up from time to time perhaps because the police had never solved the case his fathers case michael recalled that had been the year michael had been named mvp on his little league team and his father had missed most of the games and a lot of dinners it had been a long time ago michael mused but he wondered if his father ever thought about brian mcavoy and his dead son or the little girl who had taken the picture some people said that shed seen what had happened to her brother and had gone crazy but she hadnt looked crazy when michael had met her he remembered her only vaguely as a slight girl with pale hair and big sad eyes and a soft prettily accented voice he recalled now a voice a lot like her fathers poor kid he thought as he placed the tassel over the snapshot he wondered what had ever happened to her emma couldnt believe her time was almost up in less than a week she would head back to new york and saint catherines true she missed marianne it would take weeks for them to talk through all the things that had happened over the summer the best summer of her life even though theyd only spent two weeks of it in new york theyd flown to london to film part of a recording session for a new documentary and had had tea at the ritz just as she and bev had so many years before shed been able to spend time with johnno and stevie and pm listening to them play eating fish and chips in the kitchen while they discussed their next album shed taken rolls of pictures and could hardly wait to store them in her photo album where she could look at them over and over and relive the memories her father had treated her to her first grownup salon session as an early birthday gift now her shoulderlength hair was permed in corkscrew curls that made her feel very grownup and she was starting to develop emma took a quick surreptitious look down at her bikini top they werent much as breasts went but at least she wouldnt be as easily mistaken for a boy and she was tanned emma hadnt been too certain she would enjoy spending her last weeks in california but the tan made it worthwhile and there was the surfing shed had to launch a major campaign before brian had agreed to let her try her hand at shooting the waves emma knew she had johnno to thank for the bright red board if he hadnt joked and teased brian into it she would still be whiling away her hours on the beach watching everyone else skim the water maybe she couldnt do much more than paddle out and fall in but at least the process took her farther away from the bodyguards who sweated under nearby beach umbrellas it was ridiculous she thought as she carried her board toward the water no one even knew who she was each year she was sure her father would let them go and each year they remained with their solemn faces and big shoulders at least they couldnt follow her out here she thought as she stretched out on her board and began to paddle through the cool water though she knew they watched her through binoculars she pretended she was alone or better with one of the groups of teenagers who haunted the beaches she crested over a wave enjoying the swells and the way her stomach seemed to dip with the motion the roar of the sea was in her ears mixed with the riot of music from dozens of portable radios she watched a tall boy in navy trunks catch a curl and ride it smoothly to shoreand envied him both his skill and his freedom if she couldnt have the second emma decided she would work on developing the first she waited with the edgy patience of a surfer watching for the right wave sucking in her breath she brought herself up to a crouch on the board then stood and with the faith of the young let the roll take her she was up for nearly ten seconds before she overbalanced when she surfaced she saw the boy in the navy trunks glance her way tossing his wet dark hair out of his face with a careless hand pride had her struggling back onto the board she tried again and again each time lasting only seconds before the wave snatched the board from under her feet and sent her flying each time she dragged herself back on the board and with muscles aching paddled and waited she imagined the bodyguards sipping their warming drinks and discussing how clumsy she was each failure became a public humiliation and made her only more determined to succeed just once just once to ride the wave all the way to shore her leg muscles trembled as she pushed herself up she could see the wave curling toward her the glassy bluegreen tunnel the dancing white froth she wanted it needed it just one rideone success completely and totally her own she caught it her heart slammed into her throat as she skimmed along the pipe she could see the beach rushing toward her the glint of the binocular lens the drum of water was like music in her head in her heart for an instant she tasted it freedom the tower of water closed in behind her shoving her off the board tossing it and her up one moment she was in the sun the next she was tumbling in the wall of water it slammed her knocking away her breath sending her wheeling arms and legs flailing like rubber lungs burning she struggled to break the surface she could see it shimmering above her but the power of the water dragged her deeper viciously pitching her she clawed at the water then was plunged down gyrating helplessly until the surface was below her and just as out of reach as her strength failed she wondered giddily if she should pray the act of contrition floated dreamily through her brain oh my god i am heartily sorry for having offended thee as she was sucked back sucked down the prayer faded and music seemed to fill her head come together right now over me panic stabbed through her it was dark dark and the monsters were back her efforts to reach the surface were only wild flailings now she opened her mouth to scream and gagged there were hands on her and in her terror she fought them beat at them as the water beat at her it was the monster the one who had smiled at her the one who wanted to kill her as it had killed darren as an arm hooked around her throat red balls danced in front of her eyes they faded to gray as she broke the surface just relax someone was telling her ill get you in just hang on and relax she was choking emma started to drag at the arm around her throat before she realized it wasnt cutting off her air she could see the sun and when she dragged in a painful breath it was air that burned her throat not water she was still alive the tears started as much in shame as in gratitude youre going to be okay she laid a hand on the arm around her i wiped out she managed there was a chuckle quick and a little breathless big time but man you had a hell of a ride first yes she had she realized and concentrated on not humiliating herself further by being sick then there was sand hot and rough on her skin she let her rescuer lay her down but the first faces she saw were of her bodyguards too weak to speak she sent them a furious look it didnt make them back off but it kept them from coming closer dont try to stand up for a few minutes emma turned her head coughed up some seawater there was musicthe eagles she thought groggily hotel california there had been music before in the dark but she couldnt remember the words now or the melody she coughed again blinked against the dazzle of sunlight then focused on her savior the boy in the navy trunks she thought and managed a weak smile water was dripping from his dark hair his eyes were dark too rich deep gray as clear as lake water thanks sure he settled down beside her feeling awkward in the role of white knight the guys would razz him for weeks but he couldnt bring himself to just leave her there she was only a kid after all a greatlooking kid he thoughtthen felt still more awkward he gave her shoulder a brotherly pat and thought she had the biggest bluest eyes hed ever seen i guess i lost my board he shielded his eyes with the flat of his hand as he looked out to sea no freds bringing it in its a nice board i know ive only had it for a couple of weeks yeah ive seen you around he glanced back down at her shed risen up on her elbows and her wet curls tumbled down her back her voice was pretty he thought sort of soothing and musical you english or something irish for the most part well be here only a few more days she sighed as the boy named fred dragged in her board thanks not knowing what else to say she concentrated on rubbing the wet sand from her knee the boy in the navy trunks gave fred and the others who had gathered around a friendly wave that sent them about their business when my father hears about this hell never let me surf again why does he have to hear about it he always does she made a concentrated effort not to look at her bodyguards everybody wipes out beautiful eyes he thought again then looked deliberately out to sea you were doing pretty good really she colored a bit youre wonderful ive watched you thanks he grinned and showed a chipped tooth emma stared at him as memory came flooding back youre michael yeah his grin widened howd you know you dont remember me she pushed herself up to sit met you well it was a long time ago im emma emma mcavoy your father brought you to the rehearsal hall one afternoon mcavoy michael dragged a hand through his dripping hair brian mcavoy as he said the name he saw emma take a quick look round to see if anyone had heard him i remember you you sent me a picture ive still got it his eyes narrowed as he glanced over his shoulder so thats what theyre doing here he murmured studying the guards i thought they were narcs or something bodyguards she said dully then shrugged it off my father worries yeah i bet he remembered clearly the police photograph of a little boy it left him with nothing else to say i remember your father she began to draw idle circles in the sand he came to the hospital to see me after we lost my brother hes a captain now michael said for lack of anything else thats nice shed been raised to be polite under any circumstances youll tell him i said hello wont you sure they ran out of things to say so that the whoosh of the waves filled the gaps ah listen do you want a coke or something she looked up dazzled to be asked it was the first time in her life she had had more than a fiveminute conversation with a boy men certainly her life had been frill of men but being asked to have a coke with a boy only a few years her senior was a wonderful and beady experience she nearly agreed before she remembered therds she couldnt bear them watching thanks but id better go dad was going to pick me up in a couple of hours but i dont think im up to any more surfing today ill have to call him i could take you he made a restless movement with his shoulders it was stupid to feel so tonguetied with a kid but he couldnt remember being more nervous since hed asked nancy brimmer to the ninthgrade valentines dance give you a ride home he continued as emma stared at him if you want you probably have something you want to do no not really he wanted to meet her father again emma decided after one ecstatic moment a boy like himwhy he must have been at least eighteenwouldnt be interested in her but the daughter of brian mcavoy was different she drummed up another smile as she got to her feet he had saved her life if seeing her father was the only payment she could make then she would make it id like a ride if its not too much trouble no big deal he caught himself before he shifted his feet in the sand she probably thought he was a jerk ill just be a minute she rushed off in the direction of the guards snatching up her beach wrap and bag on the way my friend is giving me a ride home she said in her most dismissive tone miss mcavoy the guard named masters cleared his throat it would be better if you called your father theres no need to bother him the second guard sweeney mopped his sweaty forehead your father wouldnt like you taking rides from strangers michaels not a stranger the haughty tone made her feel nasty inside but she would not could not be humiliated in front of michael i know him and so does my father michaels father is a captain on the police force here she pulled the long rainbowcolored tshirt over her suit youll be following behind us so what does it matter she turned and keeping her head up walked back to where michael waited with their boards hold it sweeney put a hand on masterss shoulder lets give the kid a break she dont get many michaels gas gauge was hovering dangerously close to empty when he pulled up at the high iron gates in beverly hills he saw the faint surprise on the guards face before the switch was thrown and the gates swung inward he was sorry as he drove down the treelip drive that he had nothing but scruffy sandals and his old track jer to wear with his bathing trunks the house was all pink stone and white marble four towering stories of it that took up more than an acre of the trim green lawn double arched doors of etched glass stood at the entrance he wasnt sure if he should be amused or impressed by the peacock that strutted across the grass nice place its pms really or pms wifes emma found herself faintly embarrassed by the lifesized marble lions that flanked the entrance it used to belong to someone in the cinemai can never remember whobut angie did it all over anyway shes in europe filming so were staying a few weeks have you got time to come in ah yeah i got time he frowned down at the sand clinging to his feet if youre sure its okay of course it is she stepped out of the car the same chevelle that lou had once driven to the rehearsal hall she waited for michael to unstrap her board from the roof then started up the steps ill have to tell dad what happened the guards will anyhow i hope you dont mind if i well make it sound minor you know sure he grinned at her again making her young heart flutter parents always overreact i guess they cant help it he heard the music the moment she opened the door a piano a series of thunderous chords then an experimental noodling of notes and the chords again emma took her board from him to prop it against the wall theyre back here after a moments hesitation she took michaels hand and led him down the wide white hallway hed never seen a house like it though he was too embarrassed to say so arched doorways opened on room after room where abstract paintings were slashes of frantic color against white walls even the floors were white so that michael was unable to shake the feeling he was walking through some kind of temple then he saw the goddess the portrait of the goddess above a fireplace of white stone she was blond and sulkymouthed wearing a white sequined dress that skimmed dangerously over the globes of her lush breasts wow thats angie emma told him her nose wrinkled quickly automatically shes mained to pm yeah he had the oddest feeling that the portraits eyes were alive and fixed on him hungrily i ah saw her last movie he didnt add that after he had hed experienced fascinating and uncomfortably erotic dreams man shes something yes she is and even at notquite thirteen emma was aware what that something was she gave michaels hand an impatient tug then continued on it was the only room emma felt at ease inthe only room in the mausoleum of a house where she imagined pm had been given a chance to express his own taste there was color here a mixmatch of blues and reds and sunny yellows music awards lined the mantel gold records dotted the walls there were a couple of thriving plants near the window a pair of lemon trees that emma knew pm had started from seed her father was seated at a beautiful old baby grand that had been in a movie whose title always escaped emma johnno sat beside him smoking his habitual french cigarettes there was a litter of papers on the floor a big pitcher of lemonade sprinkled with condensation on the coffee table the glasses ice melting lazily inside them were already leaving a duo of rings on the wood well keep it moving through the bridge brian was saying as he pounded out chords keep it fast overlap the strings and horns but keep the guitar the dominant force fine but its still the wrong beat johnno brushed brians hands aside his diamonds winked on each pinky as he moved them over the keys brian took out a cigarette flipping it through his fingers i hate you when youre right dad he looked up the smile came first then faded as he focused on michael emma you were supposed to ring if you wanted to come back early i know but i met michael her lips curved charmingly so that her dimple flashed i wiped out and he helped me get my board because she wanted to leave it at that she hurried on and i thought youd like to meet him again there was something enormously disturbing about seeing his girl his little girl standing with her hand in the hand of a boy who was nearly a man again dont you remember his father brought him to a rehearsal his father the policeman kesselring the muscles in brians stomach clenched youre michael kesseiring yes sir he wasnt sure if it was proper to extend his hand for a shake with a music giant so stood rubbing his palms on his sandy trunks i was like eleven when i met you before it was great he was too used to being on stage under the lights to let the ache show he looked at michael tall dark sturdy and saw not lou kesselrings son but the potential of his own lost little boy but he smiled as he stood up from the piano its nice to see you again you remember michael johnno sure ever talk your old man into that electric guitar yeah michael grinned flattered to be remembered i took itssons awhile but they gave me up as hopeless i play the harmonica some though why dont you get michael a coke emma brian dropped to the arm of a chair gesturing to the couch the glint of his wedding ring caught a sliver of light have a seat i dont want to interrupt your work we live to be interrupted johnno told him mellowing the sarcasm with a smile whatd you think of the song it was great everything you do is great johnnos brow lifted not so much in sarcasm now as amusement heres a smart boy bri maybe we should keep him michael grinned unsure if he should be embarrassed no really i like all your stuff not into disco disdo sucks a very smart boy johnno decided so howd you come to meet our emma on the beach he continued talking knowing brian needed another moment to adjust she had a little trouble with a wave and i helped her out he breezed over the incident with the skill of a teenager used to outwitting adults shes got pretty good form mr mcavoy just needs more practice brian managed another smile and toyed with his warm lemonade you surf a lot every chance i get hows your father hes cool hes a captain now id heard you must be out of high school by now yes sir i graduated in june going on well yeah i thought id give college a shot my fathers counting on it johnno pulled out his cigarettes carelessly offering one to michael he took it and the first pull of the strong exotic smoke had his stomach bouncing so johnno asked mildly amused do you plan to follow in your fathers flat feet isnt that what they call cops he continued flat foots oh michael tried another small experimental puff on the gauloise i dont think im cut out to be a cop dad hes great at it patient you know like with your sons case he worked on that for years even after the department closed the files he caught himself appalled that hed brought it up hes like dedicated he finished weakly yes he is more at ease brian smiled the charming heart warming smile that made his fans love him he wished hed added rum to the lemonade youll give him my best wont you sure it was with great relief that michael saw emma bringing in cold drinks on a tray an hour later emma walked him back to his car i want to thank you for not telling dad how stupid i was today no big deal yes it was he gets upset she gazed out to the high stone walls that surrounded the estate wherever she went there were walls i think hed put me in a bubble if he could the urge to touch her hair was so strong so unexpected that hed lifted his hand before he caught himself and brushed it through his own it must be tough with what happened to your brother and everything hes always afraid afraid someone will try to take me too arent you no i dont think so the guards are always there so ive never had a chance to be really he hesitated one hand on the door handle it wasnt like he was stuck on her or anything he told himself she was just a kid maybe ill see you at the beach tomorrow a womans heart fluttered in her young chest maybe i could give you some pointers on the boardyou know help you with your form that would be great he got in fiddling with the keys before starting the engine thanks for the coke and everything it was really far out getting to meet your dad again and all any time goodbye michael yeah see you he drove down the treelined drive nearly steering onto the lawn because he was watching her in the rearview mirror he went back to the beach every day but he never saw her there again that summer they md an hour before bed check an hour before sister immaculata shuffled her way down the halls in her black sensible shoes to poke her disapproving warty nose in each of the rooms to make sure all music was off and clothes were neatly hung in closets they had an hour and emma was afraid it was going to be enough time are they numb yet i dont think so marianne narrowed her eyes as she tapped her foot along with her latest billy joel album she was convinced he was right catholic girls did start much too late emma youve had that ice on your ears for twenty minutes you should have frostbite by now ice was melting cold down her wrists but she kept it firmly against her ears are you sure you know what youre doing of course i do mariannes hips swayed in her prim cotton nightgown as she walked to the mirror there she admired the little gold balls in her newly pierced ears i watched every move my cousin made when she did mine she switched to an exaggerated german accent und ve have all de instruments ice needle gleefully she held it up so it glinted in the lamplight the potato we ripped off from the kitchen lwo quick jabs and your dull dreary ears become sophisticated emma kept her eye on the needle she was searching for a way out ears and pride intact i never asked dad if it was all right jesus emma ear piercings a personal choice youve got your period youve got your boobssuch as they are she added with a grin that makes you a woman she wasnt sure she wanted to be a woman if it meant having her best friend stick a needle in her earlobe i dont have any earrings i told you you can borrow some of mine ive got scads come on lets see that british stiff upper lip right having a deep breath emma took the ice from one ear dont screw up me marianne knelt by the chair to draw a tiny x on emmas earlobe with a purple felttip pen listen just in case i miss and drive this into your brain can i have your record collection then she giggled held the potato behind emmas ear and plunged it was a tossup as to who was more queasy god marianne tucked her head between her knees at least my parents dont have to worry about me becoming a drug addict shooting up must be disgusting emma slid bonelessly out of the chair you didnt say id feel it as her stomach roiled she concentrated on keeping very still and breathing oh gross you didnt say id hear it i didnt but then marcia and i had swiped a bottle of bourbon from daddys bar i guess we werent feeling or hearing anything she lifted her head focused there was blood just a drop of it on emmas earlobe but it made her think of the slasher movie she and her cousin had seen over the summer weve got to do the other one emma just closed her eyes oh christ you cant go around with one ear pierced weve come this far emma her hands were clammy as she clipped the needle free of the thread and prepared it for round two ive got the hard part just lie there gritting her teeth marianne aimed and fired emma only groaned and slid the rest of the way to the floor its over now you have to clean them with peroxide so they dont get infected and keep your hair over them so none of the sisters notice for a while when the door opened both girls struggled up but it wasnt sister immaculate teresa louise alcott the bright and annoying girl from across the hall popped in wearing her pink cotton robe and feather mules whats going on were having an orgy marianne flopped down again dont you ever knock teresa only grinned she was one of the feverishly pert girls who volunteered for everything always completed her assignments and wept at the stations of the cross marianne detested her on principle being thickskinned as well as pert teresa considered the insults signs of friendship wow youre getting your ears pierced she knelt down to study the strings dangling from emmas lobes mother superiorll have a cat why dont you have a cat teresa marianne suggested in your own room but teresa only grinned and sat back on her heels did it hurt emma opened her eyes and wished teresa to everlasting hell no it felt great mariannes going to do my nose next you can watch teresa ignored the sarcasm and studied her newly manicured fingernails id love to have mine done maybe after sister immaculata comes through you could do it i dont know teresa marianne pushed herself up to change the record to bruce springsteen i havent finished my report on silas mamer i was going to work on it tonight mines done thresa smiled her pert smile if you do my ears ill give you my notes marianne moved her shoulders as if debating well okay then great wow i almost forgot why i came over she dug into the deep pocket of her frilly pink robe and pulled out a magazine article my sister sent this to me because she knows i go to school with you emma she cut it out of people have you ever seen that magazine its just great it has pictures of everybody they have like robert redford on the cover and burt reynolds all the hunks ive seen it emma said because she knew it was the only way to shut teresa up sure you have because your dads been in there lots of times anyway i knew youd just be dying to see it so i brought it over because her stomach had settled emma propped herself up then took the article the nausea came back with a vengeance eternal trmgle there was bev rolling on the floor with another woman and dad with a look of stunned fury on his face reaching down for her bevs dress was ripped and there was a kind of wild anger in her eyes the same kind emma remembered as had been there the last time shed seen her i knew youd want it teresa was saying cheerfully so i brought it over thats your mother isnt it my mother emma murmured staring at bevs picture the blond lady in the glittery dress wow id just die to have a dress like that jane palmer shes your mother right jane she focused on the other woman now the old fear came back just as real just as ripe as it had been ten years before just as stunning as it had been when another girl had shown her a smuggledin copy of devastated with janes picture on the back cover it was jane bev was fighting with her and dad was there what could they have been fighting about hope flashed through the fear perhaps dad and bev were together perhaps they would all be together again she shook her head to clear it and focused on the text those of the british upper crust who paid two hundred pounds a head for salmon mousse and champagne at a charity dinner at the mayfair in london got more than their moneys worth beverly wilson successful decorator and estranged wife of brian mcavoy of devastation went head to head with jane palmer mcavoys former lover and author of the bestselling romana clef devastated what prompted the hairpulling match is up for speculation but sources say the old rivalry has never cooled down jane palmer is the mother of mcavoys daughter emma age thirteen emma mcavoy who inherited her fathers poetic looks attends a private school somewhere in the states beverly wilson who has been estranged from mcavoy for several years was the mother of mcavoys only son daffen the child was tragically murdered seven years ago in a case that still baffles police mcavoy did not attend the function with either miss palmer or miss wilson but with his current flame singer doly cates though mcavoy separated the wrestlers personally few words were exchanged between wilson and mcavoy before she left with date p m ferguson drummer for the veteran rock group neither mcavoy nor wilson were available for comment on the incident but palmer claims she will include the scene in her new book to borrow mcavoys own lyrics it seems old fires run hot and run long there was more talk about others who had attended and the comments they made about the incident there was a description of the clothes and a tongueincheek remark about what both jane and bev had worn and torn off each other but she didnt read any further didnt need to its neat isnt it the way they were ripping each others dresses right out in public teresas eyes shone with excitement do you think they were fighting over your father hes so dreamy i bet they were its just like in the movies yeah since strangling ttresa would only get her suspended marianne vetoed it there were other subtler ways to deal with idiots she picked up the needle shed pierce teresas flappy ears all right and if she forgot the ice it was an honest mistake youd better get going teresa sister immaculates going to be coming through any minute with a little squeal thresa sprang up she didnt want to spoil her perfect record with a demerit come over at ten and ill give you the notes then you can do it fine teresa put her hands on her earlobes i cant wait neither can i she waited until the door closed little shit she muttered then moved over to drape an arm around emmas shoulders you okay it never goes away she stared at the picture it was a good one she thought dispassionately well focused well lit the faces werent blurred the expressions quite clear it was easy all too easy to see the hate in her mothers eyes do you think i could be like her like who my mother come on emma you

satisfied marianne plopped down again if you dont remember her you cant be like her it sounded logical and she needed to believe it i dont look like her wanting to judge fairly marianne took up the article and studied the pictures not a bit youve got your fathers bone structure and coloring like it from an artist emma lifted a hand to her tender lobes are you really going to pierce teresas ears you betwith the dullest needle i can find want to do one emma grinned stevie had never been so scared there were bars all around and the steady drip drip drip of a faucet somewhere down the hall voices were raised occasionally and echoed there was the shuffling of feet then the godawful silence he needed a fix his body was trembling sweating his stomach was knotted refusing to let him release the nausea in the scarred porcelain john in the corner his nose and eyes were running it was the flu he told himself he had the freaking flu and theyd locked him up he needed a bloody doctor and theyd shut him up and left him to rot sitting on the cot he brought his knees up to his chest pushing his back into the wall he was stevie nimmons he was the greatest guitarist yf his generation he was somebody but they had put him in a cage like an animal they had locked him up and walked away didnt they know who he was what hed made himself he needed a fix oh jesus just one sweet fix then hed be able to laugh this off it was cold it was so goddamn cold he yanked the blanket from the cot and huddled under it and he was thirsty his mouth was so dry he couldnt even work up enough spit to swallow someone would come he thought as his eyes began to fill someone would come and make it all right again someone would fix it oh god he needed a fix his mother would come and tell him everything had been taken care of it hurt he began to weep against his knees as the pain wracked through him every breath he took seemed to hold tiny slivers of glass his muscles were on fire his skin like ice just one just one toke one hit one line and hed be all right again didnt they know who the fuck he was stevie he heard his name with eyes bleary with tears he looked toward the cell door dragging the back of his hand over his mouth he struggled to focus he tried to laugh but the sound came out in a whooping sob as he struggled up pete pete could fix it he tripped over the blanket and lay sprawled on the floor a moment as pete watched him stevies body was stickthin his legs angled awkwardly out from it and ended in fivehundredpound snakeskin boots his face as he pushed himself up was gray and pasty with lines dug deep and dug hard the whites of his eyes were streaked fiery red there was a trickle of blood from his lip where he had hit the floor and he stank man im sick he began to pull himself up hand over sweaty hand on the bars i got the flu the junkie flu pete thought dispassionately you got to get me out stevie wrapped his trembling fingers around the bars though his breath was stale pete didnt back away its tucking crazy they came into my house into my goddamn house like a bunch of bloody nazis they waved some kind of paper in front of my face and started pulling out drawers jesus pete they dragged me in here like i was some kind of freaking murderer they put handcuffs on me he began to cry again and wiped his nose with the back of his hand people were watching when they took me out of my own house with handcuffs on me they were taking pictures it aint fucking right pete it aint tucking right you got to get me out during the outburst pete had stayed very still his voice was low and calm hed handled crises before and knew how to turn them in his favor they found heroin stevie and whats politely called drug paraphernalia theyre going to charge you with possession just get me the tick out are you listening to me the question whipped out cool and quiet they found enough in your place to put you away it was planted somebody set me up somebody dont bullshit me his eyes hardened but whatever disgust he felt he kept carefully inside you have two choices you can go to jail or you can go into a clinic ive got a right youve got no rights here youre messed up stevie if you want me to help you youre going to do exactly what i tell you just get me out stevie sank to the floor and folded into himself just get me out how long will he have to stay in bev poured the chilled pouilly fume into glasses three months johnno watched her pleased that the old bev wasnt buried too deeply in the newer sleeker model im not sure how pete pulled it off nor do i think i want to know but if stevie spends his time in the whitehurst clinic he wont stand trial im glad he needs help not a jail sentence she settled on the sofa beside him feeling foolishly nervous the news is all over the radio i was just wondering what to do what i could do when you knocked at the door perhaps in a few weeks i could go to see him im not sure hell be such a pretty sight hell need his friends she said and set her wine down untasted and are you still she looked up her face softened before she lifted a hand to his cheek you look good johnno i always wondered what you were hiding under that beard the sixties are over mores the pity i actually wore a tie last week please well it was white leather but a tie nonetheless he leaned over and kissed her time he thought was only time after all ive missed you bev the years went by so quickly for some of us i hear you and pm are an item she picked up her wine sipping stalling did you come to gossip johnno you know how i adore gossip luy shall i pretend i didnt see the pictures of you and pm the familiar sarcasm was back faint but sharp as a blade of course my favorite is of you and jane right after you bloodied her lip he grabbed bevs hand before she could rise and kissed it my hero the laughter bubbled up and though she took her hand away she relaxed again i had no intention of fighting with her and no regret that i did thats the spirit you amazon she made a comment about darren bev murmured im sorry his smile faded when he took her hand again she let hers lie comfortably in it i just saw red i know thats a cliche but you do when youre viciously angry the next thing i knew i was plowing into her for darren for myself and for emma a lot of nerve i have defending emma after what i did to her no we wont get into all that she interrupted its done now i imagine jane will say some filthy things about me in her next book and my business will boom as a result push it aside she told herself and go on pm tells me that youre about to form your own label it should be official in a couple of weeks just where is our boy he had to fly to california a couple of days ago the divorce business actually hes expected back anytime now expected back here she drank again but met his eyes levelly yes here is that a problem johnno i dont know is it a trace of the old fire came into her eyesstubborn defensive hes a very sweet man a kind man i know im rather fond of him myself i know you are she sighed and let the rite die dont lets make it complicated johnno were just looking for a little happiness a little peace of mind thats bullshit pms been in love with you for years so what if he is she demanded dont i deserve someone who loves me someone who puts me first yes and doesnt he deserve the same she shoved away from the sofa to pace to the window and back the rain slicked down the glass like bars im not going to hurt him he needs someone right now so do i whats so wrong about that brian he said simply what does he have to do with this that was over long ago he got up slowly i wont insult you by calling you a liar or by calling you a fool i will say that i care about you and pm and bri and i care about the band what we are what weve done what we still can do im hardly a yoko ono she said stiffly i wont come between your precious band have i ever could i ever you never have maybe youve never known how easily you could brians never loved anyone like he loved you bev believe me i know dont say that to me he started to speak again but they both heard the door open and the rush of footsteps down the hallway bev bev pm turned into the room his coat wet from the rain and flapping open johnno thank god i just heard about stevie on the radio what the hells going on have a seat son johnno settled back on the sofa himself and ill tell you he loved her so sweetly he touched her so gently the candles flickered flames dancing with the dark as bev stroked a hand down pms back his whispers were soft the words lovely it was easy so easy to give herself to him to let the strength of his feelings carry her along she would never have to ask herself if he needed her if she would be could always be enough for him with him she would never have to spend nights wondering worrying aching and she would never never feel that thrill of unity of rightness of belonging she gave him all she could arching up to him opening for him accepting even welcoming him into her her body didnt shudder as his did her heart didnt threaten to burst through the wall of her chest but after a good clean climax came the peace and she was grateful but she should have known such simple things dont last the candles still flickered as he drew her close to hold her warmth to him he loved the serenity that always cloaked her after sex the complete and somehow elegant stillness of her body her eyes were half closed her lips soft and just parted her limbs were pliant if he rested his head as he often did on her breast he would hear the strong steady beat of her heart sometimes they talked like thisas he had never talked with his wife of seven years they talked of what had happened to them during the day or what had happened to the world or they lay and listened to the radib that had played during their lovemaking they would drift to sleep like that quiet and content and in the morning he would wake dazzled and delighted that she was beside him he shifted her so that he could brush his hand through her hair the divorce is going through roused out of a halfdoze she opened her eyes and watched the pattern of light and shadow on the wall im glad are you of course i know how hard its been on you the last few weeks you want it behind you i do i married angie for the wrong reasons bev i wanted to settle down so badly to have a wife a home a family of course that monster in beverly hills was never a home and she always had an excellent excuse for putting off starting a family just as well i was as poor a choice for her as she was for me she linked her fingers with his youre too hard on yourself no its true i was a career choice for angie the pity is she didnt realize i was fond enough of her once to have helped her there without marriage but we jumped in and were both too lazy or too cautious to jump out again when it went bad he studied her fingers long and slender tangled with his chunky ones looking back i can see every mistake so clearly i wont make them again bevif you give me a chance pm she moved then flustered and frightened his hands came to her shoulders surprisingly firm holding her facetoface i want you to marry me bev for all the right reasons she hesitated surprising herself the answer didnt come through her lips as quickly as surely as it had jumped into her head it was her heart that stopped it she realized her heart that wanted to give him what he wanted she lifted her hands to cover his i cant im so sorry i cant he stared at her watching her eyes the regret in themand the trace of pity that made him want to scream because of brian she started to agree then found that answer unclear as well no because of me she drew away and pulling on a robe got out of bed i cant let go you see i thought i had ive wanted to but i cant she turned back her face in shadows her voice clear and filled with regrets being with you is the best thing to happen to me in a long long time its made me feel happy again and its made me see things clearly for the first time in years youre still in love with him yes i think i could live with that i think i could accept that somehow and go on with you with someone but im the one who drove him away you see what are you talking about didnt he ever tell you she smiled a little as she sat on the edge of the bed it was easy to talk to him like this to think of him as friend now rather than lover no i suppose he wouldnt speak of it not even to you after darren was killed i cut brian out of my life i punished him pm and emma i hurt brian when he needed me most blaming him because i was too afraid to blame myself for gods sake bev neither of you was to blame ive never been sure of that i wouldnt let him grieve with me and when he was suffering when we both were suffering i turned him away he didnt leave me pm i left him and poor little emma in our way i suppose we both abandoned her seeing you again being with you has made me realize just what i did to all of us you deserve better than a woman who didnt love enough and wholl always regret it i could make you happy bev yes i think you could she cupped his face in her hands but i wouldnt make you happy not for long youd always know i loved him first and in a way ill never love anyone else yes he had known he had known that and her answer before he had asked the question it would have helped if he could have hated her for it and hated brian but he loved why dont you go back to him talk to him darren would be almost ten years old now its too far to go back pm emma hurried across the grounds if she looked as though she had a purpose none of the sisters would stop and question her she had an excuse prepareda botany report for a science project she only wanted to be alone she was ready to scream and wall with the need to be alone she didnt even want mariannes company emma was sorry shed had to lie to her closest friend and would confess the sin to father prelenski in the afternoon but she needed an hour an hour alone to think she cast one quick look over her shoulder then skirted around a row of hedges tucking the notebook she carried more securely under her arm she dove into a small grove of trees since it was saturday she was allowed her jeans and sneakers it was cool enough in the shade of the greening trees to make her glad shed worn the sweater once she was certain she was out of view from any of the windows of the academy she dropped to the ground inside the notebook were more than a dozen clippings most of which had been passed on to her by teresa and other equally curious classmates the first was of herself and michael from the summer before she smoothed it carefully battled embarrassed delight as she studied her face and form depicted so clearly in newsprint she looked wet and disheveled and unfortunately for her ego didnt fill out the bikini very interestingly but michael looked wonderful michael kesselring she thought of course the paper hadnt printed his name hadnt bothered to find it out it had been her the press had been interested in but all the girls had squealed over michael and demanded to know who he was and if emma had had a summer romance it had made her feel very grownup to talk about him of course shed embellished the tale more than a little about how hed carried her in his arms given her mouthtomouth pledged his undying love she didnt think michael would mindespecially since hed never know about it with a sigh she replaced the clipping and took out another it was the one teresa had brought over the night emma had had her ears pierced she couldnt count the number of times she had taken it out stared at it studied it tried to dissect it her eyes were constantly drawn to her mothers face frightened as they searched and searched for some resemblance but not all heredity could be seen she knew she was a very good student and had taken a special interest in biology when discussions of heredity and genes had come up that was her mother and there was no dienying it she had grown inside that woman had been born from her no matter how many years had passed emma could still smell the stink of gin she could still feel the pinches and slaps and hear the curses it terrified herterrified her so that just looking at the picture had her digging bittendown nails into her palms had the palms themselves sweating on a choked cry she tore her gaze from janes picture and looked at her fathers she prayed every night she was like himkind gentle funny fair he had saved her she had read the story often enough and even without the printed words she remembered the way he had looked when shed climbed out from under the sink the kindness in his voice when he had spoken to her hed given her a home and a life without fear even though he had sent her away she would never forget the years he had given her that he and bev had given her it was hardest to look at bev somehow she was so beautiful so perfect emma had never loved another woman more never needed one more and to look at her made it impossible not to think of darren darren who had had the same rich dark hair and soft green eyes daffen whom she had sworn to protect darren who had died her fault emma thought now she was never to be forgiven for it bev had sent her away her father had sent her away she would never have a family again she put it away and spent some time going through older clippings pictures of herself as a child pictures of darren the wide stark headlines about the murder these she kept hidden deep in her drawer knowing if the nuns found them and told her father he would get that sad hurtful look in his eyes she didnt want to hurt him but she couldnt forget she read the stories through through she could have recited them by heart by this time looking she was always looking for something new something that would tell her why it had happened how she might have stopped it there was nothing there never was there were new clippings nowpictures and stories about bev and pm some said bev would at last get a divorce and marry pm others played up the juicy angle of two men who had been like brothers torn apart by a woman there was the announcement of devastations new label prism and pictures of the party in london on the day it had become official there was her father with another new woman and again with johnno and pm and pete but not stevie with a sigh emma took out another clipping stevie was in a clinic where they put drug abusers they called him an addict others called him a criminal emma remembered shed once thought he was an angel emma thought he looked tired in the picture tired and thin and afraid the papers said it was a tragedy they said it was an outrage some of the girls snickered about it but no one would talk to her when she had questioned her father he had told her only that stevie had lost control and was getting help she wasnt to worry but she did worry they were her family the only family she had left she had lost darren she had to make sure she didnt lose the rest carefully in her best penmanship she began to compose letters stevie rem is in the sunlight as he sat on a stone bench in the garden during his morning walk it was a lovely spot filled with tea roses and hollyhocks and bird songs little brick paths wound through it under arbors of wisteria and morning glories both the staff and the patients at whitehurst were given free rein there until the sturdy stone walls rose up he detested the clinic the doctors the other patients he despised the therapy sessions the scheduling the determined smiles of the staff but he did what he was told and he told them what they wanted to hear he was an addict he wanted help he would take one day at a time he would take their methadone and dream of heroin he learned to be calm and he learned to be cunning in four weeks and three days he would walk out a free man this time he would be more careful this time he would control the drugs he would smile at the doctors and reporters he would lecture on the evils of drugs and he would lie through his teeth when he was out he would live his life as he chose no one had the right to tell him he was sick no one had the right to tell him he needed help if he wanted to get high hed get high what did they understand about the pressures he lived with day after day the demands to excel to be that much better than the rest maybe hed gone too far before maybe so hed keep it a social thing the frigging doctors swilled their bourbon hed do a line if he felt like a line hed smoke some hash if he had a yen for it and fuck them fuck them all he tore open the envelope he was pleased that emma had written him he could think of no other female hed had such pure and honest feelings for taking out a cigarette he leaned back on the bench and drew in the scent of smoke and roses dear stevie i know youre in a kind of hospital and im sorry i cant visit you dad says he and the others have been there and that youre looking better i wanted you to know that i was thinking about you maybe when youre well we can go on vacation together all of us like we did in california last summer i miss you a lot and i still hate school but its only three and a half more years remember when i was little and you always asked me who was the best id always say dad and youd pretend to get mad well i never told you that you play the guitar better dont tell dad i said so heres a picture of you and me in new york a couple of years ago dad took it remember thats why its out of focus i thought youd like to have it you can waite me back if you feel like it but if you dont thats okay i know im supposed to have paragraphs and stuff in this letter but i forgot i love you stevie get well soon love emma he let the letter lie on his lap he sat on the bench and smoked his cigarette and wept pm opened his letmr as he sat in the empty house hed just bought on the outskirts of london he was on the floor with the ceilings towering over him a bottle of ale by his knee and the cool blues of ray charles coming from his only piece of furniture the stereo it hadnt been easy to leave bev but it had been harder to stay she had helped him find the house as shed promised she would decorate it she would now and then make love with him in it but she would never be his wife he blamed brian for it no matter what bev had told him pm eased his pain by placing the blame squarely on brian he hadnt been man enough to stay with her through the bad times he hadnt been man enough to let her go right from the beginning brian had treated bev badly bringing her a child from another woman asking her to raise it as her own leaving her for weeks at a time while he toured pushing her he thought viciously pushing her into a lifestyle she never wanted drugs groupies and gossip and what would brian say what would they all say if he announced he was leaving the group that would make them sit up and take notice pm thought as he swallowed some ale brian mcavoy could go to hell and take devastation with him more out of habit than curiosity he opened emmas letter she wrote him every couple of months cute chatty letters that he answered with a postcard or a little gift it wasnt the girls fault that her father was a bastard pm thought and began to read dear pm i guess im supposed to say im sorry about your divorce but im not i didnt like angie the sisters say that divorce is a sin but i think its a bigger one to pretend you love someone when you dont i hope youre happy again because when i saw you last summer you were sad there are lots of things in the paper about you and bev maybe im not supposed to talk about something like that but i cant help it if you and bev get married i wont be mad shes so beautiful and good you cant help it if you love her maybe if shes happy with you she wont hate me anymore i know youre not fighting with dad like it says in some of the papers it would be stupid to blame him for loving bev if you love her too i found this picture i took of you and dad a long time ago i know youre going to start the new album soon so you can show it to him i hope youre happy because i love you maybe ill see you in london this summer love emma pm studied the picture for a long time then slipped it inside the folded letter and the letter inside the envelope divorcing his wife had been one thing he realized divorcing his family was something else again ohnno spent his first day back in new york sleeping and his second composing he was living alone at the moment and gratefully so his last lover had driven him to distraction with obsessive cleanliness johnno was fastidious himself but when it had come to washing all the bottles and cans that had come into the house from the market even he had been baffled he appreciated the silenceafter the housekeeper had left he thought idly about spending the evening out but decided he was too lazy it wasnt jet lag as much as it was the strain of the last few weeks the legalities and hassles of the new label the difficult visit with stevie at the clinic and worse somehow the time he had spent with brian watching his oldest friend snuggle down deeper into a bottle yet the music brian was writing was better than ever stinging lyrical sharpedged dreamy he wouldnt speak of his feelings of his hurt or anger over pms relationship with bev but it was there in his music that was enough to keep pete happy johnno thought as he stripped off his shirt as long as devastation kept rocking all was right with the world he took out the shrimp salad his housekeeper had made up uncorked a bottle of wine and pushed idly through the mail which had accumulated during his absence when emmas handwriting caught his eye he grinned dear johnno ive snuck away from the nuns for a little while i guess ill do penance for it later but i felt i might scream if i didnt have a few minutes alone most of the sisters are cranky today three seniors were expelled yesterday theres a rule about smoking in uniform so karen jones mary alice pleasinger and tomisina gibralti stripped down to their slips in the locker room and lit up most of the girls think it was cool but mother superior doesnt have much of a sense of humor with a laugh johnno pushed aside the salad lifted his wine and settled into the letter ive been thinking a lot lately about dad and you and the others ive seen the stories about stevie and i hate the things everyones saying about him have you seen him is he all tight the picture i have came from the london times and makes him look so old and sick i dont want to believe that hes a drug addict but im not a child dad wont talk to me about it so im asking you you ahvays tell me the truth some of the girls say that all rock singers are drug addicts some of the girls are complete asses gossip manages to get through the walls here too i have the article and the pictures of bev and dad and pm fivm people jane was in the picture too i dont want to call her my mother please dont tell dad that i wrote you about it he gets so upset and it doesnt change anything i was upset at first but i thought about it for a long time its okay if bev loves pm isnt it it almost makes it like shes family again i guess im really writing to ask you to look after dad i know he pretends he doesnt think about bev anymore that he doesnt love her but he does i can tell when i get out of schooh ill be able to take care of him myself im going to have a base in new york with marianne and i can travel all over with him taking pictures the one enclosed is a selfportrait i took it last weele note the earrings mapionne pierced my ears and i nearly fainted i havent broken the news to dad yet so keep mum will you spring breaks just nine days off and that should be soon enough for him to see the damage himself dad says well spend easter on martinique please come johnno please i love you emma and what was he supposed to do about emma johnno wondered he could show the letter to brian and say look read this and straighten your ass up your daughter needs you and if he did neither brian nor emma would forgive him she was growing up and growing up fast pierced ears training bras and philosophy brian wouldnt be able to keep her in a bubble much longer well he would try to be there when the blow came for both of them tilting back his glass he drained the wine and it looked as though hed be spending a few days in martinique with the white sand heating under him and his rum growing warm brian watched his daughter cut through the surf what was she racing against he wondered why did she always seem to be in a hurry to get from one point to the next he could have told her that once she reached the finish line the glory was only momentary but she wouldnt have listened a teenager sweet jesus how had she come to be a teenager and how had he come to be a thirtythreeyearold icon at thirteen it had all seemed very simple to him his goals had been perfectly defined to get out of the slums to play his music to be someone hed accomplished all of that so where was the thrill he picked up his glass and drank deeply where the hell was the thrill he watched emma dive under a wave then come up sleek as an otter on the other side he wished she wouldnt swim out so far it was so much easier to worry when he could see her the months when she was tucked away in school he never worried she was a good student well mannered quietly obedient then the holidays would come and she would pop back into his life that much more grownup that much more beautiful he would see that look in her eyes that dark determined look he recognized as his own it frightened him god what energy johnno dropped down beside him she doesnt slow down much does she no we getting old johnno shit johnno adjusted his panama and tried a sip of brians rum rock stars dont get old son they play vegas grimacing he screwed the glass back into the sand we aint there yet he settled back on his elbows of course we aint shaun cassidy either thank christ keep that up and youll never get your picture in ger beat they sat in silence a moment listening to the whoosh of the waves johnno was glad hed come the quiet of the private villa and beach was the perfect contrast to the crowded rush of new york or the rainy spring in london the villa behind them was three stories with terraces jutting out over the seahigh walls and hedges on three sides and the white curve of beach on the fourth the pretty pastel stones glinted in the sunlight and there was the scent of water and hot flowers everywhere yes he was glad hed come not just because of the sunshine but because of the time it had given him the quiet time with brian and with emma the time he knew would come all too quickly to an end pete rang up a little while ago brian watched emma stand in thighhigh water lift her face to the sun her skin had warmednot tanned he thought not browned but warmed the color of apricots he worried about how soon some hungry young boy would want a taste and things are set for next month we can start recording and stevie theyre going to put him on some kind of outpatient program hes a registered junkie now johnno shrugged methadone program if you cant get drugs from the street you get them from the government anyhow hell be ready will you brian picked up his glass drained it the rum had been heated by the sun and ran mellow down his throat ive been ready glad to hear it you dont intend to take a punch at pm do you give me a break johnno id rather see you smash his nose than spend the next months freezing him out or working up to killing him in his sleep ive got no problem with pm brian said carefully its his life and your wife brian shot johnno a vicious look but he managed barely to contryi the ugly words that sprung to mind bev hasnt been my wife for a long time johnno glanced over to be certain emma was still out of earshot that lines all right for anyone else not for me bri he put a hand on brians wrist squeezed then released i know its going to he hard for you i just want to make sure youre ready he lifted his glass remembered it was empty and set it down again despite the breeze off the water he was finding the heat oppressive you cant go back johnno and you cant stand still so you keep going forward whether youre ready or not oh that was great emma dropped to her knees between her father and johnno her hair streaming you should come out in the water johnno said tilting down his bluelensed sunglasses emma luy there are things in the water slimy things laughing she leaned over to kiss his cheek then her fathers she caught the sharp scent of rum and fought to keep her smile in place old people sit on the beach she said lightly middleaged people sit on the beach middleaged brian caught a thank of her hair and tugged just whore you calling middleaged oh just people who sit on the beach all morning with umbrellas at their backs she grinned why dont you two sit right here rest yourselves ill fetch you a cold drink and iil get my camera i can take pictures so you can look back and remember your nice restful vacation shes got a mouth on her bri ive noticed shall we let her get by with it he glanced at his friend not a chance she squealed when they lunged she could have been quicker if shed wanted to but put up a good wriggling fight as her father grabbed her legs and johnno hooked his hands under her arms into the brink id say johnno tossed back his head so that his hat landed in the sand then keeping pace with brian raced to the water emma held her breath and took them under with her shed never been hpier in her life it had all been perfect completely wonderfully perfect days in the sun nights listening to johnno and her father play cheating with johnno at cards walks along the beach with her father she had rolls of film to develop pockets of memory to store so how could she sleep emma wondered it was her last night on martinique her last night with her father her last night of freedom tomorrow she would be on a plane headed back to school where there were rules for everything what time to get up what time to sleep what to wear what to think with a sigh she shook her head it would be summer soon she reminded herself and she would go to london she would see stevie and pm then as well she could watch while they recorded shed get through the next few weeks somehow she had to it was so important to dad she thought that she get her education that she be safe and well looked after well the nuns did that she decided there was hardly a moment in the day when you werent looked after she could hear the water smell it going with instinct she dragged on a pair of shorts it was late even the guards would be asleep she would go to the beach alone for her last night alone she could sit and watch the water and no one would watch her she hurried out down the hall of the rented villa down the stairs holding her breath she slipped out of the tall glass doors and ran she gave herself only an hour when she tiptoed back to the villa she was soaking wet it hadnt been enough to watch the water after all she came in quietly with the idea to make a dash to her room when she heard her fathers voice she sunk into the shadows just keep it down luy everyones asleep there was a feminine giggle then a whisper thickly french im quiet as a mouse brian came into the room with a curvy little brunette wrapped around him she was wearing a hotpink sarong and carrying gold high heels im so glad you came in tonight chdrl she ran her hands up his sides then hooking them tightly around his neck brought his mouth to hers embarrassed and confused emma shut her eyes but she could hear the quick wet moans mmm youre in a hurry the french woman laughed working her way under brians shirt ill give you your moneys worth chd dont you worry but you promised me a party first right and that would help he thought her hair was dark and sleek but her eyes were brown instead of green after a couple of lines it wouldnt matter nothing would he went to a table and unlocking a drawer took out a small white vial party time the brunette clapped her hands hips swinging she walked to the glass coffee table and knelt appalled emma watched her father set up the cocaine straws mirrors the razor blade his movements were competent practiced his head bent close to the brunettes ah the french woman leaned back eyes brilliant she dipped a fingertip into the dust on the mirror then rubbed it over her gums delicious brian hooked a finger in her sarong drew her to him he felt incredible young powerful invincible he was hard and ready and full of needs he bent her back intending to take her quickly the first time after all hed paid for all night dad his head whipped up he focused but it seemed like a dream his daughter with shadows at her back her face pale her eyes dark and wet her hair streaming over her shoulders emma emma the french woman purred the name who is this emma annoyed that brians attention had shifted she twisted around there was speculation then interest so you like children too a va come then pretty one join the party shut up goddamn you shes my daughter he struggled up emma i thought you were in bed yes her voice was flat i know you shouldnt be down here he stepped forward to take her arm youre cold and wet he said fighting the sharpedged buzz of the coke where have you been i went down to the beach avoiding his eyes she tried to turn toward the stairs alone you went down to the beach alone at night yes she whirled back to him gritting her teeth at the scent of the french womans perfume i went down to the beach alone now im going to bed you know better he took both her arms now shaking her you know youre not to go anywhere without the guards for christs sake youve been swimming what if youd had a cramp then id have drowned come chip let the child go to bed the brunette prepared another line this is a party shut the fuck up he shouted at her she only shrugged and snorted dont you ever do this again he demanded toming back to emma do you understand oh yes i understand she jerked away from him eyes dark and dry i wish to god i didnt but i understand well talk about this later about my walk on the beach or about this she gestured toward the woman still kneeling at the table this is none of your business no her lips curved but her voice was flat and dull no youre quite right about that iil just go to bed then and leave you with your whore and your drugs he slapped her his arm swung up before he knew it would his hand whipped across her face before he could stop it he saw the mark of it on her cheek the red flag of violence he so detested stunned he looked down at his own hand and saw his fathers emma she stepped back in a quick jerky motion shaking her head rarely had he ever raised his voice to her and now the first time she questioned him the first time she criticized he struck her turning she bolted up the stairs johnno let her pass he stood halfway down shirtless cotton sweat pants low on his hips his hair was disheveled his eyes tired let me talk to her he said before brian could rush by he took a strong grip on his friends arm she wont hear you now bri let me hold her hand for a while he nodded his palm stung where it had connected with her face his babys face johnnoill make it up to her sure johnno squeezed his shoulder then gestured youd best tidy up your mess down here her eyes were dry emma sat heedless of her wet clothes on the edge of her bed but she didnt cry the world the beautiful world she had built around her father had crumbled she was lost again she bolted up when the door opened then sank back to the bed when she saw johnno im all right she told him i dont need anyone to kiss it and make it better okay he came in nonetheless and sat beside her want to yell at me awhile no thats a relief why dont you get out of those wet things he put his hands over his eyes then spread his fingers and grinned no peeking because it was something to do she rose and went to her closet for a robe you knew didnt you that your father liked women yes i guess i first suspected it when we were twelve im not joking johnno so she wouldnt give him an easy way out okay listen emmy luy a mans entitled to sex it just isnt something he likes to flaunt in front of his daughter he paid her she was a whore what do you want me to say when she stopped in front of him wearing a white terrycloth robe he took her hands she looked pitifully young now her hair wet and sleek around her head and shoulders her eyes dark and disillusioned should i tell you the nuns are right and its a sin they probably are but this is real life emma and people sin in real life brian was lonely then its all right to have sex with a stranger if youre lonely this is why god saw to it that i wouldnt be a father johnno murmured he tried again the best way he knew with the truth sex is easy and its empty no matter how exciting it is at the moment making love with someone is a whole different experience youll find that out for yourself when feelings are involved i guess you could practically say its holy i dont understand i dont think i want to he went out found that woman and paid for her he had cocaine i saw it i know stevie but i never believed dad i never believed it there are all kifids of loneliness emma do you do it too she set her jaw i have he hated admitting a weakness toher strange but until that moment when he had to confess his own flaws he hadnt realized how much he loved her i probably havent missed much the sixties emma you had to be there he laughed a little and drew her down beside him i stopped because i didnt like it i didnt like giving up my control for a quick buzz that doesnt make me a hero its easier for me i dont have the pressure brian does he takes everything to heart i take everything as it comes the groups whats important to me you see with bri its the world it always has been she could still see him her father with his head bent over the line of white powder that doesnt make it right no he leaned his head on hers i guess not the tears came now hot and fast i didnt want to see him like that i didnt want to know i still love him i know he loves you too we all do if i hadnt gone out if i hadnt wanted to be alone none of this would have happened you wouldnt have seen it but it would still have been there he kissed her hair now you just have to accept that hes not perfect its not going to be the same is it johnno on a sigh she leaned against him its not going to be quite the same ever again new york what do you think hes going to say marianne hauled her suitcase out of the cab while emma paid off the driver i imagine hell say hello come on emma emma pushed back her hair as the late evening wind tugged at it hell ask what the hell were doing here and ill tell him then hell call your father and well be dragged off to the gallows they dont hang in this state anymore emma picked up her own suitcase then drew a deep breath new york city it was good to be back this time she intended to stay gas chamber firing squad its all the same your fathers going to kill us both emma paused with her hand on the knob of the lobby door want to back out not on your life marianne grinned then scooped a hand through her cap of red hair lets do it emma strolled in pausing on her way across the lobby to smile at the security guard hello carl misswhy miss mcavoy he set down his lateevening pastrami sandwich and beamed at her its been over a year now hasnt it youre all grownup a college woman she laughed this is my friend miss carter nice meeting you miss carter carl brushed crumbs from the sleeve of his uniform does mr donovan know youre coming of course she lied sweetly with a smile didnt he tell you well thats johnno well only be staying for a couple of days she moved to the elevators as she spoke it would be best if he didnt buzz upstairs and let the cat out of the bag im going to school here now i thought you were going to some fancy university in london i transferred she winked at him you know my hearts in new york as the doors closed in front of them marianne rolled her eyes very smooth mcavoy very smooth most of it was true she laughed then let out a nervous breath ive been eighteen for two months its time i tried my independence ive been eighteen for seven months and my father still pitched a fit when i transferred to nycc well its done tomorrow were going to start looking for an apartment then were going to live just the way we always planned it yeah well over the first hurdle they stepped out of the elevator and walked down the wide quiet hall to johnnos condo let me do the talking emma warned at mariannes bland look she sighed i mean it the last time you did the talking we ended up polishing pews for three saturdays running im an artist not a lawyer she muttered then put on her best smile when the door opened johnno emma launched herself into his arms surprise she said then kissed him hold up he was only half dressed and groggy with afterdinner wine and sleep with his hands on her shoulders he held emma back shed grown tall in the last eighteen months shed sprung up like a willow slim graceful with hints of elegance her pale blond hair was scooped back with combs so that it fell full and straight to brush her shoulders she wore snug faded jeans with a skinny ribbed shirt tucked into them wide gold hoops swung at her ears for christs sake you look like an offduty model he shifted his gaze to marianne and heres my favorite redhead what have you done to your hair he rubbed a hand over mariannes short spiked do its whats happening now she told him then leaned her cheek in for a kiss did we get you up yes i suppose i should let you in before i ask what the hell youre doing here he glanced down with suitcases oh johnno its so good to be here the minute i got in the cab at the airport i felt at home she dropped her suitcase then took a quick spin around the room she plopped onto the couch rubbed a hand over the oystercolored cushions then popped up again how are you uhuh he knew her well enough to recognize the restless energy as nerves ill ask the questions drink yes please he walked over to a circular glass bar and rooted out two soft drinks is there a school holiday i dont know about liberation day marianne and i have both transferred to nycc have you now he poured diet pepsi into two glasses strange brian didnt mention it he doesnt know emma took the two glasses and passed one to marianne along with a warning look before you say anything id like you to listen in response he gave her ear a quick tug how did you slip by sweeney and the other one a brown wig hornrimmed glasses and a limp very clever johnno took her glass and sipped not certain he was comfortable in the role of avuncular confidant do you have any idea how worried brians going to be there was a flash of regret in her eyes then it hardened into determination i intend to call him and explain everything my minds made up johnno nothing you or he or anyone says can change it i havent tried to change it yet he frowned at marianne youre awfully quiet ive been warned ive already been through all this with my parents she added quickly they dont particularly like it but were set emma and i are both eighteen now we know what we want he felt suddenly uncomfortably old and being eighteen means you can do as you please were not kids anymore marianne began before emma put a hand over her mouth sit down marianne and be quiet emma took her glass back from johnno i know how much i owe my father and you since i was three years old ive done everything hes asked of me not just out of gratitude johnno you know that but because i love him more than anyone in the world i cant go on being a child for him being content in whatever safe little box hes picked out for me you wanted something and so did he you went for it well i want something too she walked over to her suitcase popped it then took out a portfolio the nerves had faded the energy hadnt these are my pictures im going to try my hand at making a living from them and im going to go to school here to learn how im going to share an apartment with marianne im going to make friends and go out to clubs and walk in the park im going to be a part of the world for a change instead of standing right on the edge looking in please understand how unhappy were you she smiled a little i couldnt begin to explain maybe you should have i tried she turned away a moment he didnt understand he couldnt i only wanted to be with him with you because that wasnt possible i tried to be what he wanted that night in martinique she paused choosing her words carefully even marianne didnt know what she had seen things changed for me and for dad i finished out what id started johnno i owed him thatso much more than that but this is for me ill talk to him for you thank you dont thank me yet hes liable to take one leap over the atlantic and lop off my head idly he opened the portfolio you always were clever he murmured both of you he nodded to a sketch of devastation that hung on the east wall told you i was going to frame it with a cry of pleasure marianne leaped up she had drawn it on the evening of their graduation celebration the house brian had rented on long island had been full of people never one to be shy marianne had ordered all four men to pose i didnt think you meant it thanks i suppose youre going to make your way drawing pictures while emma snaps them thats right itll be a bit hard to be starving artists with the inheritance my grandmother left me but were going to give it a shot speaking of starving have you eaten i had a hot dog at the airport while i was waiting for emmas flight to get in marianne grinned it wasnt enough i suppose we should eat then before i call brian johnno came from around the bar it may be our last meal hey johnno couldnt you sleep both girls turned at the sound of another male voice they watched the man the truly gorgeous man come down the curving stairs in nothing but a pair of jogging shorts i wondered where youd gone off to oh he paused combed his fingers through dark tousled hair and smiled at the girls hello i didnt know we had company luke caruthers emma mcavoy and marianne carter johnno stuck his hands in the pockets of his sweats luke writes for new york magazine he hesitated then shrugged he lives here oh was all emma could think of to say shed seen enough of intimacy envied it enough to recognize it hello so youre emma ive heard so much about you he smiled holding out his hand somehow i expected a little girl not anymore she managed and youre the artist he offered his dazzling smile to marianne nice work thanks she tilted her head smiled back and hoped she looked sophisticated i was just offering the ladies a meal theyve been traveling a midnight snack sounds good to me but let me whip it up johnnos cooking is poison marianne stood a moment torn between fascination and middleclass shock illahill give you a hand she cast a quick look at emma and fled behind luke to the kitchen i guess we came at a bad time emma began i didnt realize you had a roommate blowing out a breath she sat on the arm of a chair i had no idea johnno i really had no idea rock and rolls bestkept secret he said lightly but his hands were clenched in his pockets so would you like me to help you make an excuse and reservations at the waldorf her cheeks heated as she looked down at her hands no of course not does dad know of course he does she said quickly stupid question i dont know what to say he ah lukes very attractive a trace of amusement lit johnnos eyes yes i think so her blush deepened but she managed to look at him again youre making fun of me now no luy his voice was soft never you she studied him carefully trying to see if he looked different somehowif she could find something odd or wrong with the face she knew so well there was nothing only johnno her lips curved a little well i guess my plans do have to change he felt the twistharder sharper than the fists of the boys from his youth im sorry emma not half as sorry as i am she told him i have to give up my fantasy about seducing you for the first time in her life she saw his face go totally blank i beg your pardon well i always thought when i grew up when you saw me as a woman she stood up spreading her arms out then down her sides id come to visit you here fix you a meal by candlelight put on the music then seduce you she pulled a chain from under her blouse on it hung a little plastic ring with a gaudy red stone i always thought youd be my first speechless he stared at the ring then looked up and into her eyes there was love there the kind that lasted lifetimes and there was understanding without blame stepping forward he took her hands his voice was thick when he found it very rarely have i regretted being gay he brought her hands to his lips to kiss them this is one of those very rare times i love you johnno he held her against him i love you emma god knows why since youre such an ugly bitch when she laughed he drew her back for a kiss come on then not only is luke good to look at but hes a hell of a cook emma awoke urly and followed the scent of coffee and the muted sounds of the television to the kitchen it wasnt jet lag she felt now but the restless disorientation of waking up in a strange bed after only snatches of sleep there was an awkward moment as she stood in the kitchen doorway watching luke butter toast across from the television set where david hartman interviewed harrison ford shed almost been able to relax around luke the night before as theyd all eaten soup and hot sandwiches in the kitchen he was well mannered witty intelligent and mouthwateringly attractive and gay so was johnno emma reminded herself and tried a smile good morning luke turned he looked different this morning with his hair styled his face shaven he wore gray pleated slacks and a trim blue shirt set off with a thin tie of a darker shade he looked alert and hiply professional the upwardly mobile young executive she thought and such a complete contrast to johnno hi didnt think youd surface till this afternoon coffee thanks i couldnt sleep marianne and i are going apartment hunting this afternoon and i guess im worried about how my father reacted when johnno called him johnnos very persuasive he slid the coffee in front of her why dont i put you out of your misery toast no she pressed a hand to her stomach do you know what happened they argued a lot luke checked his watch then sat beside her johnno called him a few names im not sure hed like me to repeat to you she dropped her head into her cupped hands terrific he also vowed and i think a blood oath was mentioned to keep an eye on you bless him in the end and it was a long time coming brian agreed to your attending college here but he added before emma could leap up and dance you have to keep the guards dammit i will not have those two hulking bastards dogging my every move i might as well be back in saint catherines when is he going to realize that there isnt a kidnapper behind every bush people dont even know who i am and they dont care he cares he put a hand over hers emma sometimes we have to take what we can get i know i only want to live a normal life she began most of us want that he smiled again when she looked up and flushed look we both care about johnno so i figure that makes us friends right all right then this is my first friendly advice think of it this way you want to be in new york right yes you want to go to nycc yes you want your own place she blew out a frustrated breath yes well youve got it youre right she said after a moment youre absolutely right and i can ditch the guards when i want to i didnt hear that he checked his watch again listen ive got to run tell johnno ill pick up chinese he grabbed a briefcase then stopped i forgot are these yours he pointed to the portfolio open on the kitchen counter yes good work mind if i take them with me show them around you dont have to do that just because im friends with johnno doesnt mean hold on look i happened to see them sitting out in the other room i took a closer look and liked what i saw johnno didnt ask me to pump up your ego he wouldnt she rubbed her palms on her thighs do you really like them yes i know some people i could get you some input if you want i would very much i know i have a lot to learnthats why im here ive entered some competitions and shows but she trailed off knowing she was babbling thanks i appreciate it sure see you later he tucked the portfolio under his arm and headed out she sat alone taking very careful breaths she was on her way emma thought finally she was on her way its ours emma and marianne stood their arms tossed around each others shoulders looking out the windows of their newly purchased loft in soho emmas voice was both dazed and exhilarated as she made the statement i still cant believe it marianne murmured believe it its ourstwentyfoot ceilings bad plumbing and interest rates from hell on a quick laugh emma did three spins were property owners marianne you me and chase manhattan we bought it marianne sat down on the scarred wideplanked floor the rattle and hum of downtown traffic echoed up from three stories below something crashed outside and even through the closed windows they heard the shouts and swearing it was like music the loft was a huge square of space banked by a band of windows in the front and a towering panel of glass on the right a sound investment mariannes father had grudgingly called it complete insanity had been johnnos verdict investment or insanity it was theirs still dressed in the tidy suits theyd worn to settlement they each studied their new home the fruit of weeks of search endless calls to realtors and numerous bank interviews it might have been a huge empty space with spotted ceilings and grimy glass but for them it was the dream they had shared throughout childhood then they studied each other their faces mirrors of giddy terror it was the laughter that broke the last strain it bubbled up from emma first then echoed off the high plaster walls grabbing each other they did an impromptu polka up and down the length of their new home ours emma panted out when they teetered to a stop ours they shook hands formally then laughed again okay coowner marianne began lets make some decisions they sat on the floor with mariannes sketches warming pepsis and an overflowing tin ashtray between them they needed a wall here the staircase there studio space above darkroom space below they arranged rearranged constructed destructed at length marianne waved her cigarette this is it perfect its inspired emma took the cigarette out of selfdefense and rewarded herself with a puff youre a genius yes i am she shook her spiky hair as she leaned back on her elbows you helped right were both geniuses a space for everything and everything in its space i cant wait until weoh shit shit what do you mean shit theres no bathroom we forgot the bathroom after a brief study marianne shrugged screw the bathroom well use the y emma simply put a hand on mariannes face and shoved perched on a steplwder marianne painted fulllength portraits of herself and emma between two windows emma had taken on the more pedestrian chore of marketing and was storing food inside their reconditioned frigidaire thats our buzzer marianne called out over the boom of the radio i know emma balanced two grapefruits a sixpack of pepsi and a jar of strawberry preserves when the buzzer sounded again she dumped all of them on a shell beside the elevator which opened up into their living area she pushed the intercom yes mcavoy and carter thats right delivery from beds beds beds emma released the entrance door let out a war whoop what marianne demanded sitting back far enough to frown at her work beds emma shouted weve got beds dont joke about something like that emma not while im painting or ill give you a wart im not joking theyre on their way up marianne paused dripping brush in hand real beds mattresses marianne emma leaned a hand on the ladder box springs jesus marianne shut her eyes then gave a dramatic shudder i think i had an orgasm at the elevators ding emma was across the room like a shot when the doors opened all she could see was a queensized mattress covered in plastic where do you want it was the muffled question oh you can take that one right up those stairs in the far corner the man with buddy stitched across his cap rolled his eyes hefted the mattress over his head and started for the stairs we could only fit one at a time in the elevator my partners waiting downstairs oh right she pushed the release button again real beds she said as marianne joined her please not while we have company damn theres the phone ill get it the elevator dinged emma directed the second manriko according to his capthen smiled at buddy as he went out to get box springs when the elevator opened she grinned at the box springs that filled the car one goes up one goes down want a cold drink brian eased his way from behind the springs yeah dad mr mcavoy marianne shouted over the radio she stopped in midstream wiped her painly hands on her overalls hi you want to move buddy complained then maneuvered the box springs toward the stairs dad emma managed again wedidnt know you were here obviously christ emma anyone could ride up in that elevator do you always leave the entrance unlatched theyre delivering beds she gestured as riko struggled in with his load she drummed up a smile and kissed her father i thought you were in london i was i decided it was time i got a look at where my daughter was living he stepped farther into the room to take a long frowning study drop cloths covered most of the floor the packing crate from the stove served as both a table and a stool and was now covered with old newspapers a lamp a halffilled glass and a paint can the radio sat on a windowsill blasting away as casey kasem ran down the top forty the stepladder the card table and a single folding chair composed the rest of the furniture jesus was all brian could think of to say were a construction zone emma told him with forced cheerfulness it doesnt look like it but were nearly done the carpenters just have a bit of finish work here and there and misteri mean the tile man is coming monday to finish the bath it looks like a warehouse actually it was a factory marianne chimed in weve sectioned it off here and there with glass brick that was emmas idea its great isnt it she pointed to the waisthigh wall that separated the living area from the kitchen we got some terrific old appliances she continued and taking his arm gave him the tour emmas bedrooms going to be here the glass makes it private but still lets in the light im upstairsa sort of combination studio and bedroom emmas darkrooms already set up through there and come monday the bath should be not only functional but attractive he hated the fact that he could see the potential hated it because it made emma seem less like his little girl than a woman and a stranger have you decided to do without furniture we wanted to wait until it was finished emma knew her voice was stiff but couldnt prevent it we arent in any hurry wanna sign here buddy pushed a clipboard under her nose youre all set he blew his nose into a red bandana then eyed brian hey hey arent youwell sure you are ill be damned mcavoy youre brian mcavoy hey riko this heres brian mcavoy devastation no shit automatically brians lips curved into a charming smile nice to meet you this is great just great buddy went on my wifes never going to believe it we had our first date at your concert here in t can i get your autograph sure jesus shes never going to believe this while he searched in his pockets for a snatch of paper emma picked up a notepad and handed it to her father whats your wifes name brian asked buddy its doreen man shes going to drop dead i hope not still smiling brian handed over the autograph it took another ten minutes and an autograph for riko before they were alone again taking her cue marianne disappeared up the curving wroughtiron sairs got a beer brian asked no just some soft drinks with a restless move of his shoulders brian wandered to the front windows she was so exposed here couldnt she see it the big windows the city itself the fact that hed bought the firstfloor unit and installed sweeny and another man inside didnt seem to matter now that he was here to gauge the situation himself she was vulnerable every time she walked out on the street i was hoping youd choose somdthing uptown with security like the dakota she said then cursed herself im sorry dad i know lennon was a friend yes he was he turned back what happened to him should make you understand how i feel he was shot down on the streetnot for robbery not for passion just because of who and what he was youre mine emma that makes you every bit as vulnerable what about you she countered every time you step out on stage youre exposed it only takes one sick person among the thousands with the price of a ticket do you think that never goes through my mind he shook his head no i didnt think it went through your mind you never said would it have made a difference he was silent as he sat on the windowsill and took out a cigarette no you cant stop being what you are emma even if youd like to but ive lost one child he struck a match watched it flare i couldnt survive losing another i dont want to talk about daffen the old grief welled up thickening her voice were talking about you all right then i cant live for you anymore or ill hate you i gave you saint catherines dad and a year at a college i detested i have to start living for myself thats what im doing here he drew in smoke and wished for a drink i almost think id rather you hated me youre all ive got thats not true she went to him then resentments and disillusionments were crowded aside by love ive never been all and i never will be she took his hand as she sat beside him he was beautiful to look at even without a daughters prejudiced eye the years the strains the life hadnt scarred him not on the outside perhaps he was a bit too thin but time hadnt lined his poetic face or grayed his pale blond hair what magic was it she wondered that had caused her to grow up while he hadnt grown older she kept her hand over his and chose her words carefully but the trouble is for most of my life youre all ive had her fingers tightened on his and just about all ive needed i need more now dad all i want is a chance to find it he glanced around the room here to start it was impossible to argue with something he understood so perfectly let me put in a security system emma he interrupted squeezing her hand i need my sleep she laughed a little and relaxed all right ill look at it as a housewarming present she kissed him want to stay for dinner he took another look around it reminded him of his first place though that had only been a fraction of this space still it brought back the memories lugging in old furniture slopping paint on stained walls making love with bev on the floor no suddenly he didnt want to be there to feel the youth and the hope and the innocence why dont i take you and marianne out marianne leaned dangerously over the stair rail where brian grinned up at her your choice once he was forced to accept emmas decision brian played the indulgent father he bought her a warhol lithograph an exquisite tiffany lamp with signs of the zodiac and an aubusson rug in shades of powder blue and pink for the week he stayed in town he dropped in daily with a new present she couldnt stop him and after seeing the pleasure it gave him stopped trying they gave their first party on the night before he left for london packing crates stood on the priceless rug the tiffany graced the card table there was food both in plastic bowls and in the fragile limoges mariannes mother had shipped to them the radio had been replaced thanks to johnno by a walltrembling stereo unit a handful of college students mingled with musicians and broadway stars dress ranged from denim to silks and sequins there were arguments and laughter all drowned out by the music blasting against the windows it made emma nostalgic for the parties she remembered from her youth the people sprawled on the floor on pillows the bright and beautiful discussing their art she sipped mineral water and as she had always done watched an interesting soire johnno stated swinging an arm around her shoulders got any beer left lets see she steered him into the kitchen there wasnt much left in the fridge but a bottle of jug wine and part of a sixpack of becks emma opened a bottle and handed it to him just like old times she said more or less he sniffed the glass in her hand what a good girl you are im not much of a drinker that doesnt require an apology bris enjoying himseil he nodded over the wall to where brian was sitting on the floor and like a traveling minstrel plucking an acoustic guitar when she looked at him strumming singing for himself as much as for the group surrounding him the love poured through her he enjoys playing like this as much as in any stadium or studio more johnno said before he tipped back the beer though i dont think he knows it i think hes feeling better about all of this now she glanced around at the mix of people crowded into her home her home after all hed had a security system put in that would make the queens guards at buckingham palace look like pikers annoying no no really its not of course i dont remember the code numbers most of the time she sipped content to stand in the kitchen a halfwall away from the crowd and the laughter did luke tell you that he sent my portfolio over to timothy runyun he mentioned it johnno cocked his head problem i dont know hes offered me a parttime job as an assistant he took a little tug on the hair shed pulled back in a ponytail there are pitiful few who start at the top emmy luy its not that its not that at all runyun is one of the top ten photographers in the country starting out with him as a janitor would be a dream come true so she turned away from the party to look at him to watch his eyes so why did he offer me a job johnno because of my pictures or because of you and my father maybe you should ask runyun i intend to she set her glass down then picked it up again i know that american photographer printed my shot because luke suggested it do you johnno said mildly i suppose the shot wasnt worthy of that honor it was a damn good shot but johnno leaned back against the refrigerator and drank lighten up emma you cant go through life secondguessing everything that happens to you good or bad its not that im ungrateful to luke hes been great right from the start but this isnt like giving marianne and me cooking lessons nothing could be johnno said dryly i want this job with runyun to be mine she swung back her hair thin gold columns danced at her ears you have your music johnno i feel the same way about my photography are you good her chin came up im very good well then he considered the subject closed and glanced back at the party quite a group she started to continue then dragging a hand through her hair let it go im sorry pm and stevie arent here maybe next time still we have some old faces among the new i see you dug up blackpool actually dad ran into him yesterday hes doing madison square garden next weekend there isnt a ticket left in the city are you going to catch it i wouldnt dream of it he cocked a brow im hardly a fan but hes recorded three mcavoy donovan songs thats business johnno said and dismissed it why dont you like him johnno shrugged and drank again ive never been sure something about that smug smile turning emma reached in the cupboard for more chips i suppose hes entitled to be smug four gold albums a couple of grammys and a stunning wife stunning estranged wife im told hes certainly coming on to our favorite redhead marianne tossing the bags of chips aside emma shifted scanned then spotted her roommate cuddled on the shadowy window seat with blackpool she felt a surge of emotion that was tangled jealousy and alarm let me have a cigarette she murmured as she struggled to shrug it off shes a big girl emma of course she is she drew in the strong french smoke and winced hes old enough to she trailed off remembering that johnno was four or five years blackpools senior atta girl he said with a chuckle bite your tongue but she didnt smile its just that shes been so sheltered of course mother superior cram it johnno she picked up her drink again and kept her eye on blackpool the name suited him she thought he had dark lush hair and favored black clothes leathers suedes silks he had one of those moody sensual faces heathcliff as emma had always imagined him and shed always thought brontas character more selfdestructive than heroic beside him marianne looked like a bright slender candle ready to be lit im only saying that shes spent most of her life in that damn school in the bed next to yours johnno pointed out she wasnt in the mood to laugh all right thats true but i also had all that time with all of you seeing things being a part of things marianne went from school to camp to her fathers estate i know she puts on a front but shes very nve id give odds on our favorite redhead blackpools slick dear but hes not a monster of course not but she was going to keep her eye on marianne nonetheless she lifted the cigarette again then froze someone had put on a new album the beatles abbey road the first cut on the a side emma alarmed johnno gripped her wrist her pulse was scrambling her skin was ice what the hell emma look here he say one and one and one is three switch the record she whispered what switch the record she could feel the breath backing up in her lungs clogging there johnno please turn it off all right stay here he skimmed his way through the crowd moving quickly smoothly enough to prevent himself from being detained emma gripped the edge of the wall until her fingers went numb she wasnt seeing the party any longer the pretty people mixing together laughing over plastic glasses of white wine or chilled bottles of imported beer she could only see the shadows of a hallway hear the hissing and snapping of monsters and her little brothers cries emma it was brian now standing in the tiny kitchen alcove johnno at his side what is it baby are you sick no it wag dad she thought dad would make it all go away no its darren i heard daffen crying oh christ he took her shoulders and shook emma look at me what her head snapped up the glaze seemed to melt away from her eyes into tears im sorry im so sorry i ran away its all right he gathered her close his eyes anguished met johnnos over her head we should get her out of here in her bedroom johnno suggested then casually began to clear a path he slid the frostedglass doors closed behind them muffling the sounds of the party lets lie down emma brian kept his voice soothing as he set her on the bed ill stay right here im okay her worlds had separated again she didnt know whether to feel grief or embarrassment i dont know what set that off something just clicked and i was six years old again im sorry dad ssh he pressed his lips to her temple it doesnt matter it was the music johnno said then settled beside her the music upset you yes she moistened her dry lips yes it was the music it was playing that night when i woke up and heard darren it was playing when i started down the hall id forgotten ive never been able to listen to that cut but i didnt know why tonight i guess with the party it all rushed back why dont i start clearing people out no she took johnnos hand before he could rise i dont want to spoil it for marianne im all right now really it was so strange almost as if i were there again i wonder if id gotten to the door if id have seen no brians hand clamped down on hers its over and done with behind us i dont want you to think about it emma she was too weary to argue i think ill just rest awhile no ones going to miss me ill stay with you brian told her no im fine now im just going to sleep christmas is only a few weeks away ill come to london like i promised well have a whole week ill stay until you sleep brian insisted he was gone when she woke from the nightmare it had been so real so horribly clear just as the reality had been over twelve years before her skin was clammy with sweat as she reached for the light she needed the light there was so much that could hide in the dark it was quiet now five am and calm quiet the party was over and she was alone behind the glass walls of her room painfully like an old woman she rose out of bed to strip off her clothes and pull on a robe she slid the door back hit another light the room was a jumble there were scentsbeer going stale smoke trapped near the ceiling the lingering breath of perfumes and sweat she glanced up the stairs to where marianne slept she didnt want to disturb her by tidying up now though her ingrained neatness rubbed at her she would wait until sunrise there was something else she had to do and she wanted to do it quickly before cowardice could take over sitting by the phone she dialed information yes id like the numbers for american twa and pan am she wasnt going to feel guilty in fact at the moment emma didnt want to feel much of anything she knew if her father discovered shed flown to california without her guards hed be furious she could only hope he didnt find out with luck she would have her two days in california catch the redeye sunday night and be in new york again attending class monday morning with no one but marianne the wiser bless marianne emma thought as the plane touched down she hadnt asked any questions once she had seen that the answers would be painful instead she had roused herself barely past dawn tossed on a blond wig sunglasses and emmas overcoat and had cabbed it to early mass at saint pats with the guards trailing behind her that had given emma enough time to dash to the airport and catch her plane to the coast as far as sweeney and his partner would be concerned emma mcavoy would be spending a quiet weekend at home marianne would have to do some fast talking if brian or johnno called but then marianne was nothing if not a fast talker in any case emma decided while she deplaned the die was cast she was here and she would do what she had come to do she had to see the house again it had been sold all those years ago so it was doubtful she could wangle her way inside but she had to see it the beverly wilshire she told the cab driver exhausted she let her head fall back let her eyes close behind her dark glasses it was too warm for her winter coat now but she couldnt find the energy to shrug out of it she needed to rent a car she realized and let out an annoyed breath she should have taken care of that already with a shake of her head she promised herself she would arrange it through the concierge as soon as she had unpacked the few things shed tossed into her bag there were ghosts here she thought along hollywood boulevard in beverly hills on the beaches at malibu and throughout the hills looking over the la basin ghosts of herself as a young girl on her first trip to america of her young heroic father hoisting her on his shoulders in disneyland of bev smiling a hand laid protectively over the child she carried in her womb and always of darren as he giggled and ran his tractor over the turkey rug miss emma blinked and focused on the uniformed doorman who stood waiting to help her from the cab checking in yes thank you mechanically she paid off the driver walked into the lobby to registration she took her key forgetting for the moment that this was the first time she had stayed alone in her room she opened the discreet gucci carryon by habit neatly folding her lingerie hanging her clothes setting out her toiletries once done she picked up the phone this is miss mcavoy in id like to arrange for a rental car two days yes as soon as possible thatll be fine ill be down there was something else that had to be done though she was afraid picking up the phone book she opened it skimmed through to the ks kesselring l emma noted down the address in her neat hand he was still here j e you going to eat all morning michael or are you going to cut the lawn michael grinned at his father and shoveled in more pancakes its a big lawn i need my strength right mom the boy doesnt eat right since he moved out pleased to have both men at her table marge filled the coffee cups youre skin and bones michael ive got the best part of a nice ham i cooked earlier in the week you take it home with you dont give this deadbeat my ham lou objected michael lifted a brow then doused the remaining pancakes with aunt jemima who you calling a deadbeat you lost the bet but i dont see my grass getting mowed ill get to it michael grumbled and snatched another sausage i think that game was fixed the orioles won fair and square and they won over a month ago pay up michael gestured with the sausage it was a conversation theyd had every weekend since the world series and one they would undoubtedly continue to have until the first of the year when the bet would be paid in full as a police captain you should be aware that gamblings illegal as a rookie assigned to my precinct you should have better sense than to make a sucker bet mowers in the shed i know where it is he rose swung an arm over his mothers shoulder how do you live with this guy it isnt easy marge smiled and patted michaels cheek be sure to be careful with that weed whacker around the rosebushes dear she watched him go out slamming the screen door as he had always done for a moment she wished he could be ten again but that feeling passed quickly leaving a quiet pride we did a good job lou yeah he took both his and michaels dishes to the sink hed aged well putting on less than ten pounds over the last twenty years his hair was fully gray now but hed kept most of it though he occasionally realized he was uncomfortably close to sixty he felt better than he had in his life due he thought as he put his arm around marge to his wifes diligent watch on things like cholesterol and sugar as for herself marge had settled contentedly into middle age she was as trim as shed been the day theyd been married nothing kept her from her twiceweekly aerobic classes her hair was colored a flattering ashbrown five years before shed gotten what lou had thought was a bee in her bonnet about starting her own business hed considered himself indulgent when hed stood back and let his little woman open a small bookstore hed been kind and considerate like an adult patting a child on the head then she had astonished him by showing a keen and often ruthless head for business her little shop had expanded now she had three doing brisk business in hollywood bel air and beverly hills life was full of surprises he thought as he heard the mower gun his wife who had seemed content for years dusting furniture and baking pies was a businesswoman with her own accountant his son who had breezed carelessly through college then had spent nearly eighteen months drifting had enrolled in the police academy without saying a word as for himself lou was giving serious thought to something that had always seemed years off retirement it was a good life lou thought drawing in scents of sausage and roses on impulse he spun his wife around and planted a long hard kiss on her mouth the kids going to be busy for at least an hour he murmured as he cupped her breasts lets go upstairs marge tilted her head back then grinned michael turned the mower enjoying the physical release and the light sweat that was working over his skin not that he liked losing the bet he thought he hated to lose anything but he missed a lawn the look of it the smell of it his apartment suited him with its postagestamp pool and noisy neighbors but the suburbs he mused with their big leafy trees and tidy yards their backyard barbecues and station wagons were home you always felt like a kid again there saturdaymorning bike rides ricky jones down the street trying out his skateboard pretty girls walking by in thin cotton dresses while you traded baseball cards on the curb and pretended not to notice the old neighborhood hadnt changed much since his youth it was still a place where paperboys rode bikes on delivery and tossed todays news into bushes neighbors still competed with each other over the best lawn the best garden they borrowed tools and forgot to return them being there gave him a sense of continuity something he hadnt known he wanted until hed moved away from it a movement caught his eye and he glanced up in time to see the shade of his parents bedroom window go down he stopped openmouthed the grip of the mower vibrating under his hands he might not have had his gold shield but it didnt take a detective to figure out what was going on behind the shade at nine oclock in the morning he continued to stare a moment unsure if he should be amused embarrassed or delighted he decided it was best not to think about it at all there was something spooky about imagining your parents having sex he steered the mower onehanded unbuttoning his shirt as he went christmas lights might have been strung along the caves of the houses but it would be eighty degrees before noon michael sent a casual wave to mrs baxter who had come out to weed her gladiolas she merely frowned at him so he went back to singing along with the bruce springsteen number that played through his headphone hed sent a long fly ball through mrs baxters picture window more than ten years before and she had yet to forgive him he had the backyard trimmed and half of the front when he began to wonder why his father had never invested in a riding mower a trim mercedes convertible pulled up at the curb michael wouldnt have given it more than a glance except there was a blonde behind the wheel he had a weakness for blondes she merely sat dark glasses hiding her eyes as a minute stretched into five at length she slowly got out of the car she was as trim and sleek as the mercedes long elegant legs beneath a thin cotton skirt he noticed her hands as well delicate teaserving hands that clutched tight on a gray leather purse beautiful nervous and from out of town michael deduced rich too he thought both her bag and her shoes were leather and expensive and there was the dull glint of real gold at her wrist and ears there was the way she moved that whispered of wealth and privilege her hands might have given away her nerves but her movements were smooth as a dancers she didnt hesitate on the walk obviously she had made up her mind in the car to approach him he caught her scent light quietly seductive over the fragrance of freshcut grass when she smiled his heart nearly stopped shutting off the motor with one hand and dragging off his headphones with the other he stared at her in the sudden quiet springsteen and the e street band could be heard jamming metallically hello im sorry to interrupt your work his mouth went dry it was foolish it was ridiculous but he couldnt stop it that voiceit had played through his head for years sneaking up on him in sleep in front of the television in conversations with other women when he saw her bite her lip he snapped himself together taking off his sunglasses he smiled at her hi emma catch any good waves lately her lips parted in surprise then recognition and pleasure curved them michael she wanted to throw her arms around him the idea made color flutter in her cheeks but she only held out a hand for his its so good to see you again his hand was hard against hers hard and damp he released hers almost immediately to wipe his palm against his worn jeans younever made it back to the beach no she continued to smile but the dimple faded away from the corner of her mouth i never learned to surl i didnt know if youd still be living at home actually im not i lost a bet with my old man so he gets free gardening service for a few weeks he didnt have a clue what to say to her she looked so beautiful so fragile somehow standing on the freshly shorn grass in her expensive italian pumps her pale hair stirring slightly in the light breeze howve you been he managed at last fine and you all right ive seen your picture now and again once you were in one of those ski places saint moritz i guess her eyes were the same he thought big blue and haunted looking into them made his stomach dance are youvisiting around here no well yes actually michael he turned at his mothers voice she stood in the doorway neat as a pin arent you going to ask your friend in for a cold drink sure got a few minutes he asked emma yes i was hoping to speak to your father he felt his hopes deflate like a used party balloon where had he gotten the idea that she had come to see him dads inside he managed to smile gloating emma followed him to the door marge had left open she had a death grip on her purse now and no amount of mental effort could relax her fingers they had their tree up emma glimpsed it standing full of tinsel and shiny balls near the front window there were presents under it neatly wrapped and bowed and sprigs of pine here and there that scented the house the furniture was old not shabby but established a family had shared these pieces she thought had shared them so long they hardly saw them now but settled into the couch or a chair comfortably day after day evening after evening curtains were pulled back to let in the light a trio of african violets bloomed lavishly on a stand by the east window she had taken off her sunglasses and was folding and unfolding the earpieces as she studied the room want to sit down yes thank you i wont stay long i know im disrupting your weekend yeah ive been looking forward to cutting the grass all week he grinned relaxed again and gestured to a chair ill get my father before he could marge walked in carrying a tray crowded with a pitcher of fresh iced tea and glasses and a plate of her homemade sugar cookies here we are michael button your shirt she said casually then set the tray on the coffee table its nice to have one of michaels friends drop by emma this is my mother mom emma mcavoy recognition came swiftly marge worked hard to keep both sympathy and fascination out of her eyes oh yes of course she poured the tea i still have the clipping from the paperwhere you and michael met on the beach mom a mothers allowed she said mildly its nice to meet you at last emma thank you im sorry to just drop in this way nonsense michaels friends are always welcome here emma came to see dad oh the frown in her eyes came and went quickly well hes out in the back making sure michael didnt run down any of his rosebushes ill get him one rosebushwhen i was twelve michael said as he snatched up a cookie and ill never be trusted again try a cookie mom makes the best on the block she took one out of politeness terrified to put anything in her stomach you have a lovely home he remembered his brief tour through the beverly hills mansion where shed spent that summer ive always liked it he leaned over laid a hand on hers whats wrong emma she couldnt have said why that quiet question that gentle hand almost snapped the last of her control it would be so easy to lean on him to pour out her heart and be comforted but that would just be running again im not really sure she rose when lou came in her smile was hesitant vulnerable and for michael devastatingly appealing captain emmaobviously pleased he crossed to her to take both of her hands all grownup she nearly broke down then almost laid her head on his chest and wept as she once had so long ago instead she gripped his hands tightly searching his face youve hardly changed at all thats exactly the kind of flattery a man needs from a beautiful woman she smiled easily this time no really im studying to be a photographer so i try to observe and remember faces its kind of you to see me again dont be silly sit sit he spied the iced tea and chose a glass wanting to give her time to be comfortable is your father in town no she ran her fingers up and down her own glass but didnt drink hes in londonor on his way im living in new york now going to college there i havent been to new york for years he settled back in a striped wing chair that suited him so perfectly emma imagined he rarely sat elsewhere in that room photography you say i remember last time i saw you you had a camera i still have it dad often says he created a monster when he gave me that nikon how is brian hes fine though she was far from sure of that busy of that she was sure then she took a deep breath and plunged into the truth he doesnt know im here i dont want him to why she lifted her hand then helplessly let it fall again hed only be upset and miserably unhappy if he knew id come to see you to talk about darren michael will you give me a hand with something marge started to rise but emma shook her head no please theres no need for you to go its certainly not private i suppose it never has been agitated she set down her glass its only that i wondered if there was something something you might know something the press didnt get their hands on and that i was considered too young to be told at the time ive been able to put it aside for long stretches of time anyway but it never really goes away and last night i remembered what lou leaned forward just a song she murmured a song that was playing that night i remembered hearing it coming from downstairs gs i walked toward daffens room it was all so clear for a moment so clear the song the lyrics darren crying but i cant get to the door you see in my head when i try to remember i can only see myself standing in the hall maybe thats all you did lou frowned into his glass like emma hed been able to put the case aside for long stretches but it always came back he knew the face of that little boy would always haunt him emma we were never sure you went into the room or saw anything at the time you thought you did but you were very confused it was just as likely that you heard something that frightened you ran to the stairs to call your father and fell you were only six and afraid of the dark was and am she thought ive never been able to sort it out you see and i hate not knowing not being sure i couldnt have stopped it saved him i can put your mind at rest there he put the glass aside he wanted her to see him as a cop now an official there were two men in your brothers room that night the nanny claimed that she heard two people whispering as she was being bound the forensic evidence corroborated it the syringe found on the floor of your brothers room contained a sedative a childs dose from what we were able to piece together the time that elapsed between the nanny being bound and your fall was less than twenty minutes it was a bungled attempt emma with tragic results but it was well thought out something happened to confuse their plans to confuse them we may never know what it was but if you had gone into that room had tried to fight them off yourself you wouldnt have been able to save darren and in all likelihood would have been killed as well she hoped he was right she prayed he was right but it did little to soothe her when she left an hour later she promised herself she would try to believe it you have wonderful parents she told michael as he walked her to her car yeah ive almost broken them in he put his hand on the door handle there was no way he was going to let her walk out of his life so quickly again he remembered how she had looked on the beach that dayhad it been five years before shed looked sadsad and beautiful something about her had struck a chord in him then she struck the same one now are you staying in town long she gazed down the street such a pretty neighborhood she could hear children playing a few doors down and the low hum of another mower trimming grben suburban grass she wondered wistfully what it might be like to live in such a place i leave tomorrow he wanted to swear quick trip i have classes monday she looked up feeling as awkward as he he was more attractive than she rememberedthe chipped tooth the slightly crooked nose i wish i had more time what are you doing now i i was going to go for a drive up in the hills he understood and wasnt sure he cared for the idea want some company she started to rerise politely as shed been taught yes very much she heard herself say give me a minute he was off before she could change her mind the screen slammed behind him i as he went into the house then slammed again when he came out he grinned at her as he settled in the passenger seat you saved me from another hours mowing dadll never be able to let it sit like that until i get back too organized glad i could help she drove aimlessly for a while content to let the wind move through her hair listen to the music on the radio pass idle conversation when she heard her fathers voice come clear and strong through the speakers her lips curved does it ever feel weird hearing him er smile widened no not really i knew his voice before i knew him its hard to think of dad without thinking of his music it must be the same for you i mean hes your father but hes a cop im sure its natural for you to think of him wearing a gun or a badge or whatever whatever still it was pretty strange when i first started working for him working for him yeah i caved in he sent her a breezy grin as johnno once said im following in the old mans flat feet youre a cop emma braked at a stop sign and took the opportunity to turn and study him what my fathers fond of calling a rookie he grinned again what have i grown a snout no she sat a moment then drove on it was silly she supposed to have her idea of police focused by her impression of lou and at the other end of the spectrum shows like starsay and hutch its just odd thinking of you that way well thats something i never figured you thought of me at all she laughed of course i did when our picture hit the paper i was the most popular girl at school for weeks of course i exaggerated the whole business for my own benefit so did i he tossed his arm over the seat to play with the ends of her hair i got a date with sue ellen cody on the strength of that clipping alone really she shot him a quick slanted look it was my fifteen minutes of fame i kept hoping youd come back sweeney spilled it to dad she shrugged and that was the end of that do you like being a cop yeah right up to the time i walked into the academy i was sure id hate it but there you go some things are just meant and no matter how many times you walk away you end up where you belonged all along you take this road here if you want to go up to the house she stopped again staring straight ahead how do you know my father used to drive up there id go with him sometimes hed just sit and look i thought you might like to know that hes never forgotten what happened and hes never really accepted that he couldnt find them i think i knew she said slowly thats why i wanted to see him talk with him again she let out a sigh you knew what i intended when i said i was going for a drive i had a pretty good idea why did you come i didnt want you to go alone she stiffened it was only a barely perceptible movement but he sensed her shoulders straightening her chin firming im not fragile michael okay i wanted to be with you she turned his eyes were kind like his fathers but in them she could still see the boy who had driven her home from the beach degree by degree her body relaxed thanks she turned the car and followed his directions the roads didnt seem familiar shed thought they would it occurred to her and made her feel foolish that she would never have found the house on her own they didnt talk now except for michaels occasional turn right bear left but listened to the soft soothing sounds of crosby stills and nash through the car speakers he didnt have to tell her to stop she recognized the house it was like a picture developed and stored in her mind it was very much the same as it had been secluded by trees hedges the winter bloomers of the hills it was rustic as only the wealthy could afford redwood and sheets of glass terraced lawn falling into woods and stream she saw as michael did the sign speared into the ground that proclaimed the house up for sale we could call it fate he said and touched her arm do you want to go in her hands were linked hard in her lap she could see her window her bedroom window where she had once stood with darren and gleefully watched a fox dart through the trees i cant okay we can sit as long as you like she could see herself wading in the stream bev laughing as darren splashed madly in his bare feet and rolledup overalls she remembered a picnic the four of them had shared a blanket spread under a tree her father quietly strumming his guitar bev reading a book while darren dozed in her lap shed forgotten that day how could she have forgotten it it had been such a beautiful day such a perfect day the grass had been cool the sun warm and lazily yellow where it pushed through the leaves the shade soft and gray where it hadnt she could hear her fathers voice and the words hed been singing never too late to look for love never too soon to find it they had been happy emma thought they had been a family then the next day they had given a party and everything had changed yes she said abruptly i want to go in okay look it might be better if they didnt know who you are about the connection i mean she nodded and drove through the open gates michael closed a hand over hers as they stood in front of the door hers was like ice but steady he put on his best smile as the door opened hi we were driving by and saw your sign weve been house hunting for weeks weve got an appointment to see another place in about an hour but we just couldnt resist this it isnt sold yet is it the woman fortyish dressed in countrywear of bass loafers and calvin kjeins took a long cautious look she took in michaels work shirt worn levis and scuffed high tops but she was also sharp enough to note emmas discreetly expensive pumps and the casual ralph lauren skirt and blouse as well as the mercedes convertible parked in the drive she smiled the house had been on the market for five months without a firm offer well actually we do have a prospective buyer but the contract wont be signed until monday her gaze swooped down to the small but elegant diamond and sapphire ring on emmas hand i suppose it wouldnt hurt to show you through she opened the door further lifting a brow as emma hesitated before stepping inside im gloria steinbrenner nice to meet you michael extended a hand and took hers michael kesselring this is emma ms steinbrenner gave them both a dazzling smile the hell with the real estate broker she thought shed opened the door to her own hot prospect and intended to make the most of it the place is in beautiful condition i adore it she detested every board and brick its breaking my heart to sell butto be frankmy husband and i are divorcing so were liquidating oh michael put what he hoped was an appropriately sympathetic but interested look on his face im sorry no need she waved a hand are you from the area no actually were from the valley he said inspired were just dying to get out crowds smog isnt that right emma yes she forced a smile its a beautiful house thank you the living area as you can see is magnificent high ceilings genuine oak beams lots of glass and open space its a working fireplace of course of course emma thought hadnt she sat in front of it the furniture was new and she hated it on sight pretentious modern sculptures and glossy enameled tables where were all the cushions the funny baskets filled with balls of yarn and ribbon that bev had arranged the dining areas through here but this spot in front of the terrace windows is just perfect for cozy little suppers no that wasnt right she thought as she mechanically followed bev had put plants in front of those windows a jungle of plants in old pottery bowls and urns stevie and johnno had brought her a tree once grunting and panting as theyd hauled it in theyd done it as a joke but bev had left it there and bought a silly plaster robin to sit on one of the branches emma what she jolted dragging herself back im sorry oh thats quite all right the woman was delighted that emma seemed to be mesmerized i was just asking if you cooked no not very well the kitchen is uptotheminute i had it remodeled just two years ago she pushed open the swinging doors and gestured all builtins microwave jennair range a convection oven naturally acres of counter space a pantry of course emma stared at the streamlined soulless kitchen it was all white and stainless steel gone were the copper pots bev had kept shiny and hung from hooks there were no more little pots of herbs on the windowsill no high chair for darren no clutter of cookbooks or colorful apothecary jars the woman droned on obviously considering the kitchen her pidce de rdsistance while emma stood grieving when the phone rang she closed a slick white cabinet door excuse me just a moment are you all right michael murmured yes she wanted to be id like to go upstairs listen jack ms steinbrenners voice had lost its cooing flow im not interested in your complaints or your lawyers threats got it michael cleared his throat fxcuse me he offered the woman an easy smile would it be all right if we wandered through she waved them away and snarled into the phone listen asshole sounds like shell be tied up awhile he said lightly you sure you want to go up no she wasnt sure she was anything but sure i cant come this far and not finish right whatever her claims against fragility he put an arm around her shoulders as they started up the doors were openthe bedroom door where her father and bev had once slept where emma had sometimes heard them laughing late at night alices room which had always been so bland and neat had become a sitting room with walls of books and a console television her room she stopped gazing in the dolls were gone the mickey mouse nightlight the frilly pinks and whites that bev had indulged her in no little girl had slept there dreamt there in a very long time it was obviously a guest room now silk flowers a hollywood bed plumped with vivid cushions reading material carefully arranged roman shades had replaced the priscillas she remembered and walltowall carpeting the pretty frivolous shag rug this was my room she said dully there was wallpaper with little roses and violets frilly pink curtains at the windows and a big white quilt for the bed i had dolls on the shelves and music boxes i guess it was the kind of room all little girls want at least for a while bev understood that i dont know why i thought it would be the same he remembered a quote hed read in college one that had stuck all things change nothing perishes he shrugged selfconsciously he wasnt the type of man who quoted it is the same in your head thats what counts she said nothing but turned and looked down the hall to darrens room the door was open too as it should have been that night i was in bed she said flatly something woke me up the music i thought it was the music i couldnt really hear it but i could feel it the bass vibrating i tried to guess what the song was and what people were doing i couldnt wait until i was old enough to stay up for the parties i heard something something she murmured rubbing an annoyed hand on the headache that was building behind her temple i dont know what but ifootsteps she remembered abruptly and her heart began to thud against her ribs i heard someone coming down the hall i wanted it to be dad or bev i wanted them to talk to me for a while maybe i could con them into letting me go downstairs but it wasnt dad or bev easy he could see the sweat heading on her brow and rubbed her hand between both of his just take it slow darren was crying i heard him crying i know it it wasnt a dream i heard him crying i got tip alice had told me not to take charlie in but darren liked to sleep with charlie and he was crying i was going to take charlie into darren and talk to him for a while until he slept again but the hall was dark she looked around now with the sunlight creeping into it from the bedroom windows it was dark but it wasnt supposed to be they always left a light on for me im so afraid of the dark there are things in the dark things he repeated his brows drawing together i didnt want to go out in the hall in the dark but he kept crying i could hear the music now as i stepped into the hall into the dark it was loud and i was frightened she started to walk then dreamlike toward the door i could hear them hissing in the corners scraping along the walls swishing on the rugs hear what he said quietly what did you hear the monsters she turned and looked at him i heard the monsters and i dont remember i dont remember if i went to the door it was closed i know it was closed but i dont know if i opened it she stood on the threshold for an instant she saw the room as she remembered itcluttered with darrens toys painted in bright primary colors his crib his rooker his shiny new tricycle then the picture dissolved into what was there an oak desk and leather chair framed pictures glass shelves crowded with bricabrac an office they had turned her brothers room into an office i ran she said at length i dont remember anything except running and falling you said youd gone to the door you told my father when he saw you in the hospital right after it happened that youd opened the door it was like a dream and now i dont really remember at all it all faded away maybe it was supposed to he was beautiful it hurt too much to face the room he was absolutely beautiful i loved him more than anything or anyone everyone did tears were blurring her vision i need to get out of here come on he led her down the hall down the stairs where she had tumbled that night years before he sent a quick apologetic glance to gloria steinbrenner as she hurried in from the kitchen im sorry my wifes not feeling well oh annoyance and disappointment came first then hope make sure she gets some rest as you can see this house was just made for children you wouldnt want to raise a baby in the valley no he didnt bother to correct her and steered emma out well be in touch he called and took the drivers seat himself if he hadnt been concerned with emmas pale face and the prospect of driving a thirtythousanddollar car he would have noticed the dark blue sedan that trailed after them im sorry she murmured after they started down the winding roads dont be stupid no i am i didnt handle that well you did fine he reached over to give her hand an awkward pat look ive never lost anybody close to me but you only have to be human to imagine what it would be like dont beat yourself up emma put it behind me she drummed up a weak smile i hope i can i thought if i could stand there right there and think about what had happened it would all come back to me since it didnt she shrugged then pushed her sunglasses back on youve been a good friend thats me he muttered always a pal hungry she started to shake her head then stopped yes she realized im starved i can spring for a burger i think he added struggling to remember just what was in his wallet id love a burger and since youve been a pal my treat he pulled into a mcdonalds and since he discovered the contents of his wallet included three singles and the phone number of a redhead he barely remembered he put aside what he told himself was dumb macho pride emma didnt argue with his suggestion that they make it to go or with his casual assumption that he would continue in the drivers seat thought wed take it to the beach id like that she shut her eyes again and leaned back she was glad shed come glad she had climbed those stairs glad she was here with the warm wind in her hair and michael beside her it was sleeting in new york when i left there are colleges in sunny california too she smiled enjoying the breeze on her face i like new york she said absently i always have my roommate and i bought a loft its nearly livable now roommate yes marianne and i went to saint catherines together since her eyes were still closed she didnt notice his look of pleased relief we always swore wed live in new york one day now we do shes taking art classes he decided he was kindly disposed toward marianne she any good yes very one day galleries are going to be cutting their throats to get her paintings she used to do the most incredible caricatures of the nuns she glanced over noting his frown what is it probably just rookiecop instincts on overtime see that sedan just behind us she glanced over her shoulder yes so its been behind us since we picked up the burgers he switched lanes the sedan followed suit id say he was tailing us if he wasnt so stupid about it she let out a long tired sigh its probably sweeney sweeney bodyguard he always finds me sometimes i think dad planted a homing device under my skin yeah it could be i guess it makes sense but he didnt care to be shadowed so amaturely shadowed on what he considered his first date with a longtime crush i could lose him emma tilted down her glasses behind them her eyes glinted with the first real laughter hed seen in her really i could give it my best shot this little babys bound to leave him in the dust do it she said and grinned delighted michael punched the gas cut off a station wagon and peeled up to eighty we used to race on the freewayin my callow and misspent youth he swerved again dodging between a pickup and a bmw then with a twist of the wrist shot in front of a caddy and let the mercedes cruise at ninety youre good laughing emma twisted in her seat and peered at the traffic i cant see him hes back there trying to get around the caddy i pissed the caddy off so hes hogging the road hang on he swerved spun and jockeyed then raced off an exit one illegal uturn and the mercedess powerful engine and he was back on the freeway heading in the opposite direction they whizzed by the sedan slowed to a decorous speed and sailed calmly down another ramp really good at it emma said again did they teach you that at the police academy some skills youre born with he stopped then stroked the steering wheel what a honey emma leaned over and kissed his cheek thanks again before he could respond she had snatched up the bag of burgers and was racing toward the sand i love this still laughing she spun in a circle i really love the water the smell of it the sound of it if they could just plop an ocean down next to broadway id be in heaven he wanted to take hold of her then to grab her in midspin and find out if she tasted nearly as good as she looked then she dropped down on the sand and dug into the bag these smell great too she held one up before she realized he was staring at her what is it nothing but his mouth was dry again i was ah remembering that i once wondered whether you ever got to go to mcdonalds the first time i met you at the rehearsal dad took me for a burger after and i wondered with all the guards if you ever got to go no not really but dad or johnno or someone would sometimes bring takeout dont feel sorry for me she groped in the bag again not today okay hand over the fries they ate hungrily leaving not even a crumb for the gulls the breeze was up carrying a mist of the sea there were other people a few families young girls showing off tans and slender figures the inevitable radios pumping out music but for emma it was one of the most peaceful and secluded interludes of her life i could get used to this she sighed stretched her arms up sitting on the beach listening to the water she shook her head so that her hair rained like gold dust down her back i wish i had more time so do i he had to touch her he couldnt remember not wanting to when he stroked a finger down her cheek she turned her head and smiled what she saw in his eyes had her heart pounding in her throat had her lips parting not so much in surprise as in question she didnt resist as he touched his mouth to hers on a quiet moan she shifted toward him inviting something she didnt completely understand a gentle nip of his teeth had her lips heating when he entered her mouth she heard the low sound of pleasure in his throat felt his hands tense on her arms without hesitation she pressed her body to his and absorbed the sensation would he have believed that it was the first time shed been kissed like this the first time she felt like this warm liquid achingly sweet desire swam into her had she been waiting for this even as she wondered her lashes lowered to help her seal the memory you do he murmured and kissed her again gently because it seemed the right way do what taste as good as you look ive wondered for a long time she had to swallow had to draw back there were feelings growing inside her she didnt know what to do with they were too big and came too fast its the salt confused she rose and stepped closer to the sea it was easy for a man to mistake confusion for casualness he sat where he was giving himself time he had no casual feelings for her stupid as it might have sounded he was in love she was beautiful elegant and certainly accustomed to being wanted by men rich and important men and he was a rookie cop from a middleclass family he let out a long breath rose and tried to be as offhand as she its getting late yes was she crazy emma wondered she wanted to cry and laugh and dance and mourn all at once she wanted to turn to him but tomorrow she would be three thousand miles away he was only being kind she was the poor little rich girl a title she detested and he he was doing something with his life i should be getting back she turned smiled im really glad you went with me today that we had some time ill be around he took her handa friendly gesture he told himself the hell with friendly i want to see you again emma i need to i dont know you can give me a call when you come back the way he was looking at her had her skin going hot then cold i will id like toi dont know when ill make it out here again i thought you might be coming out for the movie movie they had started walking to the car but now he stopped yeah theyre going to start filming in a couple weeks in london i think then here theyre putting on extra security the movie he continued when she just looked blank devastated you know based on your mothers book angies starring in it angie parks he could see by her face that hed made a very large and a very stupid mistake im sorry emma i thought you knew no she said suddenly tired beyond belief i didnt he snatched the phone up before it had completed its first ring hed been waiting and sweating for hours yes i found her the voice and he knew that voice very well trembled lid she went to see the cop kesselring she was with him for over an hour then she went to the house she went to the goddamn house where it happened weve got to do something and do it fast i told you then and im telling you now i wont take the fall for this pull yourself together the tone was brisk but his hand shook slightly as he reached for a cigarette she went to the house she went inside the ticking place is for sale she and the guy she was with strolled right in what guy who was she with some guy the cops son i think all right he noted it down on the pad beside the phone where did they go when they left the house they went to a goddamn hamburger joint the tip of the pencil snapped off i beg your pardon i said they went for burgers then joyriding on the freeway i lost them i know where shes staying tonight i can get somebody to take care of it quick easy dont be an idiot theres no need i told you she saw the cop she went to the house yes i understood you his hand was rocksteady again he poured a drink but not for his nerves for his pleasure think for christs sake if she had remembered something anything would she have calmly ridden off to buy a hamburger i dont think thats your problem and has been from the beginning she didnt remember then she doesnt remember now perhaps this impulsive little trip of hers was a lastditch effort to bring it all back or more likely it was just a sentimental journey theres no need to do emma any harm any harm at all and if she does remember its unlikely listen to me now and listen carefully the first time was an accident a tragic and unforeseen accident one that you committed it was your idea the whole thing was your idea exactly since of the two of us im the only one whos capable of an original thought but it was an accident i have no intention of committing premeditated murder he thought of a session musician whod wanted pizza but didnt remember his name unless its unavoidable understood youre a cold sonofabitch yes he smiled id advise you to remember that it was snowing in london wet thick flakes that slid down collars and melted cold on the skin it was pretty postcard snow unless one was fighting the clogged traffic along kings road emma preferred to walk she imagined sweeney was annoyed with her choice but she couldnt worry about him now she had the address on a slip of paper in the pocket of her thick quilted coat but she didnt need that for a reminder shed memorized it it was odd to be in chelsea as an adult free to walk where she chose she didnt remember it indeed she felt a tourist in london and chelsea the grand stage for punks and sloane rangers was as foreign to her as a venetian canal the streets were dotted with boutiques and antique sholps where lastminute shoppers hurried in their fashionable coats and boots to search out that perfect gift among the horde of offerings young girls laughing their pearls and sweatshirts tucked under their jackets young boys trying to look tough and bored and worldly despite the snow there had been a flower seller in sloane square even in december spring could be bought for a reasonable price shed been tempted by the color and the scent but had walked on without digging in her purse for pounds and shillings how odd it would have been to have walked up to the door and offered a bouquet to her mother her mother she could neither deny nor accept jane palmer as her mother even the name seemed distant to herlike something she had read in a book but the face lingered the face that came in odd sporadic flashes in dreams the face that flushed dark with annoyance before a slap or a shove was administered the face from articles in people and the enquirer and the post a face from the past emma thought and what did the past have to do with today then why had she come the question drummed in her head as she walked along the narrow wellkept street to resolve something that should have been resolved years before emma wondered if jane thought it a fine joke to have moved into the posh and prosperous area where oscar wilde whistler and thrner had lived writers and artists had always flocked to chelsea and musicians emma mused mick jagger had a home here or hed had one it hardly mattered to emma whether he and the stones were still in residence there was only one person shed come to see perhaps it was the contrasts that appealed to jane chelsea was punk and domestic it was relaxed and frenetic and it cost the earth to live in one of the stylish homes or perhaps janes reason had something to do with the fact that bev had established herself in the same district that too hardly mattered she stopped clenching and unclenching her hand on the strap of her bag while the snow drifted and clung to her hair and shoulders the house was a long way from the tiny walkup flat where she had lived with jane it pretended to be old but the fussy copy of a victorian row house missed the mark by inches someone had decided to add cupolas and tall narrow windows it might have been charming in its way but curtains were drawn tight and the walk had yet to be shoveled or swept no one had bothered to hang a wreath or a string of lights it made her think wistfully of the kesselring home there had been no seasonal snow in california but the house had offered the warmth and cheer that meant christmas then again emma thought she wasnt coming home for christmas she wasnt coming home at all taking a deep breath emma pushed through the gate and waded through the snow to the front door there was a knocker against the ornately carved wood she stared at it half expecting the brass lions head to dissolve and reform into the battered countenance of jacob marley perhaps it was the season or the ghosts of her childhood that made her fanciful with hands icy inside her furlined gloves she lifted it just an old brass lions head and let it fall against the wood when there was no response she knocked again hoping there was no one to hear if no one answered could she tell herself shed done her best to erase jane and the need to see her from her mind and her heart she desperately wanted to run away from the house that pretended to be something it wasnt from the brass lions head from the woman who never seemed to be completely out of her life as she stood ready to turn away in relief the door swung open she couldnt speak could only stare at the woman in the red silk robe that dipped carelessly over one shoulder strained over hips that had spread beyond lush her hair was a blond tangle around a wide doughy face a strangers face it was the eyes emma recognized and remembered the narrowed angry eyes reddened now from drink or drugs or lack of sleep well in deference to the cold air jane hitched the robe up there was the glitter of diamonds on her fingers and to emmas horror the stink of stale gin look lovey i got better things to do on a saturday afternoon than stand in the doorway who the hell is it the annoyed male roar came from the second floor jane cast a bored glance olver her shoulder hang on will you she shouted back well she turned back to emma you can see im busy go she thought frantically just turn around and walk away id like to speak with you emma heard her own voice but it sounded like a strangers im emma jane didnt move but her eyes changed narrowing further struggling to focus she saw a young woman tall slender with a pale delicate face and flowing blond hair she saw brianthen her daughter for an instant she felt something almost like regret then her lips curved well well well little emma come home to her mam want to talk to me she gave a quick high laugh that caused emma to jolt and brace for a slap but jane merely stepped back from the doorway come right on in dear well have ourselves a chat jane was already calculating as she led the way down the hall into a cluttered parlor made dim by the thick curtains there was a scent thereold liquor stale smoke that wasnt tobacco it seemed they hadnt come so far from the old flat after all her annual check from brian would soon stop and no amount of threatening or wheedling would pry another pence from him but there was the girl her own little emma a woman had to think ahead jane decided when she had expensive tastes and an expensive habit how about a drink ib celebrate our reunion no thank you with a shrug jane poured a glass for herself when she turned back the red silk shifted over her plump hips to family ties she offered raising her glass then she laughed when emma looked down at her hands imagine finding you at my door after all these years she drank deeply then topped off the glass before sitting on a sofa of purple velvet sit down emma luy and tell me all about yourself theres nothing to tell stiffly emma sat on the edge of a chair im only in london for the holidays holidays ah christmas she grinned tapping a chipped nail against the glass did you bring your mama present emma shook her head she felt like a child again terrified and lonely the least you could have done after all these years was bring your mother a little gift with a wave of her hand jane settled back never mind you never were a considerate child all grownup now arent you she eyed the quiet diamond studs in emmas ears and done well for yourself too fancy schools fancy clothes im in college now emma said helplessly i have a job a job what the hell do you want with a job your old mans got nothing but money i like it she hated the fact that she couldnt control the stutter i want to work you never was a bright kid frowning jane tossed back more gin when i think of all the years i scrimped and saved and did without to put dresses on your back and food in your belly never a bit of gratitude from you she reached for the gin bottle and slopped more into her glass just sniveling and crying then going off with your father without a backward glance been living high havent you my girl daddys little princess not a thought for me in all these years ive thought of you emma murmured jane tapped her fingers against the glass again she wanted to get her stash take a quick fix but was afraid if she left the room emma would disappear and her chance would be lost he poisoned you against me selfpitying tears began to fall he wanted you all to himself when i was the one who went through the misery of childbirth the misery of raising a kid on my own i couldve gotten rid of you you know even then it was simple enough if you knew the right people emma lifted her eyes then dark and intense they fixed on her mothers face why didnt you jane gripped her hands on the glass they were beginning to shake she hadnt had a hit in hours and gin was a poor substitute but she was shrewd too shrewd to admit that shed been more frightened at the prospect of a backalley abortion than of childbirth in a clean hospital ward i loved him and because she believed it it sounded true i always loved him we grew up together you know and he loved me was devoted to me if it hadnt been for his music his stinking career we would have been together but he tossed me aside like it was nothing he never cared about anyone or anything but his music do you think he cared about you she rose lumbering a bit under the gin he never gave a damn it was just his image wouldnt want the bloody public to think brian mcavoy was the kind of man to abandon his own child the old doubts the old fears sprang up so quickly she had to force the words out he loves me hes done everything for me he loves brian jane braced her hands on the arms of emmas chair and leaned close there was a glitter in her eyes pure pleasure she could do very little to hurt brian nowgod knew shed tried whatever had come to mind to cause him pain but she could hurt emma and that was the nextbest thing he wouldve walked right out on the pair of us if it hadnt been for the scandal thats just what he started to do until i threatened to go to the papers she didnt mention the threat to kill herself and emma in truth it had been so unimportant shed forgotten it he knew and that worthless piss of a manager knew what would have happened if the press had started whining about rocks hottest flame leaving his bastard child in the slums he knew so he took you and he paid me a handsome sum to keep out of your life she felt sick sick from the words sick from the smell that struck out at her when jane spoke them he paid you i earned it jane took emmas chin in her fingers and squeezed i earned every pound and more he bought you and his peace of mind the price was cheap enough for him but he never got it did he never could buy that peace of mind let go of me emma gripped janes wrist and shoved it away dont touch me again youre as much mine as his no she pushed herself out of the chair praying her legs would hold her no you sold me and any claims to motherhood you might have had he may have bought me jane but he doesnt own me either she fought back the tears she wouldnt cry here not in front of this woman i came here today to ask you to stop the movie the one theyre making from your book id hoped that you might have some feelings for me enough that youd respect my wishes in this one thing but ive wasted my time from up the the stairs janes current lover began to bellow curses im still your mother jane shouted you cant change that no i cant i just have to learn to live with it she turned walking quickly to the door you want me to stop the movie jane snatched at emmas arm how badly do you want it stopped deadly calm emma turned back she took one long last look do you think id pay you youve miscalculated this time jane youll never get a penny out of me bitch janes hand cracked across her cheek emma didnt bother to dodge it she simply opened the door and walked away she wmdered for a long time dodging shoppers and dog walkers ignoring the laughter the gunning motors and the frantic christmas cheer around her the tears never fell it amazed her how easily they were controlled now perhaps the cold helped or the noise it made it so easy not to think at all so when she found herself standing in front of bevs door she wasnt completely aware of having walked there or having intended to she knocked quickly it wasnt the time to think it wasnt the time to feel it was she told herself the time to tie up all the loose ends and get on with her life the door opened warm air and christmas carols the scent of pine and welcome with the snow swirling at her back emma stared down at alice how odd it was she thought to look down at her old nanny time had made her taller and alice older she saw recognition flicker in alices eyes and the nannys lips quiver hello alice her own lips were stiff as she forced them into a smile its nice to see you again alice stood where she was as tears began to spurt out of her eyes ajice dont forget to give terry that package if he makes it by bev came hurrying down the hall a dark mink over her arm ill be home by she stopped the little black bag she held slipping out of her nerveless hands emma she whispered they stood four feet apart with the weeping alice between them bev felt the pleasure first the need to rush forward and grab emma close then she felt the shame i should have called emma began i was in town so i thought id im so glad you did recovered bev smiled and stepped forward alice her voice was gentle as she placed a hand on the womans shoulder well need some tea youre on your way out emma said quickly i dont want to disrupt your plans it doesnt matter alice she repeated the woman nodded and hurried down the hall youre so grownup bev murmured she gripped her hands together to keep herself from reaching out to touch its hard to believebut you must be freezing steadying she took emmas gloved hand in hers come in please you have plans a clients party its not important id really like you to stay her fingers tightened on emmas while her eyes searched almost hungrily over the girls face please of course for a few minutes ill take your coat they settled like two polite strangers in bevs bright spacious parlor this is beautiful emma pasted on a practiced smile id heard you were making a splash with decorating i can see why thank you oh god what should she say what should she not say my roommate and i bought a loft in new york were still having it done she cleared her throat glancing toward the fire smoldering in the stone hearth i had no idea it was so complicated you always made it look so easy new york bev said folding and unfolding her hands in her lap youre living there now yes im going to nycc photography oh do you like it very much will you be in london long until just after the first the next pause was long and awkward both women glanced over in relief as alice wheeled in the tea caddy thank you alice ill pour the tea bev put a hand over alices briefly and squeezed she stayed with you emma commented when they were alone again yes or i suppose its more that we stayed with each other it helped to have the tea the pot the cups the pretty little biscuits arranged on a shvres platter she had no thirst no appetite but the mechanics the simple civilized mechanics of serving the tea relaxed her do you still take too much cream and sugar in your tea no ive been americanized there were fresh flowers in a blue vase tulips emma wondered if bev had bought them from the flower seller in the square or if shed forced them herself now its just too much sugar brian and i were always afraid youd be fat and toothless with your penchant for sweets bev began then winced and struggled to find an easy topic of conversation so tell me about your photography what sort of pictures do you like to take i prefer shots of people character portraits i suppose more than abstracts or still lifes im hoping to make a career of it thats wonderful id love to see some of your work she cut herself off again perhaps the next time im in new york emma studied the christmas tree in front of the window it was covered with hundreds of tiny handpainted ornaments and lacy white bows she hadnt bought a present for bev no shiny wrapped box that could sit under the tree but perhaps there was something she could give why dont you ask how he is bev emma said gently it would be easier for both of us bev shifted her gaze to meet emmas eyes those beautiful dark blue eyes so like her fathers how is he i wish i knew his musics going better than ever the last concert tour well you probably know about all of that yes hes scoring a film and talking about doing a conceptual album then the videos you could almost believe music videos were made with dad in mind everything comes across just as it does in concert she paused then blundered on hes drinking too much ive heard that too bev said quietly pms worried about him but theyfor the last few years their relationships been strained i want to talk him into a clinic emma gave a quick restless shrug but he wont listen he can see it in steviebut then its so hard to miss there its difficult to reason with him about it because it hasnt affected his work his creativity or even his health to this point but youre worried yes yes i am bevs smile was softer easier a ghost of the one emma remembered is that why you came partly i suppose there seem to be a lot of parts to why i came emma i swear to you if i thought i could help if i thought there was anything i could do anything at all i would edwhy she picked up her cup to give herself time to choose her words brian and i shared a great deal no matter how long its been no matter how much hurt you dont forget all those feelings do you hate him no no of course i dont and me oh emma with a quick shake of her head emma rose i didnt mean to ask you that i didnt mean to bring all of this back its just that all at once ive felt unfinished somehow i dont know what i thought i would accomplish today she stared down at the fire that crackled sedately in the hearth i went to see jane bevs cup clattered against her saucer before she managed to still her hands oh with a laugh emma dragged at her hair yes oh i felt that i had to that seeing her would help clear up my feelings and foolishly that i might influence her to put a stop to the film theyre making from her book she turned back you cant know what its like to look at her to see her for what she is and know shes my mother i dont know what to say to you emma but the truth she studied emma a moment perhaps there was something she could do some small thing to redeem the mistake she had made all those years ago she set down her cup folded her hands when she spoke her voice was very calm and very sure youre nothing like her nothing you were nothing like her when you came to us nothing like her now she sold me to dad oh god bev pressed both hands to her face then let them drop it wasnt like that emma he gave her money she took it i was like some piece of merchandise they passed between them and foisted off on you no she sprang up clattering china thats a cruel thing to say and a stupid one yes he paid her hed have paid her whatever it took to keep you safe she said he did it to preserve his image shes a liar she walked over took both of emmas hands you listen to me i remember the day he brought you home the way you looked the way he looked he was nervous maybe even frightened but he was determined to do what was right for you not because of some bloody public image but because you were his and every time he looked at me every time you looked you must have seen her not btian never brian she sighed and putting an arm around emmas shoulders lowered to the sofa maybe i did at first i was young christ the same age you are now we were wildly in love planning to be married i was pregnant with darren and then suddenly there you werea part of brian id had nothing to do with i was terrified of you maybe i even resented you the truth was i didnt want to feel anything for you oh maybe a little pity when emma pulled away bev took her by the shoulders i didnt want to love you emma then suddenly i just did i didnt plan it i didnt stop one day and tell myself that you deserved a chance i just fell in love with you emma broke down then dropping her head onto bevs shoulder and weeping weeping brokenly shamelessly as the fire crackled and bev stroked her hair im so sorry luy so sorry i havent been there for you now youve grown up and ive missed my chance i thought you hated mebecause of darren no oh no you blamed me no bev drew back stunned good god emma you were a child i blamed her and i was wrong i blamed myself and i pray i was wrong but ihatever unforgivable things i did or thought i never blamed you i heard m crying ssh she gripped emmas hands bringing them up to her cheek shed had no idea emma had suffered this way if she had bev closed her eyes for a moment if she had she hoped she would have been strong enough to have put her own pain aside for the childs sake listen to me it was the most horrible thing thats ever happened in my life the most destructive the most painful i lashed out at the people i should have been holding close the first few years after darrens death i was i hardly knew what or where i was in and out of therapy contemplating suicide wishing i could find the courage to end it there was something about him emma something special something almost magical sometimes i couldnt believe hed come from me and when he was gone like that so quickly so cruelly so needlessly it was as if someone had taken out my heart there was nothing i could do i had lost my child and then in my grief i turned away from my other child and i lost her i loved him too so much i know she smiled gently oh i know and you ive missed you i never thought i would see you again or that youd be able to forgive me it amazed her forgiveness for years emma had thought she was the one who would never be forgiven now with a few words the rawness she had carried with her all day eased and she was able to smile when i was little i used to think you were the most beautiful woman in the world emma leaned forward rested her cheek against bevs i still do would you mind if i called you mum again emma felt the shaky sigh as bev gripped her tightly wait here a minute i have something for you alone emma groped in her bag for a tissue resting against the cushions she dried her eyes he henther had always been and would always be bev perhaps at last this was one quest she could put behind her ive saved him for you bev said as she came back into the room or maybe i saved him for myself he helped me through some very lonely nights with a cry of pleasure emma sprang up charlie twentytwo orchestra players including violins cellos flutes bassoons and a harpist crowded into the recording studio a couple of assistants had taken considerable time and trouble to decorate there were shiny red balls hanging from the ceiling boughs of pine draped on the walls and an aluminum tree just tacky enough to be amusing revolving on a stand in the corner johnno had mixed together what he grandly termed a wassail after hed drunk two cups and survived others were luted into sampling no one was drunk yet but there was plenty of cheer being passed about theyd been working on a single song for over four hours and brian was nearly satisfied with the cut through his headphones he listened to the last take it still amazed him that a song once only a vague melody in his mind could take on such a clear and powerful life of its own there were still times when he listened to what he had helped create that he felt an echo of the thrill hed experienced in writing his first song he could see pete standing in the engineering booth annoyed and impatient as always with brians nitpicking perfectionism brian didnt give him a second thought and let the music wash over him johnno was playing poker with one of the flutists and the stunning slenderfingered harpist johnno had unearthed a green visor from somewhere and livened up the game with straightforward cheating and wild betting pm was reading what appeared to be a paperback mystery a lurid one if one could tell a book by its cover he seemed to prefer his own company and a couple of grisly murders at the moment stevie was in the bathroom again his last attempt at coming clean had lasted less than a week after hed elecked himself out of the newest clinic they were satisfied brian thought an a more than ready to call it a day he listened to the final sustained iote i want to do the vocals again johnno pulled in the pot who said you couldnt draw to an inside straight he sent the harpist a lusty wink with a laugh she handed over a fivepound note how did you know hed want another take i know my boy johnno told her he rose and lifted a fist toward the engineering booth like brian he noted petes irritated scowl and ignored it once more into the breech you cant want another one son stevie lurched into the studio he was flying high now pumped full of topgrade cocaine with a heroin chaser dont you know what day it is its christmas tucking eve not for a couple of hours yet brian buried his irritation sad as it was theyd get a good twenty minutes out of stevie before he crashed lets get it done so you can go home and hang up your stocking well look whos here stevie announced as emma slipped into the studio its our little girl he swung an arm around her shoulder okay emma luy whos the best she managed to smile and kiss his thin bony cheek dad nothing but coal in your stocking pet i thought youd still be here because stevies arm was still around her she walked with him to the mike she could feel him vibrate like a tightly strung wire is it all right if i listen for a while tickets are five pence and two noting her distress johnno gently disengaged stevie but seeing its christmas well forget the shillings we wont be much longer brian stated he said the same thing two hours ago johnno gave her a quick reassuring squeeze the mans a maniac were turning him in right after the audition brian put out his cigarette then cleared his throat with plain water just the vocals on lost the sun the twentieth take of the vocals pm put in he was pleased when emma brushed her lips over his cheek sorry to take you away from your dip into literature brian snapped automatically emma shifted to stand between them as she shrugged out of her coat lost the sun she repeated im in luck then thats my favorite of this lot good you can sing backup she laughed at johnno then started to take her seat no wait brian grabbed her arm grinning thats it thats what we need he was already signaling for another set of headphones you come in on the second verse dad i couldnt of course you could you know the lyrics the melody yes but its perfect i dont know why i didnt think of it before this song needs a feminine touch keep it light just a little sad no use arguing johnno said as he fit the headphones over her ears hes on a roll emma let out a sigh it wouldnt hurt to humor him whats my percentage do i get a mention in the liner notes what about artistic control brian twisted her nose hard it was enough to see him happy she thought there was nothing like a new idea to send her father off he was calling out instructions deferring to johnno now and again keeping what seemed like an eagle eye on stevie and subtly staying aloof from pm she heard the music in her head the sad and moody strings and flutes it was a full almost classical sound like rain she realizednot a storm but a gray unrelenting rain her fathers voice flowed into her ears clear and somehow sweet despite the melancholy lyrics i looked for your face i called your name you were the light but shadows covered me i lost the sun she listened struck as she had always been by the close almost eerie harmony he achieved with johnno her fathers voice soared up hanging on notes caressing them the sad hopeless lyrics went straight to her heart why its bev she realized all at once he was singing about bev to bev emmas eyes widened as her gaze fixed on brian why hadnt she seen it before why hadnt she understood he was still in love not resentful or angry but miserably in love she didnt think but only felt as she did what he had asked and added her voice to his she didnt realize that johnno had backed off leaving her and her father alone it wasnt a planned gesture when she reached out to take his hand she wasnt aware that tears had spilled over to cling to her lashes her voice melded with his as her heart did my life is shadows without you without you dreaming of the light i wake to darkness i lost the sun as the music swelled and faded she lifted his hand to her cheek i love you dad he brushed his lips over hers fighting the need to let his own tears go lets hear the playback he called out it was nearly one before the session musicians began to file out the best part of another hour passed before brian was satisfied with the overdubbing emma watched her father pour a tumbler full of chivas regal and drink it like water over a technical discussion with an engineer she didnt want to be upset by it not now not when she was beginning to understand some of his pain but neither could she sit calmly and watch while he doused that pain with whiskey she wandered out then detoured to the bathroom to freshen her makeup there had been some talk about winding down at a local club tired or not she was going to go along and keep an eye on her father when she opened the door she could only stand in speechless shock the pristine white tiles were streaked with blood the smell of it cold and metallic mixed with the raw stink of vomit had her throat slamming shut so that she reached up with her hand pressing and squeezing to clear it she backstepped quickly nearly tripping before she managed to turn and race back into the studio daill he was finishing up his drink with one hand while struggling into his coat the flush of success was on his face but the laughter at something johnno had said died when he saw emma what is it whats wrong in the loo quick she grabbed his hand to drag him with her its all over the walls i donti cant go in she stood back gripping johnnos arm as brian pushed open the door goddamnit after one quick glance he slammed the door again get somebody to clean this up he snapped to pete taking emmas arm he started to haul her back into the studio clean it up she pulled away from him dad for gods sake theres blood all over the walls someones been hurt we have to get your coat and lets go go we have to call the police or a doctor or ease down emma pete murmured theres no need to call the police no need she spun on him then her father we have to call

a needle into any available vein and not lose some blood my god a horrible afterimage of the redstreaked walls flashed into her mind hes doing that to himself hes killing himself very likely why arent you doing something about it what the hell am i supposed to do snatching up her coat he dragged it over her arms its his life thats a despicable thing to say she whispered stepping in as peacemaker pete touched her shoulder you cant blame brian emma hes tried i promise you weve all tried as soon as the album is finished well convince him to go into detox again as soon as the albums finished she repeated the bloody album revolted she swung back to her father hes your friend yes hes my friend he didnt bother to tell her of the times hed begged stevie to get help of the times hed covered up the problem by disposing of needles and mopping up blood you dont understand emma no i dont after one last look she turned away im going home emma torn he turned back to stare helplessly at stevie go on along pm told him and half lifted stevie to his feet ill get him to bed right brian caught up with emma outside the snow had stopped and the moon had come out to shine blue light automatically he clamped his coat together to shut out the keen wind emma he laid a hand on her shoulder it was enough to stop her but she didnt turn i dont blame you for being upset i know its a shock to see something like that to know that someone you care about is into that sort of thing yes she took a deep breath before she turned to face him her eyes were very clear yes it is i dont use needles emma i never have there was a quick wave of relief but she shook it away and everything else is all right he dragged a frustrated hand through his hair im not saying its right or wrong im just saying its reality not my kind of reality i know and im glad of it he cupped her face in his hand emma if i could id shield you from everything that hurts or upsets you i dont want to be shielded i dont need to be they both turned as pm and johnno carried stevie out to a waiting car is that the kind of life you want is that what youve worked for what youve dreamed of she made him ashamed by asking made him furious because he wasnt sure of the answer i cant explain it emma but i know you dont get everything you want and you sure as hell dont get everything you dream of she turned away again but didnt leave gently he pressed a kiss to her hair they didnt speak as they walked to the car like a shadow sweeney fell in behind them living near hollywood all his life hadnt spoiled the fantasy and glamour for michael he appreciated starwatching as much as the next guy nor did he mind spending a few days in february working crowd control and security for the filming of devastated it had been a disappointment that angie parks hadnt been involved in the early location shots still he enjoyed watching the twin girls who were playing emma casting had done a remarkable job of finding a pair of kids who resembled emma of course emma had been prettier he thought was prettier her eyes were bluer bigger and her mouth it didnt do him a hell of a lot of good to think about her mouth it was a better idea to concentrate on his jobwhich was not as some of the vets had sneeringly called it pansy duty fans turned out day after day the hardcore devastation fans werent pleased with jane palmers book or the fact that it was to be a movie some carried banners or placards others just booed there were a few wearing leather and sporting mohawks and dog collars who looked as thought they would have enjoyed knocking heads with the cops added to them were clutches of young girls who shrieked and giggled every time matt holden came in view the young actor who played brian mcavoy was the current teen dream michael had had his ankle kicked his shoulder bruised and his uniform wept on by adoring fans glamour my ass he thought as he stood on the studio lot the sun was high and hazy the airquality index was in the disgusting range even for la michael thought the producers had decided it would make good press to invite some of the fans to observe a few days shooting play extras fill in the background security had enough trouble keeping the mobs back behind a police line now with people free to mill around what stood in for a london cross street every muscle had to stay on alert then there she was angie parks the lusty busty movie queen who redefined the term hot sex the press had already fallen gleefully on the irony of pm fergusons exwife playing the role of brian mcavoys exlover men broke into sweats as she walked by in her snug skirt and cotton blouse her hair was brushed srooth puffed at the crown tipped up at the ends in the fashion of the early sixties she smiled at the fansa friendly gesture but more aloof than a wave after a huddle with her director and her costar they were set for the first runthrough it was simple enough jane and brian were walking down the dingy street arms tight around each others waist there was a sense of romance as well as intimacy as the morning wore on they repeated that stroll for different camera angles for closeups when janes face was tipped adoringly toward her lovers it wasnt until the lunch break that michael noticed angie staring at him abruptly his collar seemed too tight and his brow under the shade of his cap pearled with sweat he watched her murmur something to one of the assistants that hovered then stroll off on the arm of her director they ran the dialogue later in the day the same walk the same movements for the life of him michael couldnt remember what was being said something about undying love promises of devotion plans for the future he only knew that between every take angie sent him one long level look each time she did his stomacfi muscles jolted she was coming on to him michael thought with a dull throbbing excitement that bordered on raw fear and she wasnt being subtle about it despite his fascination with her he hadnt missed the envious glances and rude remarks of the other officers on security duty still it was a shock when the scene was wrapped and she signaled him by crooking one long finger my trailers over there i beg your pardon my trailer she smiled the slow seductive smile hed seen a halfdozen times on the screen her mouth was painted a bright pink for the scene watching him she flicked out her tongue and ran it over her top lip i have to change and get out of makeup you can wait outside but youre taking me home she said and began to walk miss parks im ah on duty yes youre assigned to me now she smiled again enjoying that particular phrase ive been getting some threatening lettersabout this role i feel so much safer having a strong man around she paused flashing that smile as she signed a few autographs the producers arranged it with your superiors this afternoon she slanted a loyk at him under her lashes then strolled off to her trailer where she was immediately surrounded by a bevy of assistants michael stood where he was kesselring michael blinked then focused on the wide red face of sergeant cohen sergeant youre to escort miss parks home until your orders change youre to pick her up every morning drive her to the studio then accompany her back to her residence cohen didnt like the arrangement it was obvious from the way he bit off the words michael thought if the man hadnt been in uniform he would have spat on the street yes sir i expect you to conduct yourself in an appropriate manner yes sir michael was careful to keep the grin off his face until cohen turned away she came out of the trailer thirty minutes later wearing a loose red jumpsuit cinched at the waist with a studded leather belt her scent flowed with hera hot heady fragrance designed to make a mans mouth water her hair was attractively tousled her eyes hidden behind oversized sunglasses she tipped them down to take another long look at michael then waited beside the patrol car until he opened the door for her she gave him the address then closed her eyes and remained chillingly silent along the drive long before they had reached the gates to her estate michael had decided hed mistaken her intentions he felt both relieved and foolish hadnt he heard that she was having a screaming affair with her costar of course a lot of that gossip was just speculation and publicity but it certainly made more sense for her to be attracted to an upandcorner like matt holden than a lowly uniformed cop she signaled the guard at the gate so that theornately worked wroughtiron swung majestically open michael remembered driving to the house before emma beside him in the old chevelle their surfboards strapped to the roof it made him smile a little and regret she wasnt going to be a part of his life except in his own fantasies conscious of his duty he got out rounded the hood and opened the passenger door come in officer maam i come in she repeated then moved up the steps in her patented style she left the door wide for him to close then walked through the foyer without a backward glance angie didnt doubt he would follow men always followed after tossing her sunglasses aside she turned into what she liked to call the drawing room she opened a louis quinze cabinet and removed two glasses scotch or bourbon she knew he was in the doorway hesitating im on duty he murmured his eyes were drawn and she had known they would be to the fulllength portrait over the fireplace hed seen it before standing in the same spot with emma beside him of course its comforting to know you take your duty seriously she turned to the bar chose a soft drink and poured it into a glass you do take your duty seriously dont you yes smiling angie held the glass up youre allowed a coke right id like to talk with you for a few minutes get to know you she took a sip from her own drink her eyes steady over the rim since youre going to be taking care of me for a while come on she ran her tongue over her top lip angie considered each word each move another strand in the web she enjoyed weaving there was nothing more satisfying than catching a man in the soft sticky web of sex i wont bite she waited until hed accepted the glass before she spread herself on the sofa it couldnt be called sitting she arched her back into the corner plumped with cushions stretched her arm lazily over the back the silk of her jumpsuit rustled quietly as she crossed her legs sit down she sipped her drink again beneath the practiced seductive smile an excitement was building he was so young and lean his body would be hard as rock and hed be eager once she eased him over his initial shynessthat itself an attractionhed be beautiful she decided he was just into his middle twenties and able to fuck for hours angie wagged her fingers at the neighboring cushion tell me about yourself he sat because he felt like an idiot standing in the middle of the room with a glass of coke in his hand he wasnt stupid his initial impression of her intentions had been right on the mark the problem was he wasnt sure what he wanted to do about it secondgeneration cop he began native californian he drank telling himself he was relaxed for christs sake he was twentyfour if the amazing ms parks wanted to flirt he could oblige her and a fan he smiled angie nearly purred really ive seen all your movies once again his gaze was drawn to the portrait do you like it yeah its stunning her movements slow and fluid she reached over to pluck a cigarette from a lalique holder she held it up watching him until he remembered himself and reached for the matching table lighter help yourself she told him indicating the cigarettes he was already planning on what he would tell the guys in the locker room theyd drool with envy at the thought of him sitting on angie parkss sofa ive seen it before whats that the portrait he drew smoke in and nearly relaxed its funny when you think of it i was here seven or eight years ago i guess with emma angies gaze sharpened mcavoy yeah i ran into her on the beach one summer wed met a few years before that i gave her a lift home well here i think you were in europe filming mmmm she considered the idea a moment then smiled it made it all the more interesting somehow here she was on the verge of seducing one of little emma mcavoys friendsand playing emmas mama in what was sure to be the hottest movie of the year and it would be all the more interesting to think of herself as jane while they made love small world she set her glass aside to lean forward and toy with the buttons of his shirt do you see much of emma no well actually i saw her last month when she was in town isnt that sweet the first button popped open are you two involved no that is no miss parks angie she blew a light stream of smoke in his face then crushed out her cigarette and what is your name darling michael michael kesselring i dont her movements stopped kessetring any relation to the investigating officer on the mcavoy murder hes my father miss she laughed then long and loud and delighted better and better lets call it fate michael her hand slid up his thigh relax he wasnt stupid and he wasnt dead when she closed her hands over him the pleasure speared through him like a heated blade and so did the guilt it was ridiculous he told himself she was gorgeous dangerousevery mans darkest fantasy hed had his share of women starting with caroline fitzgerald on the night before his seventeenth birthday theyd lost their virginity together sweatily and clumsily hed learned a lot since good old caroline angie slipped the cigarette from his fingers leaving it to smolder in the ashtray as he hardened against her palm he was going to be sweet she thought so very sweet and the ironythe irony was beautiful ive never had a cop she murmured as she nipped at his lip youll be the first he felt the breath back up in his lungs thick and hot he shook his head to clear it he had one flash achingly lucid of sitting with emma on the winter beach then angie stood up with a flick of her hands she unsnapped her belt she had only to shrug her shoulders to have the red silk slithering to the floor beneath it her body was white and lush and naked she ran her hands over it lingering caressing as adoringly as a lover before he could find the strength to stand she was straddling him on a groan of pleasure she pressed his mouth against one perfect polished breast do things to me she murmured do anything you like the supermarket tabloids had a field day angie parkss rookie lover the inside story trungle of passion and murier in hollywood they leaped on the connection with the mcavoys and played it like a brass band in new york emma tried to ignore the gossip and prayed it wasnt based in fact it was none of her business she reassured herself as she spent hours in her darkroom michael was no more than a friendan acquaintance really they had no actual ties and certainly no relationship except for the kiss they had shared she was romanticizing one kiss meant nothing she hadnt let it couldnt let it even if she had feltshe wasnt sure what she had felt it hardly mattered if michael had indeed been drawn into angies web she could only feel sorry for him the idea of feeling betrayed was ludicrous they each had their own life he on one coast she on the other and she was at last at long last doing something with hers she was working for runyun she might be a lowly assistant but she was runyons lowly assistant in the past ten weeks shed learned more from him than she had learned in years of classes stacks of books working by the glow of her red light she gently moved a print in the developing fixer she was getting better and she intended to be better yet one day she thought she would give runyun a run for his money professionally she was going exactly where she wanted to go personally her life was in upheaval her mother how could she explain what it felt like to know that the woman she had faced in the dim room in london had given birth to her would she ever be able to separate and understand her feelings and her fears no matter what reassurances bev had given her shed never be able to shake the greatest fear of all could she be like jane deep down were there seeds that would sprout one day changing her from what she wanted to be into what she had been born to be a drunk a cheap bitter drunk how could she escape a fate that rushed at her from all sides her mother her grandfather her father no matter how she blinded herself to it she had to accept that the man she loved most was as much a slave to drink as the woman she wanted to hate it terrified her she didnt want to believe it she was afraid not to no good it did no good to dwell on it she told herself and hung the rinsed print to dry emma studied it critically before moving back to her enlarger since she was sick of worrying about herself she decided to worry about marianne emma knew her friend had taken to cutting classes meeting robert blackpool for lunch or drinks in whatever spot was currently trendy from there they would often crawl the clubselaines studio danceteriawhere blackpool could be seen there were nights marianne came in at dawn shadoweyed and bubbling with stories worse were the nights blackpool stayed in the apartment in mariannes studio in mariannes bed with all her heart she wanted to wish for mariannes happiness marianne was happy she was wildly in love for the first time with a man who by all appearances adored her she was living the exciting glittery and decadent life they had both pined for while trapped within saint catherines prim walls it annoyed emma to find herself jealous and critical she resented not having marianne to talk to and called herself petty it irritated her to see the glow of lovemaking on mariannes face and she called herself spiteful but with all that aside emma couldnt make herself comfortable with mariannes romance he was a gorgeous exciting and talented man there was no denying that especially as she studied the drying prints she had agreed with mariannes urging to photograph blackpool he had been a perfect gentleman emma remembered at ease amusing flatteringin the platonic manner suited to her roommates lover lover with a wistful little sigh emma frowned at the prints perhaps that was the crux of it she and marianne had shared everything every thought every deed every dream for over ten years this was something they couldnt share and mariannes bubbling happiness was a ruba constant reminder of something emma had never experienced that was something to be ashamed of she thought she could justify her feelings day in and day out blackpool was too smooth he was too experienced he was too fond of clubs and women his eyes were too dark when they rested on herand too cocky when they rested on marianne but the truth was she was desperately envious of marianne it didnt matter that she didnt like him emma told herself it didnt matter that johnno didnt like him and continually made snide comments about blackpools penchant for leather pants and silver chains what mattered was that marianne was in love she switched on the light arching her back spending the best part of the day developing had given her a ravenous appetite she hoped runyun and the contact shed made at rolling stone would approve of the shots shed taken of devastation in the recording studio she was scrounging in the refrigerator for something more interesting than molding bologna when she heard the elevator open i hope you bought supplies she called out were getting down to science projects in here sorry emma whipped around at blackpools voice i thought you were marianne no she gave me a key he smiled easily holding it up before tucking it into his jeans id have stopped by the deli if id known id find a hungry woman mariannes at class emma checked her watch she should be back soon ive got time he swung into the kitchen to peer over her shoulder emma shifted away automatically pathetic he decided but helped himself to the imported beer mariannd kept stocked for him there was a brass opener screwed into the wall he popped the top then studied her shed scooped her hair on top of her head to keep it out of the way while she worked at his scrutiny she became aware that her jeans were too tight and her tshirt too big she dragged at it as it slipped off one shoulder im sorry i cant offer you anything else he merely lifted a brow smiled then drank liont worry about it just think of me as one of the family she didnt care to be backed into the tiny kitchen with him when she started through the doorway he shifted just enough to have their bodies brush it was deliberately suggestive and shocking because hed been nothing but the polite friend of a friend to that point when she jerked away he laughed do i make you nervous emma no it was a lie and not a very good one she had tried not to think of him as a man not the way a woman thought of a man but his thighs had been long and hard when hers had knocked against them are you and marianne going out thats the plan he had a habit of running his tongue over the top of his teeth before he smiled like a man about to enjoy a long succulent meal want to join us i dont think so on the one occasion marianne had talked her into going with them emma had found herself dragged from club to club dodging paparazzi you dont get out enough sweetheart she jerked her head back when he reached out to toy with her hair ive got work to do speaking of which did you ever print those shots you took of me yes theyre drying mind if i have a look with a restless move of her shoulders she started toward her darkroom she wasnt afraid of him she assured herself if he was testing the waters to see if she wanted to make it a threesome she would set him straight quickly enough i think youll be pleased she began ah but i have very high standards emmy luy she stiffened at the sound of the pet name but continued on i tried for moody with a touch of arrogant his breath was warm on the back of her neck sexy her shiver was quick and uncontrollable some women think arrogant is sexy and you no she gestured toward the prints that hung drying if theres one that suits you i can blow it up he was distracted enough by his own image to abandon the flirtation theyd held the shoot informally right in the loft hed gone along with the idea because marianne had been so set on it and because hed wanted a chance to ply a little of his charm on emma he preferred younger womenfresh off the farm so to speakparticularly after the ugly breakup with his wife shed been thirty sharp as a scalpel and prone to bitchiness whenever shed suspected him rightly enough of being unfaithful he enjoyed mariannes quick enthusiasm dry wit and her uninhibited responses in bed but emma young quiet emma was a different matter hed wondered what it would be like to peel away that cool reserve certain that he could it would make her father crazya fact that added to the intrigue blackpool had entertained more than one fantasy about luring both women into bed two slick lithe bodies two agile young students his suspicion that emma was as virginal as marianne had been only heightened the appeal but he put that thought aside a moment and studied the shadowy blackandwhite prints marianne said you were good but i thought that was because youre her friend no even in the small room emma managed to keep at arms length i am good he laughed at that a low rumble that rushed along her skin when she felt her muscles tighten she shifted farther away dammit he was sexy but beneath the primitive appeal was something that repelled her so you are sweet thing when he turned she caught the light scent he carried with himleather from his jacket sweat and the faint whisper of beer so still waters run deep i know my work its more than work casually he braced a hand against the wall and effectively trapped her there was an element of danger here he couldnt resist photographys an art isnt it an artist is born with things other people lack he reached out and plucked a pin from her hair she stood still as jumpy and dazed as a rabbit caught in the beams of a truck i know artists recognize each other slowly he drew out another pin do you recognize me emma she couldnt speak or move for an instant she couldnt even think as she started to shake her head he swooped dragging his hand through her hair scattering pins crushing his warm and ready mouth on hers she didnt struggle not at first and would always hate herself for that stunned moment of torrid pleasure he invaded delighted most of all by her perfect innocence his tongue stabbed through her parted lips as she moaned the beginnings of a protest his hands raced up and under her shirt and caught her breasts squeezing and releasing squeezing and releasing while she fought to catch her breath no dont he only laughed again her trembles had ignited what had only been a passing interest into real fire he ground himself against her until her reluctant passion turned to real fear let go of me she fought him now nails scraping dywn the leather of his jacket body bucking when he slammed her back against the wall bottles clattered from the shelf now there was terror like an animal inside her clawing until she couldnt find the courage to scream his hands were on her zipper dragging at her jeans she didnt know she was weeping or that it excited him he released her to tug at his own jeans freed she looked wildly for a means of escape with terror still pumping through her she snatched up a pair of scissors and gripped them in both hands stay away from me her voice was low and raw as shaky as the hands that held the scissors whats this he was clever enough to know that the wild look in her eyes meant she would strike first and be sorry for it later hed been right about the virginal part he thought while his breath heaved and he wanted to be the one to relieve her of the obstacle defending your honor you were ready to cast it aside a minute ago she only shook her head jabbing with the blades as he took a cautious step forward get out i want you to get out dont come near me again or marianne when i tell her you wont tell her a thing through his fury he smiled if you do youll only lose a friend shes in love with me and shell believe exactly what i tell her imagine coming on to your best friends lover youre a bastard and a liar quite true emmy luy but then youre a frigid tease calmer he picked up his discarded beer and swigged and here i was trying to do you a favor youve got problems sweetheart big ones but nothing a good fuck wouldnt cure still smiling he rubbed himself and believe me im a very good fuck just ask your best friend get out but you wouldnt know about that would you sweet little catholic girl all hung up in sins and those sweaty dreams you have when you listen to me upstairs with marianne your kind likes it to be rape so they can pretend theyre innocent all the time theyre screaming for more setting her teeth emma looked deliberately down to where he continued to caress himself if i use these she said quietly im going straight for your balls she had the satisfaction of seeing him pale at that from rage and she was sure from fear he stepped back and the sneer that had women screaming for him sent sweat dripping down her back bitch better a bitch than a eunuch she said calmly enough though she was afraid the scissors would slip any moment from her nerveless fingers they both heard the elevator open they both braced emma mariannes cheerful voice sang through the loft emma are you home blackpool sent emma a quick cocky look right here lover emmas been showing me the prints oh shes finished them he turned and strolled out leaving emma to stay or to follow ive been waiting for you she heard him say in a voice like cool silk i didnt know youd be here the breathlessness in mariannes answer told emma she was being kissed prying one hand from the scissors she rubbed it hard against her mouth lets have a look at the prints why look at pictures when youve got the real thing robert mariannes protest ended on a muffled groan but emmas dont worry about her shes busy ive been waiting to get my hands on you all day emma stood where she was as their murmurs and whispers trailed up the stairs very quietly she closed the door to the darkroom she didnt want to hear she didnt want to imagine her legs nearly gave out before she made it to her stool once there she let the scissors drop with a ringing clatter to the floor then curled her legs up and hugged them to her chest he had touched her she thought in disgust he had touched her and god help her for a moment shed wanted him to go on touching her shed wanted him to take the choice out of her hands just as hed accused her of she hated him for that and she hated herself the phone beside her rang three times before she drummed up the energy to answer yes emmaemma is that you yes there was a crackle on the line a hesitation its michael michael kesselring she stared dully at the prints drying above her work table yes michael i are you all right is something wrong she found she wanted to laugh then long and loud no why should anything be wrong well you sound i guess youve read some of the tabloids ive seen them he let out a long breath the speech hed prepared so carefully had vanished from his mind i wanted to call and explain why its none of my business what you do or whom you do it with the anger she hadnt been able to feel through fear came bubbling to the surface i cant think of any reason i should care who youre screwing can you yes no dammit emma i didnt want you to get the wrong idea she was trembling now but mistook grief and nerves for rage are you going to tell me you havent slept with her no im not going to tell you that then we really have nothing mgre to discuss emma shit i dont know how all of this got so out of hand i want to talk to you about it but i cant do it over the frigging phone i can try to trade some duty fly out for a couple of days i wont see you for christs sake emma i wont theres no reason to michael as i said youre free to be with whomever you choose and my blessing if you want it im going to put all of that part of my life behind me all of it so seeing you again wouldnt suit my plans do you understand yes there was a long long pause yes i guess i do good luck emma thank you michael goodbye she was crying again but didnt bother to brush the tears away reaction she told herself reaction was setting in from that horrible scene with blackpool she wished michael well she really did damn him and all men she locked her door turned the radio up loud sat on the floor and wept new york the loft looked as though it had been struck by a hurricane but then emma supposed marianne had always been a strong wind there was a scatter of papers and magazines three empty handbags two of which were chinese red a single slingback pump of the same bold color and a pile of records that were spread out on the floor like a deck of cards choosing one emma set it on the turntable and was met with a blast of aretha franklin she smiled remembering that marianne had played it the night before while shed finished her furious packing it was hard to believe that both emma and the loft would have to do without marianne for the better part of a year emma picked up a purple silk blouse and a red converse hightop fwo more items that had somehow escaped mariannes maniacal search for the essentials the chance to study for a year in paris at the ecole des beaux arts was an opportunity marianne hadnt been able to turn down emma was thrilled for herbut it was hard very hard to stand in the middle of the loft alone she remained for a moment listening over the sound of aretha was the rumble of traffic from the street below through the open windows she could hear the high strong soprano of a neighboring opera student practicing an aria from the marriage of figaro maybe it was ridiculous to consider herself alone in new york but that was precisely what she was not for long she reminded herself and set the blouse and shoe on the bottom step she had her own packing to do in two days she would be in london she was going to tour with devastation again but this time she had a title official photographer it was a title shed earned emma thought as she hauled the first suitcase onto her bed shed been given her shot when her father had asked her to photograph the group for the album cover the lost the sun cover emma remembered the stark blackandwhite portrait had earned enough acclaim that even pete had stopped mumbling about nepotism and he hadnt said a word when shed been asked to shoot the cover for their current album it gave her a good deal of satisfaction that it had been he as the groups manager who had called to invite her on the tour salary and expenses included runyun had muttered but only briefly something about the commercialization of art london dublin parisa quick visit with mariannerome barcelona berlin not to mention all the cities in between the european tour was slated to take ten weeks when it was done she would do something shed been promising herself for almost two years she would open her own studio unable to find her black cashmere suit emma headed out and up the stairs pausing to pick up the blouse and shoe there was a fascinating mix of scents turpentine and opium marianne had left her studio exactly as she preferred it in chaos brushes and pallet knives and broken pieces of charcoal were stuffed into everything from mayonnaise jars to a dresden vase canvases were stacked drunkenly against the walls three paint smocks their bright colors splattered with even brighter paint were tossed over tables and chairs an easel still stood by the window along with a cup of something emma wasnt sure she wanted to investigate with a shake of her head emma moved over to the bedroom area it was hardly more than an alcove as the years had passed mariannes art had taken over the big bed with its ornate rattan headboard was squeezed between two tables a lamp with a shade fashioned like a ladys straw bonnet sat on one and half a dozen candles of various lengths stood on the other the bed was unmade marianne had refused to make her bed on principle since theyd left saint catherines in the closet emma found three items all hers the black cashmere suit hung between a red leather skirt shed forgotten she owned and an i love new york sweatshirt torn at the sleeve emma gathered them up then sat on mariannes rumpled sheets good god she was going to miss her they had shared everything jokes crises arguments tears there were no secrets between them except one emma remembered even now it made her shudder shed never told marianne about blackpool shed never told anyone she had meant to especially the night marianne had come home drunk with the certainty that he was going to ask her to marly him look he gave this to me marianne had showed off the diamond heart that hung on a gold chain around her neck he said he didnt want me to forget him while he was in los angeles working on his new album she had all but cartwheeled around the loft its beautiful emma had forced herself to say when does he leave tonight i took him to the airport the relief had come in waves i sat in the parking lot and cried like a baby for a half hour after his plane took off stupid hell be back she had whirled then to throw her arms around emma emma hes going to ask me to marry him i know it marry him relief had skidded into panic she had remembered the feel of his hands on her bruising her breasts but marianne hes how it was the way he said goodbye the way he looked at me when he gave me the necklace christ emma it took everything not to beg him to take me with him but i want him to send for me i know he will i know he will of course he hadnt marianne had sat by the phone every night had rushed home from classes day after day to check for messages there hadnt been a word from him three weeks later the first inkling of why had come in via the airwaves there had been blackpool in his trademark black leather escorting a young sultry brunette backup singer to some hollywood bash the first clips ran on television then the tabloids dug in mariannes first reaction had been to laugh it off her next had been to try to reach him he had never returned her calls people ran a feature on him and his hot new love marianne was told that mr blackpool was vacationing in crete hed taken the brunette with him emma rose and walked to the studio window before or since shed never seen marianne so devastated it had been a relief a great one when marianne had finally broken out of her weepy depression had cursed blackpool with an expertise that had warmed emmas heart then ceremonially she had tossed the diamond heart out of the window emma had always hoped some sharpeyed bag lady had happened across it shed gotten over it emma mused shed bounced back into her work with a crack that shed owed blackpool no artist could be worth her salt if she hadnt suffered emma could only wish she herself had been able to forget it as easily she would remember always everything hed said to her every name hed called her her only revenge had been to burn his prints and negatives that was the past she thought briskly and rose her problem was she remembered things too clearly it was both a blessing and a curse that she could see things that had happened a year before twenty years before as easily as she could see her own face in the mirror except for one night in her life she thought and that only came in misty dreams with her recovered clothes over her arm she started downstairs the buzzer sounded making her frown everyone knew marianne was gone and that she herself was practically out the door the intercom squawked a bit when she pushed the button yes emma its luke luke delighted she released the outside door come on up she dashed to the bedroom to toss the clothes on her bed then raced back in time to greet him when the elevator doors opened hello she hugged him tight a little surprised that he hesitated before he returned the embrace i had no idea you were in town she pulled back to study him and had to force her smile in place he looked dreadful pale shadoweyed too thin the last time shed seen him hed been on his way to miami a new job a new life i got in a couple days ago his lips curved but there was no answering smile in his eyes prettier than ever emma thanks because his hand seemed so cold in hers she chafed it automatically come in sit ill get you a drink we might have some wine got any bourbon her brows lifted in all the years shed known him hed never indulged in anything stronger than chardonnay i dont know ill check she waited until hed lowered himself onto the sprawling lshaped sectional before she darted into the kitchen miami didnt agree with him she thought pulling open cupboards and searching through their meager liquor supply or perhaps it was the breakup with johnno that didnt agree with him he looked dead on his feet haggard like some survivor of a catastrophe the luke she remembered the luke she had kissed goodbye eighteen months before had been a gorgeous muscular sleek specimen of humanity cognac she called out someone had given them a bottle of courvoisier for christmas fine thanks there wasnt a brandy snifter in the house so she chose a wine glass then poured a glass of perrier for herself his smile seemed easier when she sat on the ottoman across from him ive always liked this place he pointed to the mural marianne had painted on the plaster where is she in paris she glanced at her watch or nearly shes going to spend a year studying there he shifted his gaze to the photographs that lined a nearby wall i saw your photo study of baryshnikoy the greatest thrill of my life i was stunned when runyun let me have the assignment and the album cover he drank and felt every drop of the brandy slide down his throat wait until you see the new one she kept her voice light and easy but there was concern in her eyes as they skimmed over luke it should hit the stands by the end of the week of course the musics not bad either emma saw his fingers whiten on the stern of the glass how is johnno hes fine i think theyve talked him into doing a cameo on miami vice im sure hell get in touch if he comes down your way yeah he drank again hes not in town no hes in london the opera singer began soaring over scales theyre prepping for the tour im going along in fact im flying out day after tomorrow youre going to see him yes in a couple of days theres an enormous amount of work to be done before we start luke what is it he shook his head carefully he set the cognac aside then reached inside his jacket taking out a plain white envelope he handed it to emma would you give this to him for me of course as soon as you see him yes if you like she started to set it on the table but caught the look in his eye ill just put it in my suitcase she left him sitting there looking dully out of the windows he was standing when she returned holding the empty wine glass in both hands she started to speak then he swayed the glass shattered on the floor before she caught him she had braced for his weight the brittle fragility of his body shocked her more than the paller sit come on sit down youre ill she knelt on the cushion beside him stroking his hair as he wearily closed his eyes i think youve got a fever let me take you to a doctor no he let his head fall back his eyes were bright with fury when they met hers ive been to a doctor a whole tucking fleet of doctors you need to eat she said firmly you look as though you havent eaten in a week let me fix emma he caught her hand she knew he could see by her face that she already knew but refused to believe hed spent quite a while refusing to believe himself im dying it sounded easy almost peaceful its aids no her fingers bit into his oh god no ive been sick for weeks months really he admitted on a sigh i thought it was a cold the flu vitamin deficiency i didnt want to face going to the doctor then well i had to i didnt accept the first diagnosis or the second or the third he laughed letting his eyes close again there are some things you cant run away from there are treatments frantic she pressed his hand to her cheek and rocked ive read about treatments drugs im pumped full of drugs some days i feel pretty good there are clinics im not spending whatever time ive got in a clinic i sold my house so ive got some money im going to rent a suite at the plaza see plays go to movies museums the ballet all the things i havent had time to do in the last few years he smiled again touching a finger to her cheek sorry about the glass dont worry about it it looked like waterford he murmured youve always had class emma dont cry his voice tightened as he turned away from the tears in her eyes ill clean up the glass dont he took her hand again he so badly needed someone to hold his hand just sit for a minute all right luke you cant give up every day theyre oh i know it sounds trite she said desperately but every day theyre coming closer theres so much research being done and the media is making the public more aware she brought his hand back to her cheek theyre bound to find a cure they have to he said nothing she wanted a solace he couldnt give how could he explain how he had felt when the results had come in would she understand could she that fear and anger were only two components there had been humiliation too and despair when pneumonia had set in weeks before the ambulance attendants wouldnt touch him hed been isolated from human contact from compassion from hope she was the first one to touch him to weep for him and he couldnt explain when you see johnno dont tell him how i looked wont that seemed to comfort him his hand relaxed again remember when i tried to teach you to cook i remember that you said i was hopeless but that marianne took inaptitude to new heights you finally caught on to the spaghetti i still make it once a week whether i want it or not he was crying slow silent tears that slipped between his closed lashes why dont you put off the plaza awhile and stay here when he shook his head she went on tonight then just for tonight its so lonely without marianne and ill show you the improvements ive made in your spaghetti sauce she sat with him holcing on when he buried his face in his hands and wept it was rmning when she touched down at heathrow a soft spring rain that made her think of daffodils with her camera case slung over her arm she walked through the gate johnno met her and gave her a smacking kiss then kept his arm around her to steer her through the terminal petes having your luggage sent over he turned her away from baggage claim and toward the exit doors remind me to kiss his feet when he opened the door of a limo emma lifted her brow i hate airport traffic johnno claimed when hed settled in he poured two glasses of pepsi and offered her a bag of chips besides this way we can eat howd you handle the flight with dramamine and prayer she dove into the chips eating on a plane was a luxury her stomach couldnt afford dont worry i stocked up on both for the tour glad to have you aboard she stalled asking questions keeping it light he said nothing when she reached up and closed the privacy glass between the backseat and the driver i appreciate your coming to pick me up i figured you had a reason yes can i have a cigarette he took two out lighted them both serious very she took two long pulls on the gauloise luke came to see me a couple of days ago hes in new york yes we had dinner thats nice so how is he keeping her eyes lowered emma took the envelope out of her purse he wanted me to give you this she turned to study the dreamy rain while he opened the envelope he read in silence there was only the quiet hum of the motor the gentle lap of rain the muted music of a chopin prelude from the speakers she waited a minute then five before she looked at johnnoagain he was staring straight ahead his eyes blank the letter lay in his lap where he had dropped it when he turned to look at her her heart wrenched you know yes he told me not knowing what else to do she took johnnos hand in both of hers im sorry johnno so sorry hes worried about me johnnos voice was dull as he stared back down at the letter he wants to make sure i go in for tests and hehe wanted to reassure me that hed keep quiet about our relationship jesus his head fell back on a hollow laugh jesus christ hes dying and he wants me to know my reputations safe it matters to him his throat was raw there were tears in it he realized and took another rough drag on his cigarette he was important to me dammit now hes dying and what am i supposed to say thanks old man damn sporting of you to take my secret to the grave dont johnno its important to him to do this his way heslukes trying to tie up his loose ends he needs to tie up his loose ends oh fuck oh bloody tucking hell the grief and the fury raged inside him there was nothing he could vent it on it did no more good for him to curse the disease than it had done for him to curse fate for making him what he was he took out another cigarette fingers shaking as he fought with the lighter i arranged for some very discreet very expensive testing about six months ago im clean he dragged in smoke while he crumpled the letter in his fist no nasty problems with my immune system nope no problem here because she understood her voice was brisk its incredibly stupid to feel guilty because youre well wheres the justice emma he smoothed out theletterthe letter then carefully folded it and slipped it into his pocket wheres the frigging justice i dont know she laid her head on his shoulder when darren was murdered i was too young to ask myself that question but ive asked it johnno hundreds of times since why is it the people we love die and we dont the nuns say its gods will its not enough no its not enough she searched her conscience she supposed shed known all along that she would tell him lukes in new york hes staying at the plaza for a few weeks he didnt want me to tell you he tightened his arm around her thanks when the limo pulled up in front of brians london home johnno kissed her tell brian tell him the truth lll be back in a couple of days all right she watched the limo disappear in the misty rain emma switched to a wideangle lens and crouched at the foot of the stage in the london palladium there was no denying that devastation was as dynamic in rehearsals as they were in concert she was delighted with the shots shed taken so far and was already readjusting her schedule to work in darkroom time but now she was shooting the empty stage the instruments amps and cables left behind while the group took an hours break there were electric keyboards horns even a grand piano what interested her now what she wanted to immortalize in her way were the underpinnings of musicmaking the scarred and sacred martin made her think of the man who played it stevie was as battleworn and as brilliant as the instrument he had favored for almost twenty years its strap a bold eyepopping mix of colors had been her last christmas gift to him there was johnnos fender bass painted a slick turquoise on its stand next to the martin it looked frivolous and funky like the man it was a competent clever instrument under a coat of fancy varnish pms drum set had the bands logo splashed across the front from one angle it looked so ordinary then on closer inspection you could see the complicated arrangement of bass and snare and cymbals the cautious addition of three sets of drumsticks the gleam of chrome trim that pm still insisted on polishing himself then there was her fathers custommade gibson the absolutely plain working mans guitar with its simple black strap not a frill not a flash but the wood gleamed pale gold and when the strings were plucked it had a tone that brought tears to your eyes lowering her camera emma stroked a gentle hand down the neck she snatched it back quickly when she heard the music for an instant shed thought her touch had brought the guitar to life feeling foolish she glanced stage left there was music and it did indeed sound like magic quietly she crossed the stage and followed it she saw him sitting crosslegged on the floor outside a dressing room the music echoed haunted the hallway his long elegant fingers caressed the strings slid over them like a lover while he sang softly for himself while you slept i lay awake moonlight streamed across your face played in your angel hair while i watched you sighed my name and wishes did i make that i could creep into your dreams stay forever with you there his voice was warm and soft as he bent over his guitar his dark blond hair dipped to hide most of his face she didnt speak afraid to disturb him but she crouched and lifted her camera when he glanced up at the click of the shutter she lowered it im sorry i didnt mean to interrupt his eyes were gold like his hair they met hers and held his face suited his voice it was poetically pale smooth the gold eyes longly lashed his full sculpted lips curved shyly she thought no mans going to think of you as an interruption he continued to strum the guitar as he studied her an absent caress hed seen her before of course but this was the first chance hed had for a good close look shed pulled her hair back into a careless ponytail leaving her face unframed so that the delicate features stood on their own hi im drew latimer hell h of course i should have recognized you and would have emma realized if she hadnt been so dazed and breathless she stood to move over and offer a hand lead singer for birdcage walk i like your music thanks he took her hand kept it until she knelt beside him are pictures a hobby or a profession both her pulse began to scramble as he continued to stare at her i hope you dont mind that i took yours i heard you playing and wandered back im glad you did more than he wanted to say why dont you have dinner with me tonight and take a few hundred more she laughed even i dont take that many while im eating then leave the camera behind she waited until she was sure she wouldnt stutter i have work breakfast then lunch a candy bar with a chuckle she rose i happen to know youve got time for little but a candy bar youre opening for devastation tomorrow night he didnt release her hand had no intention of allowing her to slip quietly away how about i get you into the show and you have a drink with me after im already coming to the show okay who do i have to kill he held the guitar in one hand and her fingers in the other his demin shirt was nearly unbuttoned and revealed pale smooth skin in one lithe move he was standing beside her youre not going to walk away from me on the eye of my big break are you i need moral support youll do fine he tightened his grip when she started to draw away my god no matter how trite it sounds its the truth youre the most beautiful woman ive ever seen flattered and flustered she tugged on her hand you need to get out more his smile was slow devastating okay where do you want to go she tugged again torn between panic and laughter she could hear voices and movement from the stage where the musicians were wandering back i really have to get back at least tell me your name he ran a thumb over her knuckles until her knees turned to water a mans entitled to know who broke his heart im emma emma mcavoy oh christ he winced as he dropped her hand im sorry i had no idea jesus i feel like a complete jerk why after dragging his fingers through his hair he let them fall brian mcavoys daughter and here i am making a fumbling pass i didnt think it was fumbling she murmured then cleared her throat when his eyes met hers again i do have to get back it was nice meeting you emma he paused enjoying the way she hesitated and turned back maybe sometime over the next ten weeks you can find time for that candy bar all right she let out a long breath as she walked back to the stage he sent her a milky way tied with a pink ribbon and her first love letter emma stood in the doorway long after the messenger had left staring down at the note emma ill do better when we get to paris but for now this is just a reminder of our first meeting when i play in your dreams tonight ill be thinking of you drew she looked down at the candy bar if it had been a basket of diamonds she would have been no more enchanted with no one to see her she spun a trio of pirouettes in the wide foyer then on impulse grabbed her jacket and raced from the house alice answered the door again but this time she didnt cry her lips curved just slightly as she looked at emma you came back yes hello alice she could hardly keep her feet from dancing she leaned over and surprised her old nanny by kissing her cheek i came back i was hoping to see bev is she home shes upstairs in the office she keeps here ill tell her thank you she not only wanted to dance she wanted to sing never in her life had she felt like this giddy nervous and absolutely beautiful if this was infatuation she had waited much too long to experience it there was a bouquet of daffodils and hyacinths in a vase by the door bending over them she knew shed never smelled anything sweeter emma with a pencil tucked behind her ear and big blackframed glasses perched on her nose bev hurried down the stairs im so glad to see you she wrapped her arms around emma and hugged i know you mentioned when i saw you in new york last winter that youd be coming over but i didnt think youd have time to visit i have all the time in the world with a laugh emma hugged her again oh mum isnt it a beautiful day i havent had a chance to so much as sniff the air but ill take your word for it bev held her at arms length her eyes narrowed behind her reading glasses you look as though youve lapped up the cream and the saucer as well what is it do i emma pressed her hands to her cheeks do i really laughing again she tucked an arm through bevs oh i had to talk to someone i couldnt stand it dads off somewhere meeting with pete and the new road manager he wouldnt have done me any good anyway no bev slipped her glasses off setting them on a table as they walked toward the parlor what couldnt he have helped you with i met someone yesterday someone bev gestured to a chair then sat on the arm of it herself as emma continued to move around the room a male someone i take it a wonderful male someone oh i know i sound like an idiotthe type of idiot ive always promised myself id never be but hes absolutely gorgeous and sweet and funny does this gorgeous sweet and funny man have a name drew drew latimer birdcage walk with a chuckle emma gave bev a hug before she began her nervous pacing again you keep up of course she frowned a moment then called herself a prissy fool for worrying about emma having a romance with a musician pot calling the kettle she reminded herself and smiled so is he as wonderful to look at in person as he is in pictures better she remembered the way he had smiled at her the way his eyes had warmed we just sort of ran into each other backstage he was sitting there on the floor playing the guitar and singing like dad does sometimes then we were talking and he was flirting with me i suppose i babbled a bit she shrugged babbling or not she wanted to remember every word of the meeting the best part the very best part is he didnt know me she swirled back to grab bevs hands he didnt have any idea who i was does that make a difference yes oh yes he was attracted to me you see me not brian mcavoys daughter she did sit then for an instant then was up again it seems everyone ive dated has wanted to know about dad or what its like to be brian mcavoys daughter but he asked me to dinner before he knew it didnt make a difference to him then when i told him he was well embarrassed there was something so charming about the way he reacted did you go out with him no i was too flustered and maybe a little afraid to say yes then today he sent me a note andoh mum im dying to see him again i wish youd come tonight so you could just be there you know i cant emma i know i know she let out a long breath you see ive never felt this way before sort of lightheaded short of breath yes emma laughed yes exactly she had felt the same way once only once you have plenty of time to get to know him go slow ive always gone slow she muttered did you go slow with dad it hurt more than fifteen years had passed and it still hurt no i wouldnt listen to anyone you listened to yourself mum lets not talk about brian all right just one thing more dad goes to irelandto darrentwice every year once on darrens birthday and once on once in december i thought you should know thank you she gave emmas hand a squeeze you didnt come here to talk about sad things no no i didnt emma knelt rested her hands on bevs thigh i came to ask you something vitally important i need something absolutely wonderful to wear tonight go shopping with me and help me find it with a delighted laugh bev sprang up ill get a jacket emma han nearly convinced herself shed been foolish to worry about her attire she was there to photograph not to flirt with the lead singer of the opening act there was so much to do equipment and lighting to check stagehands and smoke machines to dodge that she soon forgot it had taken her over an hour to dress the audience was already filing in though there were more than thirty minutes to the opening there were stands of merchandise to be plucked through sweatshirts tshirts posters key chains in the eighties rock and roll was no longer just music for young rebellious kids it was big business umbrellaed by conglomerates anonymous enough in her black jumpsuit she prowled the stands snapping pictures of fans as they forked over pound after pound for memorabilia of the big concert she heard her father discussed dissected and cooed over it made her smile and remember the day so long ago when she had stood on line for the elevator to the top of the empire state building she hadnt been quite three then and now nineteen years later brian mcavoy was still making giddy teenagers hearts throb she switched cameras wanting color now to show the screaming streaks of red blue green of the shirts with their boldly emblazoned lettering devastation the fans themselves were a rainbow spiked hair razor cuts flowing manes the style now was no style at all dress ranged from torn jeans to threepiece suits a good number of the people jostling for space were her fathers age and older doctors dentists executives who had grown up on rock and roll and shared the legacy with their children there were schoolchildren toddlers carried on shoulders women wearing pearls with their daughters clutching newly purchased screenprinted tshirts and like an echo of the sixties there was the faint but unmistakable aroma of pot to mix with the fragrance of chanel or brut she wandered away moving slowly through the crowd the pass clamped to the second button of her jumpsuit had security giving her the nod to go backstage if it was a madhouse out front it was only madder back here a faulty amp another coil of cable a frantic roadie rushing in and out desperate to fix the last of the inevitable glitches she took her shots then leaving the technicians and grips to do their job she headed toward the dressing rooms to do hers she wanted pictures like the ones she remembered so well in her mind dad and the others sprawled around a dressing room chainsmoking joking popping gumdrops or sugared almonds she was just beginning to smile at the thought when she all but ran into drew it was almost as if hed been waiting for her hello again hi she smiled nervously adjusting the strap of her camera i wanted to thank you for the present i thought of roses but it was too late he stood back you look incredible thanks struggling to steady her breath she took her own survey he was dressed for the stage in snug white leather studded with silver boots of the same style and color came halfway to his knees with his hair tousled and the halfsmile on his face he made emma think of a smartly dressed cowboy so do you she managed when she realized hbw long shed been staring look incredible we want to make a splash he rubbed his palms on the thigh of his pants all of us are half sick with nerves donthe bass playerhes all the way sick got his head in the john next door dad always says you perform better when youre nervous then we ought to be a hell of a smash tentatively he took her hand listen have you thought about maybe going out after having a drink she had thought of nothing else actually i im pushing drew let out a long breath i cant help it as soon as i saw youit was like wow there she is he dragged a hand through his carefully mussed and moussed hair im not doing this very well arent you she wondered that he couldnt hear her heart thudding against her ribs no he took her hand let me put it this way emma save my life spend an hour with me her lip curved slowly until the dimple winked at the corner of her mouth id love to she hmdly heard the cheers her brains barely registered the music when it was over and her father dripping sweat came off the stage for the last time she knew that if a fraction of the dozens of pictures shed taken turned out to be worth anything it would be a miracle christ im starving mopping his face and hair he headed for the dressing room cheers and screams still ringing in his ears what do yota say emma lets drag the rest of these rock relics out for a pizza oh well id love to but she hesitated not sure why she felt uncomfortable ive got some things to do quickly she reached up to kiss him you werewonderful what did you expect johnno asked as he elbowed his way down the crowded hall he dropped his voice to a creaky whisper were legends his red face streaming pm stopped beside them that lady annabellewith the hair he held his hands out to the side of his own head to demonstrate the one in the red suede and diamonds emma offered i suppose she wangled a spot backstage pm swiped a hand over his brow though his voice was aggrieved laughter sparkled in his eyes when i went by sheshe he cleared his throat shaking his head as if he could hardly go on she tried to molest me good god call the law johnno swung a comforting arm around his shoulder women like that should be locked up i know you must feel used and dirty dearie but dont you worry come tell uncle johnno all about it he started to lead pm off just what did she touch and how dont be afraid to be specific chuckling brian watched them go pm always attracts the blatant sort hard to figure there was affection in his tone emma caught it wondering if her father knew hed forgiven his old friend then she saw the smile fade stevie stood a few feet away resting a shoulder against the wall his face was pale both it and his hair running with sweat emma thought he looked ten years older than his contemporaries come on son in a casual move brian slipped an arm around his waist steadying taking the weight what we needs a shower and some red meat dad can i help with a brisk shake of his head brian turned toward stevies dressing room this wasnt something he would turn over to his daughter or anyone else no ill take care of it illsee you at home she murmured but he had already closed the door feeling a little lost she went to find drew she expected him to pick a loud crowded club with hot rock musiotramp or thboo instead she found herself sitting in the dim corner booth of a smoky jazz club in soho there was a trio spotlighted in dreamy blue on the stage a pianist a bass player and a vocalist they kept the music low and moody like the lighting i hope you dont mind coming here no deliberately emma unlaced her hands and relaxed her shoulders she was grateful for the low lighting so that drew couldnt see her nervesor sweeney smoking lazily a few tables over ive never been here before i like it well it cant be what youre used to but most of the other places its hard to talk or to be alone i wanted to do both with you her fingers knotted together again i didnt have a chance to tell you how good you were tonight youll be looking for your own opening act soon thanks that means a lot he laid a hand on hers gently stroking his thumb over her knuckles we were a little stiff on the opening set but well loosen up how long have you been playing since i was ten i guess i can thank your father oh why i had a cousin he did some road work for devastation when i was a kid and snuck me into a concert brian mcavoy he just blew me away as soon as i could save up i bought a secondhand guitar he grinned her hand was firmly lodged in his now the rest is history ive never heard that story i guess ive never told anyone else he shrugged restlessly its a little embarrassing no enchanted she moved closer to him its touching thats just the kind of story that endears someone like you to fans he looked at her his eyes dark gold in the dim light im not thinking about fans right now emma would you like a drink emma tore her gaze away from drews to blink at the cocktail waitress oh a mineral water drews brow lifted but he didnt comment guinness he continued to look at emma continued to toy with her fingers you must have heard your fill about musicians he murmured id rather hear about you theres not that much to tell i think youre wrong i want to know everything there is to know about emma mcavoy he lifted her hand to his lips everything she spent the evening in a haze with the sultry music the perfect backdrop he seemed to hang on her every word and touching always touching herhis hand on hers or brushing through her hair skimming along her arm they never moved from their shadowy corner never glanced at the other couples huddled at tables they left the club to walk along the thames in the breezy moonlight it was late much too late but it didnt seem to matter what time it was she could smell the river and the cool spring flowers emma thought of gallant knights when drew stripped off his jacket and spread it over her shoulders are you cold no she drew in a deep breath and shook her head it feels wonderful i never remember until i come back how much i love london ive lived here all my life walking slowly he watched the starlight play on the dark surface of the river he wanted to see other rivers other cities and knew his time was coming have you ever thought of moving back here to live no i havent not really maybe you will he stopped her gentle hands on her shoulders i keep wondering if youre real every time i look at you its as if youre something i dreamed up his fingers tensed as he pulled her closer the quick unexpected strength the sudden intensity of his eyes his voice made her mouth go dry i dont want you to vanish im not going anywhere she murmured her heart scrambled as he lowered his head toward hers she felt the warmth of his mouth light and so tender he drew away an inch only then slowly watching her eyes pressed his mouth to hers again sweet so sweet she thought so kind accepting she skimmed her hands up his back and let him lead her with a masters touch he stroked his lips over her face then brought them back to hers for one long last caress id better get you home his voice was thick unsteady emma as if he couldnt keep from touching her he ran his hands up and down her arms i want to see you again like this is that all right she laid her head on his shoulder thats absolutely all right she spent all her free time with drew over the next weeks midnight suppers for two long walks in the starlight a stolen hour in the afternoon there was something more exciting more intimate more desperate about the hours they spent together because they were so few in paris she introduced him to marianne they met at a little cafe on boulevard stgermain where both tourists and locals would sit over red wine or cafd all lait and watch the world strut by marianne looked more like a native in her lacy white tights and slim short skirt gone was the spiky hairdo the bright red hair was worn sleek and short and very french but her voice was pure american as she squealed emmas name and jumped up to embrace her youre here i cant believe youre here it seems like years let me look at you christ youre beautiful i hate you with a laugh emma swung her hair behind her shoulders you look precisely the way a french art student should look teds chic et sensuel over here thats as important as eating you must be drew marianne kept an arm around emmas waist and extended her hand to him its nice to meet you emmas told me all about you uhoh well sit down anyway you know picasso used to drink here i come all the time and try a different table i know if i ever find his chair ill go into a trance she picked up her glass would you like wine she asked drew at his nod she signaled the waiter un vin rouge et un cafd sil vous platt she sent a wink to emma whod have thought sister magdelinas boring french lessons would have come in handy your accents still a c minus i know im working on it so hows the tour devastations never been better emma smiled at drew and their opening acts creating quite a sensation he laid a hand over hers the response has been great he shifted his gaze from marianne to emma everythings been great marianne sipped her wine measuring him if she had been into religious art she would have painted him as john the apostle he had that dreamy dedicated look or skipping a few centuries hamlet the young prince shadowed by tragedy she smiled as the waiter served the fresh drinks then again she could have dipped back only a few years and used him as a model for the young brian mcavoy she wondered if emma saw the resemblance where to from here she asked nice drew stretched out his legs but im not in any hurry to leave paris he glanced toward the street where cars and bicycles whizzed by with careless disregard for life and limb whats it like to live herb noisy exciting she laughed wonderful i have this little apartment right over a bakery there is nothing believe me nothing that smells like a french bakery first thing in the morning they spent an hour loitering over their drinks before drew leaned over to kiss emma look ive got to get to rehearsal and i know you want to talk ill see you tonight you too marianne im looking forward to it she along with half the women around the cafe watched him walk away i believe hes the most beautiful man ive ever seen he is isnt he she leaned over to grip mariannes hands you do like him dont you whats not to like hes gorgeous talented smart funny she grinned maybe hell dump you for me id really hate to have to murder my best friend but i figure im safe he doesnt look at anyone but you why i dont know just because youve got those incredible cheekbones and big blue eyes a yard of blond hair and no hips some guys have no taste she leaned back you look ridiculously happy i am she took a deep breath drawing in the scents of wine and flowers of paris i think im in love with him no kidding id never have guessed with a laugh she patted emmas cheeks pal its all over your face if i were to paint you right now id call it infatuated what does your dad think of him emma picked up her cold coffee and sipped he has a lot of respect for drews talent both as a musician and as a songwriter i meant what does he think of drew as the man his daughters in love with i dont know we havent talked about it mariannes brows disappeared under her sharply cut bangs you mean you havent told him that youre involved no why i dont know exactly emma shoved the coffee aside i guess i just want to keep it to myself i want it to belong to me for a while he still thinks of me as a child ce a week to make sure i havent succumbed to some lecherous french comte i only wish when emma didnt smile she tilted her head you think hell disapprove i dont know restless she moved her shoulders emma if its serious between you and drew hes going to find out sooner or later i know im just hoping itll be later it wasnt much later emma enjoyed the morning sun on the terrace of her room in rome though it was late for breakfast she was still in her robe her coffee growing cold as she checked over her current batch of prints in the back of her mind she was assessing them not only for pete but for her own idea for a book smiling she took out her favorite of drew shed taken it in the leafy shade of the bois de boulogne only moments after shed taken the picture hed kissed her and told her he loved her he loved her closing her eyes she reached her arms up to the sky she had hoped and she had wished but shed had no idea how happy she could be until hed said the words now that he had she could begin to dream what it would be like to be with him always to make love with him to be married to him to make a home and raise a family she hadnt realized how badly she wanted that a man who loved her a home of her own children they could be happy so happy who understood the life and problems of a musician more than a woman who had been raised by one she could comfort and support him in his work and he would do the same for her after the tour she thought after the tour they could begin to make plans the knock on the door broke into her thoughts she hoped it would be drew come to share breakfast with her as he had once or twice her smile of welcome faltered only slightly when she saw her father dad im surprised to see you out of your room before noon maybe im too predictable with a newspaper folded in his hand he stepped into the room he glanced first at the bed then at his daughter are you alone yes she studied him with a puzzled frown why is something wrong you tell me he slapped the paper into her hand she had to unfold it then turn it right side up but the picture was clear enough the picture of her and drew it wasnt necessary to read italian to get the drift they were locked in each others arms her face tilted up to his her eyes slumberous and dreamy as a womans became when shed been kissed by her laver she couldnt tell where it had been taken it didnt matter where what mattered was that someone had intruded on a very private moment then had splashed that intimacy in newsprint emma tossed the paper across the room then stalked to the balcony she needed air damn them she muttered knocking her fist lightly against the rail why cant they leave us alone how long have you been seeing him emma she looked over her shoulder the wind blew strands of pale hair over her eyes since the start of the tour brian jammed his hands into his pockets for weeks then for weeks and you didnt bother to tell me she tossed her head back as she turned im over twentyone dad i dont have to ask my fathers permission to go on a date you were hiding it from me dammitcome inside he bit the order off the bloody press has their telescopic lenses trained on this place what difference does it make she demanded holding her ground everything we do ends up as public fodder eventually thats part of the price she gestured to the piles of prints on the table hell i do it myself its not the same and you know it he stopped himself dragging a furious hand through his hair it hardly matters at this point i want to know whats going on between you and drew you mean am i sleeping with him no not yet she braced her hands on the rail but its none of your business dad just as you told me years ago that your sex life was none of mine im your father dammit he heard himself he was her father somehow hed become the father of a grown woman and he didnt have a clue what to do about it he waited until he was sure his voice would be calm emma i love you and i worry about you theres no need to worry i know what im doing im in love with drew and hes in love with me now he couldnt speak in defense he picked up her cold coffee and downed it a dove flew by the terrace soft gray wings flapping youve only known him for a few weeks that means you dont know enough about him he plays a guitar for a living she pointed out youd sound ridiculous criticizing that the last thing i want for you is to see you involved with someone in the business for christs sake emma you know what it can do to people the demands the pressures the egos i dont know any more about this kid than that hes ambitious and talented i know all i need to know listen to yourself you sound like some bubblebrain like it or not youre not in a position to trust a man just because he has a pretty face and says he loves you youve got too much money and too much power power theres no one who knows me who would doubt id do anything for you anything youd ask me it took her a minute but the words slowly sank in angry tears blurred her vision as she stepped toward him so thats it you think drew is interested in me because i have money because he thinks i could sway you to help him in his career its impossible isnt it that he or any man might be attracted to me might fall in love with me just me of course not but no thats just what you think after all how could anyone look at me and not see you she spun around pressed her palms against the rail the sun glinted off a lens in the garden below she didnt give a damn let them take their pictures oh its happened before yes it has emma how about dinner fridayand by the way can you get my cousin tickets and a backstage pass to your fathers concert in chicago emma im sorry he reached out but she jerked away what for you really cant help it can you and i learned to live with that even to be amused by it but this this time ive found someone who cares about me whos interested in my feelings and my thoughts who hasnt asked me for anything but to be with him and you want to spoil it i dont want to spoil it i dont want to see you hurt youve already hurt me her eyes were dry when she looked at him leave me alone dad and leave drew alone if you interfere with this ill never forgive you i swear it im not going to interfere i only want to help you i dont want to see you make a mistake itll be my mistake youve made your own god knows for years ive watched you do whatever you wanted with whomever you wanted you ran away from your happiness dad i wont run away from mine you know how to twist the knife he said quietly i hadnt realized he walked out of the sunlight and left her alone drew slipped an arm over emmas shoulders they were standing on another terrace in another city the oldworld graciousness of the ritz madrid was lost on emma she could hear the tinkle of the fountains smell the lush garden below but she might have been anywhere still she found drews arm comforting and rubbed her cheek against it i hate to see you sad emma im not maybe a little tired but not sad youve been upset for weeks ever since you and brian argued over me he removed his arm and moved aside the last thing i wanted to do was cause you trouble it has nothing to do with you he turned and in the moonlight his eyes gleamed dark it doesnt really he would have had the same reaction no matter whom i was seeing dads always been overprotective a lot of it comes because of what happened to my brother he kissed her gently on the temple i know it must have been rough for you and for him but it happened a lohg time ago some things you dont ever forget she shivered suddenly cold in the warm summer night its because i understand how he feels that its so difficult for me hes done everything for me not just materially but in every way he adores you you can see it every time he looks at you smiling again he brushed a hand over her cheek i know just how he feels i love him too still i know that i cant go on living my life to please him ive known that for a long time he doesnt trust me his lighter flared followed by the sharp sting of tobacco i dont blame him from where he stands im on the first rung of the ladder still fighting my way up you dont need me to reach the top he blew out a stream of smoke still i see where hes coming from its easy since were both crazy about you she moved to him then to press a kiss against his shoulder hell come around drew hes just not ready to admit that im grownup and in love if anyone can soften him up its you he flicked his cigarette away then turned her into his arms im glad you didnt want to go out tonight im not big on clubs and parties just an oldfashioned girl arent you his lips were curved as they touched hers do you mind spending the evening alone with you his hands moved up and down her rib cage as he toyed with her mouth do i look crazy you look wonderful her breath caught as he skimmed his fingers over her breasts she was small and firm he felt himself harden as she trembled against him sweet he murmured always so sweet his mouth grew hungrier on hers more demanding less patient as he circled her off the balcony and toward the bed the touts nearly over yes she let her head fall back when his lips raced down her throat will you come back to london when its done emma she shuddered again it was the first hint hed given her that he meant what they had to last yes ill come to london well have nights like this he lowered her to the bed keeping his voice soothing his hands easy not wanting to break the mood night after night together smoothly his clever hands tugged her blouse from the waistband of her slacks ill be able to show you over and over now feel about you how much i want you let me show you emma drew she moaned his name as his mouth roamed lower as his tongue stroked over and under the slope of her breast the pleasure and the passion streaked into her this time she told herself as his long callused fingers glided over her skin this time she could feel the tension in his shoulders where her own hands gripped he had strong shoulders strong arms for such a slim delicatelooking man she loved feeling the bunch and flow of his muscles then his hand roamed down to the waist of her slacks those clever fingers fumbled impatiently with hooks no she hated herself as the word burst out but she couldnt stop it when he continued to tug his mouth coming back to close over hers she struggled no drew please she was on the verge of tears when she managed to pull away im sorry she began im so sorry im just not ready he didnt speak she couldnt see his face in the dark she huddled on the bed until her system leveled i know im not being fair annoyed with herself she dashed a tear from her cheek i dont know whether the nuns did a better job than they could ever imagine or if its because of dad but i need more time youve every right to be angry but i just cant do this not yet you dont want me his voice was quiet and oddly flat you know i do she groped for his hand and tried to soothe his rigid fingers in hers i guess im a little frightened and a little unsure ashamed she brought his hand to her lips i dont want to lose you drew please give me a little more time her sigh shuddered out when she felt his hand relax in hers you couldnt lose me emma like all the time you need i can wait he brought her close stroking with one hand the other curled into a tight fist in the dark it felt odd spending the summer in london again during her childhood at least a few weeks of emmas vacation had been spent there each year but it was different now she was no longer a child she was no longer staying in her fathers home and she was in love she knew drew was hurt that she had refused to move in with him it wasnt moralsor perhaps only a small part of it was morals she wanted the romance to go on a little longerthose lush bouquets he sent to her the funny notes that arrived in the mail or were slipped under the door she wanted time to enjoy itthe thrill of failing in love the terror of being in love the glassyeyed lightheaded exhilaration that every woman has the right to experience at least once and most of all she wanted time to be sure she had at last stepped out from her fathers shadow she didnt love brian any less emma doubted she could but shed discovered that she wanted more than her photographs to stand on their own then there was bev for most of her life emma had been cheated out of a mother in the weeks as summer drifted into fall she made up for a longing of a lifetime by moving into one of bevs guest rooms if drew was impatient with her she had to put him off she needed this time with bev not to feel like a child again but to reforge a bond how could her new relationship work if she left older ones unresolved she had her work the city where her father had spent his childhood caught her imagination emma could spend hours scouring the streets and parks finding subjects an old woman who came day after day to feed pigeons in green park the ultratrendy set who walked labradors or pushed prams along kings road the toughfaced punks who haunted the clubs so she stayed on a month then two months longer she celebrated with drew when birdcage walks album settled into billboards number twelve slot she watched in amusement as lady annabelle ruthlessly pursued a baffled pm she cut asters and mums from bevs garden and at last she took a step forward and submitted prints and a book proposal to a publisher im meeting drew at seven emma called out as she tugged on a short suede jacket were going to dinner and a film have fun bev gathered up an armful of samples where are you off to now stevies i thought he was under the weather apparently hes on the mend she took time for a quick glimpse in the hallway mirror the deep bold blue of the suede picked up the color of her eyes i have the last lot of prints from the tour dads meeting me there sowe can all argue about which ones are best ive got a meeting with lady annabelle bev rolled her eyes behind emma she glanced in the mirror pausing to tighten her left earring im not sure if she wants me to decorate her parlor or just pump me for information about how pm is in bed emma tucked her portfolio under her arm you dont think she already knows bev considered then grinned ill certainly find out soon enough she gave emma a quick kiss on the cheek then dashed moments later emma popped into her aston martin she tried to imagine sweet selfeffacing pm with the brash overdressed lady annabelle she couldnt then again shed never been able to see him with angie parks she fought the traffic in grim british style she was glad that drew and his band had signed with pete page if anyone could help push birdcage walk to the top it was pete look what hed done for blackpool she thought with a sneer the man was making a bloody fortune doing commercials she was well aware how furious pete had been when brian had refused to endorse products or lend his music to television adstossing away worldwide exposure and millions of pounds but she was proud of him leave it to blackpool she thought nastily then pulled into stevies estate shed been pleased when hed bought the old victorian home and rolling grounds hed even taken up gardening and had appeared on bevs doorstep with book after book on roses sou and rock gardens it was no longer a secret that his health was poor but pete being pete had managed to keep the cause of it out of the press emma had been afraid the tour would exhaust stevie but hed made it through now he was writing again and gearing up to join brian at some of the benefits her father could never say no to emma thought brian was truly in his element now rock had embraced causes to its gritty bosom in europe and america musicians were organizing to do something new with their talents benefits to aid causes from droughtridden ethiopia to the struggling farmers in america were as much a part of the eighties scene as political rallies and loveins had been in the sixties the glory and arguably selfindulgent days of woodstock were over rockers had taken up the cause of humanity and were clasping it to their sweaty bosoms she was proud to be a part of it to record the changes and her view of them at the end of the walk a barrel of violas drooped in the full sun with a shake of her head emma shifted them under the slanted shade of the caves apparently stevie hadnt read his garden books carefully enough she pressed the doorbell since her fathers car was nowhere in sight she hoped stevie might feel up to taking her for a tour of his gardens the housekeeper opened the door and eyed emma with both impatience and distrust good morning mrs freemont mrs freemonts dusty brown hair was secured in a nononsense bun she might have been anywhere from forty to sixty and kept her sturdy bulletshaped body primly attired in good black wool she had done day work for stevie for over five years mopped up his blood and vomit carted out his empty bottles and looked the other way when her housekeeping duties brought her in contact with suspiciouslooking vials some might have been duped into believing she was devoted to her employer the staunch mrs freemont was only devoted to the hefty salary stevie paid her in return for minding her own business she sniffed as she opened the door for emma hes around somewhere probably bed i aint got to the upstairs yet old bat emma thought but smiled politely thats all right hes expecting me none of my concern mrs freemont said righteously and went off to attack some defenseless table with her dustcloth dont worry about a thing emma said to the empty hall ill just find my own way up she started up the old oak stairs unbuttoning her jacket as she went stevie make yourself decent i havent all day it was a huge barn of a house which was one of the reasons it appealed to emma the paneling along the wide secondfloor corridor was mahogany the gleaming brass fixtures and glass globes bolted to it had once burned gas it made her think of the old ingrid bergman movie in which boyer playing against type had plotted to drive his innocent wife mad the comparison might have been apt but for the fact that stevie had amused himself by hanging warhol and dali lithographs between the lights she could hear the music and with a sigh emma knocked shook her stinging knuckles and knocked again come on stevie rise and shine when he didnt answer she sent up one quick but fervent prayer that he was alone then pushed open the door stevie the room was emptythe shades drawn and the air stale she frowned at the rumpled bed and at the half bottle of jack daniels on the eighteenthcentury table beside it swearing she marched over and lifted it but she was too late to save the glossy old cherry from the white ring still she set the bottle on a crumpled copy of billboard before she put her hands on her hips all the progress hed made she thought and now hed pumped whiskey into his belly why couldnt he understand that hed already damaged himself so badly that the booze was just as much a killer to him as the drugs so hed gotten drunk last night she thought as she sent the shades flapping up and pushed windows open then hed probably crawled off to be sick asleep on the bathroom floor she decided and if hed caught his death of cold it would be well deserved shed be damned if shed feel sorry for him she pushed open the adjoining door blood and sickness and urine the stench had her stumbling back gagging she felt the bile rush up her throat stared at the red and gray spots that danced in front of her eyes she fell against the stereo sending the needle raking across the vinyl the sudden silence hit her like a slap on a cry of alarm she rushed forward to bend over the body sprawled on the floor he was naked and so cold terrified she heaved until she turned him onto his back she saw the syringe and the revolver no oh god no panicked she searched for a wound then for a pulse she found the first but it was only the tragic marks of the needle the sob burst out of her when she found the second faint and delicate at his throat stevie oh god stevie what have you done she raced to the doorway to the top of the stairs call an ambulance she screamed call a bloody ambulance and hurry as she ran back she tore the quilt from the bed to cover him his face was the color of paste made from water and ashes the sight of it of his skin still smeared with blood from the needle terrified her more than his deathlike stillness on his forehead just above his eyebrows was a nasty gash snatching a washcloth she pressed it against the wound when he was covered she began to slap her open palm over his face wake up goddamn you stevie wake up im not going to let you die this way she shook him slapped him then broke down and wept against his chest her stomach pitched and she bit down furiously on nausea please please please she repeated like a chant she remembered how darren had been found lying alone a syringe on the turkey rug no no youre not going to die on me she stroked his hair then pressed her fingers against his throat again this time there was nothing bastard she shouted at him then tossed the quilt aside and began pumping on his frail chest youre not going to do this to me to dad to all of us she pulled his mouth open to breathe into it then shifted back to push with the heels of her hands you hear me stevie she panted you come back she pushed the air from her lungs to his pumped the thin and frail area between his breasts threatening pleading cursing she fought to pull him back the tile bit into her knees but she didnt notice so intent was she on his face on praying for one flicker of life that she forgot where she was memories scrambled through her headof stevie in white singing in the garden of him standing on stage colored lights and smoke dragging feverish music from a sixstring guitar board games in front of the fire an arm around her shoulders and a teasing question whos the best emmy luy only one clear thought ran over and over in her mind she would not lose someone else she loved this way this useless way the sweat was rolling off her when she heard the footsteps running up the stairs in here hurry oh god dad oh sweet jesus he was down beside her in an instant i found himhe was alive then he stopped breathing the muscles in her arms screamed as she continued to pump the ambulance did she call the ambulance she called pete got us on his car phone goddamnit i told her to call an ambulance he needs an ambulance her head flashed up her eyes met petes damn you cant you see hes going to die if he doesnt get help call he nodded he had no intention of calling an ambulance a public ambulance but instead walked quickly to phone a discreet and very private clinic stop emma stop hes breathing cant brian took her arms felt the muscles tremble youve done it baby hes breathing dazed she stared down at the shallow but steady rise and fall of stevies chest sometimes he screamed sometimes he cried while stevies body detoxed new pains snuck in little imps of torment pulsing in the abscesses along his arms in the tender flesh hed abusedbetween his toes in his groin they capered along his skin first hot then cold he could see them sometimes he could actually see them with their tiny red eyes and hungry mouths tapdancing over his body before they plunged their teeth into him hysteria would follow with a manic strength that forced the staff to restrain him to the bed then he would become quiet descend into an almost trancelike state where he would stare for hours on end at a single spot on the wall when he lapsed into those long silences he would remember drifting peacefully painlessly then emmas voice angry hurt frightened demanding that he come back and he had then there had been pain again and no peace at all he begged whoever was in the room with him to let him go to score for him he promised outrageous amounts of money then swore viciously when his demands went unanswered he didnt want to come back to the world of the living when he refused to eat they fed him through a tube they used an antihypertensive medication to trick his brain into believing he wasnt going cold turkey with that they mixed naltrexone a nonaddicting opiate antagonist to make his body believe he wasnt getting high stevie craved the seductive hazy escape of heroin and the quick buzz of cocaine he was rarely alone but detested and feared even a tenminute span of solitude in those moments it would be only him and the machines that hummed and grumbled in response to his vital signs after two weeks he quieted but he also became sly he would wait them outthe tightlipped bastards that had put him here he would eat his fruit and vegetables he would smile and answer all their questions he would lie to the pretty cooleyed psychiatrist then he would get out he dreamed of scoring again of filling his veins with that glorious combination of chinese white and topgrade snow all that beautiful white powder he fantasized about ithuge mountainous piles of beautiful white powder heaped on silver platters he would scoop it up with both hands fill himself with it he dreamed of killing them the doctors the nurses he dreamed of killing himself then he would weep again they said hed damaged his heart and his liver they said he was anemic and were ruthlessly dealing with that and his crossaddiction to heroin and coke no one called him a junkie they said he had an addictive personality it had been hard not to laugh at that so he had an addictive personality no shit sherlock all he wanted was for them to leave him and his personality alone he was the best tucking guitarist in the world and had been for twenty years he was fortyfive and twentyyearold girls still wanted the honor of a few hours in his bed he was rich filthy rich he had a lamborghini a rolls he bought motorcycles like potato chips he had a twentyacre estate in london a villa in paris and a hilltop hideaway in san francisco hed like to see any of the smartmouthed nurses or holierthanthou doctors top that had they ever stood on stage and had ten thousand people scream for them no but he had they were jealous all of them jealous thats why they kept him here away from his fans away from his music away from his drugs wallowing in selfpity he stared at the room the walls were papered in a soft blue and gray floral a thick gray carpet covered the floor and the windows faced south the matching drapes tried to disguise the fact that the windows were barred there was a colorcoordinated sitting area across the room two cusioned sofas and a spoonback chair festive fall flowers sat in a wicker basket on the coffee table a tasteful reproduction of a nineteenthcentury wardrobe held a television vcr and stereo system an entertainment center stevie thought bitterly he wasnt entertained why had they left him alone so long why was he alone he felt his breath back up then release slowly as the door opened visit after visit brian tried not to be shocked by his friends appearance he didnt want to dwell on the limp graying hair the lines sunk deep around stevies eyes and mouth he didnt want to look at the thin brittle bodya body that had shrunken with misuse as a mans shrinks with age most of all he didnt want to look at stevie and see his own future a rich pampered and helpless old man hows it going because he was grateful for the company stevies smile was genume oh its a barrel of laughs in here you ought to join me the idea sent a slice of fear up brians spine then youd have competition for all these longlegged nurses he offered a fivepound box of godiva a fix for the junkies notorious sweet tooth youre looking almost human son yeah i think dr matthewss real name is frankenstein so whats going on in the real world they talked uneasily and much too politely while stevie worked his way steadily through the chocolatecoated creams and nuts in the box pete hasnt been by in a while stevie said at length hes pretty tied up there was no use mentioning that pete had his hands full dealing with the press and the promoters devastations american leg of the tour had been canceled you mean hes pissed some brian smiled and wished desperately for a cigarette and a drink when has that ever bothered you it doesnt but it did every slight hurt like a seeping wound i dont know what hes being so tightassed about he got but the press release viral pneumonia complicated by exhaustion right it seemed the best way brian began sure sure no problem no tucking problem wouldnt want the public to know old stevie mixed one speedball too many and thought about blowing his brains out come on stevie hey its cool he blinked back tears of selfpity only it burns me bri really burns me he doesnt want to come see the junkie he doled out the smack when he was afraid i couldnt perform without it but now he doesnt want to see me you never told me pete scored drugs for you stevie dropped his eyes that had been a little secret there was always one more little secret now and then when things got tight and my sources dried up the show must go on right the tucking show always goes on so hed score a little h for me all very disapproving then when the show was over hed put me back in one of these places none of us knew it was going to get this bad no none of us knew he began to drum his fingers on the top of the candy box remember woodstock bri christ what a time you and me sitting in the woods dropping acid tripping out listening to the music jesus what music howd we get here i wish i knew brian dug his hands out of his pockets then pushed them in again look stevie youre going to pull out of this hell youre right in fashion now everybodys drying out cleaning out he worked up another smile its the eighties thing to do thats me always on the cutting edge he grabbed brians hand listen its hard you know man its really hard i know man you cant know cause youre not here he swallowed the anger and resentment he couldnt afford to show either now maybe ill do it this time bri but i need help thats why youre here okay okay so im here goddamnit he was sick of platitudes and good wishes but its not enough i need something bri just a taste of something you could slip in a couple grams of cokejust to get me through it wasnt the first time hed asked with a sinking heart brian knew it wouldnt be the last i cant do it stevie christ bri just a couple grams nothing major aji they give me in heres tinkertoy drugs its like going cold turkey with aspirin brian pulled his hand away and turned around he couldnt bear to look at those dark haunted eyes pleading eyes im not going to score coke for you stevie the doctors say itd be like putting a gun to your head i already tried that fighting tears stevie pressed both hands to his face all right no coke you could get me something else some dolophine its a good drug bri if it was good enough for the nazis its good enough for me he began to whine staring at brians back its just a substitute man youve done it for me before so whats the big tucking deal itll keep me straight brian sighed when he turned opening his mouth to refuse yet again he saw emma in the doorway she stood like a statue her lush hair caught back in a braid baggy blue pants hitched with white suspenders lying on a crimson shirt there were big gold hoops at her ears and she carried a game of scrabble brian thought she looked sixteen until he saw her eyes they were cold a womans cold accusing eyes am i interrupting no brian stuck his hands in his pockets ive got to get on id like to talk with you she didnt look at him as she spoke but moved to the opposite side of stevies bed maybe you could wait outside for me i wont be long the doctor said stevie needed rest all right it was ridiculous brian thought but he felt like a child about to be scolded ill see you in a day or two stevie right he said nothing else but his eyes begged as brian left the room i bought you this emma laid the board game over stevies bony knees i figured you could practice up so you could try to beat me i always beat you when i was a kid and because you cheated she lowered the bedguard to sit beside him im not a kid anymore he couldnt keep his hands still his fingers played a nervous tatoo on the box i guess not so you want some drugs she said it so matteroffactly it took a moment for it to register his fingers picked up the rhythm against the box as he looked at her what was the name of it again ill write it down i imagine i can get my hands on some in a few hours no you said you wanted it what was the name shed taken out a pad and held a pencil poised over it there was hope and a desperate greed before shame flushed his skin for a moment he looked almost healthy i dont want you involved she laughed at that a low amused sound that made the sweat break out on the back of his neck dont be soft stevie ive been involved since i was three do you really believe i had no idea what went on at the parties on the tours give me some credit he had believed it because hed needed to she was and had always been the quiet light of innocence in all the noise and madness i im tired emma tired need a lift a little buzz to take the edge off reality give me the name stevie after all i saved your life it seems only just that i should help you lose it i didnt ask you to save my life goddamn you he lifted a hand as if to push her away then let it fall limply on the sheet why didnt you leave me the hell alone emma why didnt you just leave me alone my mistake she said briskly but we can do our best to fix it right up she leaned closer bringing him a whiff of soft scent as her voice and eyes hardened ill get the tucking drug for you stevie ill get it ill feed it to you illpush the needle in whatever vein you might have left hell maybe ill even try it myself no why not she lifted a brow as if amused you said it was a good drug isnt that what you said to dad its a good drug if its good enough for you its good enough for me no goddamnit look what ive done to myself he held out his scarred and scabbed arms i see what youve done to yourself she threw the pad and pencil across the room i see exactly what youve done to yourself youre weak and pitiful and sad miss a nurse came through the door youll have to get out of here emma whirled on her fists clenched eyes blazing get the hell out im not finished yet she left the hurried sound of her retreating feet echoed leave me alone stevie murmured the tears were spilling out of his eyes seeping through the fingers he pressed to his face oh ill leave you alone all right when im done i found you lying on the floor in your own blood and vomit beside the gun and the needle couldnt you make up your mind which way you wanted to kill yourself stevie it was just too damn bad wasnt it that i didnt want you to die i pumped life back into you right there on the floor i cried because i was afraid i wouldnt be quick enough or good enough or smart enough to save you but you were breathing when they took you away and i thought it mattered what do you want he shouted what the hell do you want i want you to thinkthink about someone else for a change how do you think i would have felt if id found you dead or dadwhat would it have been like for him you have everything but youre so hellbent to selfdestruct you could have twice as much and it wouldnt matter i cant help it oh thats a poor excuse poor and pitiful and sad and completely suitable to what youve made yourself she was near tears now herself but she fought them back letting the bubbling anger pour out instead ive loved you ever since i can remember ive watched you play and year after year been astonished by what youre capable of creating now youre going to sit there and tell me that you just cant help killing yourself thats fine then but dont expect the people who love you to stand and watch she started out only to be stopped in the doorway by a petite brunette miss mcavoy im dr haynes mr nimmonss psychiatrist emmas body braced like a boxer readying for a new match im on my way out doctor yes i can see that the woman smiled and offered a hand nice show dear i recommend a brisk walk then a hot bath she moved by emma to go to stevies bed ah scrabble one of my favorites care for a game mr nimmons emma heard the tiles hit the wall but kept on walking she found brian outside leaning against the hood of his newest jaguar when he spotted her he took one last drag on his cigarette then flicked the butt away i thought you might stay a bit longer no i said all i had to say as she spoke she fastened the bottom snap on her dark blue bombers jacket then pulled up the zipper i wanted to ask you if id heard correctly did you buy drugs for stevie not the way you mean it im not a dealer emma word games then she agreed with a nod did you provide him with drugs i provided him with an opiate substituteto help get him through the tour and keep him from going out to some alley and trying to score heroin to get him through the tour she repeated i thought pete was bad lying to the press helping stevie lie to himself petes not at fault here yes he is youre all at fault here are we supposed to take out an ad in billboard saying that stevies a junkie it would be better than this how is stevie ever supposed to face up to this if he cant admit what he is and how is he supposed to stop being what he is if his friends his very dear friends keep handing him drugs so he can get through one more show one more city it isnt like that isnt it or are you deluding yourself into thinking youre doing it out of friendship too weary for anger he leaned against the car again the breeze that ruffled his hair was brisk with autumn and smelled of rain peace he thought as he studied his daughters furious face he only wanted peace you dont know anything about it emma and i dont appreciate being lectured by my own daughter i wont lecture you she turned and walked to her own car with her hand on the door she looked back at him you know i never told you but i went to see jane a couple of years ago shes pathetic wrapped up in her own needs and her own ego until now i hadnt realized how much youre like her she slammed the door gunned the motor if there was pain on his face she didnt look back to see it emma married drew in a quiet civil ceremony there were no guests no advance press she had told no one not even marianne after all she was over twentyone and needed no ones permission or approval it wasnt the wedding she had dreamed of no misty tulle and glowing white silk no flowers except the single pink rose drew had given her no music and no tears she told herself it didnt matter she was doing exactly what she wanted it was selfish perhaps but she felt justified in committing one purely selfish act how could she have told marianne or bev without telling her father she hadnt wanted him there standing beside her giving her away she would give herself away shed done her best to cheer the dull mechanical ceremony by wearing a fussy silk dress shades deeper than the rose she carried lacy at the bodice and at the drifting tealength hem she thought of her fathers wedding the first wedding she had ever seen bev looking gloriously happy brian smiling stevie all in white singing like an angel the memory brought tears to her eyes but she held them back as drew took her hand he was smiling at her smiling as he slipped the simple diamond band on her finger his hand was so warm and steady his voice was clear and lovely as he promised to love honor and cherish she so desperately wanted to be cherished when he kissed her she believed it then they were man and wife she was no longer emma mcavoy but emma mcavoy latimer a new person and in vowing her love and her life to drew she was beginning a new life it didnt matter that he had to race off directly after the ceremony to the recording studio she understood the demands and the need for premium session time better than anyone it had been her idea to be married quickly quietly and in the middle of the making of his new album it gave her time to prepare the hotel suite where they would spend their wedding night she wanted it to be perfect there were flowers now banks of hothouse roses orchids narcissus for her own pleasure she arranged them personally setting tubs and vases throughout the rooms down to a basket of flowering hibiscus she set in the bath a dozen candles waited to be lit all white and scented with jasmine champagne chilled in a crystal bucket the radio was on low to enhance the mood she indulged in a long bath fragrant with oils she creamed and powdered her body and enjoying the female ritual dabbed more scent at every pulse point like the room like the night she wanted her body to be perfect for him she brushed her hair until her arm went numb then slowly drawing out the pleasure of it dressed in the white silk and lace peignoir when she studied her reflection in the cheval mirror she knew she looked like a bride closing her eyes she felt like a bride her wedding night the most beautiful night of her life now she would know what it was like drew would come in he would look at her those tawny eyes going dark he would be gentle sweet patient she could almost feel his long clever fingers skimming over her skin he would tell her how much he loved her how much he wanted her then he would carry her into the bedroom and show her patiently tenderly passionately by ten oclock she was anxious by eleven uneasy by midnight she was frantic her calls to the studio only told her that he had left hours before she imagined a terrible accident he would have been in a hurry to get back to her as anxious as she to begin their life together in the big soft bed he might have been careless and his car they wouldnt know where to reach herthe doctors the police even now drew could be lying in some hospital bed bleeding calling for her she was working her way down the lists of hospitals ivhen she heard the key in the lock before he could open the door she was there swinging it open and failing into his arms oh drew i was terrified easy easy does it he gave her buttocks a quick squeeze anxious are we drunk part of her mind tried to deny it but it was there in the slurred words the sway of his body the smell she stepped back to stare at him youve been drinking just a little celebration with the lads not every day a man gets married is it but you you said youd be here by ten christ emma youre not going to start nagging me already no buti was worried drew well im here now arent i he struggled out of his jacket and let it fall to the floor it wasnt often he got drunk but tonight it had been so easy to let one drink follow another tonight hed climbed one more rung to the top and look at you the perfect picture of the blushing bride beautiful beautiful emma all in white she did blush there was desire in his eyes now the kind shed seen before the kind shed imagined seeing in them tonight i wanted to look beautiful for you she went easily into his arms lifted her mouth to his in innocent trust he hurt her his mouth was fierce and hot he nipped hard at her bottom lip as he pushed himself against her drew she tried to struggle back alarmed by the memory flash of blackpool in her darkroom drew please dont play that game with me tonight he caught her hair in his hand and dragged her head back youve made me wait long enough emma no excuses tonight im not i justdrew cant we youre my wife now we do it my way he pulled her to the floor ignoring her pleas and struggles his hands were rough tearing the filmy lace as he bared her breasts to suckle and squeeze the speed and urgency frightened her it wasnt right she thought frantically it wasnt right lying on the floor the lights glaring her gown in tatters his fingers dug into her hips as his mouth clamped down on hers choking on the smell of whiskey she tried to say his name when she began to fight in earnest he locked her hands in one of his and took her virginity in one hard swift thrust she cried out both in shock and pain then he was plunging and pumping into her panting groaning she was weeping when he collapsed when he rolled aside and fell instantly to sleep he was full of contrmon and shame and tenderness in the morning with shadowed eyes and trembling voice he cursed himself and begged her forgiveness hed been drunk a phor excuse but his only reason for behaving like a monster when he held her gently stroking her hair and murmuring promises she believed him it was as though another man had come to her on her wedding night to show her how cruel and heartless sex could be her husband showed her only sweetness when her first day as a new bride ended she lay in his arms content dreaming only rosy dreams of the future michael staggered into the kitchen hed meant to get to the dishes in fact his intentions had been so firm he was shocked to find the sink full and the counter cluttered he gave them a bleary accusing stare hed been working double shifts all week and wondered why things like dishes couldnt just take care of themselves in the spirit of selfsacrifice he decided to deal with them before he settled in with breakfast and the morning paper he began to stack plates bowls cups forks dragging over a fivegallon rubbermaid kitchen can he shoved the whole business inside they were all paper and plastic a system that appalled his mother but which suited michael just fine although his modest kitchen boasted a whirlpool dishwasher hed never owned a plate that required its services satisfied he poked through the cupboards knocking over a bottle of el paso salsa and a jar of skippy peanut butter shoving them aside he grabbed the box of shredded wheat he shook some into a chinet bowl then lifted the coffeepot and poured the steaming brew over the cereal hed discovered this delicacy purely by accident on another groggy morning hed nearly eaten his way through his breakfast when hed realized the coffee was on the cereal and the milk in the styrofoam cup since then michael had dispensed with the milk altogether before he could sit and enjoy he was interrupted by a banging on the back screen door at first glance it appeared to be a fivefoot gray mat but mats didnt have wagging tails or lolling pink tongues michael pushed open the screen and was greeted exuberantly by the scruffy oversized dog dont try to make up michael shoved the huge paws off his bare chest the paws hit the floor but most of the mud on them remained on michael conroy pedigree unknown sat on the linoleum and grinned he smelled almost as bad as a dog could possibly smell but was apparently unoffended by his own aroma his hair was matted and full of burrs michael found it hard to believe that hed picked conroy out of a litter of cute gamboling pups less than two years before as an adult conroy had turned out uglynot homely but downtothe ground ugly this little trick of nature didnt bother the dog either conroy continued to grin as he lifted a paw in what both he and michael knew had nothing to do with subservience im not going to shake that paw i dont know where its been you went back to that slut again didnt you conroy slid his eyes to the left if he could have whistled between his teeth he would have dont try to deny it youve spent all weekend rolling in the dirt and slobbering over that halfbreed beagle tramp never a thought to the consequences or my feelings turning away michael rooted in the refrigerator if you knock her up again youre on your own if ive told you once ive told you a thousand times safe sex its the eighties bucko he tossed over a slice of bologna which conroy caught nimbly and swallowed in one gulp softening michael tossed him two more before he settled down with his coffeesoaked shredded wheat he liked his life moving to the burbs had been the right decision for him it had exactly what he wanted a nice patch of lawn he could grumble about mowing a few leafy trees and what remained of the previous owners flower bed hed given gardening a shot but when hed proven inept had abandoned it that suited conroy as well no one got antsy when he dug up the snapdragons hed bought the small brick rancher on impulse right after the end of his brief and illadvised affair with angie parks hed learned something from her other than kinky sex and that was that michael kesseiring was and always would be middle class it had been strange to watch her on the screen after hed been replaced with a twentyyearold hockey player it had given him an eerie almost creepy feeling to see her depiction of jane palmer and to realize that shed played that part with hith all during the three frenzied months theyd been lovers hed gone alone to the theater a kind of test to make certain hed gotten rid of any residual and unhealthy attraction for her when shed bared those beautiful breasts hed felt nothing but discomfort though it had been by proxy he knew he had been to bed with emmas mother and he had wondered sitting under the dark cloak of the theater if emma would see the movie but he didnt like to think of emma there had been other women no one serious but other women he had his work it no longer amazed him that he had both a talent and an affection for law enforcement perhaps he didnt have his fathers patience and skill with paperwork but he thought well on his feet accepted the long often monotonous hours of legwork and stakeouts and had a healthy enough respect for his life not to be triggerhappy i got shot at yesterday he said conversationally to conroy the dog began disinterestedly to scratch for fleas if that pervert had gotten lucky youd be out in the cold pal dont delude yourself into thinking that slut would take you in conroy glanced over burped and went back to his fleas one trip to the vet michael muttered as he spooned up cereal just one trip and a couple of snips and your letching days are over pleased that hed had the last word michael opened the paper there was the usual business about the middle east the latest in terrorism some routine bitching about the economy beneath the fold in section b was an article about the capture and arrest of one nick axelrod a smalltime secondstory man who had hopped himself up on pcp and axed his lover heres the guy michael said holding out the paper for conroys perusal found him in an apartment downtown shooting up the walls and screaming for jesus see heres my name detective michael kettlerung yeah i know i know but its supposed to be my name if youre not interested in current events why dont you do something useful like getting my cigarettes go on fetch moaning conroy started off he tried a limp but michael had gone back to the paper and wasnt paying attention scratching his bare chest michael turned to the entertainment section his fingers curled in fisted and held against his heart as he stared at the picture it was emma she lookedgod he thought she looked outrageous that shy little smile those huge quiet eyes she was wearing some skimpy strapless dress and her hair was down raining over her shoulders in thick wild waves there was an arm over her shoulders as well and the arm was attached to a man michael tore his eyes from emmas face long enough to stare at the man drew latimer his brain connected face and name he was smiling too positively tucking beaming michael thought he shifted back to emma studying every inch every angle of her face for a long time conroy came in and dumped a slobbery pack of winstons on his lap but he didnt move very slowly as if it were a foreign language he read the headline rock princess enma mcavoy mames her prince in a secret ceremony two days ago emma mcavoy daughter of devastations brian mcavoy and author jane palmer married drew latimer twentysix lead singer and guitarist for the rising rock group birdcage walk the newlyweds met on devastations recent european tour michael didnt read any more couldnt jesus emma he closed his eyes and let the paper fall back to the table oh jesus emma was thriued to be back in new york she could hardly wait to show off the city to drew and to spend their first christmas together in the loft it hadnt mattered to her that their plane had been late or that a fine icy sleet had been falling they would have four weeks for the honeymoon that had been delayed by the completion of drews new album she wanted to spend that time in new york in her home as she made the transition from bride to wife she had the limo driver take them through midtown so she could show drew the lights the people the majestic tree in rockefeller center the carnival of times square it delighted her to arrive at the loft knowing she was alone finally alone with no sweeney in residence downstairs it feels like years since ive been here she knew mariannes father had complained bitterly over their refusal to sublet but she was glad so glad to know that no one had lived there in her absence well she combed her fingers through her damp hair what do you think its quite a space he skimmed over the plaster walls the bare floors the kitschy china owl emma had discovered in a neighborhood thrift shop a bit spartan wait until i start decorating for christmas marianne and i collected some truly awful decorations she fumbled in her bag for a tip when the driver deposited their luggage with a discreet cough thank you he pocketed the twenty thank you maam merry christmas merry christmas she tossed off her coat and raced to the windows drew come look at the view its better from mariannes studio but i get dizzy very nice he saw a dirty street and a maddening crush of traffic emma i wonder why you never moved into something more upscale i never wanted to well this is certainly charming and im sure it was fine for two college girls but well have to do some rethinking when she turned he reached out to brush a hand over her hair after all we dont want to share our living quarters with marianne however delightful she is i hadnt thought she wont be back for a couple of months yet youd better start thinking he took the sting out of the words by kissing her brow pretty face and slow wits he thought and patted her cheek from what ive heard it takes a great deal of time money and energy to find a place in new york since you want to divide our time between here and london well need the right kind of accommodations jesus christ its cold in here i had the agent keep the heat back while we were gone she hurried over to turn it up always practical arent you love there was a sneer in his voice but he was smiling when he turned back to her im sure well enjoy ourselves here for a couple of weeks after all a honeymoon even a delayed one doesnt require much more than a bed he laughed when she blushed then walked over to sweep her up in a long lusty kiss we do have a bed dont we emma yes she held him close right through there it needs fresh linens well worry about the linens later he pulled her through the doorway tugging at her sweater she knew it would be quick not fierce and painful as it had been on her wedding night but speedy and soon over she didnt know how to ask for more though she felt somewhere in her heart that there should be more than the rapid groping in the dark the mattress was cold on her back but his body as it entered hers long before she was ready was hot she wrapped her arms around him clinging to the warmth and waiting for the starburst she had only read about she shivered when he was done from the cold she told herself moments later drew echoed her thoughts christ almighty its like an ice box in here it wont take much longer to heat up ive got some blankets in the chest she reached for her sweater but he closed a hand over hers i like looking at your body emma such a sweet little body just this side of ripe theres no need to be shy in front of me anymore is there no awkward she rose to lift the top of the chest he fumbled in the pocket of the jacket that was tangled on the floor and found his cigarettes i dont suppose theres any food in this place or a bottle of something to ward off pneumonia theres some cognac in the kitchen she remembered the bottle shed opened for luke luke who was back in miami fighting to hang on to life she laid the pile of sheets and blankets on the foot of the bed already shed shared nearly all her secrets with drewexcept about johnno and luke i didnt even think about food she saw him frown as he brought the cigarette to his lips why dont i run around the corner to the market pick up some things you can have some cognac and a hot bath ill fix us some dinner fine it didnt occur to him to offer to go with her pick me up some cigs too will you sure he didnt stop her when she reached for her sweater again it wont take me long he got up when she left tugging on his jeans more for comfort than modesty he poured the cognac first and though he was annoyed there wasnt a proper glass for it he approved the brand it amazed him that shed expected him to applaud the silly barn of a room a downtown loft he thought and drank more cognac he had no intention of living downtown hed been waiting to move up all of his life it was laughable to think that now that he was on his way he would settle for anything less than the best hed grown up in worse certainly sipping he studied the mural of emma on the plaster wall and thought of where hed come from and where he was going he couldnt claim a life in the slums digging in poverty but hed been only shades above it a rented house a muddy yard mended jeans he detested coming from the working class and the father who had kept them there because hed never had an ounce of ambition stoopshouldered old man he thought no spine or balls why else would his wife have walked out on him and her three children so shed wanted something better than just eking out a living drew mused how could he blame her he detested her he was going his own way and that way was straight to the top lifting the glass he toasted emmas portrait if his eager and naive little wife could give him a couple of boosts theyd all live happy but he would run the show hed indulge her for a week or two here and then theyd move uptown one of those big glitzy and expensive flats off central park that would do for a beginning he didnt mind living part of the year in new york in fact he thought new york would suit him just fine especially with the contacts emma had there crossing to the stereo he flipped through albums until he found one that suited him complete devastation it seemed only right drew mused that he give a nod to the old man after all if it hadnt been for the tour he wouldnt have been able to lure emma backstage pour on the charm imagine her being stupid enough to believe he hadnt known who she was or what she could do for him with a shake of his head he put the record on and let the music rock the room no he wouldnt find it difficult to indulge her even though she was lousy in beda severe disappointmentshe was overeager to please hed played her as cleverly as he played his sixstring from the moment hed set eyes on her he intended for his ingenuity to pay off in spades before long she would have mended fences with her father the old man had taken their marriage well enough and had been generous in his wedding gift of fifty thousand pounds made out in emmas name but already deposited in a joint account there was still restraint between father and daughter that would ease up soon enough drew was sure of it being brian mcavoys favored soninlaw was bound to have its rewards in the meantime he had a very very rich wife a rich naive wife with a laugh he strolled over to the window what better mate for an ambitious man he only had to control his temper and impatience keep her happy and then everything he wanted would fall in his lap they moved into an elegant twostory condo on the upper west side because it seemed so important to drew she tried to ignore the fact that they were living on the eleventh floor she only really got dizzy when she stood at the window and looked straight down the phobia was an annoyance to her she had stood at the top of the empire state building and felt exhilarated yet if she stood at a fourthfloor window her head spun and her stomach heaved drew was right she thought wherj he told her shed have to learn to live with it in any case emma liked the high coffered ceilings in the master bedroom the ornate deco balustrade that ran along the curving stairs the niches cut into the walls and the maroon and white checkerboard tiles in the foyer emma called on bev to decorate it hoping her touch and a few weeks of her company would make the move from the loft less painful emma had to admit the condo was lovely with its aerielike view of central park and its wide winding staircase she satisfied her yen for antiques and oddities by furnishing it with a mix of prissy queen anne and funky pop art she liked its lofty windows the little glassedin balcony where she could pot herbs and the fact that it was only a brisk walk to johnnos she saw him almost every day he went along with her on her hunts through antique stores something that bored drew it was habitual for johnno to drop by once or twice a week for dinner or to join them on an evening out if she couldnt have her fathers approval it soothed to have johnnos to hear him talking music with drew emma was pleased when he and drew began to write a song together she threw herself into domesticity making a home for herself for drew and for the children she couldnt seem to conceive it had surprised and pleased emma that drew wanted to start a family right away whatever else they disagreed on whatever differences she had discovered in their tastes and viewpoints in this they shared the same dream she imagined what it would be like to carry a child to feel drews child growing inside of her often she daydreamed about how she and drew would push a pram through the park would they wear those smug smiles she noticed on new parents as the months passed she told herself to be patient that the time would come it was stress it was trying too hard once she had learned to relax during lovemaking it would happen as spring breezed in she took dozens of pictures of pregnant women of babies and toddlers in the park she watched them enjoying the fine warming afternoons and envied plans to open her own studio and work on her book were postponed but she continued to sell her pictures she was content to pour herself into a new domestic life to spend her free hours expanding her portfolio she began to collect cookbooks and to watch cooking shows on public television it flattered her when drew praised her attempts to recreate a meal since he became easily bored with her photography she stopped showing him her prints or discussing her works in progress he seemed more content to see her as a housewife in the first year of their marriage she was more than happy to oblige him deliberately she kept busy trying to mask her disappointment when her body informed her with regularity that she wasnt pregnant trying not to feel the guilt when drew sulked each time she failed it was runyun who shook her out of her complacent routine with a bottle of champagne in one hand and a clutch of tulips in the other emma burst into the apartment drew drew are you home setting the bottle down she switched on the radio jesus would you shut that thing off drew appeared at the top of the stairs he wore only a pair of sweats never at his best in the morning his hair was tumbled his eyes bleary his face scruffy with a nights growth of beard you know i worked late last night i dont think its too much to ask for a little quiet in the morning im sorry quickly she pushed the off switch and lowered her voice a few months of marriage had taught her that drews temper was a lit rise before coffee i didnt realize you were still in bed i thought you were out some people dont have to get up at dawn to be productive she gripped the flowers a little tighter she didnt want to spoil the moment with an argument shall i fix you some coffee you might as well therell be no getting any sleep here emma took the flowers and wine into the kitchen it was a narrow room made spacious by the glassedin breakfast nook she had chosen blues and whitegleaming navy countertop white appliances pale blue and white tiles for the floor there was an old kitchen hutch in the corner shed painted white herself it displayed a collection of cobalt glass emma added fresh water to the trio of cacti shed started in blue bowls then began fixing breakfast they had help three days a week but she enjoyed cooking a few meals as much as she enjoyed developing a good print she set drews favorite sausage on to grill before she ground beans for coffee when he entered a few moments later still barechested and unshaven the scents were enough to mellow his mood besides he liked seeing her at the stove cooking for him it reminded him that no matter who she was no matter how fat her bank account she belonged to him he strolled over to kiss the side of her throat morning her answering smile faded as he slid his hands up to rub her breasts itll be ready in a minute good im starved he gave her nipples a quick ungentle pinch she hated when he did that but said nothing as she moved over to pour his coffee when shed told him she didnt care to be pinched hed only begun to do it more often just teasing her he claimed youre too sensitive emma you have no sense of humor i have news she handed him the cup oh drew its wonderful news his eyes sharpened was she pregnant he badly wanted to present brian with a grandchild youve been to the doctor nooh no im not pregnant drew im sorry she felt the familiar sense of guilt and inadequacy disappointment marred his face before he went to sit at the table its just going to take a little more time she murmured and cracked two eggs into the pan im keeping my temperature chart carefully sure he took out a cigarette lit it and studied her through the smoke youre doing your best she opened her mouth closed it it wasnt the time to remind him that it took two people to make a baby the last time they had discussed it he had smashed a lamp then had stormed out to leave her frazzled and guilty until morning i went to see runyun you know i told you i was going hmmm oh right the snotty old boy of the shutterbugs hes not snotty it didnt do any good to get her back up over the term shutterbug cranky she said with a smile often obnoxious but not snotty she carried his plate to the table shed forgotten her own coffee but sat almost ready to burst hes arranging for me to have a showing my own showing showing drew said over a bite of sausage what the hell are you talking about for my work drew i told you i thought he was going to offer me a job again but it wasnt that at all you dont need a job in any case i told you how i feel about your working with some grabby old fart no butwell it doesnt matter now he thinks im good it was hard for him to admit but he really thinks im good hes going to sponsor a show you mean one of those precious little gatherings where people wander around staring at pictures and saying things lik what depth what vision she stiffened slowly she rose to unwrap the tulips until her temper cooled he didnt mean to hurt her she assured herself its an important step in my career ive wanted this since i was a child id think youd understand behind her back he rolled his eyes he supposed hed have to pet and soothe now of course i do good for you luy whens the big day in september he wants to give me plenty of time to get my best work together i hope youre going to include a few shots of me she made herself smile as she set the tulips in a slant of sunlight on the table of course youre my favorite subject s he was certain he wasnt trying to make things difficult but drews demands on her time made it next to impossible for emma to get any work done it was time they took advantage of new york he said and insisted on haunting the clubs he needed a break so they flew off for a week in the virgin islands it was natural for him to make friends among the young and rich of new york the apartment was almost never empty now if they werent entertaining there was a party somewhere else as one of the bright new couples they were hounded by the paparazzi the opening of a new broadway play an evening at a new night spot a concert in central park everything they did was recorded their names and faces adorned papers at every supermarket checkout they were on the cover of rolling stone and people and newsweek barbara walters wanted an interview each time she became frantic under the pressure emma reminded herself this was precisely the kind of life shed dreamed of while trapped in saint catherines but the reajity of it was much more wearing and much more boring than she would have believed everyone said the first year of marriage was the hardest she continually reminded herself it took effort it took patience if marriage and life in general was more difficult and less exciting than shed imagined it only meant that she wasnt trying hard enough come on luy its a party drew swung her around her mineral water sloshed over her glass as he caught her close to dance loosen up emma im tired drew youre always tired his fingers dug into her back when she tried to draw away shed been up three nights running working in her darkroom her showing was only six weeks away and she was nervous as a cat and angry she admitted angry because her husband showed no interest in her work angry because hed announced two hours before that hed invited a few friends over a hundred and fifty people crowded the rooms the music blasted over the past month there had been more and more of these little gettogethers her liquor bill had soared to five hundred dollars a week she didnt resent the money no it wasnt the money it wasnt even the time not when it involved friends but friends had swelled to hangerson groupies last week the apartment had been a wreck after everyone had cleared out the sofa had been stained with brandy someone had put out a cigarette on her oriental rug but worse than that worse than the broken baccarat vase or the missing limoges candy dish were the drugs shed found a group people shed never met cheerfully snorting coke in the guest room she hoped would soon be a nursery drew had promised it would never happen again youre just pissed because marianne didnt come hadnt been invited emma corrected silently its not that at all since she got back in town youve been spending more time with her over at that loft than here with me drew i havent even seen her for nearly two weeks between my work and our social life i havent had time youve always got time to bitch though she jerked back furious she shoved his hand aside before he could grab her again im going up to bed she pushed her way through the crowd ignoring the calls and laughter he caught her on the stairs the bite of his fingers told her he was every bit as angry as she let go of me she said under her breath i dont think you want a fight here in front of your friends then well take it upstairs he squeezed until she yelped then dragged her the rest of the way she was prepared for an argument indeed she relished the thought of a good screaming match when she walked into the bedroom she snapped they were using her antique mirror to cut the coke four of them bent over her vanity table giggling and snorting in the white powder the old perfume bottles shed collected had been pushed aside one lay shattered on the floor get out four heads popped up and she was eyed with owlish grins i said out get the hell out of my room get the hell out of my house before drew could stop her she had grabbed the closest person a man about twice her weight and had dragged him up hey look well share get out she repeated shoving him toward the door they moved quickly enough then filing out one of the women stopped long enough to pat drews cheek emma slammed the door behind them and rounded on her husband ive had enough ive had all im going to take drew i want those people out of here and i wont have them coming back wont you he said quietly doesnt it matter to you doesnt it matter at all this is our bedroom christ drew look at my things theyve been in my closet enraged she picked up a heap of silk and linen god knows what theyve stolen or broken this time but thats not the worst i dont even know those people and theyre in my bedroom doing drugs i wont have drugs in my house she saw him swing back but the movement didnt register the back of his hand connected hard enough with her face to send her sprawling she tasted blood dazed she lifted a hand to her split lip your house he dragged her to her feet her shirt tore as he heaved her away she landed hard against the bedside table her beloved tiffany lamp crashed to the floor spoiled little bitch its your house too stunned to fight back she cringed when he advanced on her the roar of the music drowned out her scream as he picked her up again and threw her on the bed our house you bloody well remember that its as much mine as yours its all as much mine as yours dont you ever think you can tell me what to do do you think you can humiliate me that way and get away with it i wasnt she broke off drawing her shoulders up as he lifted his hand thats better ill let you know when i want to bear you whine always get your way dont you emma well we wont let tonight be any exception you want to sit up here all alone thats fine he picked up the phone and ripped it out of the wall you just sit up here he threw the phone up against the wall before he strode out slamming and locking the door behind him she sat curled on the bed breathing hard too numb to ache from the cuts and bruises it was a nightmare she thought shed had other nightmares painfully she remembered the slaps and shouts shed lived with for the first three years of her life spoiled little bitch was that janes voice or drews shivering she reached out the little black dog from her childhood sat on the pillow curling her arm around him she cried herself to sleep when he unlocked the door the next morning she was asleep standing in the doorway drew studied her dispassionately the side of her face was swollen hed have to make sure she didnt go out in public for a couple of days stupid to have lost his temper he thought rubbing his palms on his thighs satisfying but stupid but then she was always pushing him he was doing his best wasnt he and it wasnt easy a man might as well take a dead fish to bed as sleep with her and she was always talking about her goddamn show sneaking off for hours in the darkroom instead of taking care of him it was his work his needs that came first it was time she understood that a wife was supposed to take care of her husband thats why hed married her she was supposed to take care of him to help him get where he wanted to go maybe knocking her around had been a good thing shed sure as hell think twice before defying him again but now that hed shown her who was running things he could afford to be generous sweet little emma he thought it only took a little effort to manage her emma carefully avoiding the shards of the broken lamp drew crossed to the bed he watched her eyes open saw the fear oh baby im so sorry she winced when he stroked her hair i dont know what happened i just lost it i deserve to be locked up she didnt speak like an echo her mothers thick apologies came back to her you have to forgive me emma i love you so much it was just the way you were screaming at me blaming me it wasnt my fault he took her rigid fingers and pressed them to his lips i know those scum had no right to be in here in our room but it wasnt my fault i tossed them out myself he improvised it was just a rage he continued when i saw them in here i was so furious then you turned on me she began to cry again slow silent tears that squeezed between her tightly shut lashes ill never hurt you again emma i swear it ill go away if you want you can divorce me god knows what id do without you but i wont ask you to let me stay its justchrist its just that everythings piling up the album isnt selling as well as we expected the grammy passed right over us and i think about us having a baby all the time he began to weep then holding his head in his hands tentatively she reached out to touch his arm he nearly laughed then gripped her fingers in his falling on his knees beside the bed please emma i know the fact that you were hounding me that you turned on me is no excuse for what i did forgive me give me another chance ill do anything to make it up to you well work it out she murmured with his face pressed against the coverlet he smiled the parties stopped oh there were a few gatherings now and again with people emma was comfortable with but there were no more throngs of strangers in her home drew was attentive and sweet the way she remembered him from their courtship she convinced herself that the rage and the violence had been one isolated incident she had pushed him he reminded her of that often enough to make her believe it she had blamed him for something that wasnt his doing she had turned on him viciously instead of supporting and believing in him and if he lost his temper occasionally if she saw a flare of violence in his eyes watched his fists clench or his mouth tighten he could always give solid even logical reasons why she had set him off bruises healed pain faded he made an effort to take an interest in her photography though he pointed out in dozens of subtle ways that her hobby as he called it took time away from their marriage and her support of him and his career it was a nice print he might say if one cared to look at old ladies feeding pigeons so why had it taken her so many hours away from him to come up with a few blackandwhite snaps of people loitering in the park he supposed he could eat a cold sandwich even though hed been composing for six hours apparently it was up to him to drag the laundry to the cleaners despite the fact that hed been tied up in a meeting all afternoon she wasnt to worry a bit if her work was so bloody important he could entertain himself for another evening whatever criticisms he handed out were tempered with compliments she looked so inviting standing in front of the stove making a meal it made him feel good to come home and find her waiting for him perhaps he was too forceful about how she should dress what clothes she bought how she styled her hair after all her image as his wife was as important as his own he was particularly concerned about what she should wear to the showing but as he said he only wanted her to look her best and as he told her she had a rather drab taste in clothes it was true that she preferred the column of black silk and hammeredgold jacket to the short snug concoction of feathers and sequins hed chosen but as he said she was an artist now and should look the part because it touched her that hed called her an artist she wore it to please him he gave her a pair of chunky gold earrings set with multicolored stones if they were a bit gaudy it hardly mattered he had fastened them on her himself when they pulled up in front of the small uptown gallery her stomach began doing calisthenics drew patted her hand come on emma its not as though youre going on stage in front of ten thousand screaming fans its just a little picture show with a laugh he helped her out of the limo loosen up people are going to buy brian mcavoys little girls snapshots whether they like them or not she stopped on the curb incredibly hurt drew thats not what i need to hear right now i want to do this on my own never satisfied he snatched her arm hard enough to make her wince here i am trying to be a good sport about all this trying to support you in what youre hellbent on doing no matter what the inconvenience to me and you bite my head off i didnt mean to you never do since you want to be on your own so badly perhaps youd like to go on in alone no of course i dont nerves and frustration intensified the pounding behind her eyes she could never seem to find the right thing to say she thought and tonight of all nights she didnt want to alienate him im sorry drew i didnt mean to snap at you im just nervous all right then satisfied with the apology he patted her hand and drew her inside they had come lateas runyun had ordered hed wanted the crowd there and already intrigued when his star arrived he had his eagle eye on the door and pounced the moment emma walked through he was a small bulky man who invariably wore a black turtleneck and black jeans emma had once thought he was affecting an artistic image but the simple fact was he was vain and thought black made him look slimmer he had a big bald head made more prominent by the high necklines and thick black brows flecked with gray over his surprisingly pale green eyes his nose was hooked his mouth thin he compensated by sporting a clark gable mustache it did nothing to improve his looks which had always been poor at best yet his three wives hadnt left him because he was ugly but because he paid more attention to his art than his marriages he greeted emma not with a smile or a kiss but with a scowl good god you look like a starlet out to lay a director never mind he added before emma could speak just mingle for a bit emma looked at the crowd the glitter of jewels and silk the gleam of leather with a kind of dull horror youre not going to disgrace me by fainting runyun said no one could have called it a question no she drew a deep breath no i wont good he had yet to speak to or acknowledge drew whom he had detested on sight the press is here theyve already eaten half the canapds i believe your fathers been cornered by someone dad hes here over there runyun gestured vaguely now mingle and look confident i didnt think hed come emma murmured to drew of course he came drew had counted on it he put an affectionate arm around her shoulders he loves you emma hed never miss an important night like this lets find him i clont the affectionate arm squeezed startling a gasp out of her emma hes your father dont be snotty she moved through the crowd beside him smiling automatically stopping now and then to chat it helped a great deal to hear drew brag about her his approval which had been so long in coming brought a glow inside her shed been stupid she thought now to think he resented her work accepting his kiss of congratulations she vowed to spend more time with him give more time to his needs shed always wanted to be needed smiling at drew as he enthusiastically discussed her prints with other guests she was content that she was at his insistence she accepted a glass of champagne but barely touched it as they worked the room she saw brian surrounded by people in front of a portrait of himself and johnno her face hurt from keeping the smile in place as she crossed to him dad emma he hesitated then reached out for her hand she looked so remote he thought it was nice of you to come im proud of you his fingers tightened on hers as if he were searching for the connection he felt was lost very very proud she started to speak then there was a volley of flashes from the surrounding cameras was that another flash she wondered a flash of annoyance on his face before the easy smile settled in brian how does it feel to have your daughter taking the spotlight he didnt glance up at the reporter but continued to look at emma i couldnt be more pleased making the effort he offered his hand to drew drew brian shes great isnt she he pressed a gentle kiss to her temple i dont know whos been more nervous about tonight emma or myself i hope youll stick around for a few days come by and see our place have dinner it infuriated brian that the invitation had come from drew and not his own daughter im afraid i leave for la in the morning emma she turned and her strained smile vanished in surprise stevie on a laugh she threw her arms around him im so glad to see you moving back to arms length she studied him you look good and it was true he would never be the smoothly handsome man she bad known in childhood but he had put on weight and the heavy shadows no longer haunted his eyes i didnt know youd no one told me that he was out she thought understanding he grinned time off for good behavior he told her then gathered her close for another hug i even brought my own doctor he released emma to put a hand on the shoulder of the woman beside him after a moments confusion emma recognized the petite brunette as stevies psychiatrist hello again hello katherine haynes smiled and congratulations thank you i was your first sale katherine went on the portrait of stevie and his guitar it looked as though he were making love to it i couldnt resist shell analyze it for hours he caught the scent of scotch and had to check an old and deep craving pms around you know stevie leaned close and lowered his voice to a wicked whisper he brought lady annabelle no really i think theyre engaged but hes being coy about it with a wink he took katherines arm and wandered off emma was laughing as she slipped her arm through drews i think ill take a look for pm she cast a questioning glance at her father what could he say shed greeted stevie with more affection and comfort than she had greeted him he wanted to have it out with her but now was hardly the time or place go ahead ill see you before i go yes go ahead emma drew kissed her cheek ill just hang around with your dad that way we can both brag about you incredible isnt she drew began as emma turned away she very nearly felt incredible shed never expected so many people or much interest in her work there was a little voice that asked her if she really thought theyd come to see her work or her father and his mates she did her best to ignore it she did see pm it was obvious he was no longer running away from lady annabelle in fact he seemed to be having the time of his life she was dressed in emeraldgreen leather and snakeskin boots dyed canaryyellow her frizzy red hair shot out like shock waves and after a tenminute conversation emma realized the woman was completely and totally in love it was nice emma decided pm deserved that kind of devotion that kind of well tin people came and went but more came to linger runyun was very cleverly playing a devastation retrospective through the speakers she saw with some astonishment the discreet blue sticker beneath more than a dozen of her prints sold she thought trapped in a corner by a pretentious little man who wanted to discuss form and texture she spotted marianne excuse me she began but before she could make her escape her old roommate was bearing down on her heres the star of the evening she gave emma a big whopping kiss you she said and pulled emma toward her and into a cloud of chanel have done it a long way from saint catherines pal yeah emma squeezed her eyes tight it had taken only that to make it all seem real at last look who i found bev emma moved out of mariannes arms and into bevs i didnt think youd be able to make it i wouldnt have missed it for anything we walked in together and i recognized her marianne explained weve been having a marvelous time complimenting you while we shoved through the crowd this is wild she snatched one of the few remaining canaps from the table you know that shot of me in the loft wearing a paint smock and rugby socks some gorgeous man just bought it im going to go see if hed like a chance at the real thing its no trouble seeing why you love her bev commented as marianne maneuvered through the groups of people so how does it feel incredible tfrrifying she pressed a hand to her jumpy stomach but it wasnt nerves as much as excitement now ive been trying to get back to the ladies room for an hour to have a good cry im so glad youre here then she saw brian standing a few feet away dads here will you speak to him bev had to turn her head only inches to see him she twisted her evening bag over and over in her hand after all these years she thought it was still there everything shed felt was still there of course she said it lightly it was safe here in a crowd on emmas night at least they could share their pleasure for emma he walked toward them could it be as difficult for him bev wondered as it was for her would his palms be wet with nerves would his heart be trembling he didnt touch her didnt dare but he struggled to find a voice as casual as his smile its good to see you and you she fought to relax her death grip on her bag you look beautiful wonderful well thank you i am this is all marvelous for emma isnt it she glanced over but emma had slipped away walls of people had closed in around them you must be very proud of her yes he took a long swallow of the whiskey he held can i get you a drink so polite bev thought so bloody civil no thanks im going to wander around a bit and look i may just buy something myself but first she was going to find that ladies room and have a cry of her own it was nice seeing you again bri bev it was foolish to think that she could still care for him goodbye emma watched them from across the room and wanted to scream at both of them couldnt they see it wasnt just her imagination or wishful thinking she was much too good at studying people and seeing what they felt in the eyes in a gesture in the set of the body they were still in love and still afraid she drew a deep breath and started toward her father perhaps if she talked to him emmy luy johnno caught her around the waist im about to make my escape you cant go yet she straightened his lapels he was into retro clothing these days and they were almost as wide as the palm of her hand bevs here is she well ill have to go see if shes ready to run away with me yet but in the meantime ive run into someone from your past my past she laughed i dont have a past ah but you do a sultry summer day on the beach a hunk in blue trunks like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat he swept his arm aside michael how odd to see him there she thought looking handsome and uncomfortable in a suit and tie his dark hair was thick and still unstyled his face had fined down was lean and bony with the slightly crooked nose an appealing flaw he had his hands in his pockets and looked as though hed rather be anywhere else on earth i ahwas in town so she was laughing when she threw her arms around him he thought his heart stopped he knew his brain did slowly carefully he pulled his hands free and pressed them lightly to her back she felt as hed remembered as hed always imagined she would feel slender and firm and fragile this is wonderful i cant believe youre really here everything rushed through her so quickly an afternoon on the beach two afternoons what shed felt as a child then as a woman slammed into her so fast so unexpectedly that she held him close and held him too long her eyes were damp when she drew back its been a long time yeah about four years give or take he could have given her years months and days you look great so do you ive never seen you dressed up before well are you in new york on business yeah it was a bald lie but he was less concerned with veracity than with looking like a fool i read about your show that was the truth only hed read about it at his breakfast table in california then hed taken three days personal leave so what do you think about what the show she took his hand and began to walk its great really i dont know anything about photography but i like your stuff in fact in fact she prompted i didnt know you could do something like this like this one he stopped in front of a print it was of two men woolen caps over their ears ragged coats pulled tight one of them was lying on a sheet of cardboard apparently asleep the other looked directly into the camera his eyes surly and tired its very powerful and very disturbing not all of new york is madison avenue it takes a lot of talent and sensitivity to be able to show all the sides equally she looked at him with some surprise that was exactly what she had tried to do with her studies of the city of devastation of people you certainly say the right things for someone who doesnt know much about photography when are you going back in the morning first thing oh she walked with him again surprised at the depth of her disappointment i was hoping youd be able to stay for a few days i wasnt even sure youd talk to me that was a long time ago michael and i wasnt reacting so much to what was going on with you as to something that had just happened to me its not important now she smiled and kissed his cheek forgive me that was my question still smiling she touched a hand to his face emma she jolted when drew spoke from behind her guilt it spread through her sharply as if he had found her and michael in bed rather than in a room crowded with people oh drew you gave me a start this is michael kesselring an old friend of mine michael drew my husband drew hooked one arm firmly around emmas waist he didnt offer michael a hand but a brisk nod there are people who want to meet you emma youve been ignoring your duties my fault michael said quickly concerned with how quickly the glow fled from emmas eyes we havent seen each other in a while congratulations emma thank you give my best to your parents i will it was jealousy he told himself plain and simple jealousy that made him want to grab her away from her husband michael she said as drew began to pull her aside keep in touch sure he grabbed a glass off a passing tray as he watched them move away if it was only jealousy he wondered why every instinct had him itching to bash drew latimers pretty face in because hes got her michael told himself ruthlessly and you dont drew wasnt drunk hed nursed two glasses of champagne during the long and excruciatingly boring evening he wanted to be clearheaded and in control he prided himself that kissing up to brian mcavoy would reap rewards any fool could have seen that drew latimer was devoted to and besotted with his wife he should have won a tucking oscar for the performance and all the while hed been playing the doting husband shed been flaunting her success her snotty boardingschool education and her society friends hed wanted to slap her around right there in front of all the cameras then the world would have seen who was really on top but her daddy wouldnt have liked it not him or any of the producers promoters and buttoneddown executives who fawned over the great brian mcavoy theyd be fawning over drew latimer before long he promised himself then shed pay hed almost decided to let her have her glory then shed had the nerve to hang all over that friend she needed to be taught a lesson for that and he was just the man to do it he was silent on the ride home it didnt seem to bother emma she was half asleep beside him pretending to be asleep drew decided shed probably already made plans to meet that creep kesselring he imagined them togetherin some fancy hotel suite groping around in bed it almost made him laugh kesselring would be in for a disappointment when he discovered pretty little emma was a dud between the sheets but kesselring wasnt going to have the chance to find out no one cheated on drew latimer he was going to drive that point home very shortly she was half dreaming when the limo stopped with a sigh she settled her head on drews shoulder as he led her into the lobby i feel as though ive been up all night on a sleepy laugh she snuggled against him and the whole night seems like a dream i dont think i can manage to wait up for the reviews it was as though she were floating emma thought and it felt wonderful she slipped out of her wrap the moment they were in the door i think ill he hit her a resounding blow that sent her tumbling down the two tiled stairs into the living room moaning she touched a hand to the side of her face drew bitch you sneaky conniving bitch dazed she watched him advance on her instinct had her trying to slide away drew dont please what did i do he yanked her up by the hair slapping her again before she could scream you know what you did you whore when he punched a fist into her breast she sank bonelessly to the floor all night all tucking night i had to stand around smiling pretending to care about your stupid pictures do you think anybody came to see them he hauled her up by the shoulders leaving reddening trails where his fingers bit in do you think anybody cares about you they came to see brian mcavoys little girl they came to see drew latimers wife youre nothing he tossed her down oh god please dont hit me again please dont tell me what to do th emphasize his point he kicked her missing her ribs but connecting hard against her hip you think youre so smart so special im the one they want to see and im the one who runs things around here you remember that yes she tried to curl up praying he would leave her there until the pain went away yes i remember did michael come to see you he grabbed her hair again dragging her over onto her back michael dazed she shook her head the pain rolled inside it no no dont lie to me he struck her over and over openpalmed the back of the hand until she didnt feel anything you had it all planned didnt you oh im so tired drew im going right to sleep then you were going to sneak out and sleep with him werent you she shook her head but he hit her again admit it you wanted to fuck him admit it yes thats why you wore this dress you wanted to show off your legs and those useless little tits of yours dimly she remembered that drew had chosen the dress hadnt he chosen it she couldnt be sure and you had your hands all over him letting him paw you right there in front of everybody you wanted him didnt you she nodded she had hugged michael and for a moment when hed been warm and solid against her she had felt something she couldnt remember what she couldnt remember anything youre not going to see him again are you no not ever no i wont see him and you wont wear this whores dress again he hooked a hand in the bodice and ripped it down the center you deserve to be punished emma dont you yes her mind was floating in and out shed spilled her mams perfume she wasnt supposed to touch mams things she was a bad nasty girl and needed to be punished its for your own good she didnt scream again until he pushed her onto her stomach and began to beat her with his belt she had stopped screaming long before he finished he djdnt apologize this time there was no need to it took her ten days in bed to recover and all the while he told her she had brought it on herself there was a part of her mind that knew he was wrong knew he was crazy but he was persistent and in an odd way loving as he explained over and over that he was only acting in her best interest shed only been thinking of herself hadnt she when shed spent all those weeks preparing for her show shed sent her husband to bed alone night after night then had flouted her marriage in public by flirting with another man shed pushed him to it shed deserved it shed brought it on herself though the phone rang constantly for several days following the showing she didnt answer any of her calls at first her mouth was too swollen and sore to allow her to speak drew brought her ice packs and fed her soup he gave her pills that took the edge off the worst of the pain and helped her sleep through it then he told her that people were only calling her to get to him they needed to be alone to work out their marriage to make a baby she wanted a family didnt she she wanted to be happy and be taken care of if she hadnt put so much time and effort into her work she would be pregnant by now isnt that what she wanted and when he asked her drilling her with the questions one after another as she lay recovering she agreed but agreement was never enough she awoke alone to dark and music a dream she told herself gripping the sheets fighting to wake but even when her eyes were open she could hear it those odd words sung by a man who was dead her fingers shook as she groped for the switch on the lamp at the bedside she turned and turned and turned it but the light didnt shine didnt fill the room and chase the shadows as the music grew louder she put her hands over her ears but she could still hear it throbbing pulsing until her screams drowned it out there emma there now drew was beside her stroking her hair another nightmare you should have outgrown them by now shouldnt you the music she could only gasp and cling he was her lifeline the only solid line that could pull her out of the sea of fear and madness it wasnt a dream i heard it the songi told youthe song that was playing when darren was killed there isnt any music quietly he set the remote for the stereo aside it was a good lesson he thought as she trembled against him a good way to keep her dependent and manageable i heard it she was sobbing now between chattering teeth and the light the lights wont go on youre too old to be afraid of the dark he said gently reaching down he plugged in the lamp and turned the switch better she nodded her face buried against his shoulder thank you gratitude rushed through and overwhelmed her with the light she went limp in his arms dont leave me alone drew please dont leave me alone i told you id take care of you he smiled and continued to stroke her hair i wont leave you alone emma you dont have to worry about that by christmas she thought she was happy again drew took all the details of daytoday living out of her hands he chose her clothes monitored her calls took away all the business of handling her money all she had to do was tend the house and him decisions were no longer there to trouble her to make her anxious her darkroom equipment and camera were shut away they no longer held any interest for her when she thought of her work it brought on depression he bought her a diamond pendant in the shape of a huge teardrop for christmas she didnt know why it made her want to cry she had a battery of fertility tests when her most intimate troubles were leaked to the press she suffered her humiliations in silence then stopped reading the papers altogether it hardly mattered to emma what went on in the outside world her world consisted of the seven rooms overlooking central park when the doctors confirmed that there was no physical reason for her not to conceive she hesitantly suggested that drew have some tests of his own he knocked her unconscious and locked her in the bedroom for two days the nightmares continued once sometimes twice a week sometimes he would be there to soothe and stroke until she calmed again other times he would call her a fool complain that she was disturbing his sleep and leave her to tremble in the dark when he was careless enough to leave the remote by the bedside and the abbey road album on the stereo she was too tired to care dimly almost dispassionately she began to realize what he was doing to her what he was making of her the whirlwind ten weeks of the tour and the man she had fallen in love with were like a fantasy shed created there was no portion of him left in the man who kept her a virtual prisoner in the apartment she thought of running away he rarely left her alone for more than a few hours and was always with her when she went out but sometimes when she lay in bed in the middle of the night she thought of escape she would call marianne or bev or her father they would help her then the shame would take over blistered by the doubts hed so deeply embedded in her mind he didnt use the belt on her again until the night of the american music awards when he and his group were passed over for record of the year she didnt resist she didnt object as he pounded her with his fists she crawled inside herself as she had once crawled under the kitchen sink and disappeared in his rage he made a drastic error in judgment he told her why he had married her what the hell good are you as she lay on the floor fighting to hide from the pain he rushed around the room smashing whatever came to hand do you think i wanted to get stuck with a spoiled stupid sexless bitch he vented his frustration at having to sit smiling while someone else mounted the stage and accepted the award his award by hurling a waterford cracker barrel the exquisite glass shattered raining down like ice have you done one thing one bloody thing to help me everything ive done for you making you feel important making you believe that i wanted you putting romance into your dull prim little life tired of breaking glass he swooped down to pull her up by what was left of her dress did you really believe that i didnt know who you were that first day he shook her but she remained limp hardly focusing on his face she was beyond fear now beyond hope she watched his eyes tawny and dark narrow into slits and there was hate in them you were such a fool emma stuttering and blushing i nearly laughed out loud then i married you for christs sake and all i expected was that youd help me move up but have you once asked your father to push a few buttons for me no she didnt answer silence was the only weapon she had left disgusted he dropped her to the floor again though her vision was blurred she watched him pace through the chaos of the room shed tried to make a home youd better start thinking youd better start to figure out a way to make all this time ive spent on you pay off emma let her eyes close again she didnt weep it was too late for weeping but she did begin to plan her first real hope of escape came when she heard that luke had died he was my friend drew he was a tucking queer he was trying out chords on the grand piano he had bought with his wifes money he was a friend she repeated struggling to keep her voice from trembling i have to go to the funeral you dont have to go anywhere he glanced up smiled at her you belong right here with me not at some fags death march she hated him then it amazed her that she could feel it it had been so long since shed felt anything strange that a tragedy would make her finally accept what a waste her marriage was she would divorce him she opened her mouth then saw his long slim fingers run over the keys slim they were but strong as steel shed begged for a divorce once before and hed nearly choked her it would do no good to make him angry but she did have a weapon drew its public knowledge that he was my friend he was a friend of johnnos and dads and everyone if i dont go the press is going to start by saying that i ignored him because he died ofaids it wont look good for you especially now that youre doing that benefit with dad he pounded on the chords if the bitch didnt stop nagging he was going to have to shut her up i dont give a flying fuck what the press says im not going to a funeral for a freak she held on to her temper it was vital she kept her voice soft and soothing i understand how you feel drew a man like you so virile she almost choked on the word but the benefit is going to be televised here and in europe its the biggest thing since live aid the moneys going to research a cure for exactly what luke died of she paused letting it sink in i can go with johnno representing you she said quickly he looked up from the keys again his eyes flat her heart began to pound it was a look she knew and feared anxious to get away are you dear no she forced herself to move to him to touch a hand to his hair id much rather you go with me she gritted her teeth we could go on down to the keys afterward dammit emma you know im working typical of you to think only of yourself of course im sorry she backed off in a submission that was only partly an act its just that id love it if we could get away for a few days just the two of us ill call johnno and tell him i cant make it drew considered a moment the benefit was the break he needed he intended to dump birdcage walk and strike out solo he was the star after all and the rest of the group was holding him back he needed big exposure and lots of interested press if a funeral could help him along that was fine in any case he wanted nothing more than to get rid of emma for a day or two i think you should go her heart nearly stopped be careful she warned herself dont make a mistake then youll come no but i think you can manage one day on your own especially if johnno takes care of you make sure to weep copiously and say all the right things about the tragedy of aids she wore a simple black suit since drew watched her every move she couldnt take anything else shed hardly need fancy duds for a spot of mourning would she he asked she was allowed a pair of black pumps and an oversized purse that would double as a carryon he even checked through her cosmetics bag while she sat on the bed since hed locked her passport up and taken her credit cards away you really are careless about such matters emmashe was totally dependent upon him he made her flight arrangements a roundtrip hed given her fourteen hours of freedom her flight left laguardia at ninefifteen and she was due back at ten twentyfive the same evening hed generously allotted her forty dollars in cash shed stolen fifteen more feeling like a thief from the housekeeping money shed tucked it in her shoe now and again she wiggled her toes felt it and was struck with excitement and shame she was lying to him dont ever lie to me emma im always find out the truth and punish you she was never coming back dont ever try to leave me emma ill find you ill always find you and youll be sorry she was running away youll never run fast enough to get away from me emma you belong to me you need me to take care of you because you make so many stupid mistakes emma dammit emma pay attention she jerked when he tugged hard on her hair im sorry her fingers gripped together twisting wringing youre such a damn fool god knows where youd be without me i was thinking about luke well save the long face until youre gone it makes me sick johnnos going to be here any minute to get you he leaned close so that his face was all she could see what are you going to tell him if he asks how things are that theyre fine theyre wonderful youre sorry you cant come but you felt since you didnt know luke youd be intruding she recited the instructions he gave her like a parrot ive got to come back straight from the service because youve got a touch of the flu and i want to take care of you just like a devoted wife yes a devoted wife good it was disgusting really how cowed she was she hadnt even uttered a peep when hed knocked her around the night before hed wanted her to leave with his dominance fresh in her mind of course hed been careful not to hit her in the face or anywhere it might show he intended to give her a proper beating when she got back just to remind her that a womans place was in the home his mothers place had been in the home drew thought viciously but shed left soon enough like the whore she was leaving him with his wreck of a father if the stupid old man had given her a few licks now and again she wouldnt have taken off he smiled at emma no like emma his mother would have sat with her hands folded in her lap and done just what she was told all a woman needed was a man to set the rules and enforce them maybe its not such a good idea for you to go he enjoyed seeing her eyes widen it was a great game to dangle the funeral in front of her nose like a carrot on a stick her hands sprang wet with sweat but she fought to keep them steady in her lap i wont go if you dont want me to drew he stroked her face then gently so that she could almost remember what it had been like in the beginning it made it worse somehow to remember no you go ahead emma you look so good in black youre sure that bitch marianne isnt going no johnno said she couldnt make it another lie and one she prayed johnno wouldnt reveal drew had done all he could to separate her from marianne and done it well enough emma thought wearily that her old friend no longer called or bothered to drop by thats fine then if i found out she was going youd have to skip this little jaunt shes a bad influence on you emma shes a slut only pretended to be your friend so that she could get closer to your father and then to me i told you that she came on to me remember yes ah thats johnno come on now put on that sad sweet smile we all know and love her lips curved automatically thats a good girl now dont forget to mention the benefit to any reporters he instructed as they walked downstairs make sure you tell them how committed i am to raising money to research a cure for this horrible disease i will drew i wont forget she was terrified her knees would buckle maybe it was best if she didnt go drew had told her again and again how helpless she was without him drew i but he was opening the door and johnno was standing there hello baby he put his arms around her as much to comfort as for comfort im so glad youre going yes she looked dully over his shoulder at drews face i want to go she fought demons during the flight he was going to come after her he had found out shed taken the fifteen dollars and would come to punish her hed read her mind he knew she wasnt going back so great was her fear that she clung to johnnos arm as they deplaned and searched the crowd at the gate for drew she was sweating by the time they reached the limo and shaking and struggling just to breathe emma are you sick no she moistened her dry lips there was a man by the curb lean blond what was left of her color drained but he turned and it wasnt drew im just upset can lan i have a cigarette drew wouldnt let her smoke hed dislocated her finger the last time hed caught her but he wasnt here now she reminded herself as she pulled on the cigarette she was alone in the limo with johnno maybe you shouldnt have come i had no idea it would upset you this badly he was dealing with his own grief great stunning waves of it and could only wrap an arm around her shoulders ill be all right she told him then repeated the words over and over in her head like a prayer she hardly noticed the servicewhat words were said what tears were shed in the warm moist heat of noontime in her heart she hoped luke would forgive her for caring so little that he was being mourned she felt dead herself emotionally dead as people walked away from the quiet gravesite away from the white and pink marble stones and lush flowers she wondered if she would have the strength to follow through johnno marianne stopped him a gentle hand on his arm then instead of condolences she kissed him i wish he could have taught me to cook she said and made johnno smile you were his only complete failure he turned to emma the driver will take you back to the airport i need to go over to lukes apartment like care of a few things he ran a finger down her cheek youll be all right yes i didnt expect to see you here though she hated herself marianne couldnt make her tone friendly i wanted to come really marianne opened her purse and tossed a balledup tissue inside her anger with emma was like that she thought balled up and frayed i didnt think you had time for old friends anymore marianne she couldnt break down right here there were still reporters close enough watching her snapping pictures drew was going to see the pictures of her and marianne together then he would know she lied she cast desperate looks over her shoulder can i i need are you all right marianne tipped down her sunglasses and studied emmas face christ you look terrible id like to talk with you if you have a few minutes ive always had a few minutes marianne retorted she dug in her purse for a cigarette i thought you were going straight back no she took a deep breath and stepped over the line im not going back at all through the haze of smoke mariannes eyes narrowed what im not going back emma repeated and was terrified when her voice began to hitch can we go somewhere please i have to go somewhere sure marianne stuck a hand under emmas elbow well take your limo well go anywhere you like it took only a short time to reach mariannes hotel which when emma began to shake was the best place marianne could think of to take her they went straight up to the suite a beautiful pastel set of rooms overlooking the crowded white sand and blue water marianne had already made the space hers by tossing articles of clothing over every available chair she scooped up the sweatshirt and slacks she had traveled in gestured for emma to sit then went to the phone i want a bottle of grand marnier two cheeseburgers medium a basket of fries and a liter of pepsi in a bucket of ice i got twenty bucks for the guy who gets up here in fifteen minutes satisfied she swept her running shoes off another chair and sat okay emma what the hells going on ive left drew not quite ready to forgive she stretched out her legs yes i think i picked up on that but why i thought you were deliriously happy yes im very happy hes wonderful he takes such good care she heard her own voice and trailed off with a kind of panicked disgust oh god sometimes i actually believe it believe what what hes trained me to say marianne i dont know who else i can talk to and i think if i dont say it right here and right now i never will i wanted to tell johnno i started to but i just couldnt all right because emma looked much too pale marianne rose and opened the balcony doors sea air fluttered in take your time is it another woman marianne said nothing just watched as emma began to rock back and forth and laugh oh christ sweet christ before she could stop the laughter had turned to sobs great wrenching sobs moving quickly marianne knelt beside her to take her hands easy emma youre going to make yourself sick hey hey we all know most men are bastards if drews been unfaithful you just kick him out its not another woman emma managed another man she struggled sucking in the tears afraid if she let them fall too freely shed never be able to stop no i have no idea if drews been unfaithful and i dont care if its not another woman what did you fight about we didnt fight emma said wearily i didnt fight she hadnt known it would be so hard to say so hard to admit the words were like a fist lodged in her throat heated with shame taking deep breaths she wiped her eyes with the back of her hands sitting here i can almost believe i imagined it all that it wasnt as bad as i thought while it all happened he could be so sweet marianne so considerate i remember how hed bring me a rose in the morning sometimes how hed singwhen it was just the two of ushow hed sing as though i were the only woman in the world he said he loved me that all he wanted was to make me happy to take care of me and then i would do somethingi hardly know whatbut something and then he would he beats me what if emma had said that drew sprouted wings and flew off the terrace every afternoon i would have been easier to believe he hits you the disbelief didn register she was too deep inside herself sometimes i cant even walk for days after its been worse lately she stared at a pretty pastel print on the wall i think he might want to kill me back up emma emma look at me when she caught her friends face in her hands marianne spoke slowly are you telling me that drew physically abuses you yes slowly carefully marianne let out a breath watching emmas face trying to make sense of it all she sat back on her heels does he get drunk do drugs no ive only seen him drunk onceon our wedding night he doesnt do drugs at all he likes to be in control drew has to be in control i always seem to do something something stupid to set him off stop it enraged marianne sprang up her eyes were flooded as she paced the room youve never done a stupid thing in your life how long has this been going on emma the first time was a couple of months after we moved uptown it wasnt so bad he only hit me once that time and he was so sorry after he cried my heart breaks for him marianne muttered she stalked to the door to admit room service here dont worry about setting it up she signed the check handed over the twenty and got rid of him first things first she decided and ignoring the food poured the grand marnier drink marianne ordered i know you hate the stuff but we both need it emma took two small sips and let the warmth course through her i dont know what to do i dont seem to be able to think for myself anymore ill think for you for a couple of minutes i vote we castrate the sonofabitch i cant go back marianne i think id do something something really horrible if i went back you seem to be thinking just fine can you eat no not yet she had to sit just sit for a moment and take in the enormity of what shed done shed left drew shed gotten away and now she had her friend her oldest and closest friend with her closing her eyes she felt a fresh wave of shame marianne im sorry so sorry i know i havent returned your calls i havent been a friend to you these past months he wouldnt let me marianne lighted two cigarettes and passed one to emma dont worry about that now he even told me that you hadthat you had tried to take him away from me in his dreams she nearly laughed at that but emmas face stopped her you didnt believe it no not really but there were times i believed anything hed tell me it was easier she shut her eyes again the worst is it wouldnt have mattered to me if youd just called me i couldnt talk to you about it and i couldnt bear to be around you because i was afraid youd find out id have helped you emma could only shake her head as her hands clasped and unclasped in her lap im so ashamed what the hell for i let him do it to me didnt i he didnt hold a gun to my head thats the one thing he never did to me he didnt have to i dont have the answers emma or i do have one you should call the police no good god no i couldnt bear to to see it spread all over the papers and they wouldnt believe me hed just deny it fear came sprinting back on her face in her voice i can tell you marianne he could make you believe anything all right well hold on the cops and get you a lawyer i need a few days i just cant talk to anyone else about this all i really want is to get as far away from him as i can okay well plot now were going to eat i think better on a full stomach she bullied emma into taking a few bites then pushed the pepsi on her hoping the sugar and caffeine would put color back in her friends cheeks well hang around miami for a few days no emma was thinking clearer now though the nerves were still jangling inside her head of all the wild plots and plans that had rushed into her mind over the last two days only one seemed right i cant even stay tonight its the first place hed come looking for me london then to bev shed want to help you no passport drew locked it in a safedeposit box i dont even have a drivers license he tore it up she sat back because even the few bites of food had made her queasy marianne i have fiftyfive dollars in my pursei stole fifteen of that from the housekeeping money i dont have any credit cards he took them months ago i have the clothes on my back and thats it because she wanted to break something marianne rose and poured another grand marnier all this time she thought all this time shed been sulking in the loft nursing hurt feelings while emma had been going through hell you dont have to worry about money your credits good with me ill get a cash advance on my credit card then call and authorize them to accept your signature you can have your pick visa mastercard or american express you must think im pathetic no i think youre the best friend ive ever had tears burned the back of her eyes marianne let them fall if i could id kill him for you you wont say anything to anyone not yet not if thats what you want but i think your father should know no things are bad enough between me and dad without adding this i think what i need most of all now is a little time i thought about going into the mountains somewhere a cabin in the woods but i dont think i could stand the quiet i want to lose myself in a big noisy city i keep thinking of la every time i thought about running i imagined running there and ive been dreaming about it again a lot about darren yes the nightmares started a few months ago and they wont let up i feel like i need to be there and i hope its the last place drew would expect me to go ill go with you emma reached over to take her hand i was hoping you would for a little while it was dark in the bedroom and filthy janes last day maid had quit the week before nipping a couple of silver candlesticks on her way out the door jane wasnt aware of the theft she rarely left the bedroom these days she made occasional runs to the kitchen for food wheezing and panting on the stairs like a hermit she horded the drugs and bottles and food in her room it had once been ornately decorated shed had a fancy for red velvet it still hung at the windows heavy creases caked with dust but in a rage shed torn down the curtains that had draped the plump round bed now because she was so often cold she huddled under them the red and silver flocked wallpaper was stained jane had a habit of throwing things at her loverslamps bricabrac and bottles which was why she had such a difficult time keeping anyone in her bed for more than two nights running the last one a tall muscular dealer named hitch had tolerated her temper fits longer than most then philosophically had knocked her unconscious stolen the diamond off her finger and had gone off to look for sunnier climes and more sympathetic company but hed left her the drugs hitch in his way was a humanitarian jane hadnt had sex in over two months it didnt particularly bother her if she wanted an orgasm she only had to pop the needle under her skin and cruise she didnt care that no one came to see her no one called except during that brief time after the drug started to wear off and before she craved another fix then she would become weepy and full of selfpity and anger most of what she felt was anger the movie hadnt done nearly as well as predicted it had jumped with almost rude haste from theater to video she had been in such a hurry to see the movie made she had all but signed over the video rights her agent had been unhappy with the deal but jane had fired him and gone her own way the movie hadnt made her rich a lousy hundred thousand pounds didnt last long with someone of her tasteand appetites her new book was being rewritten again she wouldnt see the bulk of her advance until the stupid ghost writer had completed the job her oldest source had dried up there were no more checks from brian shed depended on them not only for the money jane thought but because shed known that as long as hed been paying hed been thinking of her she was glad hed never found real happiness she was proud that shed had some part in seeing him denied if she couldnt have him she at least had the pleasure of knowing no other woman had held him for very long there were still times when she fantasized about him coming to his senses coming back to her and begging her forgiveness in those fantasies she saw them making love in the red velvet bed the hot frantic sex they had shared so many years before her body was curvy and smooth a young girls jane always imagined herself that way shed grown grotesquely fat her breasts like soggy balloons hung down to what had been her waist fishwhite her belly drooped low and was ringed with row after row of loose flesh her arms and thighs were massive and shook like jelly with tab whenever she stirred herself to move them it had become so difficult to find a vein through the layers of fat that she had taken up freebasing she could still skin pop slide the needle under the skin but mainlining was rare she missed it mourned it like a mother mourns a lost child rising she turned on the bedside lamp she didnt like the light but she needed it to get to her pipe her hair hung limply and was blond only on the last few inches she had wanted to bleach it with clairols bombshell beige but had lost the box somewhere in her cluttered bedroom she wore a black lace nightie the size of a twoman pup tent when she lit the torch she looked like some mad pornographic welder the smoke calmed her shed been lying in bed planning she was shrewd enough to know she needed money a great deal of money if she wanted to pay her supplier and she wanted pretty clothes again pretty clothes and pretty boys to come and sink into her she wanted to go to parties to have people pay attention she smoked and smiled she knew how to get the money but shed have to be clever very clever the drug made her feel smart it was time to pull out her ace in the hole scrounging through her dresser she found a box of stationery it was pretty rainbowcolored paper with her name across the top she admired it for a time then took another hit from the pipe before searching for a pen muttering to herself a little insurance she thought as she began to write of course shed have to tear her name off the top she wasnt a fool she wrote like a child slowly her tongue caught between her teeth as she formed the letters when shed finished she was so pleased with her neatness she forgot about the letterhead there were stamps inside the box she hummed as she attached three of them they looked so pretty she added another then studied her craftsmanship for a time she puzzled over the address then began to write again kesselring police detective los angeles california usa after some thought she added urgent in the corner and underlined it she took it downstairs with her thinking she would find some clever hiding place on a detour into the kitchen she ate an entire carton of ice cream shoveling it into her mouth with a serving spoon spotting the envelope she began to mutter stupid girl she mumbled thinking of her last maid cant even post a damn letter going to sack her indignant she waddled out and with considerable effort bent to push the envelope under the front door she went back upstairs and smoked herself into oblivion it was a week before she remembered her plan in her mind she remembered writing the letter the insurance shed hidden it though she couldnt quite remember where that didnt worry her what worried her was that she was nearly out of food and drugs her last bottle of gin had been drained jane picked up the phone after a few hours she thought shed never have to worry about money again it was answered on the third ring hello dear its jane what do you want ooh thats a nice way to speak to an old friend there was a sigh bitten off i said what do you want just a chat luy just a chat she giggled blackmail was so much fun im running a bit low on funds thats not my problem oh i think it is you see when i run low on funds my conscience starts acting up just lately ive been feeling bad about what happened to brians poor little boy ive been feeling real bad about it you never gave a damn about that boy thats a hard thing to say dear after all im a mother thinking of my own sweet emma a grownup married lady now makes me think about that boy why hed be grownup himself if hed lived i dont have time for this better make time her voice changed roughened ive been thinking that i should drop that detective in the us a note you remember him dont you dearie kesseiring was his name imagine me remembering his name all these years she smiled to herself everyone thought she was stupid they wouldnt think it for long he hesitated too long and cursed himself theres nothing you can tell him no well well have to see wont we i thought i might write him a letter they might reopen the case if they had a couple of names to go by your name for instance and you stir this up its going to come back on you his voice was still calm but he was sweating you were every bit as involved as i oh no i wasnt there was i i never laid a finger on that boy what the hell had the boy been named donald or dennis she thought it hardly mattered no i didnt lay a hand on him but you did its murder even after all these years its murder theyve never proven anything they never will with a little help they might want to chance it dear no he didnt she would know that he couldnt chance it he was exactly where he wanted to be and intended to stay there whatever it took how much she smiled i think a million pounds would do it youre out of your mind it was my plan she screeched into the phone it was my idea and i never got a frigging penny its time to settle accounts dearie youre rich man you can spare it there was never any ransom to collect he reminded her because you screwed up i havent got a penny out of brian in two years now that emmas grown up hes cut me out cold we can just think of your payment to me as a retirement account that much money will keep me for a long time and i wont have to bother you again you bring it here tomorrow night and i wont have to mail my little note hours later she couldnt remember if she made the call or dreamed it and the letter where had she hidden the letter she went back to the pipe hoping it would help her think it seemed the best thing to do was write the letter again and if he didnt come soon if he didnt come very soon she would make another call jane sat down to write and soon fell asleep it was the doorbell that woke her ringing and ringing and ringing she wondered why that damn stupid girl didnt answer it it seemed to jane that nothing got done if she didnt do it herself huffing and puffing she groped her way down the stairs she remembered when she saw him he was standing at the door his eyes grim a briefcase in his hand and she remembered yes indeed you had to do things yourself come on in ducks its been a while i didnt come to visit he could only think she looked like a pig fat dirty all of her chins quivering as she laughed come on old friends like us well have a drink the liquors up in my room i conduct all my business in my boudoir in a coy invitation she put a hand on his lapel he tolerated it knowing he would burn the suit well conduct business anywhere you like but lets get it done you always were in a hurry she started up mammoth hips swaying he watched her seeing the way her hand gripped tight to the banister hearing her breath puffing one push he considered and shed go tumbling down no one would question it as anything but an accident he nearly reached out nearly touched her then he steadied himsell he had a better way a surer way here we are dear redfaced and wheezing she dropped on the bed name your poison the stench almost gagged him the room was lit by a single lamp and in the shadows he could see tangles of dirty clothes and dishes empty cartons and cans and bottles a fetid odor hung in the room like the cobwebs in the corners he could almost see it as he breathed slowly between his teeth ill pass on the drink he was careful not to touch anything not just because of fingerprints now but from fear of soiling himself suit yourself what have you brought me he set the briefcase beside her he would burn that as well he spun the combination then flipped the lid its part of the money i told you its impossible to raise a million in cash overnight youll have to be patient he turned the case toward her but i brought you something else to tide you over a sign of good faith she saw the bag plump with white powder on the neat stack of bills her heart began to race unsteadily her mouth filled with saliva thats a pretty sight before she could snatch it up he moved the case out of reach now whos in a hurry he enjoyed taunting her he could see the fine sweat popping out on her face dribbling down her jowls hed dealt with junkies before and knew just how to handle them its topgrade heroin the best money can buy one shot of this and youll go straight to heaven or hell he thought if one believed in such things you can have it jane all of it but youve got to give me something back her heart was a triphammer in her breast making her short of breath and giddy what do you want the letter you give me the letter and another few days to raise the rest of the money and the smack is all yours the letter she had forgotten about it all she could do was stare at the bag of white powder and imagine what it would be like to have it swimming in her veins there isnt any letter i didnt write a letter insurance she remembered and sent him a sly glance yet i didnt write it yet but i will let me have a hit then well talk talk first oh it would be a pleasure to kill her he thought as he studied the flecks of spittle on her mouth the boy had been an accident a tragic one and one he sincerely regretted he wasnt a violent man never had been but it would have given him enormous satisfaction to have choked the life from jane palmer with his own hands i started to write it confused and anxious jane glanced toward the desk i started to but i was waiting for you i wont finish it if we have a deal she wouldnt lie he thought as he studied her face she wasnt clever enough we have a deal he turned the case around again go ahead take it she grabbed the bag in both hands for a moment he thought she might tear it apart with her teeth and gobble it like candy instead she moved as fast as her bulk would carry her and began to search through drawers for her works he waited both appalled and fascinated by the procedure she went through she paid no attention to him now but mumbled to herself her hands shook so that she spilled a little her breath came loud and harsh as she cooked the first spoon she didnt want to skinpop it she didnt want to smoke it this she would mainline squat on the floor licking her lips as though she were about to dine she filled the syringe there were tears in her eyes as she searched for a vein then she closed them leaning back against the dresser as she waited for the kick it did swelling speeding bursting through her her eyes popped wide her body convulsed she screamed once riding the enormous crest he watched her die but found he didnt enjoy it after all it was an ugly process jane palmer had no more dignity in death than she had in life turning his back on her he took the surgical gloves out of his pocket and snapped them on he picked up the halfwritten letter first and placed it in the briefcase fighting revulsion he began to search picking over her things to make certain shed left nothing else in the house that might incriminate him brun groaned when the phone woke him he tried to sit up but the hangover screamed through his head like a chain saw shielding his eyes with one hand he groped for the phone what bri im pm call me back when im not dying brii guess you havent read the morning paper right the first time ill read tomorrow mornings paper thats when i plan to wake up janes dead brian jane his mind stayed blank for ten full seconds dead shes dead how odd somebody found her last night an exlover or a dealer or something shed been dead a couple of days with the heels of his hands he tried to rid his eyes of grit jesus i thought you should pull it together before the press starts on you and i figured youd want to be the one to tell emma emma brian pushed himself up against the headboard yeah yeah ill call her thanks for letting me know sure bri he trailed off hed started to tell brian he was sorry but he doubted anyone really was see you around right brian lay in bed a moment trying to imagine it he had known jane longer than anyone but johnno he had loved her once and he had hated her but he couldnt imagine her dead rising he walked to the window the sunlight hurt his eyes and churned the hangover up to blinding without thought he poured out two fingers of whiskey and downed it he was almost sorry that he couldnt feel anything but the pain in his head dulling now under the coat of whiskey shed been the first woman hed lain with turning his head he looked at the brunette sleeping under the rumpled satin sheets of his bed he didnt have any feelings for her either he was always careful to choose women who wouldnt want an attachment who would be as satisfied as he by a few nights of sex the dark dangerous careless sex that had nothing to do with affection hed made the mistake of choosing a woman who wanted more once jane had never let him get on with his life let him fully enjoy what he had then hed found bev shed wanted more too but with her so had he my god so had he she had never let him get on with his life either not once in seventeen years had a day gone by when he hadnt thought of her and wanted her jane had shadowed his life by refusing to get out of it bev had ruined it by refusing to share it so he had his music and more money than he had ever dreamed of and he had a succession of women who meant absolutely nothing to him now jane was dead he wished that he could stir his heart feel some regret for the girl he had known once the desperate eager girl who had claimed to love him above all else but there was nothing to feel the girl and the boy he had been had been dead a long time so he would call emma it was best that she hear it from him though he doubted she would feel any true griel when he had called her and made certain she didnt need him he would go to ireland to darren and spend some quiet days sitting in the tall green grass are you sure youre going to be all right yes emma gave mariannes hand a squeeze as they walked toward the gate at lax im going to be fine im just going to take a few more days to well let myself settle you know id stay i know this time the squeeze of a hand wasnt enough emma turned and hugged her i wouldnt have been able to go through with this on my own yes you would have youre stronger than you think didnt you cancel the credit cards close the bank accounts and have the accountant play hide the money your ideas thats only because you werent thinking of practical matters i wasnt going to see that bastard get a penny i still think you should talk to the police emma only shook her head she was just beginning to believe she might get her pride back involving the police the press the public would only heap humiliation on top of humiliation all right not yet marianne said though she had no intention of seeing drew waltz away unscathed youre sure the accountant will keep his mouth shut about where you are yes hes my accountant after all when i told him i was getting divorced he went into action it was almost funny if such things could be funny i suppose after dealing with boring trusts and such all these years he was excited by a fat complicated divorce divorce she thought it was such a huge word such a final one marianne kept silent a moment while they walked hes going to find out where you are sooner or later i know instantly nerves replaced regret i just want it to be later when im sure nothing he can say or do will make me go back with him see the lawyer marianne urged get it started as soon as your plane takes off marianne shuffled restlessly then popped a lifesaver in her mouth it was getting so there was no place you could smoke in an airport listen emma its only been a couple weeks sincesince we came out here are you sure you dont want me to stay a few more days i want you to get back to your painting i mean it she added before her friend could object when a kennedy commissions your work your reputations made go finish the painting before caroline changes her mind youll call me marianne heard the announcement for her right every day i will she clung for one last minute when this is behind me im going to want my half of the loft back its yours unless i decide to marry that dentist and move to long island what dentist the one who wants me to have my roots planed her lips curved it was becoming almost easy to smile thats certainly a novel and disgusting approach it was good marianne thought to see emma really smile again yeah maybe but hes got these big brown eyes hairy knuckles though i dont know if i could fall in love with hairy knuckles especially since hed always be sticking them in your mouth thats your last boarding call you call me absolutely she wasnt going to cry emma promised herself she wasnt going to but they both were with one final hug marianne raced off emma waited by the gate watching through the windows as the plane taxied back she was alone now on her own decisions mistakes opinions were hers to make again and it terrified her it wasnt so long ago she thought she had been on her own in london that had been such an exciting such a freeing feeling and shed been in love she wasnt in love now that was one small blessing as she started back toward the terminal she scanned the crowd watchful jittery moments before she felt anonymous in the noise and hurry of the airport now now that she was alone she only felt vulnerable she couldnt shake the feeling that drew might be hidden somewhere in the crowdthere behind the family on their way to phoenix or there among the businessmen waiting to board for chicago she kept her head lowered nerves jumping as she passed a gift shop he could be in there idling by the magazine rack biding his time he would step out smiling saying her name just before he put a hand on her shoulder in that way he had fingers digging in grinding against the bone she had to force herself to keep moving forward not to run back to the gate and beg them to stop the plane so marianne could get off again emma her breath pushed out of her lungs her knees buckled as a hand dropped to her shoulder emma it is you dead white and dizzy with panic she stared up at michael he was saying something she could see his lips move but couldnt hear over the roaring in her head the pleasure died out of his face eyes narrowed he pulled her to a chair it seemed he could almost pour her into it so boneless were her limbs he waited until her rapid breathing slowed better yes yes im fine do you always faint when you run into friends at airports she managed what passed for a smile bad habit of mine you did startle me i could see that startled wasnt the word he thought the word was terrified shed looked the same way when hed dragged her to the surface of a wave over ten years before will you wait here a minute id better go let my parents know why i ran off on them when she only nodded he repeated wait yes ill wait it was an easy enough promise since she was sure her legs wouldnt support her yet alone she took long and careful breaths she was already embarrassed enough and didnt want to be a gibbering idiot when he returned he was gone only moments but she was confident she was in control again so where are you going she asked me nowhere my mothers got some kind of convention and dads tagging along i dropped them off because he doesnt like to leave his car at the airport did you just get into town no ive been here about two weeks i was just seeing off a friend here on business no well yes and no a flight had just deplaned streams of people marched by she had to fight down fresh panic as she scanned for drew ive really got to go ill walk with you he didnt offer his hand because he sensed her shying away from being touched so youre here with your husband no her eyes shifted from side to side ever watchful hes in new york weve she had to get used to saying it to meaning it weve separated oh he didnt grin at least not on the outside im sorry but he remembered her reaction when hed come up behind her in the airport amicably i hope so she shuddered lord they keep it cold in here he opened his mouth to question it wasnt his place to pry he reminded himself not into her marriage or the ending of it how long do you plan to be in town im really not sure how about some lunch or a drink i cant i have an appointment in an hour have dinner with me then her lips curved a little she would have liked to have had dinner with a friend im trying to keep a low profile while im here i havent been going to restaurants how about a backyard barbecue at my place well i look heres my address because he didnt want to give her time to say no he took out a card and scribbled on the back you can come by around seven and well throw a couple of steaks on very low profile she hadnt realized how much shed been dreading sitting in her room picking at a room service meal flipping channels on the television for company all right he started to offer her a lift but caught sight of a big white limo at the curb seven oclock he repeated she sent him a last smile before they went their separate ways michael wondered if he could find a cleaning service at two oclock on a friday afternoon emma walked past the limo and took her place on line for cabs idly she turned the card over detective m kesselring homicide with a shiver she slipped it into her bag odd shed forgotten he was a cop like his father michael stuffed two weeks worth of newspapers in the bedroom closet his two twentygallon trash cans were already bulging it was hard for him to believe that one man and one dog could accumulate so much garbage and he was appalled that in a city like los angeles there wasnt a single cleaning service to he had on a friday afternoon he tackled the kitchen first with the bottle of tlipjob hed borrowed from a neighbor the house smelled like a pine forest but it couldnt be helped then michael lured conroy into the bathroom with a slice of bologna when he stepped naked into the tub and dangled it the dog hesitated they both knew bologna was a weakness the moment the dog leaped into the tub michael slid the glass doors closed grin and bear it pal michael suggested as conroy bristled with indignation it took a half bottle of shampoo but conroy bore up like a soldier he did howl occasionally but that could have been in response to michaels singing when they were both wrapped in towels michael searched through the linen closet for his hair dryer he found it and a frying pan hed given up for lost he dried conroy first though the dog had yet to forgive him you ought to thank me for this michael told him one whiff of you and slut dogs going to crumble like an oatmeal cookie she wont even look at that stuckup german shepherd it took michael thirty minutes to mop up the flood of water and dog hair he was about to try his hand at salad making when he heard a car pull up he hadnt expected her to take a cab hed imagined her arriving in a limo or some spiffy rental car as he watchedshe passed bills to the driver there was a breeze to ruffle her hair and the boxy cotton shirt she wore its size and mannish style made her appear smaller and only more feminine he watched her draw a hand through her hair brush it out of her face as she looked toward the house shed lost weight hed noticed that at the airport too much weight michael thought now shed gone from looking slender to almost unbearably fragile there was a hesitation in her hed never noticed before in the way she walked in the nervous glances she sent over her shoulder hed been a cop long enough to have seen that same kind of controlled panic many times in suspects and in victims because she looked as though she might bolt he opened the door so you found it she stopped dead then shielding her eyes from the sun saw him in the doorway yes her stomach muscles slowly unknotted youve bought a house she said and felt foolish immediately its a pretty neighborhood before she could step inside conroy raced to the door he intended to bolt to roll around in the dirt and grass until hed rid himself of the undignified and all too human scent of shampoo hold it michael snapped that wouldnt have stopped him but emmas soft purr did oh you have a dog she crouched to rub his head youre a nice dog arent you since conroy was disposed to agree he sat down and let her scratch his ears yes such a nice dog such a pretty dog no one had ever accused him of being pretty conroy mooned at her with the one eye that showed beneath his hair then turned his head to sneer at michael now youve done it michael took her hand to help her to her feet hell expect to be complimented on a regular basis now i always wanted a dog conroy leaned against her slacks the picture of devotion ill give you fifty bucks to take this one when she laughed michael drew her inside this is nice she turned around the room comforted by the sound of the dogs nails on the floor behind her a big gray chair looked cushy enough to sleep in the couch was long and low inviting afternoon naps hed tossed an indian blanket in gray and red stripes on the floor as a throw rugand as a sop to conroy vertical blinds let in slashes of sunlight id imagined you in one of those slick condos near the beach oh mariannes legs delighted she walked over to the print hed hung over the couch i picked that up the night of your show emma glanced over her shoulder one brow lifted why why did i buy it thoughtful michael tucked his thumbs in his pockets i liked it if you want me to start talking shadows and texture forget it the fact is its a great pair of legs shot with a great deal of wit i like your opinion a lot more than a discussion on texture she turned back smiling it had taken them hours to set this shot not that it had been so difficult really they just hadnt been able to agree on the shoes it showed mariannes legs crossed elegantly at the knee with a ladylike flounce of hem sliding across them theyd finally decided on plain black chucks for her feet you didnt have to buy this i know the outrageous price runyun set i owed you at least a print you gave me one once already she remembered the picture shed taken of him with her father but i wasnt a professional then i imagine an early mcavoy would be worth a tidy sum if i ever wanted to sell it he felt her quick instinctive jerk when he touched her arm gunshy he thought automatically it was natural enough for a woman to be gunshy right after the breakup of a marriage lets go into the kitchen i was just getting started on dinner the dog followed them in resting his head adoringly on emmas foot when she sat at the table michael poured wine in glasses hed borrowed from his neighbor he turned on the radio low emma recognized nat king coles creamy voice as she idly scratched conroys head with her other foot how long have you lived here nearly four years he was glad to have company in the kitchen a rarity for him unless he counted conroy he had fresh vegetables lined up on the counter puzzling over them michael wished hed asked his neighbor for a recipe for tossed salad he remembered to wash the lettuce then taking up the neighbors carving knife prepared to chop it up what are you doing emma asked making salad because of the way she was looking at him he paused with the knife over the head of romaine maybe you dont like salad id rather eat a hotfudge sundae but i like it well enough she rose to inspect the vegetables she counted four fat tomatoes slightly underripe a halfdozen peppers of every color and description leeks mushrooms a gourd of some kind a full head of cauliflower and a bunch of carrots theres certainly enough of everything she decided i always make a lot he improvised conroys a fiend for salad i see emma smiled then took the knife from him and set it aside why dont you let me do this while you deal with the steaks you cook yes laughing she began to tear the lettuce leaves do you no she smelled like wildflowers fresh and delicate he had to fight back an urge to press his lips to her throat when he smoothed her hair behind her back she lifted her head eyes wary i never imagined you cooking i like to he was standing close but not so close that she felt afraid as she scrubbed a green pepper she realized she wasnt afraid around him uneasy perhaps but not afraid youre good at this i took top honors in vegetable chopping five years running she brushed him away go start the grill later she carried the salad out to a round wooden table beside a pathetic bed of petunias a critical glance told her he was handling the steaks well enough so she went back in emma wasnt sure what to make of the giant package of paper plates in the cupboard a further search unearthed a trio of empty beer bottles a drawer full of ketchup and mustard packets and a mother lode of chef boyardee pasta meals in a can she checked the dishwasher discovered that was where he stored his laundry and wondered if he had a clothes hamper somewhere full of dishes and flatware she found them in the microwavetwo pretty china plates with baby roses painted around the edges matching bowls and a pair of steak knives and forks by the time hed grilled the steaks she had the table set as best she could i couldnt find any salad dressing she told him salad dressing right he set the steaks down now that she was here looking so right so simply right smiling at him with one hand resting on the dogs head he thought it was foolish to try to pretend he knew what he was doing with the meal if they were to get to know each other really get to know each other this time around she might as well see what she was getting into from the first make sure conroy doesnt get any idea about these he said then walked to the chainlink fence and swung over he was back in a few moments with a bottle of wishbone and a fat blue candle mrs petrowski says hello with a laugh emma glanced over and saw a woman leaning out of the back door of the house next door because it seemed natural she waved before she turned back to michael her dishes yeah theyre very nice i wanted to do better than a burger on the beach this time around cautious she passed him the salad im glad you asked me to come we didnt have much of a chance to talk when you came to new york im sorry i didnt have a chance to show you around next time he said and cut into his steak they lingered over the meal until twilight shed forgotten what it was like to talk about unimportant things to laugh over dinner with music in the background and a candle flickering the dog sated with half of emmas steak snored by her feet nerves strung tight for months smoothed out he could see the change it was a gradual almost a musclebymuscle relaxation she never spoke of her marriage or the separation he found it odd he had friends both male and female who had gone through divorces during the process and long afterward it had been their favorite topic of conversation when rosemary clooneys seductive voice drifted from the radio he rose and pulled emma to her feet the old ones are the best to dance to he said when she took a step in retreat i really dont and itd give mrs petrowski such a thrill gently he drew her closer forcing himself to keep the embrace friendly and undemanding emma moved with him automatically as clooney crooned out tenderly closing her eyes she concentrated on staying relaxed on ignoring the emotions that were creeping into her she didnt want to feel anything unless it was peace there was only a flutter of a breeze now as they danced across the grass the shadows were long when she opened her eyes on a long careful breath she could see the sky in the west glowing in sunset when i was waiting for you to come i figured out that weve known each other about eighteen years he brushed a finger over the back of her hand she didnt jerk away this time but there was a moment of stillness eighteen years he repeated even though i can count the days ive spent with you on one hand you didnt pay any attention to me the first time we met she forgot to be nervous when she smiled up at him you were too busy being dazzled by devastation elevenyearold boys cant notice girls those particular optic nerves dont develop until the age of thirteen twelve in some precocious cases chuckling she didnt object when he brought her a few inches closer i read that somewhere its fully developed when the young male anticipates the arrival of sports illustrateds swimsuit issue as much as he anticipates the football preview when michael grinned she lifted a brow it was your loss i had quite a crush on you did you he skimmed his fingers up her back to toy with the ends of her hair absolutely your father had told me about how youd rollerskated off the root i wanted to ask you how it felt before or after i regained consciousness in flight i guess i was up for about three seconds it was the best three seconds of my life it was exactly what shed hoped hed say do your parents still live in that same house yeah you couldnt get them out with a howitzer ts nice she mused th have a place like that a place thats always home i felt that way about the loft is that where youre going to live when you go back i dont know the haunted look came back into her eyes and lingered i may not go back he thought she must have loved her husband very much to be so hurt the marriage was over there are some nice places along the beach i remember you like the water yes i do he wanted to see her smile again do you still want to learn how to surf she did smile but it was wistful i havent thought about it in years i have sunday off ill give you a lesson she glanced up there was a challenge in his eyes just enough of one to hook her all right he brushed a kiss at her temple in a gesture so easy she was hardly aware of it you know emma when i told you i was sorry about you and your husband he brought her hand to his lips i lied she retreated instantly turning she began to gather the dishes ill help you wash up he stepped back to the table putting a hand over both of hers it doesnt come as that much of a surprise does it she made herself look at him the light was pearly with dusk behind him the eastern sky was deep deep blue his eyes were on hers very direct a little impatient no she turned and took the dishes inside though it cost him he didnt press she was vulnerable he reminded himself a person was bound to be just after the breakup of a marriage so hed give her time as much as he could stand she didnt relax again couldnt what kind of a woman was she to be drawn to one man so soon after shed left another she didnt want to think about it her mind was made up she would never become involved again she would never allow herself to be trapped by love by marriage now she only wanted to go back to her hotel to lock the doors and feel safe for a few hours its getting late i really should get back can i call a cab ill take you back you dont have to i can emma i said id take you stop it stop it she ordered herself and pulled her nervous fingers apart thanks relax if youre not ready for the incredibly romantic affair were going to have i can wait its only been eighteen years so far she wasnt sure whether to be amused or annoyed an affair takes two people she said lightly im afraid ive sworn off like i said i can wait he scooped up his keys at the jingle of them conroy leaped into the air barking he likes to ride in the car michael explained shut up conroy knowing a true ally the dog shuffled over to emma head low can he come she asked as he rested his head against her thigh ive got an mg i dont mind being crowded hell shed all over you its all right conroy followed the conversation one ear pricked michael would have sworn the dog snickered you win conroy michael pointed toward the front door sensing victory conroy bolted his waving tail struck emmas purse and knocked it from table to floor when michael bent to retrieve it the clasp gave and the contents spilled out before he could apologize he saw the emma said nothing as he lifted it turning it over in his hand it was top grade the best automatic of that caliber that smith and wesson had to offer it was glossy as silk and heavy in his hand no elegant ladies gun this one was mean and for business only he pulled out the clip found it full then snapped it back into place what are you doing with this i have a license that wasnt my question she crouched down to pick up her wallet and compact and brush i live in new york remember she said it lightly while her stomach churned as it always did when she lied a lot of women carry guns in manhattan for protection he studied the top of her head so youve had it awhile years thats interesting seeing as this model came out about six months ago from the looks of it this gun hasnt been knocking around in your purse more than a couple of days when she stood her whole body was shaking if youre going to interrogate me shouldnt you read me my rights cut the crap emma you didnt buy this to scare off a mugger she could feel the skitter of panic up her back it made her throat dry and her stomach roil he was angry really angry she could see it in the way his eyes darkened in the way he moved when he stepped toward her its my business if youre going to take me to the hotel first i want to know why youre carrying this around why you lied to me and why you looked so damn scared at the airport this afternoon she didnt say a word but watched him just watched him with dull resigned eyes hed had a dog look at him like that once michael remembered it had crawled onto the grass at the edge of their lawn one afternoon when hed been about eight his mother had been afraid it was rabid but when theyd taken it to the vet it had turned out the dog had been beaten badly enough often enough that the vet had had to put it to sleep a sick rage worked inside of him as he stepped toward her she stumbled back what did he do to you he wanted to scream it but his voice hissed out through his teeth she only shook her head conroy stopped scratching at the door and sat quivering emma what the hell did he do to you h have to go goddamnit emma when he reached for her arm she rammed back into the wall her eyes werent dull now but glassy with terror dont please i wont touch you all right it was training that kept his voice calm and quiet he never took his eyes from hers his expression was controlled now carefully blank im not going to hurt you still watching her he slipped the gun back in her purse and set it aside you dont have to be afraid of me im not but she couldnt stop trembling youre afraid of him of latimer i dont want to talk about him i can help you emma she shook her head again no you cant i can did he threaten you when she didnt answer he eased a step closer did he hit you im divorcing him what difference does it make it makes a hell of a difference we can get a warrant no i dont want to do that i want it over michael i cant talk to you about this he said nothing for a moment he could all but feel the terror draining out of her and didnt want to frighten her again all right i know places where you can go and talk to someone else to other people who know what its like did he really believe there was anyone who knew what it was like i dont need to talk to anyone im not going to have strangers reading aboutabout all of this over their morning coffee this isnt your concern do you think that he said quietly do you really think that she felt wretchedly ashamed now in his eyes was something she needed needed badly if she only had the courage to ask for it he was only asking for her trust but she had trusted once before i know its not this is my problem and im handling it he could see that one nudge too many would cause her to shatter so he backed off all right id just like you to think about it you dont have to do this alone he took all of my selfrespect she said quietly if i dont do this alone ill never get it back please just take me to the hotel im very tired so the bitell figured she could just walk away drew thought she thought she could walk out the door and keep going he was going to fix her good when he found her and find her he would he bitterly regretted that he hadnt beat her more vigorously before shed gone to florida he shouldnt have let her out of his sight should have known he couldnt trust her the only women a man could trust were hookers they did their job took the money and that was that there was a world of difference between an honest hooker and a whore and his sweet delicatefaced wife was a whore just as his mother had been he was going to give her a beating shed never forget imagine her having the nerve to take off the tucking gall to transfer her money and cancel the credit hed been humiliated at bijan when the clerk had taken back the cashmere duster drew had decided to purchase with the cool comment that his credit card had been canceled she was going to pay for that then to have that snotty lawyer serve him with papers so she wanted a divorce hed see her dead first the new york lawyer hadnt been any help some bullshit about a professional courtesy to another firm mrs latimer didnt want her whereabouts known well he was going to find her whereabouts all right and he was going to kick ass at first hed been afraid shed gone to her father with the benefit coming up and all drews plans to go solo about to bear fruit he didnt want someone as influential as brian mcavoy coming down on him but then brian had called about emmas old lady dying drew was pleased that hed been able to cover himself so quickly hed told brian that emma was out for the evening with a couple of her girlfriends and he was certain hed had just the right tone of sympathy and concern in his voice when hed promised to tell emma the news if mcavoy didnt know where his bitch of a daughter was then drew figured none of the other band members knew either they were all as thick as bloody thieves hed thought of bev but he was nearly sure that if emma had gone to london her old man wouldve gotten wind of it or maybe they were all playing with him laughing at him behind his back if that was the case then hed pay her back with interest shed been gone for over two weeks he hoped shed had herself a high flying time because she was going to pay for every hour he hunched his shoulders against the brisk wind as he walked the leather jacket kept out the worst of the early spring chill but his ears were ringing from the wind or maybe it was fury he liked that idea better and grinned a little as he crossed the street to the loft hed taken the subway something he found degrading but safer than a cab under the circumstances he would more than likely have to do something unpleasant to marianne unpleasant for her anyway drew thought with a laugh it wowd be a great pleasure for him emma had lied to him marianne had been at the funeral hed seen the pictures of them together in the paper as sure as god made hell marianne had been in on the whole thing shed know where emma was hiding and when he got through with her shed be damn delighted to tell him he used the key hed gotten from emma months before inside he punched in the security code to unlock the elevator as the doors closed him in he rubbed the knuckles of one hand against the other he hoped she was still in bed the loft was silent he moved quietly across the floor and up the stairs with his heart pounding happily there was disappointment when he saw the empty bed the sheets were tangled but cool the disappointment was so great he compensated by trashing the loft it took him nearly an hour to vent his frustration ripping clothes breaking glassware hacking cushion after cushion in the sectional with a knife hed taken from the kitchen he thought of the paintings stacked up in the studio knife in hand he started up when the phone rang he stopped jumping at the sound he was breathing hard sweat rolling into his eyes there was a trickle of blood from his lip where hed gnawed through while slashing the sofa on the fourth ring the machine picked up marianne drew bolted down the steps at the sound of emmas voice hed nearly yanked up the receiver before he caught himself youre probably still in bed or up to your elbows in paint so call me later try to make it this morning im going to the beach later to practice my surfing i can stay up for more than ten seconds dont be jealous but its going to hit ninety in la today call soon la drew thought turning he stared at the mural of emma on the plaster wall when marunne phoned an hour later emma was on her way out the door she closed it locked it again before she answered hi there mariannes voice was drowsy and content hi yourself you just getting up it must be nearly noon in new york im not up yet she snuggled back against the pillows im in bed the dentists bed having a tooth capped lets just say that hes got talents that extend beyond dental hygiene i called my machine for messages and got yours so how are you im doing okay really glad to hear it is michael going to the beach with you no hes working marianne wrinkled her nose if she couldnt be around to look after emma she counted on the cop to do so she could hear the shower in the next room and wished lazily that her new lover would come back to bed instead of heading off to fight plaque tooth decay or bad guys i guess a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do look im thinking of coming out in a couple of weeks to check up on me right and to finally meet this michael yjuve been keeping to yourself all these years have a good time hanging ten emma ill call you tomorrow michml liked being our in the field he didnt have any real gripe with paperwork or the hours it sometimes took talking on the phone going on doortodoors but he liked the action on the streets hed had to ignore a good deal of ribbing in the early years the captains son some of it had been goodnatured some of it hadnt but hed weathered it hed worked hard for his gold shield in the station now he stole a doughnut from a nearby desk eating it standing up while paging through the paper an associate had left next to the coffee maker he went straight for the comics after a night like hed put in he needed all the laughs he could get from there he went looking for sports turning the page with one hand and pouring coffee with the other jane palmer dies of overdose jane palmer fortysix exlover of devastations brian mcavoy and mother of his daughter emma was found dead in her london home apparently a victim of a drug overdose the body was discovered by stanley hitchman late sunday afternoon michael read through the rest of the article it contained only the bare facts but suicide was hinted at swearing he tossed the paper aside he grabbed a jacket and signaled mccarthy i need an hour theres something i have to take care of mccarthy put a hand over the phone receiver he held at his ear we got three punks in holding yeah and theyll hold an hour he repeated and strode out he found her at the beach it had only been a few days since she had come back into his life but he knew her habits she came there every day to the same spot not to surf that was just an excuse she came to sit in the sun and watch the water or to read in the shade of a little blue and white cabana most of all she came to heal always she set herself apart from the others who sunned or walked along the beach she wasnt seeking company but was comforted by the fact that she wasnt alone she wore a simple blue tank suit no flighty bikini or spandex onepiece cut provocatively at the thigh its very modesty drew eyes toward her more than one man had considered an approach but one look from her had them passing by to michael it was as if she had a glass wall surrounding her thin icecold and impenetrable he wondered if within it she could smell the coconut oil or hear the jangle from the portable radios he went to her her trust in him allowed him to get closer than most but shed built a second line of defense that held even friends at their distance emma he hated to see her jolt that quick involuntary movement of panic she dropped the book shed been reading behind her sunglasses fear darted into her eyes then subsided her lips curved her body relaxed he saw it all the change from serenity to panic to calm again in a matter of seconds it made him think that she was becoming much too used to living in fear michael i didnt expect to see you today are you playing hooky no ive only got a few minutes he sat beside her in the partial shade the breeze off the water fluttered his jacket so that she caught a glimpse of his shoulder holster it was always a shock to remember what he did for a living he never looked like her image of a detective even now when she could see the weapon snug against his usc tshirt she couldnt quite believe he would ever uwe it you look tired michael rough night she smiled a little he could see that she thought he was speaking of a heavy date there was no use telling her hed spent most of it dealing with four young bodies emma have you read the paper today no she had deliberately avoided newspaper and television the troubles of the world like the people in it were on the other side of her glass wall but she knew he was going to tell her something she didnt want to hear what is it when he took her hand the anxiety quickened is it dad no he cursed himself for not coming straight out with it her hand had turned to ice in his its jane palmer shes dead emma she stared at him as though he were speaking in a language she had to translate dead how it looks like she overdosed i see she withdrew her hand from his then stared out to sea the water was pale green near the shore deepening and changing as it stretched toward the horizon there it gleamed a deep gemlike blue she wondered what it would be like to be that far from everything to float completely alone am i supposed to feel anything she murmured he knew she wasnt asking him so much as herself still he answered you cant feel what isnt there no you cant i never loved her not even as a child i used to be ashamed of that im sorry shed dead but its a vague impersonal kind of sorrow the kind you feel when you read in the paper that someones died in a car wreck or a fire then thats enough he took her braid a habit hed developed and ran his hand up and down it listen ive got to get back but i should have things wrapped by around seven why dont we take a drive up the coast you and me and conroy id like that when he stood she reached out a hand for his the contact was fleeting then she turned and looked back out to sea drew arrived at the beverly wilshire just after three it was the first hotel he checked it both pleased and disgusted him that emma was so predictable it was the connaught in london the ritz in paris little dix bay in the virgin islands and always the wilshire in la he strolled in an easy personable smile on his face he knew his luck was in when the desk clerk was young female and attractive hi he flashed the smile at her and watched her polite expression turn to recognition then delight good afternoon mr latimer he put a hand over hers and lifted the other to place a finger to his lips lets keep that between us shall we im joining my wife here but im afraid ive been careless and forgotten what room shes taken mrs latimers staying with us the clerk lifted a brow yes i had some business to take care of before i joined her youll find her for me wont you of course her fingers skipped over the keyboard i have no latimer registered no perhaps she checked in under mcavoy he held back his impatience while the computer clicked im sorry mr latimer we have no mcavoys he wanted to grab the clerk by her slender throat and squeeze with an effort he fixed a puzzled frown on his face thats odd im almost sure i havent mixed the hotels emma wouldnt stay anywhere but the wilshire his mind jumped from possibility to possibility then he smiled ah of course i dont know how i could be so addlebrained she stayed here with a friend for a bit probably kept the room in her name you know how it is when youre trying to slip away for a few days thy marianne carter its more than likely on the third floor emmas twitchy about heights yes here it is suite thats a relief behind his smile his teeth ground together id hate to think id lose my wife he waited for the key struggling to keep his breathing calm and steady youve been a big help luy my pleasure mr latimer oh no he thought as he headed for the elevators it was going to be his pleasure his great pleasure he wasnt disappointed that the suite was empty in fact he decided it was that much better from his bag he took a small tape recorder and a belt of rich supple leather he drew the drapes snug at the windows then lighting a cigarette settled down to wait kesselring a young detective opened the door of the interrogation room where michael and mccarthy were working in tandem to wear down a suspect you got a call im a little busy here drummond take a message tried she says its an emergency he started to swear then thought it might be emma try not to miss me he said to swan as he started out he sat on the edge of his desk and picked up the phone kesselring michael this is marianne carter im a friend of emmas sure annoyed by the interruption he shoved a hand in his pocket for a cigarette you in town no no im in new york i just got into the loft isomebody somebody wrecked it he pressed his fingers to his tired eyes i think you might be smarter to call the local police i cant get there for a few hours she wasnt in the mood for sarcasm i dont give a damn about the loft its emma im worried about what does she have to do with it this place has been torn apart everythings slashed cut up broken it was drew im sure it was drew he probably has emmas key i dont know how much shes told you but hes violent really violent and i okay calm down the first thing you do is get out go to a neighbors or a public place and call the police hes not here she hated herself for being so scattered she was unable to make herself clear i think he knows where she is michael she left a message on the machine this morning if he was here when she called or he played it back then he knows i tried to call her but she didnt answer ill take care of it get out of the loft and call the cops he hung up before she could respond kesseiring if youve finished talking to your sweetheart lets move michael interrupted his partners complaint and started for the door at a run what the move michael repeated he was already peeling out when mecarthy jumped in the car when emma walked into the lobby of the beverly wilshire it was nearly four during her long afternoon on the beach shed made one decision she was going to call her father he would have heard about janes death and emma had no doubt he would have tried to contact her it wouldnt be an easy conversation but a necessary one it was time she told him that she had left drew perhaps it was also time to take advantage of the press that was always so eager for gossip once the separation was made public she might break out of her perpetual daze maybe shed stop being afraid as she walked down the hall toward her room she dug in her bag for her key her fingers brushed the warm metal of the gun she was going to stop carrying it she told herself she was going to stop looking over her shoulder she opened the door of the suite and frowned the drapes shut out all but the faintest light she hated the dark and silently cursed the maid pushing herself forward she let the door close behind her as she went toward the lamp then the music started her fingers froze on the switch that eerie unmistakable intro that haunted her dreams the murdered lennon began to sing in a crisp staccato across the room the light flashed on she could only whimper and stumble back for a moment a face floated into her mind blurred but almost almost recognizable then she saw drew hello emmy luy have you missed me she broke out of her trance and raced for the door he was quick hed always been quick one sweep of his hand knocked her aside and sent her bag flying still smiling he turned the security lock and fixed the chain we want our privacy dont we his voice pleasant quietly loving sent ice skidding up and down her back how did you find me oh we have our ways emma lets say theres a bond between you and me didnt i tell you id always find you behind her the music kept playing it was a nightmare she wanted to believe it she had them often the music the dark she would wake up sweating cold as she was sweating now and it would be over guess what i received emma a petition for divorce now that wasnt very nice was it here ive been worried sick about you for two weeks why you might have been kidnapped he grinned you might have been murdered like your poor little brother dont ah it upsets you to talk about him doesnt it the music upsets you too shall i turn it off yes shed be able to think if he turned the music off shed know what to do all right then he took a step toward the recorder then stopped no i think well leave it on you have to learn to face things emma ive told you that before havent i her teeth had begun to chatter i am facing them good thats good now the first thing youre going to do is call that fancy lawyer of yours and tell him youve changed your mind no fear was storming through her system so that she could only whisper im not going back with you of course you are you belong with me youve had your little snit emma dont make it harder on yourself when she shook her head he let out a long gusty sigh then his hand snaked out quick as a whip and smashed across her face blood filled her mouth as she slammed into a table sending a lamp crashing to the floor through a haze of pain she saw him coming toward her and she began to scream he kicked her full in the stomach cutting off the screams and her air when she tried to curl up he began to hit her slowly methodically this time she fought back her first blow glanced off his chin but surprised him enough to give her time to crawl away she heard pounding on the door a demand to open it she managed to struggle to her feet and take a watery step toward the sound when he caught her again so you want to play rough emma he began to tear at her clothes raking his nails down her skin her struggles only drove him on she would be punished this time in a way she would never forget emma heard someone pleading begging promising she wasnt aware it was her own voice she hardly felt the blows as he continued to beat her this time he used his fists forgetting everything but the need to pay her back did you think you could walk out on me bitch did you think id let you ruin everything i worked for ill kill you first her body was a jelly of pain even the effort to breathe cut through her like dozens of dulledged knives it had never been this bad before even at its worst it had never been this bad groggy she grabbed a chair leg and tried to haul herself up wet with her own blood her fingers slipped off she stopped fighting there was no strength left to hold him off she felt him lift her then send her flying something snapped in her chest and she screamed again against the sickening pain half conscious she lay sprawled bitch whore bitch he was panting as he started for her again dimly she saw that blood was running from his nose his eyes were glazed and wild she knew looking at his face that he had crossed some line this time a beating wouldnt be enough he would pound on her until she was dead weeping she tried to crawl the snap of his belt made her flinch her sobs rose up into walls as she pulled herself across the rug he continued to snap the belt snap it to the beat of the music as he stalked her she collapsed the jolt screamed through her ribs until her vision wavered she heard someone calling for her shouting her name splintering wood was that the sound of splintering wood or was her body just breaking in two the first slash of the belt across her back had her arm flinging out her fingers brushed metal blindly she closed her hand around the gun choking on sobs she pushed herself over she saw his face as he raised the belt again she felt the gun jerk up in her hand michael broke in the door in time to see drew stagger back a look of puzzlement on his face weaving he lifted the belt again michaels weapon was drawn but before he could use it emma fired again and again she continued to press the trigger long after it clicked uselessly long after he was sprawled at her feet she held the trigger down aiming at empty air good jesus mccarthy said keep those people out michael moved toward her peeling off his jacket he wrapped it around her her clothes were torn to bits and soaked with blood she didnt move only continued to fire the empty gun when he tried to take it he found her hand convulsed on it emma baby its all right now its over now gently he brushed at her hair he had to fight to keep his rage buried her face was a mass of blood one eye was already swollen shut the other was glassy with shock give me the gun now baby you dont need it anymore youre okay he shifted so that she could see his face taking a scrap of what had been her blouse he dabbed at the blood its michael can you bear me emma its michael its going to be okay her breath began to hitch violently shudders wracked her he gathered her close rocking while her body shook her hand was limp when he slipped the gun from it she didnt cry michael knew the sound she made as he held her couldnt be called grieving she moaned low animal moans that died into whimpering ambulance is on its way after a cursory check of drews body mccarthy crouched beside michael messed her up pretty good didnt he michael continued to rock her but he turned his head and studied drew latimer for a long time too bad you can only die once yeah mccarthy shook his head as he rose the sonofabitch is still holding the belt brim watched the clouds race across the sky as he sat beside darrens grave each time he came to sit in the high sweet grass he hoped he would find peace he never had but he always came back hed let the wildflowers grow where his son was buried he preferred them to the small marble marker that carried only a name and two dates the years were pitifully close his parents were buried nearby though he had known them for decades he remembered his son with more clarity from the cemetery he could see plowed fields spaces of rich brown cutting through the rich green and the spotted cows grazing it was early in the day mornings in ireland were the best for sitting dreaming the light was soft and pearly as hed never seen it anywhere but ireland dew was glittering on the grass the only sounds he could hear were the bark of a dog and the distant hum of a tractor when bev saw him she stopped she hadnt known he would be there through the years shed been careful to come only when she knew brian was elsewhere she hadnt wanted to see him there beside the grave where they had both stood so many years before she nearly turned away but there was something in the way he sat his hands resting lightly on his knees his eyes looking out over the green hills he looked too much alone they were both too much alone she walked quietly he never heard her but when her shadow fell over him he turned his head she said nothing but laid the spray of lilacs she carried beneath the marble marker on a sigh she knelt in silence they listened to the wind in the high grass and the distant purr of the tractor do you want me to leave he asked her no gently she brushed a hand over the soft grass that covered their son he was beautiful wasnt he yes he felt the tears well up and fought them back it had been a long time since hed wept here he looked so much like you he had the best of each of us her voice quiet she sat back on her heels like brian she looked toward the hills they had changed so little in all these years life continued that was the hardest lesson she had learned he was so bright so frill of life he had your smile bri yours and emmas he was always happy whenever i think of him i remember that my biggest fear was that i would forget somehow that his face and his memory would fade with time but it hasnt i remember how he laughed how it would just roll out of him ive never heard a prettier sound i loved him too much bri you cant love too much yes you can she fell silent for a time a cow began to low oddly the sound made her smile do you think its just lost that everything he was and might have been just vanished just went away when he died no he looked at her then no i dont his answer made all the difference i did at first perhaps thats why i lost myself for so long it hurt so much to think that all that beauty and joy had been here for such a short time but then i knew that wasnt true hes still alive in my heart and in yours he looked away toward the distant shadowed hills there are times i want to forget times i do whatever i can to forget its the worst kind of hell to outlive your own child when you do you know nothing that happens to you will ever be as painful we had him for two years bri thats what i like to remember you were a wonderful father she reached out for him took his hands when his fingers tightened on hers she held on im sorry i wouldnt share that pain with you the way i shared the joy i was selfish with it as if holding it to myself would make it only mine but its ours the way he was ours he said nothing tears were clogging his throat understanding she turned to him holding each other they sat in silence as the sun rose higher and dried the dew on the tall grass i should never have left you he murmured we left each other why he tightened his grip why ive thought about it so many times i think we couldnt bear to be happy that we felt or i did that if we could be happy after he was gone it would be like dishonoring him it was wrong bev he turned his face into her hair dont go please dont go no she said quietly i wont they walked hands linked back to the farmhouse the sun shone bright through the windows as they went upstairs they undressed each other stopping only for long quiet kisses gentle caresses he wasnt the young man who had once loved her nor was she the same woman they were more patient now they didnt tumble onto the bed but lowered slowly knowing each moment was precious when so many had been lost and yet though they had changed their bodies moved easily together when she reached for him the years seemed to vanish with his mouth pressed against her throat he drew in the familiar scent the familiar taste even as passion built they glided along its edges unwilling to be ruled by it as they once had been her lips curved as she ran a hand through his hair as her body heated she sighed as much in contentment as desire with her eyes half closed she let her hands run over him remembering every angle every plane of his body passion released flowed into them like a fine wine she welcomed him opening and arching when they joined she wept bringing his mouth to her she tasted his tears mixed with her own later they lay quiet her head tucked in the curve of his shoulder she wondered that it should be so easy and feel so right it had been nearly twenty years half of her life had been spent apart from him yet they were here bodies damp from loving she could feel his heart thud under the palm of her hand its so much like it used to be he said echoing her thoughts and yet its so different i didnt want this to happen aji this time ive worked so hard to stay away from you she lifted her head looked in his eyes i never wanted to love this much again its only ever been right with you dont ask me to let you go again i wouldnt make it this time she brushed his hair with its first few sprinkles of gray away from his brow i was always afraid that you didnt really need me certainly not the way i needed you you were wrong yes i know i was she lowered her head to kiss him weve wasted a lot of time bri id like you to come home they stayed the night there in the old bed talking making love it was late when the phone rang brian answered it only because there was no other way to end the interruption hello brian mcavoy yes speaking this is michael kesselring ive been trying to track you down kesselring he regretted saying the name the moment bev stiffened beside him what is it its emma emma he sat up quickly mouth dry as dust bevs hand was on his shoulder squeezing has something happened to her michael knew from experience it was best to say it all quickly but he had a difficult time forming the words shes in the hospital here in la shes an accident has she had an accident no she was beaten pretty badly ill explain when you get here beaten emmas been beaten i dont understand the doctors are working on her they tell me shes going to be okay but shes going to need you well be there as soon as we can bev was already up and pulling on her clothes what happened i dont know shes in the hospital in la he swore fumbling with the buttons of his shirt here quickly bev did them up shes going to be all right bri emmas tougher than she looks he could only nod and take a moment to hold her against him it was dark there was pain a dreamy distant pain that drifted sluggishly through her body like a warm red ocean it seemed to cover her weigh her down so that she was trapped away from air and light emma tried to rise above it to sink below it but couldnt seem to outmaneuver the dull ache she found she could accept that but not the dark not the quiet she struggled to move there was panic when she realized she didnt know if she was standing or sitting or lying down she couldnt feel her arms or legs just that nagging somehow fluid ache she tried to speak to call out to someone anyone in her mind she screamed but no one answered she knew she had been hurt all too well she could remember the way drew had looked at her hed been waiting for her he might still be there watching her waiting in the dark this time he would but maybe she was already dead she felt more than pain now she felt anger she didnt want to die moaning in frustration she strained using all her strength and will just to open her eyes they might have been sewn closed for all the control she had over them a hand brushed her hair she sensed it just the whisper of a touch that rammed screaming panic against the pain rest emma its all right now you have to rest not drew neither the voice nor the touch was drews youre safe now i promise michael she wanted to say his name grateful not to be alone in the dark to be alive then a dark red wave rolled in and covered her she drifted in and out for most of the night michael knew the doctors had said she would sleep straight through but it was fear that had her fighting off the sedatives he could feel it pumping out of her each time she surfaced he talked to her repeating the same assurances hour after hour his voice or the words seemed to calm her so he sat and watched and held her hand he wanted to do something more none of his training or his years on the force had taught him this kind of patience to sit helplessly by while the woman he loved waged her own silent battle her lovely elegant face was broken and bandaged her slim soft body bruised and battered they said she wouldnt die there would be pain physical and emotional but she would live the extent of the trauma could only be judged later and he could only wait and regret he should have pushed her michael cursed himself over and over as he listened to her deep drugged breathing if he had applied the right pressure at the right time he could have convinced her to tell him just how bad things had been for her he was a cop for gods sake he knew how to get information but he had backed away wanting to give her time and privacy christ privacy he rubbed his hands over his face hed given her privacy when shed belonged in protective custody hed given her time when he should have had the new york cops issue a warrant because he hadnt done his job because hed let his feelings get in the way she was lying in the hospital he left her only once when marianne and johnno arrived from new york michael johnno gave him a quick nod of recognition and kept a hand on mariannes shoulder what happened michael rubbed the heels of his hands over his eyes the lights in the corridor blinded him latimer looks like he got into her room at the hotel oh god marianne clutched the little stuffed dog how bad bad enough an afterimage of emma sprawled on the hotel carpet flashed into his brain he broke three of her ribs dislocated her shoulder shes got some bruised internal organs i dont know how many contusions and lacerations and her face they dont think shes going to need any extensive surgery jaw clenched johnno stared at the closed door wure is the bastard dead good we want to see her michael knew that the doctors were annoyed enough with him but hed used his badge to persuade them to let him sit in her room you two go ahead ill clear it with the nurse and wait for you in the lounge like johnno he stared at the closed door theyve got her sedated he gave them time loitering over a cup of coffee in the visitors lounge going over every movement of his day to try to see if there was one thing he could have done differently it was always timing he thought wearily if he had broken in the door five minutes earlier it might have changed everything he stood again when he saw them come in mariannes eyes were red but he didnt think she would fall apart she took the chair michael vacated i shouldnt have left her here by herseil its not your fault johnno told her no its not my fault but i shouldnt have left her alone ignoring the signs johnno pulled out a cigarette once it was lighted he handed it to marianne marianne filled me in on whats been going on during the flight over i assume youre aware that latimers been abusing emma for more than a year michael crushed the empty styrofoam cup with his fingers i dont know the details ill take emmas statement as soon as shes up to it statement marianne looked up why does she have to make a statement its procedure he glanced back toward emmas door just routine but youll do it johnno put in i wouldnt want her to have to talk to a stranger ill take the statement with the ash growing long on her cigarette marianne studied him hed more than lived up to the promise in the newspaper picture of ten years before at the moment he looked tense and exhausted dark shadows under his eyes lines of strain beside them despite them she judged him as a man to be depended upon whatever emma had said to the contrary michael kesseiring looked precisely like mariannes image of a cop did you kill drew he shifted his gaze and met her eyes more than anything he could remember he wished he could have said yes no i was too late who did emma oh jesus was all johnno said look i dont like leaving her alone michael said im going in to sit with her you might want to check into a hotel get some rest well stay marianne reached up to take johnnos hand we can take turns sitting with her with a nod michael went back into emmas room she surfaced at dawn the light dim as it was relieved her there had been so many dreams so many strange dreams through the night most of them vanished midnight mirages that slipped away in the sunlight but she knew shed had the nightmare again almost she could hear the echo of music and the swish of shadows she struggled to throw off sleep annoyed at first by the heaviness in her limbs it was frustrating that she could only open one eye she lifted a hand found the bandage and remembered panic it filled her lungs like smoke almost choking her she turned her head and saw michael he was slumped in the chair beside her bed his chin on his chest one of his hands covered one of hers she had only to move her fingers to have him jerking awake hey he smiled tightening his fingers around hers and bringing them to his lips his voice was rough with fatigue good morning how she closed her eye again impatient with the thin whisper how long you just slept through the night thats all any pain she had pain and plenty of it but she shook her head it made her believe she was alive it happened didnt it all of it its over wanting the comfort almost as much as he needed to give it he kept her hand against his cheek im going to go get the nurse they wanted to know when you woke up michael did i kill him he took a moment her face was bruised and bandaged hed seen worse but not often yet her hand held steady on his shed been battered but she wasnt defeated yes for the rest of my life ill regret that you beat me to it her eye closed but she kept her hand firm around his there had to be something inside her something besides the thin rivers of pain and drugged fatigue i dont know what to feel there doesnt seem to be anything no grief no relief no regret i only feel hollowed out he knew what it was to hold a weapon in your hand to aim to fire at another human being in the line of duty in selfdefense yet no matter how urgent how vital the cause it haunted you you did the only thing you could do thats all you have to remember dont worry about the rest now he had such a lovely voice i fell in love with it i wish i knew why it had to be this way he had no comfort and no answers michael left her to the nurse and went to the lounge where marianne was drowsing against johnnos shoulder the room was done in nice pastels designed he supposed to cheer and relax the friends and family who could only sit and wait there was a color television bracketed to the wall it was chattering discreetly a table was set up with pots of water on hot plates and baskets of instant coffee packets and tea bags there were two telephones at either end of the room and a generous supply of magazines shes awake awake marianne shot up instantly how is she shes okay michael poured another cup of coffee stirring the instant powder without interest she remembers what happened and shes dealing with it the nurse is with her and theyre paging the doctor you should be able to see her pretty soon they all fell silent when emmas picture flashed on the television screen the report was brisk and brutally concise interspersed with shots of both emma and drew there was a quick standup with the desk clerk of the hotel and with two of the witnesses who had heard the disturbance and called security a middleaged man baking and flushed with excitement spoke into the mike michael remembered shoving him aside before he had broken in the door i only know there was a lot of crashing around and she was screaming begging him to stop it sounded pretty bad so i beat on the door myself i had the room next door then the cops came one of them broke in the door it was only for a second but i could see a woman sprawled on the rug bleeding she had a gun and she fired it she kept right on shooting until she ran out of bullets michael was swearing as he strode over to the phone on the screen the news switched to a live remote outside the hospital the reporter solemnfaced announced that emma mcavoy latimer was in guarded condition look michael snapped into the phone i dont give a damn you hold them off awhile i want a uniform outside her door twentyfour hours to keep out any reporters who try to get in to see her ill make a statement myself this afternoon you wont be able to stop it johnno said when michael slammed the phone down i can hold them off for a while johnno rose there was no use telling michael that emma knew the price of celebrity shed been paying it all of her life marianne you go see emma im going to buy this copper some breakfast i dont want sure you do johnno cut michael off it isnt every day you get to share scrambled eggs with a legend go on marianne tell emma ill be in soon he waited until marianne had started down the hall the first time i saw emma she was about three she was hiding under the kitchen sink in janes filthy flat shed been kicked around quite a bit already she pulled out of it shell pull out of it this time as well i should have gotten a warrant michael said i should have pushed her and gotten a warrant how long have you been in love with her he didnt speak then let out a long breath most of my life he walked to the window jerking it up to let the air hit his face with his palms braced on the sill he leaned out five minutes if hed been five minutes later or id been five minutes faster id have killed him i had my gun in my hand when i went through the door i should have killed him for her thats the way it should have been ah the male ego johnno kept the same small sarcastic smile on his face when michael whirled on him i have an idea how you feel but i disagree im glad emma wasted the sonofabitch herself theres justice in that i only wish shed had the chance before he did this to her come on son johnno patted his shoulder you need food because he was too tired to argue michael went along they were nearly to the elevators when the doors opened brian and bev rushed out where is she brian demanded shes right through there hold on johnno took his arm mariannes with her you need to calm down before you go busting in there shed had enough excitement for a while johnnos right bri bev battled back her own nerves to soothe his we dont want to upset her and we need to know whathow she got hurt can you tell us what happened she asked michael weve been traveling ever since we got the call yesterday drew latimer found emma here in her hotel found her brian interrupted what do you mean werent they together shes been hiding from him while she set the divorce in motion divorce because he knew he was punchy from lack of sleep and worry brian took a long breath and tried to clear his head i talked with emma only a few weeks ago she said nothing about wanting a divorce she couldnt say anything about it michael told him because she was afraid latimers been abusing her for most of the marriage thats crazy brian dragged a hand through his hair he dotes on her ive seen it yeah the fury michael had been holding off bubbled to the surface hes been a real loving husband a tucking prince thats why shes been terrified thats why shes lying in there right now with her face smashed and her ribs broken the man damn near loved her to death brians lips trembled open his hand tightened on bevs until he rubbed bone against bone he beat her are you telling me that hes the one who put emma here thats right rage flew into him as he grabbed michael by the shirt front where is he hes dead easy bri johnno rubbed his shoulder debating the wisdom of stepping between two furious men it wont help emma if you go off i want to see her he pulled bev against him we want to see her now he walked to the door as marianne came out he didnt speak only stared for a moment at his daughter lying in the bed baby he held tight to bev as he crossed the room emma looked at them one hand fluttered to her bruised cheek then she lifted both to cover her face she hadnt wanted him to see her like this gently he drew her hand away emma he lowered his head to press a kiss to her forehead im sorry im so sorry she let the tears come then stumbling over her own apologies and explanations when she was exhausted she lay with her hand in his i dont even know how it all happened not really or why i wanted to have someone love me just me i wanted a family and i thought she let out a long sigh i thought he was like you he wanted to cry then it was almost impossible to keep his head from lowering to her breast to weep but he only brought her hand to his lips again youre not to worry about it youre not to even think about it no ones ever going to hurt you again i swear it all that matters is that youre safe now gently bev brushed the hair back from emmas bandaged forehead thats all that matters to any of us i killed him emma murmured did they tell you i killed him over his daughters head brians shocked eyes met bevs itsits over now he fumbled for emmas hand again i wouldnt listen to you didnt want to curling her fingers into his she held on i was angry and hurt because you thought he only wanted me to get to you dont he pressed his lips to her fingers you were right the words came out on a long weary sigh he never wanted me or loved me not me and when having me wasnt enough to get him what he wanted he began to hate me i dont want you to think about it now brian insisted all i want you to do is rest and concentrate on getting well he was right emma thought she was much too tired to think im glad youre here dad im so sorry for pulling away from you all this time for shutting you out we were both wrong and its done he smiled at her then weve all the time in the world now wed like you to come home when youre better bev reached across the bed to touch brians cheek with us both of you yes brian lifted a hand linked it with bevs we have a lot of time to make up for all of us when i woke up this morning i didnt think id ever have a reason to feel happy again emma said but im happy for you i need to think about the rest theres no hurry bev leaned over to kiss her cheek well let you get some sleep kesselring it was noon when mccarthy found michael in the hospital lounge jesus did you move in here coffee not if itll make me look like you he tossed michael a bag fresh clothes andshaving stuff i fed your dog thanks mccarthy changed his mind about the coffee grumbling about the packaged cream for the most part he enjoyed giving his partner grief at the moment he thought old mike had all he could handle hows she doing shes in a lot of pain dwery wants a statement mccarthy referred to the acting captain with a sneer in his voice ill take care of it he knows youre friends with the victim he wants me to get it ill take care of it michael repeated dumping sugar in the coffee for energy more than taste hed stopped tasting it hours before did you bring a stenographer yeah hes waiting ill see if emmas ready he chugged the coffee like medicine then tossed the cup away how about the press they want something by two michael checked his watch then went to change fifteen minutes later he went into her room pm was with her now like the rest of them he looked a little worse for wear shocked travel rumpled and heavy eyed but hed made emma smile pms going to be a daddy emma said congratulations thanks it was awkward standing beside the bed trying to think of the right things to say the things not to say stevie had flown over from london with him and theyd seen the paper at an airport newsstand theyd barely known what to say to each other much less what to say to emma ill be on my way he kissed her then paused and kissed her again well be back around tonight thanks for the flowers she lifted a hand to the violas on her tray theyre lovely well heartsick he stood for a moment then left them alone its uncomfortable for him emma murmured for all of them her fingers worked restlessly at the bedsheets then moved to brush at charlie its hard to see their eyes when they first walk in i suppose i look pretty bad thats the first time ive heard you fish for a compliment he sat beside her people have been going in and out of here most of the day you havent gotten much rest i dont really want to be alone you stayed with me all night she held out a hand i heard you talking to me and i knew i was still alive i wanted to thank you for that i love you emma he dropped his forehead on their joined hands there was no response from her as he fought to pull his raw emotions back in line wrong time wrong place with a sigh he rose and paced the room i guess youre going to have to think about it since i said it anyway if youre feeling up to it wed like to get your statement she watched him roam restlessly around the room there was nothing she could say not now when she could barely feel if things had been different she wondered if things had been different if she would have reached out if she could have trusted enough but things werent different who do i have to talk to you can talk to me the control was back when he turned to her or i can get a female officer if youd be more comfortable no her restless fingers began to pluck at the violas no i can talk to you theres a stenographer waiting all right we can do it now id like to get it over with it wasnt easy somehow shed thought it would be with her emotions so deadened but there were enough left just enough to bring on the shame she didnt look at him as she spoke as time dragged on she told him everything she hoped that by talking about all the fears the shames and humiliations she would be purged of them but when it was done she only felt tired michael dismissed the steno with a nod he couldnt speak didnt dare is that all you need emma asked he nodded again he needed to get out well have it typed up you can read it over when youre feeling up to it and sign it ill check back later he swung out of the room and started for the elevators mccarthy stopped him dwery wants you back at the station asap the press is foaming at the mouth fuck the press i need to walk back in london robert blackpool read the newspaper report it amused the hell out of him the fleet street stories were the best all that murderofpassion and deathofadream nonsense theyd gotten hold of a couple of pictures as well they were grainy a bit out of focus but immensely satisfying emma being wheeled into an ambulance her face was a mess and that pleased blackpool very much hed never forgotten the way shed turned on him he thought it was a pity that latimer hadnt beaten her to death but then there were other ways to pay back picking up the phone he called the london times pete was livid when he read the article the next day robert blackpool expressing deep sorrow at the death of a talented young artist like latimer related an incident that involved himself and emma from his slant she had shown vicious jealousy over his relationship with her roommate when her attempts at seduction had failed she had tried to attack him with a pair of scissors the headlines were bold thirst forlovedremma to violence it didnt take long for people to gobble up the reports opinions were now torn as to whether she had acted in selfdefense or in a jealous rage when she had shot her husband grabbing the phone pete dialed you tucking lunatic ah and good morning to you blackpool chuckled hed been expecting the call what the hell do you think youre doing spreading a story like that ive got enough of a mess to clean up its not my mess mate if you ask me little emma got just what she deserved im not asking you and im telling you to back off why should i do that i can use the publicity youre the first one to say press sells records arent you im telling you to back off or i dont care to make threats robert just take me at my word when i tell you that scrounging up nasty secrets isnt healthy for anyone there was a long humming pause i owed her this one perhaps that isnt my concern your numbers have been slipping the last couple of years robert record companies are notoriously fickle you wouldnt want to have to go digging about for a new manager at this stage would you we go back pete i doubt either of us wants to break up an old friendship remember it keep stirring things up and ill drop you like a dirty sock you need me as much as i need you oh i doubt that pete smiled into the phone i doubt that very much michael paced the corridor stabbed out his cigarette then paced again i dont like it im sorry you feel that way emma took her breathing carefully after three weeks her ribs still tended to twinge if she moved the wrong way its what i want to do and what i feel is best holding a press conference the same day youre being released from the hospital is just stupid and stubborn im better off making a formal statement than trying to dodge them she spoke lightly but her arms were icecold under her linen jacket believe me i know more about this than you if youre talking about that bullshit blackpool started its already blown over he did himself more damage than you i dont care about blackpool but i do care about my family and what these last few weeks have put them through and i want to have my say she started to walk into the conference room then stopped and turned back the police investigation ruled it selfdefense ive spent the last three weeks convincing myself of the same thing i want my record clear michael it was useless to argue hed come to know her well enough to understand that but he tried anyway the press has been behind you ninetynine percent and that one percent makes an ugly stain he relented enough to cross to her and brush a thumb over her cheek have you ever wondered why life gets so screwed up yes she smiled ive begun to believe that god really is a man are you coming in with me sure the press was waiting cameras lights microphones at alert flashes went off the moment she stepped up to the podium murmurs accompanied them she was very pale so that the healing bruises showed in vivid contrast on her skin though no longer swollen her left eye was a mass of ugly fading colors that spread to cheekbone and hairline when she began to speak they quieted she gave them only the facts and not her feelings she had learned that much what she felt inside was hers alone it was a brief statement just over eight minutes as she read she was grateful that pete had helped her refine it she ignored the cameras and the faces that studied her when she was done she stepped back from the mike it had already been established that she would not take questions but the questions came she had turned away her hand on michaels arm when one penetrated if he had abused you all those months why did you stay she didnt intend to answer but she looked back they were still hurling questions only that one lodged in her mind why did i stay she repeated the room fell silent again it had been easy to read the statement she almost knew it by heart it was just words printed on paper and they hadnt touched her but this this one simple question drove straight into her heart why did i stay she said again i dont know she fumbled forgetting not to look at the faces not to see them it seemed vital that she answer the question i dont know she said again if two years ago anyone had told me that i would allow myself to be brutalized i would have been furious i dont want to believe that i chose to be a victim she sent michael a quick desperate look and yet i stayed he beat me and humiliated me but i didnt leave there were times when i could see myself walking away getting in the elevator going out to the street and walking away but i didnt i stayed because i was afraid and i left for the same reason so it makes no sense it makes no sense she repeated and turned away this time she ignored the questions you did fine michael told her were going to get you out the side here mccarthys got the car waiting they drove to malibu to the house on the beach that her father had rented emma rode in silence with that one question echoing over and over in her head why did you stay she liked to srr on the redwood terrace in the morning watching the water and listening to the gulls if she tired of sitting she could take long walks along the shore the outward side of abuse had healed her ribs still troubled her occasionally and there was a thin scar just under her jawline it could have been repaired easily enough but she discarded the idea of a plastic surgeon it was barely noticeable and it reminded her the nightmares were another legacy they came with daunting regularity and were a montage of old and new sometimes she walked the darkened hallway as a child others as an adult the music always came but it was cloudy as if it played underwater at times she heard darrens voice clear as a bell but then drews would layer over it she would freeze child or woman in front of the door terrified to open it then as her hand closed over the knob turned it pushed she would wake sweating but the days were calm there was a breeze off the water the scent of flowers bev had planted in tubs and window boxes and always music shed been given the chance to see her father and bev start again that soothed the most raw of her wounds there was laughter bev experimenting in the kitchen brian in the shade playing guitar at night she often lay in bed thinking of them together it was as if they had never been apart how easy it had been once the step had been taken for them to bridge the gap of twenty years and she wanted to weep for she could never be a child again and fix the mistakes that had been made they waited six months though emma knew they were both anxious to get back to london that was their home she had yet to find hers she didnt miss new york though she did miss marianne the months she had lived there with drew had spoiled the city for her she would go back that she promised herself but she would never live there again she preferred to watch the water to feel the sun on her face shed been alone in new york she was rarely alone here johnno had visited twice staying two weeks each time for her birthday hed given her a pin a gold phoenix rising out of a ruby flame she wore it often wishing for the courage to spread her wings again pm married lady annabelle detouring to la on their way to a honeymoon in the mexican caribbean watching the way the new mrs ferguson doted on her husband nearly restored emmas faith in the possibilities of marriage though plump and pregnant annabelle had worn a white leather mini to her wedding pm was obviously delighted with her even now they had company stevie and katherine haynes had arrived the night before long after shed gone to bed emma had heard her father and stevie playing like old times shed thought the music had made her wistful for the days during her early childhood when as though she had been cinderella brian had come to take her to a neverending ball good morning she turned and saw katherine holding two cups of coffee hello i saw you out here and thought you might like a cup thanks its a beautiful morning mmmm i couldnt sleep through it she chose a chair beside emma are we the only ones up yes she sipped at the coffee traveling makes me restless i imagine you find a lot here to photograph emma hadnt picked up a camera in more than a year and was sure katherine was aware of it its a beautiful spot a change from new york yes would you rather i went away no im sorry emmas fingers began to tap against her mug i didnt mean to be rude but i make you uncomfortable your profession does katherine stretched out her legs to rest her ankles against the hottorn rail im here as a friend not as a doctor she waited watching a gull soar out to the water but i wouldnt be a good friend or a good doctor if i didnt try to help im fine you look fine not all wound show though do they emma looked at her then calm and passionless perhaps not but they say time takes care of that if that were true id be out of business your parents are concerned emma they neednt be i dont want them to be they love you drews dead emma said he cant hurt me anymore he cant beat you anymore katherine agreed but he can still hurt you she lapsed into silence sipping her coffee and watching the waves youre too polite to tell me to go to hell im thinking about it with a light laugh katherine turned her head one day ill tell you about all the rude and revolting things stevie pulled on me you might come close but i doubt you could match him do you love him yes are you going to marry him thrown a bit off stride katherine lifted one shoulder ask me again in six months bev tells me youre seeing someone named michael hes a friend i love you emma a friend she repeated as she set the coffee aside a detective isnt he the son of the man who investigated your brothers murder taking emmas silence in stride katherine continued its strange how life runs in circles isnt it makes us feel a bit like a puppy chasing his own tail id just finished a miserable divorce when i met stevie my ego was bellydown and my opinion of men well lets just say i found certain varieties of slugs more attractive i detested stevie on sight that was personal professionally i was determined to help him and get him out of my hair now here we are though she no longer wanted it emma picked up the mug again and sipped the cooling coffee did you feel as though youd failed with my marriage katherine kept her tone easy it was a question shed wondered if emma would ask yes and i had but then people fail all the time the hard part isnt even admitting it its accepting it i failed with drew i accept that is that what you want me to say no i dont want you to say anything unless you need to i failed myself she sprang up slamming her mug on the little redwood table all those months i failed myself is that the right answer is it on an oath emma turned to the rail i dont want to do this if id wanted a psychiatrist i could have had a dozen by now you know you made quite an impression on me the first time i saw you you were about to storm out of stevies hospital room after giving him the dressingdown id been dying to give him he didnt want help either im not stevie no youre not katherine rose then she wasnt as tall as emma but when her voice grew crisp she projected total authority would you like me to quote you statistics on how many women are abused every year i believe it runs about one every eighteen seconds in this country surprised she asked when emma stared at her did you want to feel as if you were the only member of an exclusive club how about how many of them stay with their abusers it isnt always because they dont have friends or family who would help them it isnt always because theyre poor or uneducated theyre afraid their selfrespect has been shattered theyre ashamed theyre confused for every one who finds help there are a dozen more who dont youre alive emma but you havent survived it not yet no i havent emma spun around her eyes were damp but there was fury behind them i have to live with it every day do you think talking about it helps finding excuses choosing reasons what difference does it make why it happened it happened im going for a walk she raced down the steps and headed toward the surf katherine was a panent woman for two days she said nothing made no reference to the talk she and emma had had she waited while emma kept a polite distance the days were anything but uneventful because it was her first trip to the states stevie wanted to show katherine everything they spent hours sightseeing taking in all the tourist spots from the walk of the stars to disneyland and knotts berry farm there were clubs in the evening sometimes they went alone sometimes as a group she liked best the nights they spent at home with stevie sitting for hours making love to his guitar but she thought incessantly about emma stevie understoodperhaps that was why katherine had fallen in love with himthat she had to help even when help was rejected she took her chances when she heard emma go downstairs before dawn one morning following her down katherine found all the lights shining emma was in the kitchen sitting at the breakfast bar and staring out the dark window i wanted some tea katherine said easily and walked to the stove i always find it comforting when i wake this early she didnt comment on the tears drying on emmas cheeks but busied herself with cups and saucers i admire your mother the way she adds a few touches and makes the kitchen the coziest room in the house with mine i always feel as though im standing in someone elses closet she measured out tea in a painted pot shaped like a cow stevie took me through the universal studios tour yesterday afternoon have you ever been she waited only a beat for emmas response then continued i got a closeup look at jaws and wondered why the film had terrified me but then its all image and illusion she poured the boiling water into the pot and let the tea steep the little tram rode by norman batess houseyou know from psycho it looks exactly the same just what youd expect but without the terror it seems when you lift something out of context even something frightening it loses power it becomes just an odd little house or a mechanical fish life isnt the same as films no but ive always thought there were interesting parallels would you like cream no no thank you she was silent while katherine poured the tea then the words came out before she could stop them sometimes its as though the time i spent with drew was a film something i can look at detached and then on mornings like this when i wake up before the light i think im back in new york in the apartment and hes sleeping beside me i can almost hear him breathing in the dark then the rest these last months are the film does that make me crazy no it makes you a woman who lived through a terrible ordeal but hes gone i know hes gone why should i still be afraid are you she couldnt keep her hands still she poked and pushed at items on the counter a wine glass that hadnt been put away from the night before a bowl of fresh frt the sugar bowl that matched the bovine teapot he used to play tricks after id told him about darren everything i remembered everything i felt he would get out of bed after i was asleep it was all rushing out now unstoppable hed put on that song the one that was playing the night darren was killed then hed call me whispering my name over and over so that id wake in the dark hearing it id always try to turn on the light but he would have pulled out the plug so i would just sit there in bed begging it to stop once i started screaming he would come back he would tell me it was all a dream now when i have the nightmares i lie there in bed frozen terrified hes going to open the door and tell me it was all a dream you had a nightmare tonight yes can you tell me about it theyre always basically the same its the night darren was killed i wake up just as i did the hallways dark the music playing and im afraid i can hear him crying sometimes i get to the door and drews there sometimes its someone else but i dont know who do you want to know now i do when im awake and i feel safe but during the dream i dont i feel as though ill die if i do if he touches me you feel threatened by this man yes how do you know its a man i she hesitated the dark was lightening to gray because the window was open she could hear the early gulls like children crying i dont know but im sure it is are you threatened by men emma because of what drew did to you im not afraid of dad or stevie ive never been afraid of johnno or pm i couldnt be and michael she picked up her tea for the first time drinking it cold im not afraid hed hurt me but you are afraid that i wouldnt be able to she broke off shaking her head this doesnt have anything to do with michael its me its natural to be wary of a physical relationship emma when your last experience brought only pain and humiliation intellectually you know that those arent the purposes or the usual result of intimacy but intellect and emotion run on different tracks emma nearly smiled are you saying the nightmares are a result of sexual repression im sure freud would katherine said mildly but then im half convinced the man was a lunatic im just exploring possibilities i think we can rule michael out hes never asked me to have sex with him not make love with katherine noted but have sex with she would file that for later do you want him to now she did smile dawn had come and with it the safety of morning ive often wondered if psychiatrists are just gossips okay well pass on that one can i make a suggestion all right get your camera go out and take pictures today drew took a number of things from you why dont you prove to yourself that he didnt take everything emma wasnt sure why she took katherines advice she could think of nothing she wanted to photograph people had always been her favorite subject but shed shied away from them for so long still she had to admit it felt good to have the camera in her hand to toy with lenses to plan a particular shot she spent the morning focusing on palm trees and buildings the shots wouldnt win any prizes she knew but the mechanics of photography were relaxing by noon shed used up two rolls and wondered why shed waited so long to enjoy something she loved she wasnt sure why she pointed the car in the direction of michaels house it was a beautiful sunday afternoon too pretty to spend alone she hadnt taken a picture of him since that first one years before conroy would make an interesting subject those were all easy excuses she settled on them as she pulled up in front of his house though his car was there he didnt answer for so long she thought shed missed him the dog had begun to bark on her first knock and now could be heard howling and scratching on the other side of the door she heard michael swear at him and grinned the moment he opened the door she knew shed awakened him it was past noon but his eyes were heavy and unfocused he wore only a pair of jeans obviously tugged on hastily and still half zipped he dragged a hand over his face and back into his hair emma yes im sorry michael i should have called he blinked against the sunlight is something wrong no listen ill go on i was just out riding around no come on in he reached for her hand as he glanced over his shoulder shit michael really its a bad time i can just shed stepped over the threshold the dim light had her narrowing her eyes oh my she couldnt think of anything else the living room looked as though it had been run over by a group of particularly vicious elves have you been robbed no he was too groggy to worry about appearances and took her arm to drag her back to the kitchen the dog continued to bark and leap in circles around them you must have had a party she decided and felt a bit miffed that he hadnt asked her to come no please god let there be coffee he muttered pushing through the cupboards here she found the can of maxwell house in the sink with a bag of potato chips would you like me to no he brushed her aside i can make the damn coffee conroy if you dont shut up im going to tie your tongue around your neck in defense he took the chips and set the bag on the floor for the dog to enjoy what time is it emma cleared her throat she decided it would be unwise to point out that there was a clock on the coffee maker about twelvethirty he was scowling at the coffee scoop in his hand obviously hed lost track as he began to add more emma lifted her camera and shot im sorry she said when he glared at her its reflex he said nothing but turned to root through the cupboards again his mouth felt as though hed dined on chalk there was a jazz combo jamming gleefully in his head he was sure his eyes had swollen to the size of golf balls and he discovered he was out of tucking cereal michael emma trod carefully not because she was intimidated but because she was deathly afraid she would laugh would you like me to fix you some breakfast i cant find any sit down she had to clear her throat again as she pushed him to a chair well start with coffee where are your cups in the kitchen okay after a search she found a package of styrofoam cups jumbo size she poured the coffee it looked as thick as mud and just as appetizing but he guzzled it as the caffeine kicked in he saw her with her head in his refrigerator she looked great absolutely great with a little cropped blouse and breezy summer pants in pale blue her hair was loose he liked it best loose so he could imagine running his hands through it but what was she doing with her head in his refrigerator what are you doing fixing you breakfast you have one egg how would you like it cooked he drained the cup and hobbled back for another dose your bolognas green and theres something in here that might be alive she took out the egg a hunk of cheese and a heel of bread ive never seen things move in a refrigerator before got a skillet i think so why never mind she found it eventually and with a little invention managed to fix him an openface eggandcheese sandwich she settled on a flat ginger ale and sat across from him as he ate michael not to intrude but could i ask how long youve been living this way l bought the place about four years ago and youre still alive youre a strong man michael ive been thinking about getting it cleaned think bulldozers its hard to get insulted when im eating he watched her take a picture of conroy who had gone back to sleep with his paws crossed over the bag of chips hell never sign a release form she smiled at him feeling better almost human i was outdecided it was time to start working again i thought you might like to tag along for a few hours she felt shy suddenly it was different now that he was fully awake watching her over the remains of the breakfast shed fixed him i know youve been busy the last few weeks tackling crime singlehanded conroy you lazy mutt go fetch the dog opened one eye and grumbled go on he gave what sounded like a very human sigh as he dragged himself up and out youve been avoiding me emma she started to deny it yes im sorry youve been a good friend and i if you start on that friendshipandgratitude business again youre only going to piss me off he took the pack of cigarettes conroy dropped in his lap then rose to let the dog out i wont mention it again good he turned back six months hed waited hoping shed come knocking on his door now that she had he couldnt kick the anger why did you come here i told you you wanted company while you took some pictures and you thought about good old michael she set the bottle of ginger ale down and rose stiffly obviously i should have thought again im sorry i disturbed you walk in and walk out he murmured thats a bad habit of yours emma i didnt come here to fight with you thats too damn bad its long past time we had this out he took a step toward her she retreated nothing she could have done would have infuriated him more im not latimer goddammit im sick to death of you thinking of him every time i get close if were going to fight its going to be you and me and nobody else i dont want to fight before shed realized shed done it she picked up the bottle and threw it glass and ginger ale exploded in the sink she stood stunned as the fizzing died away want another i have to go she reached for her camera but he moved and laid a hand over hers not this time his voice wasnt calm when she looked up at him she braced waiting youre not going to walk out on me again emma not until ive said what i need to say michael just shut up ive wanted you for as long as i can remember that day all those years ago that day on the beach when i took you home i had such a crush on you i could hardly see i was barely seventeen and i couldnt think of anyone but you for weeks after i haunted that beach waiting for you to come back i couldnt she turned away but made no attempt to leave i got over it michael shook a cigarette out of the pack then slammed through the kitchen drawers looking for a match i thought id gotten over it and then you came back there i am minding my own business cutting the lawn and youre standing in front of me i could hardly breathe dammit i wasnt a boy anymore and it wasnt a crush she had to struggle to find her voice it was a different kind of fear now dozens of nerves jumping to tangle over each other you hardly knew me he shifted his gaze to meet hers you know better emma there was something there when we sat on the beach the first time i kissed you the only time ive never forgotten it i havent been able to then you walked away i had to maybe you did he pitched his cigarette out the door and let the screen slam shut the time wasnt right thats what i told myself christ ive been telling myself that for years he crossed to her he could feel her tremble when he took her arms but he didnt let go not this time when is the time going to be right emma i dont know what you want me to say thats bullshit you know just what i want you to say i cant wont he corrected because of him dammit you broke my heart when you married him and i had to live with that it seems like ive spent half my life trying to get over you maybe i could have done it but you came back again i she moistened her dry lips i couldnt help that either something came into his eyes that had her holding her breath i told myself this time it would be different i was going to make it different and then when i found out what hed done to you i almost went crazy ive been afraid to touch you all these months give her time thats what i kept telling myself give her time to get over it the hell with it he pulled her close and covered her mouth with his it wasnt what she expected she was trapped there was no denying that she was trapped against him his body strong and hard and tense his mouth like a fire on hers shed thought she would be revolted or terrified to find herself held tight by a man again but those werent her feelings what emotions rushed into her came so quickly her head spun warmth and pleasure and an iceedged spear of desire she didnt want to give herself to them or to him how could she when it meant handing her control over to someone else again but before she could fight he was drawing away he didnt speak just looked at her wideeyed breath quickened she stood absolutely still yes she was trapped emma realized but it didnt seem to matter because she was feeling again really feeling in a way shed long ago accepted she was incapable of the anger had drained out of him so that only his needs remained i dont want you to be afraid of me it would be her choice she could see that in his eyes if she was trapped it was her own longings her own dreams that held her prisoner im not his hands had gentled on her shoulders she didnt protest when he slid them up to frame her face nor did she try to pull away when his lips touched hers again gently now and soft her muscles went lax even as her pulse scrambled her choice she thought again and one shed taken much too long to make then her mind filled up with him so completely there was room for nothing else he felt the change the slow hesitant response as her lips parted beneath his as her body seemed to melt against him he was trembling himself as he skimmed kisses over her face then her arms came around him and she found his lips with her own he lifted her up it seemed the only way to love her this first time he continued to kiss her light and promising deep and drugging as he carried her into the bedroom the shades were drawn so that the sun beat against them in yellow waves he wished it could have been candlelight emma tried not to stiffen when he laid her on the bed she knew it would go quickly now she wanted him to go on kissing her holding her but she knew better she thought she knew better he was beside her he didnt roll on top of her and tug at her clothes his mouth sought hers again to seduce as much as to reassure though her body was taut as wire she seemed so fragile her skin her mouth the scent that he could wallow in when he buried his face in her hair her fingers brushed hesitantly over his bare chest nearly driving him mad with a little moan of pleasure he began to tease her tongue with his her taste ran through him like a warm river he moved slowly confusing her seducing her she waited for him to take but he continued to give his hands ran over her making her shudder but there was no fear in it here at last was generosity here at last was compassion a pleasure so deep and dark coursed through her that she moved against him hands clutching greed poured into her she hadnt known she could feel it not for a man her hands were in his hair dragging his mouth back to hers so that she could sink into those hot wet kisses when he drew back she moaned in protest and reached for him i want to look at you he told her ive waited a long time to look at you here she could only stare bewildered and aching as he brushed his hands through her hair watching the way it fell from his fingers onto the pillow he continued to watch her face as he slowly unbuttoned her blouse he could see the confusion in her eyes and the cloudy haze of desire it made it easy to be tender when she lifted a hand to cover herself he took it pressed her fingers to his lips with her hand still in his he lowered his mouth to her breast a groan escaped him she was small and firm sweet unbearable her skin fired with the slightest touch he filled himself with her the taste the smooth silky texture he could hear her breath as fast and shallow as his own her body arched as he peeled the blouse from her his mouth was everywhere she shivered from the heat as he ranged quick openmouthed kisses over her face her shoulders then gently torturously down her rib cage she jolted when he used his teeth but there was no pain only delirium he drew down her slacks inch by maddening inch following the path with his lips she wanted she had never wanted before only dreamed her body was slick with sweat writhing with need but he continued to kiss and caress making her claw at the sheets as he nibbled on the back of her knee the heat was unbearable yet she wanted more as his fingers skimmed up her thighs her body convulsed she couldnt draw air a roaring filled her head bolted through her system terrifying her with a wild mixture of pleasure and fear she reared up the climax slammed into her a velvet fist which had her falling back gasping my god youre sweet he could barely breathe himself as he brought his mouth back to sear hers before her shudders had stopped he was driving her up again she wanted to scream out his name but could only whisper it as her hands slid over his damp skin please her breath was sobbing out now sensation after sensation poured into her body until it was a mass of fevered pleasure yet it wasnt enough it wasnt nearly enough i want she cried out again flinging out a hand and sending something crashing tell me he was crazed to hear it the pressure had built to a pitch hed never experienced yet he held back look at me and tell me she opened her eyes his face was all she could see and in his eyes she saw herself i want you reaching up she dragged his mouth to hers she cried out again when he filled her she slept for an hour exhausted across his bed hed sat beside her for a long time stroking her hair and wondering how to keep her in his life even being in love with her all that time hadnt prepared him for what it would be like to be her lover hed imagined it countless times but whenever he had hed had only women as comparisons there was no one like emma if he had to beg hed beg if he had to fight hed fight but he wasnt going to lose her again when she woke he was gone she lay stomach down across the bed trying to adjust her mind to what had happened to her body it seemed impossible that she had felt all those things done all those things without a moment of regret or hesitation even hours before she had been certain she would never want to be touched again and yet perhaps today was the first time she truly had been touched smiling she rolled over and thought idly about getting dressed and finding him then she saw his gun it was still holstered the strap slung across the back of a chair a few feet from the bed she had used a gun emma remembered though much of that last horror with drew came only in vague patches she could clearly see those final moments she could remember how it had felt to wrap her hands around the gun to pull the trigger to kill to know she was capable of that made her stomach coil into knots she had loved and married and killed in a little less than two years now she had the rest of her life to wonder how she could have done any one of the three when the bedroom door swung open she groped automatically for the sheet good youre up michael strolled in carrying a bucket of chicken and a sixpack of cokes i thought you might get hungry hed pulled an lapd tshirt on with his jeans but he was still barefoot to emma he looked more like a beachcomber than a man who would fire a gun before she could answer he leaned down and kissed her in a way that had her mind clouding again figured we could have a picnic a picnic she echoed where right here he dropped the bucket of chicken on the bed that way the neighbors wont be shocked because youre naked she laughed i could get dressed he sat on the bed across from her and took a long look i really wish you wouldnt grinning he twisted the top off a coke want some music he leaned over and punched a button on his clock radio linda ronstadt soared over blue bayou getting down to business he peeled the top off the bucket and dug in arent you hungry the scent of the chicken was glorious emma watched him take a bite and dragged a hand through her tousled hair i cant eat naked sure you can he held out the drumstick she shifted took a bite then laughed again really i cant michael dropped the chicken back in the bucket then dragged his shirt off he pulled it over her head better emma worked her arms through lots the shirt smelled of him it amazed her that it made her every bit as hungry as the chicken ive never had a picnic in bed before same principle as a blanket on the beach we eat listen to music and then i make love with you this way we avoid the sand she took the bottle he offered and drank to ease a dry throat i dont know how all this happened thats okay ill be glad to run through it all again for you was it she broke off annoyed with herself you werent going to ask if it was good for me were you no he was grinning at her sort of she took another bite of chicken never mind delighted with her with himself with everything he ran a fingertip down her bare arm you want like a scale of one to ten shut up michael just as well because you went right off the scale he only flustered her its never been like that for me before she murmured ive never i didnt think i could she broke off again then taking a deep breath got the rest out of her system i thought i was frigid he nearly laughed but he could see by her face that it wasnt a joke latimer again michael thought and had to take several seconds to control his voice you thought wrong his careless response was exactly the right one looking up again she smiled if i had followed my instincts that day on the beach when i kissed you id have known differently a long time ago why dont you follow them now she hesitated rising up to her knees she linked her arms around his neck and kissed him michael tossed the halfeaten drumstick over his shoulder she was laughing when they rolled over the bed stay tonight the sun was going down as she started to dress not tonight i need to think i was afraid youd start thinking again he reached for her holding her against him i love you emma why dont you think about that her only response was to close her eyes i need you to believe me i want to believe you she told him i dont trust my own judgment right now not so long ago i thought drew loved me and that i loved him i was wrong on both counts goddamnit emma biting off the words he moved away to pull up the shade twilight crept in im not comparing you arent you no she knew he couldnt understand how far she had come already to be able to go to him and rest her cheek against his back its me im not sure of my problems didnt start with drew it would be difficult enough if they had i have to be sure i know what i want before i ask for it again im not going to settle for one day with you she sighed and kissed his shoulder dad and bev will be going back to england soon he turned at that she could see the glint of fury in his eyes in the dying light if youre thinking about going back with them think again you cant bully me michael im past that until shed said the words she hadnt realized they were true im thinking of staying on at the beach house they need to get on with their lives and i need to decide what i want to do with the rest of mine and you want me to back off not too far she put her arms around him again i dont want to lose you im sure of that i just dont know what to do about it yet can we leave things as they are for now for a little while longer all right but understand this im not going to wait forever neither am l strmning for patience michael propped his feet on his desk and studied the ceiling the high excited voice in the phone receiver rambled on and on they would haul the little weasel in as a material witness sooner or later he knew he just wanted it to be sooner listen pal he interrupted at length i got the impression springer was your friend yeah well talks cheap he may have been a worthless twobit bagman but once we get the stiff we take a personal interest he paused listened to another moment of babbling no one was more uncooperative than a jumpy witness with a fistful of priors thats fine you dont want to come in well find you he glanced up as the sergeant dropped a load of files and mail on his desk take your chances on the street weve always got room for one more at the morgue he listened as he pushed through the files good choice ask for detective kesselring michael hung up and scowled at the paperwork hed hoped for five minutes to call emma but the odds were against it resigned he tuned out the noise of the squad room and went for the mail first hey kesselring we need your ten bucks for the christmas party michael decided if he heard the word christmas again hed shoot somebody preferably santa himself mccarthy owes me twenty get t from him hey hearing his name mccarthy wandered over wheres your holiday spirit in your wallet michael told him still sulking cause his ladys going to spend christmas in london lighten up kesselring the worlds full of blondes kiss off mccarthy put a hand over his heart must be love ignoring him michael studied the manila envelope it was odd when he was thinking such dark thoughts about london that he would get a letter from that city a law firm he mused skimming the return address what would a london law firm want with him when he opened it he found a cover letter and an envelope in shades of pink and blue turning the envelope over he saw another return address in fancy script jane palmer though he wasnt a superstitious man he stared at the envelope for several minutes thinking about messages from the dead he slit it open and studied the cramped handwriting within five minutes he was standing in his fathers office watching lou read the letter dear detective kesselring you investigated the death of brian mcvoys son im sure you remember the case i remember it also if youre still interested you should come to london and talk to me i know all about it it was my idea but they made a mess of it if you will pay for information we can work out a deal yours truly jane palmer what do you think michael demanded i think she might have known something lou adjusted his glasses and read the letter through again she was six thousand miles away when it went down and we could never tie her to it but he had always wondered the first postmarks just a few days before her body was found according to the lawyers the letter bounced around because of the incomplete address then ended up with the rest of her papers over eight months michael said in disgust im not sure it would have made a difference if it had been eight days shed still have been dead if she was telling the truth and knew who killed the kid someone could have gotten to her someone who didnt know shed send off a letter i want to see the report talk to the investigating officer lou turned the letter over in his hand there wasnt any purpose in reminding michael that the letter had been addressed to the investigating officer on the case its possible its the first lead weve had on this in nearly twenty years he remembered the police photograph of a little boy and looked up at his son i guess youre going to london emma rolled our cookie dough and tried to put her heart into it shed always loved christmas this year for the first time since childhood she would be spending it with her family the kitchen smelled of cinnamon and brown sugar carols were playing through the speakers and bev was measuring out ingredients for plum pudding outside a light snow was falling but her heart wasnt in it she was afraid it was six thousand miles away with michael as emma pressed the cutters into the dough bev slipped an arm around her im so glad youre here emma it means everything to me and your father and to me she scooped up a cookie in the shape of a snowflake and laid it on the baking sheet you used to let me do this when i was little if johnno was around hed come in and pinch a few before they were even cooked why do you think i sent him off with bri she watched emma sprinkle colored sugar over the tops you miss michael dont you i didnt know i would not this much she carried the tray to the oven its silly its only two weeks after setting the timer she walked back to ball the dough together and roll it again it felt good to do something with her hands to feel competent in charge its probably good for me to get away i dont want to get too involved too quickly katherine says youre making wonderful progress i think i am im grateful to her for staying on with me in la for the last couple of months i wasnt always she added with a smile but talking things out helped youre still having nightmares not as often and im getting back to work finally pushing through with the book she paused with a cookie cutter in her hand a year ago christmas was a nightmare this year its almost perfect she glanced over as the kitchen door swung open the cookie cutter clattered to the floor michael the housekeeper said i should just come back she didnt think she didnt need to with a cryof pleasure she raced into his arms before he could speak again her mouth was on his i cant believe youre here she pulled back laughed and began to dust him off ive got flour all over you im sure i can find a dozen things to do bev wiped her hands on a cloth and slipped out the door you said you couldnt come emma began i had a change in schedule he drew her close again wanting another taste desire rippled through him as her mouth moved warm under his merry christmas how long can you stay a couple of days he glanced over toward the stove whats that noise oh my cookies she dashed over to turn off the timer and rescue them i was thinking of you when i made these and wishing you werent so far away turning tray in hand she looked at him ill go back with you if you want you know i want he ran a hand down her braid i also know that you need time with your family ill be waiting for you when you get home i love you the words went through her heart to her mind so quickly it stunned her the tray clattered as she dropped it on the rangetop say it again his eyes were so dark and intense she lifted a hand to his cheek to soothe i love you michael im sorry its taken me so long to get it out saying nothing he pulled her close and held her for a moment everything hed ever wanted was within the circle of his arms i knew when i saw you in new york at my showing as soon as i saw you i knew with a combination of relief and pleasure she turned her face into his throat it scared me it seems ive been scared for years then when you walked in the door just now it all fell into place you wont be able to shake me off now good she tilted her head up to his how about a cookie he made excuses michael didnt enjoy lying to emma but he felt it best that the business that had brought him to london remain his for a while longer he found his british counterparts polite and tidy he also discovered that british red tape was every bit as convoluted as american it took him two hours to be told he would have to come back the next day for a look at the files it was time well spent emma was thrilled at the opportunity to show him london steering him from the tower to piccadilly to the changing of the guards to westminster abbey though hed been easily persuaded to stay in the mcavoys home hed kept his hotel room after the frantic tour they spent hours in bed the files were little help to him a standard investigation had ultimately ruled death by misadventure forensics had turned up no prints other than janes her former maids and those of the dealer who had found the body both his and the maids alibis were airtight the neighbors had nothing good to say about the deceased but they hadnt seen anything or anyone on the night of her death michael skimmed through the police photographs and people called him a slob he mused as he studied the filth in which jane had lived and died frustrated that the scene had long since been cleaned out he went over the pictures again with a magnifying glass inspector carlson who had been in charge of the palmer investigation looked on patiently it was a bit of a sty he pointed out th be frank ive never seen anything quite like it or smelled anything like it the old girl had cooked for a couple of days no prints but hers on the syringe no she did the job herself carlson removed his hornrims to polish the lenses we debated suicide but it simply didnt fit as it says in the report it appears that she obtained the heroin was too strung out to remember to cut it down and took a quick last ride whered she get the horse this guy hitch the inspector pursed his lips hes smalltime doesnt have the connections to deal anything that pure if not him then who weve never been able to ascertain we assumed shed made the buy herself she was a bit of a celebrity in her day and had a number of connections youve seen the letter she sent to my department thats why were willing to reopen the case detective if indeed weve had a murder here that connects with a murder in your country youll have our complete cooperation he settled the hornrims comfortably on his hooked nose its been nearly twenty years but none of us has forgotten what happened to darren mcavoy no no one had forgotten michael thought as he sat in brians oakpaneled office and watched the man read his exlovers letter there was a fire crackling cheerfully in the hearth across the room easy chairs were placed cozily in front of it awards and plaques and photographs lined the shelves and walls there were a few cardboard boxes a testament to the fact hed only moved in weeks before his desk looked more like an executives than a rock stars glossy and piled with files and papers against the wall was a yamaha keyboard and synthesizer along with a huge reeltoreel tape recorder there was only mineral water and soft drinks in the bar michael waited until brian looked up my father and i discussed it we thought you should know shaken brian groped for a cigarette you think its genuine yes he fumbled with his lighter there was a bottle of irish whiskey in the bottom drawer of his deskstill sealed it was a test to himself in the six weeks and three days since hed tipped a bottle hed never wanted a drink more sweet jesus i thought i knew what she was capable of i cant understand this he dragged in smoke like a drowning man sucks air if she waswhy would she have wanted to hurt him he buried his face in his hands me she wanted to hurt me were still of the opinion that the death was an accident hardly words of comfort michael thought logically kidnapping and the ransom you would have paid were the motives i was already paying her for emma he scrubbed his face with his hands then dropped them on the desk she would have killed emma snapped her neck right before my eyes she was capable of that in a rage but to plan something like this lifting his face again he shook his head i cant believe she could do it she had help he rose then all but lunged from the chair to roam the room it was full of the tangible proof of his success gold records platinum records grammys american music awards signs that the music he had created was important jockeying for space with them were dozens of photographs devastation yesterday and today brian with other singers musicians politicians hed supported celebrities there was a framed snapshot among them of emma and his lost son sitting on the banks of a little creek and smiling into the sunlight he had created them as well twenty years dissolved in an instant and he was back on the sun dappled grass listening to the laughter of his children i thought id put this behind me he rubbed his fingers over his eyes and turned away from the picture i dont want bev to know not yet ill tell her when i think the times right thats up to you i wanted you to know im going to reopen the case are you as dedicated as your father id like to think so with a nod brian accepted that whatever bond had been forged on that horrible night two decades before had yet to be broken but he had another child to consider what about emma are you going to put her through all the questioning again ill do everything i can to keep emma from being hurt he opened a bottle of ginger ale a poor substitute for whiskey bev seems to think youre in love with her i am michael shook his head at the offer of a drink im going to marry her as soon as shes ready brian stood where he was and drank the thirst was unbearable i didnt want her involved with drew for all the wrong reasons ive had the opportunity to ask myself if i hadnt pushed her if i hadnt objected so strongly would she have waited latimer wanted you and what you could do for him i only want emma i always have with a sigh brian sat again she has always been the most constant and beautiful part of my life something i made thoughtlessly that turned out perfectly right with a ghost of a smile so much like his daughters he looked at michael you made me nervous the day emma brought you to that miserable house of pms in beverly hills i looked at you and thought this boy is going to take emma away from me must be the irish he said as he drank again it seems the lot of us are drunks or poets or seers ive had a chance to be all three i can make her happy ill hold you to it he picked up the letter again as important as it is to me for you to find who killed my son its more important that you make emma happy dad pm and annabelle have brought the baby oh im sorry emma stopped with her hand on the knob i didnt know you were here michael you were shopping when i got back he stood casually taking the letter from brian and slipping it into his pocket whats wrong nothing brian came around the desk to kiss her ive been grilling michael it seems he has ideas about my daughter she smiled on the verge of believing it before she saw her fathers eyes what is it ive just told you he put an arm around her shoulders and would have led her out but she turned to michael i wont be lied to i do have ideas about his daughter michael countered she shrugged off the arm around her shoulder and stood firm will you let me see the envelope thats in your pocket yes but id rather do it later dad would you leave us alone a moment emma please reluctantly he closed the door behind him and left them alone i trust you michael she began if you tell me that the only thing you and dad talked about in this room was our relationship ill believe you he started to he wanted to no its not all we talked about will you sit it was going to be bad she found herself gripping her hands together in her lap as she had done since her school days when she was afraid to hear what she had to hear instead of speaking michael took the envelope out of his pocket and handed it to her ice prickled along her skin as she saw the name on the back of the envelope a message from the dead she thought and wished she could have laughed at the phrase she opened the letter and sat in silence reading it she was so much like her father michael noted her expressions the way grief came into her eyes the quiet way she held herself as she coped with it before she spoke she folded the letter again and gave it back to him this is why youre here yes her eyes were dark and wretched when they met his i wanted to think you couldnt stay away from me i cant she lowered her head again it was so difficult to think when the ache came this way marching hard do you believe this letter its not up to me to believe he said carefully im following it up i believe it emma had a flash of her last clear image of jane standing in the doorway of the dirty house her face shadowed with bitterness she only wanted to hurt dad she wanted to make him suffer i still remember the way she looked at him the day he took me away i was only a baby really but i remember she took a ragged breath tears were useless now how is it possible to love and hate a person as she did how is it possible to take those feelings and distort them so completely that you could play a part in taking a little boys life its been almost twenty years but she still wants him to suffer he crouched beside her and took the envelope that lay in her lap maybe thats true but she may have started something that will help us find out who killed him and why i know she closed her eyes tight its buried somewhere deep inside me but i know this time im going to dig it out when the music started she was standing in the dark doorway in her favorite nightgown clutching charlie darren was crying she wanted to go back to bed back to her own bed and the glow of the nightlight but shed promised to take care of him and he was crying she stepped out but her foot didnt touch the floor it seemed to float on a dark gray cloud she could hear the hissing the dry skittering of the things that liked the dark the things that ate bad little girls like her mam had told her she didnt know which way to go it was too dark and there were sounds everywhere under and over the music that wouldnt stop she walked toward her crying brother trying to be small so small no one could see she could feel the sweat running down her back she had her hand on the knob turned it slowly pushed the door open hands gripped her arms twisting i told you not to run away from me emma drew slipped a hand around her throat and squeezed i told you id find you emma michael caught her flailing arms and pulled her close wake up emma wake up its just a dream she couldnt get her breath even when she realized where she was and who was holding her it seemed that drew still had his hands locked around her throat the light she dragged the words out please turn on the light all right hang on he shifted dragging her with him as he hit the switch there now look at me emma look at me he put a hand firmly under her chin and held it she was still shuddering and in the gleam of the lamp her face was marblewhite sheened with sweat it was a dream he said quietly youre with me im all right he pulled the sheet up around her shivering shoulders im going to get you some water when she nodded he slipped out of bed into the adjoining bath emma brought her knees close to her chest listening to the sound of water hitting glass she knew where she was in the hotel room with michael shed wanted one night alone with him before he went back to the states though she knew it had only been a dream she lifted a hand to her throat she could still feel the grip of drews fingers drink a little she sipped it didnt burn as shed feared im sorry michael he wasnt interested in apologies nor did he want her to know he was as shaken as she shed sounded as though she had been choking in sleep trying to gasp for air that was trapped in her throat how often do you have these too often is this why you wouldnt ever spend the night with me before she moved her shoulders and looked miserably into the glass youre too beautiful to be a jerk emma he shoved the pillows into place and pulled her back beside him tell me about it when shed finished he continued to stare into middle distance she was calm now he could feel it in each easy breath she took he was wired tight the letter probably set it off she murmured i used to pray that the nightmares would stop now i dont want them to i want to see i want to get through the door and see he turned his head to press his lips to her hair do you trust me his arm was firm around her not holding her down just holding her yes im going to do everything i can to find out whos responsible for your brothers death it was so long ago ive got some ideas let me see if i can put them together she rested against him wishing she could go on forever beside him her head cushioned on his shoulder i know i said id go back with you if you wanted but i need to stay i have to talk to katherine i need a few weeks he said nothing for a moment adjusting himself to the idea of being without her while youre here think about whether you could handle being married to a cop he turned her face up to his think about it hard will you yes she slid her arms around him make love with me michael the club was noisy filled with young bodies stuffed into tight jeans snug short skirts barely covered the hips of longlegged girls the music was hard and loud the liquor watered but the club was packed the dance floor jammed colored lights whirled distorting faces couples standing hip to hip had to shout to communicate drugs and money exchanged hands as casually as phone numbers it wasnt what he was used to it certainly wasnt what he preferred but he had come he squeezed into a small corner table and ordered a scotch if youd wanted to talk you could have picked a better spot his companion grinned and downed a whiskey what better place for secrets than in public he lit a cigarette with a monogtammed gold lighter the grapevine has it that jane slipped something by you i know about the letter you know and didnt think it was worth mentioning thats right it wont do to forget that what concerns you concerns me the letter only implicates jane not you or me since shes dead it hardly matters he paused waiting until the waitress had set down his drink theres something else that may be more pressing emmas having troubling dreams the man laughed and blew smoke between his teeth emmas dreams dont bother me they should since they concern us both shes in therapy with the psychiatrist who treated stevie nimmons after sampling the scotch he decided it wasnt good enough to water a plant with it looks as though she may be starting to remember his expression changed there was a trace of fear then a flood of anger you should have let me kill her years ago it wasnt necessary then the other man shrugged and sipped his scotch it may be necessary now i dont intend to get my hands dirty at this stage old man you take care of her i dealt with jane his voice was cool and level at the moment i think emma only bears watching if it goes further it will be up to you all right not because you order it but because i owe her mr blackpool can i have your autograph he set down his lighter and smiled at the curvy young redhead of course dear it would be a pleasure through the parlor window emma could see the last of the new years snow melting from the hedgerow michael wants me to marry him katherine barely lifted a brow how do you feel about that emma nearly laughed it was such a standard response therapist to patient i feel a lot of things about that surprise isnt one of them ive known for some time hes only been waiting to ask me when im with him i start to believe that it could work a home a family its what ive always wanted do you love him oh yes that part it seemed was quite simple i do there was no hesitation there katherine noticed but youre not sure of marriage it works for some people we could hardly say it worked for me how does michael compare with drew in what way katherine merely lifted her hands palms up fingers spread theyre both men attractive determined men anything else emma wandered the room the house was empty and quiet it was understood that at three each afternoon she would be left alone to talk to katherine she hadnt meant to speak of michael today but of the nightmares but her thoughts had focused on him no nothing even before i realized drew was violent i couldnt have compared them he was careless with people only able to focus on one at a time there was no real sense of loyalty he could be very clever and very romantic but it was never done out of simple generosity he always required payment and mchael he cares about people his job his family loyalty is like well the color of his eyes just part of him i never thought id want to be with a man again th have sex when we made love for the first time i felt things id always wanted to feel and hadnt been able to you call it having sex when you refer to drew making love with michael do i emma paused and gave katherine one of her rare smiles a memory drifted backjohnno sitting on her bed in her room in martinique when its with someone you care about its almost holy i dont suppose a degree is required to puzzle that out no pleased katherine leaned back against the cushions are you comfortable physically with michael no but its a wonderful kind of discomfort exciting yes but i havent been able to initiate do you want to i dont know i thinkid like to show him i suppose im afraid of doing something wrong in what way baffled emma lifted her hands and let them fall im not sure just that i might do something to annoy him or impatient with herself she turned back to the window i cant shake drew and the things he said to me about how stupid how useless i was in bed she hated that knowing she was still allowing him to control some part of her life have you considered that if you were inadequate in bed it was due to your partner and the circumstances yes up here emma touched a finger to her temple i know im not cold and unresponsive i can feel passion desire but im afraid to move toward michael afraid i might spoil something pausing she picked up a crystal pyramid and watched the colors run through it and its the nightmares im almost as afraid of him now as i was when he was alive somehow i think if i could pull him out of my dreams erase his face and his voice from my subconscious id be able to take that next step with michael is that what you want of course thats what i want do you think i want to go on being punished for what for not doing what he wanted quickly enough or in the wrong way agitated she set the crystal down to wrap her arms around her breasts for not wearing the right dress for being in love with michael he knew he knew i felt something for michael she began to pace again twisting her fingers together when he saw us together at the showing he knew it so he beat me he made me promise id never see michael again and he still beat me he knew i wouldnt keep the promise a promise made under duress isnt a promise at all dismissing logic emma shook her head the point is i tried to keep it but i didnt i couldnt so he punished me she dropped into a chair i lied she continued half to herself i lied to drew and to myself katherine leaned forward but she kept her voice very low and mild why do you suppose drew is there in your dream your dream of the night darren died i lied then too emma murmured i didnt keep my promise i didnt take care of darren we lost him dad and bev lost each other id sworn to them that i would always look after him that id keep him safe but i broke my promise no one ever punished me no one ever blamed me but you did havent you blamed yourself punished yourself if i hadnt run awayhe called to me for an instant it flashed into her mind the way his voice had raced after her as shed fled down the dark hall he was so scared but i didnt go back to him i knew they were going to hurt him but i ran and he died i should have stayed i was supposed to stay could you have helped him i ran because i was afraid for myself you were a child emma what difference does that make i made a promise you dont break promises to people you love no matter how difficult they are to keep i made one to drew and i stayed because because because i deserved to be punished she closed her eyes on a dull dreary horror oh god did i stay all those months because i wanted to be punished for losing darren katherine allowed herself only the briefest moment of satisfaction this was exactly what shed been hoping for i think thats part of it youve said before that drew reminded you of brian youve blamed yourself for darrens death and in a childs mind punishment follows guilt i didnt know drew was violent when i married him no you were attracted to what you saw on the surface a beautitil young man with a beautiful voice romantic charming you chose someone you thought was gentle and affectionate i was wrong yes you were wrong about drew he deceived you and many others because he was so attractive so loving on the outside you became convinced that you deserved what he did to you he used your vulnerability exploited it and compounded it you didnt ask to be battered emma and you werent to blame for his sickness just as you werent to blame for your brothers death she took emmas hand i believe when you accept that completely youll remember the rest once you remember the nightmares will pass i will remember emma murmured and i wont run this time the loft hm mrdly chmged marianne had added a few of her own bizarre touches a fullsized blowup of godzilla an enormous plastic palm tree that was still decorated for christmas though the january white sales were in full swing and a stuffed minah bird that swung on a perch in front of the window her paintings dominated the walls landscapes seascapes portraits and stilllifes the studio smelled of paint turpentine and calvin kleins obsession emma sat on a stool in a slash of sunlight wearing a sweatshirt that drooped off one shoulder and the sapphire and diamond earrings her father had given her for christmas youre not relaxed marianne complained as she stroked a pencil over her pad you always say that when you sketch me no youre really not relaxed marianne stuck the pencil in her hair it was a mass of curls now that just skimmed her shoulders she sat back to drum her fingers on the pad and study emma is it being here in new york i dont know maybe but shed been tense the last couple of days in london as well unable to shake the feeling she was being watched followed stalked stupid she took three deliberate breaths in all likelihood the tension stemmed from finally acknowledging her guilt and shame and her anger which revolved around darren and drew and yet once she had she felt relief you want to quit even as she asked marianne took out the pencil and began to sketch again shed always wanted to capture that quiet haunted look in emmas eyes we could run uptown go to bloomies or go to elizabeth ardens for the works i havent had a facial in weeks ive been meaning to mention how haggard you look she smiled so that the dimple winked at the corner of her mouth what is it vitamins macrobiotics sex you look wonderful i think it might be love the dentist who oh no talk of root canals destroyed our relationship his names ross i met him about six months ago six months ago emma arched a brow and you never mentioned him i thought i might jinx it with a shrug marianne turned the pad and started a new sketch shift a little would you turn your head yeah serious emma glanced out the window her stomach did a little loop so that she had to inhale slowly people were hurrying along below chased by a chill wind that threatened rain or sleet there was a man standing in the doorway of the deli smoking she would have sworn he looked right at her what she said when she heard mariannes voice i said it could be id like it to be the problem is hes a senator as in us the gentleman from virginia can you see me as one of those classy washington wives yes emma said and smiled i can teas and protocol marianne wrinkled her nose i cant imagine actually having to sit through a speech on the defense budget what are you staring at oh nothing with a quick shake of her head emma shifted her gaze theres just a man standing down on the street imagine that in downtown new york youre tensing up again sorry deliberately she looked away and tried to relax paranoia she said hoping for a light touch so do i get to meet the politician hes in dc in two strokes marianne penciled in emmas brow if you werent in such a hurry to get back to la you could go down with me next weekend it is serious then semi emma what is so fascinating out there illts just this man its almost as if hes looking right at me sounds more like vanity than paranoia pushing herself up marianne walked to the window probably waiting to make a drug deal she decided she moved away again to pick up her longneglected coffee cup in the serious vein what about michael are you going to give the man and his dog a break i want to take my time youve been taking your time with michael since you were thirteen marianne pointed out whats it like to have a man carry a torch for you for over ten years its not like that its exactly like that in fact im surprised he managed to stay on the coast when you told him you were going to visit here for a couple of days before flying back he wants to get married well you could knock me over with a twentyfoot crane whod have guessed it i suppose i havent wanted to think about what happens next thats only because youve blocked the m word out of your vocabulary for a while so what are you going to do about it it the two ms marriage and michael i dont know she looked out the window again he was still there standing patiently im going to wait until i see him again we both may feel differently now that things have settled down and our lives are getting back to normal dammit what i dont know why i didnt realize it before dads hired a bodyguard again she turned her head quickly eyes narrowed did you know about this no marianne stirred herself to go to the window and look out again brian never said a word to me look the guys just standing around why automatically assume hes there for you when youve lived with it most of your life you know when youre being watched annoyed she moved away from the window on an oath she whirled back and yanked the window open hey her sudden shout surprised her as much as the man on the street go call your boss and tell him i can take care of myself if i see you down there in five minutes im calling the cops feel better marianne murmured at her shoulder lots im not sure he could hear you all the way down there he heard enough emma said with a satisfied nod hes leaving a little dizzy she pulled her head in lets go get a facial michael pored over the printout it had taken him days to correlate lists and crosscheck in the past weeks hed found himself just as caught up in darren mcavoys murder as his father had been twenty years before he had read every inch of every file studied every photograph checked and rechecked every interview that had been compiled during the original investigation from his own memory he pulled out the visit to the house in the hills with emma making his own notes from her descriptions and recollections from his fathers meticulous investigation and emmas recollections he was able to recreate in his mind the night of darrens death music he imagined beaties stones joplin the doors drugs everything from grass to lsd cheerfully shared shop talk party talk gossip laughter and intense political discussions vietnam nixon womens liberation people coming and going some invited some just showing up no one questioning unfamiliar faces formal invitations had been for the establishment peace love and communal living the order of the day it sounded nice enough but for a cop in the first year of the nineties it was frustrating he had the guest list his father had compiled it was of course woefully inadequate but a place to start playing a hunch he spent days verifying the whereabouts on the night of jane palmers death of every name on the list hed turned up sixteen people who had been in london including all four members of devastation their manager and bev mcavoy michael ignored his tendency to cross them off and spent several more days checking alibis his printout now had twelve names he liked to think if there was indeed a connection between two murders twenty years apart it was on that list it gives us something to work with michael said he leaned over his fathers shoulder so that they could both study the printout i want to dig a little deeper find any and all of the connections between these twelve people and jane palmer youve got the mcavoys on the list you dont think they killed their own son no its the connection he pulled over a file and opened it he had a list of names connected with broken lines it resembled a family e headed by bev brian and jane below were emmas and darrens names ive been hooking them up using interviews and file information take johnno michael slid his finger down hes brians oldest friend his writing partner they formed the group together he remained friends with bev during her long estrangement from brian he also knew jane the longest motive money or revenge is all weve got michael went on we can easily apply both of those to jane palmer but its a stretch for anyone else on the list blackpool michael moved his finger down he was more of a hangeron at the time darren was killed his big break came several months later when he recorded a song brian and johnno had written and pete page became his manager he ran his finger over the lines connecting blackpool with brian johnno pete and emma no connection with palmer lou asked i havent found one yet with a nod lou leaned back there are several names on your list that even i recognize a rockandroll countdown sitting on the edge of the desk michael lit a cigarette i know when you figure the main motive for kidnapping is money most of these names dont fit thats where jane comes in if she planted the idea she could have used blackmail sex drugs or any other kind of hook to pressure someone into getting to brian through daffen she tried to get to him once through emma and all she got out of it was money she wanted more what better way than through his son he pushed away from the desk to pace the office and try to figure it out if she could have gotten into the house she would have done it herself but she was the one person who wouldnt have been welcome that night so she found someone else used whatever lever worked best and got what she wanted you sound like you understand her very well michael thought of his brief destructive affair with angie parks i think i do if we take her at her word that the kidnapping was her idea then we have to find the connection she used someone on this list there were two people in the nursery that night and one of them had to know their way around the house he had to know the layout of the rooms upstairs the mcavoys private space he had to know the kids the routine so we look for someone connected to both jane and brian youre forgetting something michael lou leaned back to study his son if you penciled your name on this page how many lines would connect you nothing clouds an investigation quicker than personal involvement and nothing motivates more michael tapped out his cigarette im not sure i would be a cop today if it hadnt been for emma she came to the house that time you remember it was around christmas she came to see you i remember she was looking for help there wasnt a lot anyone could give her but she came to you it started me thinking it wasnt all filling out forms making lists it wasnt all shootouts and collars it was having people come to you because they knew youd know what to do we went to the house in the hills and i walked through it with her i understood that there have to be people who know what to do who care enough about one small boy theyve never met to keep trying touched lou looked down at the papers on his desk its going on twenty years and i havent figured out what to do about this one what color were darren mcavoys eyes green lou answered like his mothers smiling a little michael rose youve never stopped trying ive got to pick emma up at the airport can i leave this stuff with you i dont want her to see it yeah he frilly intended to go over every word in his sons report michael he glanced up as michael paused at the door youve turned out to be a pretty good cop so have you emma md convinced herself to ease back her relationship with michael was moving too quickly she would gently pull their relationship back a few notches her book was about to be published it was time to open her own studio perhaps have another showing how did she know her own feelings in any case her life had been in too much upheaval it was easy to mistake love for gratitude and friendship and she was grateful to him always would be he had been her friend a constant if distant one for most of her life her decision to back off was best for both of them she took a firm grip on her camera case as she walked through the gate there he was he saw her the same instant she saw him all of the practical decisions shed made over the last three thousand miles vanished before she could say his name he had swooped her off her feet to the amusement and annoyance of other passengers he greeted her in silence blocking most of the gateway when she could breathe again she touched a hand to his cheek hi hi he kissed her again its good to see you i hope you havent been waiting long i think its over eleven years now he turned and started toward the terminal arent you going to put me down i dont think so how was your flight smooth with a laugh she pressed a kiss to his cheek michael you cant carry me through the airport theres no law against it i checked i guess youve got luggage yes i do you want to pick it up now she answered his grin then settled back to enjoy the ride not particularly two hours later they were in her bed sharing a bowl of ice cream id never developed the habit of eating in bed before i met you emma scooped out a spoonful and offered it marianne and i used to hoard hershey bars in our room at school sometimes wed sneak them into bed after lights out but that was as decadent as it got i always figured girls snuck guys into their room after lights out no just chocolate she slid the ice cream into her mouth and closed her eyes we only dreamed about boys we talked about sex all the time looking up with envy to any of the girls who claimed to have lived through the experience she opened her eyes and smiled at him its better than i imagined it would be she offered him another spoonful and the strap of the tank top she wore slithered off her shoulder reaching out michael toyed with it if you let me move in we could practice a lot more he was looking at her waiting wanting an answer emma thought and she didnt know which one to give him i havent decided whether im going to keep this house or look for another one that was true enough but they both knew it was an evasion rather than an answer i need studio space and a darkroom i think id like to find a place where i could have it all here in la yes she thought of new york it would never be her home again id like to try to start here good she set the bowl aside certain he didnt know what she meant by starting i need to concentrate on getting ready for another show i have a number of contacts out here and i think if we could tie it in with the book what book she smoothed the sheets and took a deep breath mine i sold it about eighteen months ago on devastation early photographs from when i was a child up to the last tour i went on with dad its been delayed a couple of times because because of what happened but its due to come out in about six months she glanced toward the window the wind had picked up from the sea and brought with it a rush of rain i have an idea for another one the publisher seems to be interested why didnt you tell me before she could make an excuse he cupped her face in his hands and kissed her long and hard all we have is a bottle of mineral water to celebrate with uhoh shed nearly relaxed and now braced again what my mothers going to kill me if you dont give her first dibs on autographing sessions and that was it she thought staring at him no demands no questions no criticisms i the publisher wants me to tour its going to mean a lot of traveling for a few weeks do i get to watch you on donahue li dont know theyre setting stuff up i told them id be available for anything they wanted during the month of publication it was her tone that had him lifting a brow is this a test emma are you waiting for me to grow fangs because youre telling me youve got a life maybe sorry to disappoint you he started to rise but she laid a hand on his arm dont if its not fair im sorry its not always easy to be fair she dragged both hands through her hair i know better than to make comparisons but i cant help making them work on it he suggested flatly then reached over for his cigarettes dammit michael hes all i have to compare i never lived with another man i never slept with another man you want me to pretend that that part of my life never happened that i never let myself be used or hurt im supposed to forget and pick up and go on so that you can take care of me every man whos ever been important to me has wanted to take over because im too weak or stupid or defenseless to make the right choices hold on but she was scrambling out of bed to pace the room all of my life ive been tucked into corners all for my own good my father wanted me to forget about darren not to dwell on it not to think of it i wasnt supposed to worry about what he was doing to his own life either then drew was going to take care of it all i was too naive to handle my finances my friends my work and i was so bloody used to being pointed in a direction i just went now im supposed to forget all of that just forget it and let you click into place so im protected again is that why you think im here she turned back isnt it maybe thats part of it he blew out smoke then deliberately crushed out his cigarette its hard to be in love with someone and not want to protect them but lets just back up okay i dont want you to forget about what happened between you and latimer i want you to be able to live with it but i hope to christ you never forget it ti wont neither will l he stood then to cross to her outside the rain was whipped by the wind battering windows ill remember everything he did to you and therell be times when ill wish he was still alive so i could kill him myself but ill also remember that you pulled yourself out of it you took a stand and you survived weak he lifted a fingertip to trace the faint scar under her jawline do you really believe i think youre weak i saw what he did to you that day ill always be able to see it you didnt let him plow you under emma no and i wont let anyone take control of my life again im not your father he spit out the words as he gripped her shoulders and im not latimer i dont want to control your life i just want to be part of it i dont know what i want she lifted her hands to cover his i keep coming back to you and its frightening because i cant stop i dont want to need you this way dammit emma when the phone rang he swore again its for you she said holding out the receiver yeah he picked up his cigarettes then paused where twenty minutes he said and hung up ive got to go he was already pulling on his jeans she only nodded someone was dead she could see it on his face were not finished here emma no he shouldered on his gun ill be back as soon as i can michael she didnt know what she wanted to say instead she went with instinct and put her arms around him goodbye she couldnt settle once hed gone the rain was coming in sheets now she could barely see the ocean through it but she could hear the waves crashing she found it soothing the gray light the sound of water it was cool enough to start a fire from the stack of split oak in the woodbox once it was blazing she called the airport to arrange for her luggage to be delivered it occurred to her that it was the first time she was completely alone in the house a house she was considering making her own after brewing tea she wandered through it sipping if she did buy it remodeling would be essential there was a room off the kitchen that could be enlarged for a studio the light was good or was she thought when there was sun there were three bedrooms upstairs all large and lofty an impractical amount of space perhaps but she liked having it she could make it her own thoughtful she glanced at her watch it would be worth a call to the real estate agent before she could pick up the phone it rang emma dad she sat on the arm of the sofa i just wanted to see if youd gotten there everythings fine how are you a little crazed at the moment were recording well be breaking off to come out to the coast dad i told you im fine it really isnt necessary for you to come all this way id like to see you for myself plus were up for three grammys she broke off her objections of course congratulations we figured wed show up in force youll come along wont you id love to i thought you might like to ask michael petes arranging the tickets i will she remembered the way hed looked when hed strapped on his gun he may be busy check it out well be coming in at the end of the week for rehearsals pete got a request for you to be one of the presenters he asked me to pass it along i dont know it would mean a lot to me emma having you make the announcement if johnno and i cop song of the year she smiled and if you dont i can read your names anyway thats the way youll take care of yourself wont you yes and thats something i wanted to speak to you about she shifted the phone to her other ear dad i dont want the bodyguard i fully intend to take care of myself so call him off what bodyguard the one you hired before i left london i didnt hire anyone emma look i she broke off he often hid things from her but he never lied you didnt arrange for someone to follow me look out for me no it didnt occur to me that youd need it has someone been bothering you i can break off earlier and come out no sighing she pressed her fingers to her eyes no ones been bothering me marianne was right its just paranoia i guess i havent gotten used to coming and going as i choose but i intend to to prove it she made her decision quickly tell pete id be delighted to be a presenter at the grammys in fact ill start hunting up a dress tomorrow someone will contact you about the rehearsals keep a night free bev and i would like to take you and michael out to dinner ill ask him hes dad she said on impulse what is it that makes you so comfortable with michael hes steady as a rock and he loves you as much as i do hell make you happy thats all ive ever wanted i know i love you dad ill see you soon maybe it was just that easy she thought as she hung up the phone she had a man who loved her and who could make her happy shed never doubted michaels feelings or her own the doubts came from whether she would be able to give anything back bundling into a slicker she raced into the rain the least she could give michael when he returned was a hot meal she enjoyed pushing the cart up and down the aisles of the market choosing this selecting that by the time she checked out she had three bags loaded drenched she settled back into the car it was only three but she had to turn on her lights to cut the gloom jet lag had set in but the fatigue was almost pleasant and suited to the rain the road was all but deserted other shoppers had planned more carefully or were waiting for the storm to pass perhaps that was why she noticed the car behind her turning where she turned always keeping two lengths behind turning up the radio she struggled to ignore it paranoia she told herself but her eyes kept flicking to the rearview mirror and she could see the twin headlights glowing steadily behind her emma increased her speed a little more than safety allowed on the slick roads the headlights paced her she eased off the gas the trailing car slowed catching her lip between her teeth she swerved into an abrupt left turn her car fishtailed skidded behind her the car swung left then slid across the road fighting for control emma punched the gas and managed to pull her car out of the skid on a burst of speed she turned toward home praying the few moments lead was all she would need she had her fingers around the door handle before she hit the brakes she wanted to get inside to safety whether it was her imagination or not she didnt want to be caught outside and defenseless if the other car cruised up leaving the groceries she sprinted out of the car then screamed when a hand clamped on her arm lady the young driver jumped back and nearly overbalanced into a puddle jeeze get a grip what do you want the rain was dripping off a cap onto a blunt freckled nose she couldnt see his eyes this your house she had her keys balled in her hand emma wondered if she could use them as a weapon why i got three pieces of luggage american flight number from new york for emma mcavoy her luggage emma nearly laughed as she ran a hand over her face im sorry you startled me you were behind me when i left the market and i guess i got spooked ive been waiting here for the last ten minutes he corrected and shoved a clipboard at her want to sign please but she looked over in time to see a car drive slowly toward the house the figure behind the wheel was lost in the sheeting rain and shadows as it cruised down the street im sorry she said again would you mind waiting until i get the groceries in look lady ive got other stops to make she pulled a twenty out of her purse please without waiting for his agreement she went back to her car to unload inside she doublechecked all the locks with the fire the lights the warmth shed all but convinced herself that shed made a mistake when she didnt see the car reappear during the next twenty minutes she was almost sure of it cooking relaxed her she liked the scents she created the low murmur of music as the hour grew later the gray simply deepened there was no twilight just the steady fall of rain at ease again she decided to go upstairs and unpack the sound of a car swishing through the rain outside had panic streaking up her spine again she stood frozen at the base of the stairs staring out the wide dark window it hadnt occurred to her until that moment how exposed she was with all the lights buming she could hear a brake set a door slam she was on the way to the phone when she heard the footsteps in front of the door without hesitating she ran to the fireplace and grabbed the brass poker the knock had her grip tightening she was alone he knew she was alone emma thought frantically because shed been foolish enough to wander through the house with the lights burning and the shades drawn up she inched her way toward the phone she would call for help if it didnt get there in time she would help herself her heart tatooed against her chest as she lifted the receiver emma im drowning out here michael the phone slipped out of her fingers and fell to the floor she let the poker drop as well as she rushed to the door her fingers werent steady as she fumbled with locks she could hear him swearing by the time she pulled open the door and threw her arms around him she was laughing sorry i dont get the joke no im sorry it was just that i but when she drew back she saw something in his eyes she hadnt seen before despair here let me help you youre soaked through she helped him peel off his jacket ive got some tea i wish id thought of brandy but theres probably a bottle of whiskey somewhere she nudged him over by the fire then went into the kitchen moments later she returned with a cup he hadnt moved she noted he just stood there looking down at the flames its a nice irish tea heavy on the irish she handed it to him thanks he sipped grimaced then downed it you should get out of those wet clothes in a minute she started to speak again then changed her mind and went quietly upstairs when she came back she simply took his hand come on im running you a bath he couldnt find the energy to argue do i get bubbles all you want go ahead she gestured toward the door relax ill get you some more tea he pulled off his shirt and let it fall with a wet splat to the floor make it straight irish this time two fingers no ice she hesitated while he unsnapped his pants she had to stop looking for ghosts in bottles as well not everyone who wanted a drink wanted to get drunk all right when she came back the water had stopped running she paused at the door then feeling foolish set the glass on the table by the bed though they were lovers she couldnt see herself waltzing in while he was bathing whether it was a matter of intimacy or privacy she couldnt cross the line she sat on the window seat watched the rain and waited with a towel slung low on his hips he stepped out the light was behind him and she could clearly see the tension and withdrawal in his face i started dinner he nodded but only picked up the glass he thought he could hold the whiskey down food was another matter why dont you go ahead i can wait she wanted to go to him take his hand smooth the lines away from his brow but he was brooding into the glass as if she werent even there rising she walked into the bath to tidy the wet clothes and towels you dont have to pick up after me he was standing in the doorway now an anger deep and raw came through in both his voice and his eyes i dont need a mother i just latimer wanted to be waited on emma its not my style fine her own temper rose up to meet his she let his shirt fall to the floor again pick it up yourself then not everyone likes to live in a sty he snatched up the shirt and hurled it into the tub emma retreated two steps before she could stop herself dont look at me like that he whirled on her furious with her himself with everything dont ever look at me like that i can get pissed off at you without throwing a punch she started to check the venom that burned her tongue but it poured out im not afraid youll hit me no one will ever hit me again and walk away im through being victimized by anyone that includes you if you want to sulk then go ahead and sulk if you want to fight fine ill fight but im going to know what im fighting about if youre acting like this because i wont do what you want be what you want and say what you want then tough shouting isnt going to change my mind he held up a hand before she could storm by not to block her but to ask her to wait the subtle difference was enough to make her hold back the next burst of temper it has nothing to do with you he said quietly nothing at all im sorry i shouldnt have come back here tonight he looked down at his wet clothes look can we throw these in the dryer or something so i can get them back on and get the hell out of here it was there again she noted not just anger but a deep dark despair what is it michael i told you it has nothing to do with you lets sit down back off emma he turned away and walked back into the bedroom hed been wrong he decided as he put the whiskey aside he couldnt keep that down either oh i see you want to be a part of my life but im not to be a part of yours not this part you cant section off pieces of yourself and tuck them away i know she moved to him touched a hand to his arm until that moment she hadnt realized how much she loved him with a kind of wonder it came to her that the need wasnt all hers after all talk to me michael please it was kids he murmured jesus babies he just walked over to the playground at recess and let loose michael had to sit groping his way to the bed he sat on the edge pushing the heels of his hands into his eyes he could still see it what terrified him was that he knew he always would bewildered emma sat beside him rubbing a hand over his shoulder to try to ease the tension from the muscles bunched there i dont understand neither do i we found out who he was hed had a history of mental illness been in and out of institutions all his life turns out he went to that school that same school through first and second grades before they put him away the first time well find out more for what its worth who who are you talking about just a loser some sick pitiful loser who got his hands on a fortyfive automatic and she began to see a sickness welled up to her throat oh my god he drove to the school walked right up to the playground kids were playing ball and jumping rope it hadnt started to rain yet so he opened up six kids are dead twenty more are hospitalized they wont all make it oh michael she put her arms around him rested her cheek against his then he just walked away by the time the black and whites got there he was gone when mccarthy and i drove up but he couldnt describe it not to her not even to himself we got a make on the car and found it a couple of blocks away he was right there eating lunch in the park just sitting on a bench in the tucking park eating a sandwich in the rain he didnt even bother to run when we moved in he picked up the gun and stuck the barrel in his mouth so well never know why well never even know why im sorry she could think of nothing else to say im so sorry were supposed to make a difference goddamnit were supposed to make a difference six kids dead and theres nothing you can do you couldnt stop it and you couldnt fix it all you can do is walk away and try to convince yourself that there was nothing you could do but you dont walk away she murmured thats why you make a difference michael she drew away to study his face you couldnt have stopped this i wont tell you you shouldnt grieve over something you couldnt prevent because that makes you who you are you never get used to it he dropped his brow on hers i used to wonder why my father would come home sometimes and close himself off when he did id hear him and my mother talking after i went to bed for hours you can talk to me he pulled her close she was so warm so soft i need you emma i wasnt going to come back here with this i needed to hold on to something this time you hold on to me she lifted her mouth to his his response was so strong almost desperate that she no longer tried to soothe if he needed to burn out despair in passion she was there for him she took control as she hadnt known she could pulling him down with her letting her hands excite her mouth demand he had always loved her before gently patiently there was no room for that now and no need if his passion was dark hers could equal it if his desire was urgent she would match it this time she would chase away his demons she rolled with him over him dragging the towel aside giving herself the pleasure of driving him feeling his body tremble and heat and tense as she raced over it no hesitation no fears no doubts to pleasure herself as much as him she stroked with fingertips slow circles teasing lines the lamplight glowed over his skin tempting her to taste with quick flicks of her tongue with long strokes of her lips power just discovered rocked through her like thunder he felt himself pulse wherever she touched him though his hands werent idle she shifted away wait she seemed to tell him let me show you let me love you linking her hands with his she slithered down his body her mouth burning frantic arrows of pleasure into his flesh he could hear the patter of rain on the glass feel the sheet heat under his back in the slanted light he saw her long pale hair streaming down her shoulders her eyes dark depthless as they met his rearing up he dragged her close until they were thigh to thigh with the need pumping through him he tugged at buttons wanting to see her desperate to feel her her teeth nipped into his shoulder as he ripped her blouse here was a violence she could understand and relish savage without brutality and the turbulence in him was a storm within her equal interchangeable she found that love and lust could tangle gloriously as he tore at her clothes her lowthroated moan had nothing to do with surrender how could she have known that all of her life she had waited to be wanted this way desperately exclusively heedlessly nor had she known that she had waited to feel this same wild recklessness he wasnt gentle now and she reveled in the furor he wasnt controlled and she pushed him further to the edge when his fingers dug into her hips she knew he wasnt thinking of her as frail and fragile and in need of defending when her name tore from between his lips the need was there for her and only for her she rolled over him arching her back with both triumph and release as she took him into her the first stunning climax ripped through her but didnt weaken it was his hands that slid from her that groped blindly for hers with their fingers linked she set the pace fast and frantic even after she felt him explode inside her she rode him driving him demanding more she brought her mouth back to his insatiable until his lips grew hungry and his breathing shallow her tongue slid along his throat where his pulse began to throb he murmured something dazed and incoherent but she could only moan as she felt him harden inside of her again half mad he reared up gripping her arms in tense fingers covering her mouth with hot crushing kisses then she was beneath him and his body was like a fumace pumping and plunging into hers long and limber her limbs linked around him her eyes were open and on his he could see them begin to glaze watch her lips begin to tremble pleasure rippled through him as he felt her body shudder over a new peak then he saw her lips curve slowly beautifully it was the last thing he saw before passion dragged him under it infuriated emma that she kept looking over her shoulder almost a week had passed since shed settled back into the house on the beachsince michael and conroy had unofficially settled in with her a rehearsal she sometimes thought for the future she was beginning to believe in living with michael sharing her bed and her time with him didnt make her feel trapped it made her feel at long last normal and happy yet no matter how content she was emma couldnt shake the sensation of being watched most of the time she ignored it or tried to telling herself it was just another reporter looking for a new angle another photographer with a long lens looking for an exclusive picture they couldnt touch her or what she was building with michael but she kept the doors locked and conroy close whenever she was alone no matter how often she told herself there was no one there but her own ghosts she kept watching waiting even walking down rodeo drive in bright sunshine she felt the tension in the back of her neck she was more embarrassed than afraid and wished she had called a limo rather than driving herself shed thought she would enjoy looking for just the right outfit trying on both the outrageous and the classic being pampered and cooed over by the clerks but it was only a relief to have it over to tuck the dress box into her car and drive off it was pitiful she told herself this persecution complex emma thought katherine would lift her psychiatrists brow and make interested noises if she told her poor emmas gone off the bend again thinks shes being followed wonders if someones been in the house when she goes out what about those odd noises on the phone must be tapped christ she rubbed a finger against her temple and tried to laugh the next thing shed start doing was checking under the bed at night then shed be in therapy for life well shed chosen la hadnt she before long shed have a personal trainer as well as a therapist shed be worried about her polarity or shed start channeling for a threehundredyearold buddist monk and then she did laugh after she stopped at the auditorium she picked up her camera buddhist monks would have to hold off at least until shed dealt with the business at hand acts and presenters for the awards show would already be inside it would be like the old days she mused watching rehearsals taking pictures it was a satisfying feeling to know that her past and her future had found a way to meld when she stepped from the car blackpool stood blocking her path well well hello again emmy luv it infuriated her that he could still make her cringe without speaking she started to skirt around him he simply shifted trapping her against the car as easily as he had once trapped her in her darkroom smiling he stroked a fingertip down the back of her neck is this any way to treat an old friend get out of my way well have to work on those manners he gripped her braid and tugged hard enough to make her gasp little girls who grow up with money always end up spoiled id have thought your husband would have taught you betterbefore you killed him it wasnt fear she realized as she began to shake it was fury hot glittering ftiry you bastard let go of me i thought we might have a chat just the two of us lets take a ride he kept his hand on her hair pulling her along she swung back bringing her camera case hard into his midsection when he doubled over she stepped back and into someone else without thinking she whirled and nearly caught stevie in the face hang on he threw up a hand before her fist could connect with his nose dont hit me im just a poor recovering addict whos come to play guitar he put a hand on her shoulder gave it a quick squeeze is there a problem here almost carelessly emma glanced back at blackpool hed recovered his wind and was standing fists clenched emma felt a quick surge of pleasure she had taken care of herself and very well no theres no problem turning she walked toward the theater with stevie what was all that about there was still a smile on her face pure satisfaction hes just a bully and youre a regular amazon here i was loping across the lot trying to play white knight you stole my thunder she laughed and kissed his cheek youd have flattened him i dont know hes a lot bigger than i am better all around that you punched him yourself id hate to have gone on the telly with a black eye youd have looked dashing and rakish she slipped an arm around his waist lets not say anything about this to dad bris very handy with his fists id fancy seeing blackpool with a shiner id fancy it myself she murmured at least wait until after the awards i never could resist a pretty face no you couldnt have you convinced katherine to marry you yet shes weakening they could hear one of the rehearsing acts playing before they entered the theater rough unapologetic rock blasted through the walls she stayed in london said she had too many patients to take the time for this but she also stayed behind to see if i could deal with this business on my own he stopped near the rear of the theater just to listen and can you its funny all those years i took drugs because i wanted to feel good there were some things i wanted to forget he thought of sylvie and sighed but mostly because i wanted to feel good they never made me feel good but i kept right on taking them in the past couple of years ive started to realize what life can be like when you face it straight he laughed his shoulders moving restlessly i sound like a bloody public service announcement no you sound like someone whos happy he grinned it was true he was happy more hed begun to believe he deserved to be im still the best he told her as they walked toward the stage only now i can enjoy it she saw her father being interviewed offstage he was happy too she thought johnno was stage right harassing pm who was trying to show off baby pictures to any technician he could collar the group on stage had broken off rehearsing they were young emma noted six smooth young faces under masses of hair who were up for best new group she could feel the nerves from them and she could see with a sense of pride the way they glanced toward her father from time to time would they last so long she imagined them asking themselves would they make so deep a mark would another generation be touched and moved by their music youre right she said to stevie you are the best all of you she didnt think of blackpool again she didnt look over her shoulder for hours she indulged herself taking pictures talking music laughing at old stories it didnt even bother her to make an entrance and stand at the podium reciting her lines to a nearempty theater she sat sipping a lukewarm coke as some of the musicians jammed centerstage on old chuck berry tunes only pm left early anxious to get back to his wife and baby hes getting old johnno decided plopping down beside her to play some blues on a harmonica he glanced back to study the seventeenyearold vocalist who was already an established star christ were all getting old before long youll commit the ultimate insult and make us grandfathers well just push your rocking chair up to a mike she tipped up the bottle youre a nasty one emma i learned from the best chuckling she draped an arm around his shoulders look at it this way there hasnt been anyone else on stage today whos lived through two decades of rockandroll hell youre practically a monument ftuly nasty he decided and cupped the harmonica all this talk about lifetime achievement awards he muttered between chords rock and roll hall of fame they have their nerve dont they she laughed and hugged him johnno youre not really worried about age he scowled and began to blow more blues behind him someone picked up the rhythm on bass see how you like it when youre cruising toward tucking fifty jaggers older he shrugged the drums had fallen in a brush on the snare not good enough he told her and continued to play youre better looking he considered that rue and ive never had a crush on him he grinned never got over me did you never then she spoiled the solemn look with a chuckle she began to sing improvising lyrics as she went ive got those rockandroll blues those old old rocking blues when my hair is gray and you ask me to play i say dont bug me momma my bones theyre aching today i got them rockandroll blues them old man rocking blues she grinned at him did i pass the audition pretty bloody clever arent you like i said i learned from the best while he continued to play she slid off the edge of the stage and framed him in one last shot before i go she snapped changed the angle and snapped again ill call it rock kon she laughed when he called her a nasty name then packed the camera in her case shall i tell you what rock and roll is johnno from someone who doesnt perform but observes he gestured with the harmonics then cupped it again to play softly as he watched her its restless and rude walking back she laid a hand on his knee its daring and defiant its a fist shaken at age its a voice that often screams out questions because the answers are always changing she glanced up to see her father standing behind johnno listening her smile swept over him the very young play it because theyre searching for some way to express their anger or joy their confusion and their dreams once in a while and only once in a while someone comes along who truly understands who has the gift to transfer all those needs and emotions into music when i was three years old i watched youshe looked back up at brianall of you go out on stage i didnt know about things like harmony or rhythms or riffs all i saw was magic i still see it johnno every time i watch the four of you step on stage he toyed with the copper column at her ear then sent it spinning i knew there was a reason we kept you around give us a kiss her lips were curved as they touched his see you tomorrow youre going to knock them dead it was dusk when she walked to her car sometime during the afternoon it had rained again the streets were shiny and the air was cool and misty she didnt want to go home to an empty house michael was working late again when she started the car she turned the radio up loud as she liked it best on aimless drives she would entertain herself for a couple of hours look at houses in the glow of street lights try to decide if she wanted the beach the hills or the canyons relaxed she set the car at a moderate pace and let the music wash over her she didnt check her rearview mirror or notice the car that fell in behind her mchml stood in front of the pegboard in the conference room and studied his lists hed made another connection it was slow work frustrating but each link brought him closer to the end of the chain jane palmer had had many men finding them all could be a lifes work michael thought but it was particularly satisfying when he turned one up whose name was on the list she had used brians money to move out of her dingy little flat and into bigger more comfortable quarters in chelsea where shed lived from to until shed bought the house on kings road for the better part of shed had a flatmate a struggling pub singer named blackpool wasnt it interesting michael thought as he rubbed eyes deaddry with strain that while the mcavoys had been living in the hills of hollywood jane palmer had been playing house with blackpool blackpool who had been at the mcavoys party that night in early december and odd wasnt it just a bit odd that jane hadnt mentioned the connection in her book shed dropped every name that could have made the slightest ring but blackpool an established star by the midseventies didnt rate a footnote because michael concluded neither of them wanted the connection remembered mccarthy stuck his head in the door christ kesselring you still playing with that thing i want some dinner robert blackpool was palmers livein lover from june of to february of well call out the wrath of god michael slapped a file in mccarthys hand i need everything there is to know about blackpool i need red meat ill buy you a steer michael said as he walked back into the squad room you know partner this whole business has ruined your sense of humor and my appetite blackpools a big star he does beer commercials for christs sake youre not going to tie him to a twentyyearold case maybe not but im down to eight names he sat at his desk and pulled out a cigarette somebody stole my damn pepsi ill call a cop mccarthy leaned over mike no fooling around youre pushing this too hard looking out for me mac im your goddamn partner yeah im looking out for you and im looking out for myself if we have to go out on the streets while youre strung out like this youre not going to back me up through a veil of smoke michael studied his partner his voice when he spoke was dangerously soft i know how to do my job it was a tender area mccarthy was well aware of the razzing michael had taken his first years on the force im also your friend and im telling you if you dont ease off for a few hours youre not going to do anybody any good including your lady slowly michael unclenched his fists im getting close i know it its not like it was twenty years ago its like it was yesterday and i was there right there going over every step like your old man yeah he braced his elbows on the desk to scrub his hands over his face im going crazy youre just overcharged kid take a couple hours ease off michael stared down at the papers on his desk ill buy you a steak you help me run the make on blackpool deal he waited while michael shrugged into his jacket why dont you give me a couple other names marilyns on a new kick and were getting nothing but fish this week anyway thanks emma stopped the car and looked at the house through the rising mists she hadnt consciously decided to drive to it years before she had sat in the car with michael and studied the house it had been sunny then she remembered there were lights in the windows though she could see no movement she wondered who lived there now did a child sleep in the room where she had once slept or where darrens crib had stood she hoped so she wanted to think that more than tragedy lived on there had been laughter in the house as well a great deal of it she hoped there was again she supposed johnno had made her think of it when he had talked of growing older most of the time she still saw them as they had been in her own childhood not as men who had lived for nearly a quarter of a century with fame and ambition with success and failure they had all changed perhaps herself most of all she no longer felt like a shadow of the men who had so dominated her life if she was stronger it was because of the effort it had taken to finally see herself as whole rather than as parts of the people shed loved the best she looked through the gloom to the house nestled on the hill and hoped with all her heart she would dream of it that night when she did she would open that door she would stand and look and she would see releasing the brake she started down the narrow road six months before she knew she wouldnt have had the courage to come alone to open herself to all those feelings it was good so good not to be afraid the headlights flashed into her rearview mirror so close so fast they blinded her instinctively she threw a hand up to block the glare drunk and stupid she thought and glanced for a place to pull over and let the car pass when it rammed her from behind her hands clamped automatically on the wheel still the few seconds of shock cost her and had her veering dangerously close to the guardrad dragging the wheel back she heard her tires squeal on the wet pavement her heart jackhammered to her throat as she slid sideways around the next turn asmhole with a trembling hand she wiped a smear of blood from her lip where shed bitten it then the lights were blinding her again and the impact of the next hit had her seat belt snapping against her breastbone there was no time to think no room for panic her rear fender slapped against the metal guard as her car shimmied the car behind backed off as she fought her own out of a skid she saw the tree a big leafy oak and used every ounce of strength to jerk the wheel to the right panting she concentrated on maneuvering around an s turn pumping her brakes to slow her speed he came again she caught a glimpse of the car bumed the image into her brain before the lights glared against her mirror again though braced for the impact she cried out he wasnt drunk and he wasnt stupid in one part of her mind the terror screamed out someone was trying to kill her it wasnt her imagination it wasnt leftover fears it was happening she could see the lights hear the crunch of metal against metal feel her tires skid as they fought for traction the car came up on her left punching hers toward the drop she was screaming she could hear herself as she laid on the gas and tore around the next turn she wouldnt outrun him emma blinked the glaze out of her eyes and tried to think his car was bigger and faster and the hunter always had the advantage over the hunted the road cut through the hills gave her no room to maneuver and there was no place to go but down he pulled up again she could see the dark shape of the car creeping closer and closer like a spider toward a victim in the web she shook her head knowing at any moment he would ram her and send her crashing over the edge in desperation she jerked her car to the left surprising him by taking the offensive it gave her an instant hardly more but even as he approached again she saw the headlights gleam from the other direction on a prayer she took her last chance and poured on the speed the oncoming car swerved brakes high and shrill horn blasting she caught a glimpse of the car behind her veering back to the right at a dangerous speed for a second she was alone around the next turn then she heard the crash it echoed with her own screams as she hurtled down the winding road toward the lights of la mccarthy md been rjght not only did michael feel better after a meal and an hours break but he thought more clearly as a secondgeneration cop he had not only his contacts to call on but his fathers he made a call to lous poker buddy who worked in immigration to his own contact in the motor vehicle administration used his fathers name with the fbi and his own with inspector carlson in london no one was particularly pleased to be called on after hours but the meal had made it easier for him to use charm i know its irregular inspector and im sorry to bother h lord i totally forgot the time difference i am really sorry yes well i need some information background stuff robert blackpool yeah that blackpool i want to know who he was before inspector i should be able to connect the dots after that he made a note to himself to contact pete page everything you can find i dont know if ive got anything but youll be the first he broke off when he saw emma running in glassyeyed with a trickle of blood on her temple please she collapsed into the chair in front of his desk someones trying to kill me he cut inspector carlson off without a word what happened he was beside her taking her face in his hands on a road up in the hills a car tried to run me down were you hit he began to search frantically for broken bones she heard other voices they were crowding around her a phone was ringing ringing ringing she saw the lights revolve the room followed it before she slid out of the chair there was a cloth against her head cool she moaned reaching a hand to it as she opened her eyes youre okay michael told her you just passed out for a minute drink a little of this its only water she sipped letting her head rest against his supporting arm she could smell himher soap his sweat she was safe again somehow she was safe again i want to sit up okay take it easy she stared around waiting to settle she was in an office his fathers office she thought shed seen it when shed stopped by earlier in the week wanting to see where michael worked it was very plain brown carpet glass walls the blinds were closed now his desk was ordered there was a picture of his wife on it michaels mother looking beyond she saw another man thin balding im sorry youre michaels partner mccarthy i met you a few days ago he nodded she might have been concussed but she was lucid emma michael touched her cheek to make her look at him tell us what happened i thought i was imagining it what that someone was after me could i have that water sure because her hands were shaking he closed his over them on the cup who was after you i dont know before i left london i maybe it was my imagination tell me i thought someone was following me she glanced over at mccarthy waiting to see the doubt or the amusement he only sat on the edge of the captains desk and listened i was almost sure of it after so many years with bodyguards you just know i cant explain it you dont have to michael told her go on she looked at him and wanted to weep because he meant it she would never have to explain to him while i was in new york i saw someone watching the loft i was sure dad had hired someone to look out for me but when i asked him he said he hadnt so i decided id been wrong the first night i was back a car followed me home from the market you never mentioned it i was going to but she trailed off again you were upset when you got back and then i more or less forgot about it i didnt like thinking i was going crazy i would think someone had been in the house when id go out that the phone was making noises like it was tapped she closed her eyes typical paranoid behavior dont be stupid emma she nearly smiled he never let her feel sorry for herself for long i cant prove it had anything to do with tonight but i feel it can you talk about it now hed given her time now her hands were steadier and the glassy look had faded yeah taking a deep breath she related everything that she could remember about the incident on the road i just kept going she finished i dont know if anyone was hurt that other car i didnt even think about it until i was nearly here i just kept going you did the right thing check out her car he asked mccarthy emma did you get a look at the driver no at the car yes calm again she nodded i made a point of looking of trying to pick out whatever details i could it was darkblue or black t cant be sure i dont know much about makes and models but it was goodsized not a small car like mine it could have been a cadillac i think or a lincoln it had la plates mbe i think those were the letters but in the mist i couldnt catch the last numbers you did great he kissed her im going to have someone drive you to the hospital i dont need the hospital he traced a fingertip over her temple youve got a majorleague bump on your head i didnt even feel it though she could now with more clarity than was comfortable she stood firm i wont go michael ive had enough of hospitals to last me a lifetime all right well get someone to take you home and stay with you cant you ive got to check this out he began then glanced up when mccarthy came back in you must be a hell of a driver miss mcavoy emma she said i was too scared to be a bad one mike i need you a minute just sit i wont be long he told emma as he rose recognizing the took on his partners face he shut the door behind him well i dont know how the hell she managed to get through it in one piece car looks like she took third place in the demolition derby casually he laid a hand on michaels arm he didnt think his partner was quite ready to take a look at it himself i had one of the guys check the hospitals before i took a look at her car they just got an admission car wreck up in the hills cut the guy out of a brandnew cadillac blackpool he said and watched michaels eyes narrow hes in a coma are you sure youre up to this johnno took a careful study of emma as she came to the bottom of the stairs dont i look up to it she did a slow models pivot the deep blue dress left her shoulders bare and dipped low at the back before it slid down her body sparkling with hundreds of bugle beads her hair was scooped up in intricate tiny waves and clipped with two glittery combs on the lapel of the silver jacket she carried was pinned the phoenix he had given her id best not comment what you look up to still he crossed to her to stroke a thumb over the bruise on her temple which shed camouflaged with makeup you had a rough time a couple days ago but its over she walked to the table to pour him a glass of wine after a moments hesitation she poured another for herself blackpool cant harm me from a hospital bed she offered johnno a glass i know michael believes he was involved with darrens murder and i certainly wont rule him out but until he comes out of the comaif he comes outwe wont be sure ive tried to picture him in darrens room that night but i just cant remember there was someone else there he reminded her isnt that why i have the hottest escort in town for the awards tonight he grinned over the rim of his glass i doubt if i make up for michael she set down the glass barely touched and picked up her evening bag you dont have to make up for anyone and hell get there if he can ready as ill ever be he offered his arm formally and led her outside to the waiting limo dont try that shy retiring stuff on me i happen to know that no one loves the spotlight better it was true enough he settled back against the cushy seat enjoying the scent of leather and fresh flowers but he worried i thought i knew the bastard he said half to himself i didnt like him particularly but i figured i knew him one of the biggest pissers is i helped write his first hit its a bit foolish to beat yourself up over that now if he had anything to do with darren with a shake of his head he pulled out a cigarette that should keep the tabloids going for years well deal with it she laid a hand over his its all going to come out anyway janes part in it and blackpools well just have to learn to live with it its rough on bri like going through it a second time hes stronger now she fingered the pin on her jacket i guess we all are he brought her hand to his lips you know if you threw michael over i might just might consider changing my style she laughed then picked up the phone as it began to ring hello michael johnno sat back and watched her smile spread yes im sitting here thinking over a proposal from an incredibly attractive man no johnno she put a hand over the receiver michael wants you to know hes got an in with the department of motor vehicles and can make your life a living hell ill take the bus johnno decided yes were due at the theater at four the early award ceremonies should have already started im sorry i cant be there michael told her he glanced down the hospital corridor toward icu if things change here ill meet you dont worry about it easy for you to say i miss my chance to ride in a limo and rub elbows with the rich and famous if you mained me i could do it once a week all right he caught a glimpse of a doctor coming down the corridor all right what ill marry you he ran a hand through his hair and shifted the phone excuse me she grinned foolishly at johnno and squeezed his hand have we got a bad connection no i shit hold on he put a hand over the speaker to listen to the doctor ive got to go emma hes coming out of it listen dont forget where we left off okay no i wont she hung up just as johnno popped the cork on the champagne do i get invited this time hmmm oh yes yes a little dazed herself she stared at the glass he handed her it was so easy its supposed to be when its right feeling a bit misty he touched his rim to hers hes the luckiest man i know we can make it work she sipped letting the wine explode on her tongue we will make it work dreamily she settled back and didnt give a thought to blackpool micfl thought of him he stood at the foot of the bed and studied the man who had tried to kill emma he hadnt come out of it well his face was ruined if he made it he would need a series of operations to reconstruct it his survival didnt look promising with the internal damage hed suffered in the crash michael didnt give a damn whether he lived or died he only wanted five minutes he had the background report on blackpool it was still sketchy but it told him enough the man swimming toward consciousness in icu had been born terrance peters as a juvenile hed racked up a record of petty theft vandalism possession hed graduated to assault usually on women dealing and larceny before hed changed his name and tried his hand at singing in clubs hed let london swallow him and though hed been under suspicion for a handftil of robberies hed always slid his way out his luck had turned when hed hooked up with jane palmer for the worse as it turned out michael thought its taken twenty years you sonofabitch but weve got you he wont be in any shape to talk the doctor pointed out he needs to stabilize ill keep it brief i cant leave you alone with him fine we can always use a witness he stepped to the side of the bed blackpool he watched the eyes flutter still then flutter again blackpool i want to talk to you about darren mcavoy blackpool dragged his eyes open again his vision wavered and pain icepicked into his head you a cop thats right fuck off im in pain ill bring you a getwell card you took a bad ride pal its touch and go i want a doctor im dr west mr blackpool youre get this bastard out of my face ignoring him michael leaned closer its a good time to clean out your conscience i havent got one he tried to laugh and ended up gasping then maybe youd like to stick it to someone else we know about you how you screwed up the boys kidnapping she remembered when michael didnt respond he shut his eyes even through the pain he could feel hate and fury it figures the bitch would remember me and not him supposed to be a nice smooth job he told me take the kid pick up the ransom he didnt even want the money then when it was all ticked he just walked away told me to clean it up like that guy in the kitchen who was ordering pizzas all i had to do was whack him and keep cool and id have everything i wanted who michael demanded who was with you gave me ten thousand pounds anyway nowhere close to the million we were going to ask for the kid but a nice tidy sum just had to keep cool and let him handle it the kid was dead and the girl didnt remember tkaumatized he called it little emma was too traumatized to remember nobody would ever know and he was going to see i made it to the top on mcavoys coattails he laughed again and fought for breath youll have to leave now detective michael shook the doctor off a name goddammit give me a name who set it up blackpool opened his eyes again they were red and watery and still malicious go to hell youre going to die for this michael said between his teeth either here in this bed or breathing in a lungful of poison gas nice and legal but youre going to die you can go alone or you can take him with you youll take him down personally with a smile blackpool closed his eyes again it was page pete page tell him ill see him in hell emma watched grips raise and lower the sliding doors at the rear of the stage in a few hours she realized she would walk through the one on the right and go to the microphone im nervous she told bev its silly all i have to do is stand there and read the cue cards and hand out the awards hopefully to your father and johnno lets go into the dressing room theyre too busy to use it dont you want to go out front emma glanced at her watch theyll be starting in ten minutes not yet whoops sorry annabelle emma cursed herself for not having brought her camera it was quite a sight lady annabelle tucked into hot pink silk that dripped with sequins changing a diaper dont worry hes nearly decent she picked young samuel ferguson up to cuddle we just nipped in here for a quick feed and change i couldnt leave him with the nanny it didnt seem fair that he should miss his papas big night emma looked at the babys sleepy eyes i dont think hes going to make it just needs a little nap she nuzzled again then laid him on the sofa would you mind standing guard for a few minutes i need to find pm you could twist our arms bev murmured bending down to stroke the babys head i wont be more than ten minutes annabelle hesitated at the door are you sure if he wakes up well entertain him bev promised after one last look annabelle shut the door quietly behind her who would have imagined the ditsy lady annabelle as a devoted mother emma mused babies change you bev sat on the arm of the sofa watching samuel sleep ive been wanting to talk to you alone automatically emma lifted a hand to the bruise on her temple theres nothing to worry about noting the gesture bev nodded i wanted to touch on that as well but theres something else im not sure how youll feel about it one deep breath and she plunged brian and i are going to have another baby emma stared lips parted in surprise a baby i know it surprised us too though we have been trying she lifted a hand to her hair after all this timei suppose its crazy im almost fortytwo a baby emma repeated not to replace darren bev said quickly nothing could and it isnt that we dont love you as much as its possible to love a daughter but a baby with a laugh emma dragged bev up and hugged her oh im so glad im so happy for you for me for all of us when near the end of summer she pulled back to study emmas face what she saw had tears rushing to her eyes we were afraid you might be upset upset emma brushed the back of her hand over her own cheeks why would i be upset it brings back memories brian and i have had to deal with ours i didnt think i would want another child but emma i want this one so badly i want it so much for me for bri buti know how much you loved darren we all loved him as she had more than twenty years ago she laid a hand on bevs stomach i already love this one hes going to be beautiful and strong and safe as she finished speaking the lights went out the instant fear clicked in making her grope for bevs hand its all right bev said theyll have it fixed in a minute im right here im okay she was going to beat this too she told herself this hideous hateful fear of the dark maybe its just the backstage lights ill go see whats going on ill go with you no she took a step toward the door she could barely see the outline of it only a shadow in the dark a rustling noise had her jolting the baby was stirring she told herself as her mouth went dry there were no monsters and she wasnt afraid of the dark she found the knob but instead of relief she was struck by a wild unreasonable fear she could see herself opening it opening it and looking in the baby was crying dizzy she tried to understand if it was the baby behind her or the one in her mind instinctively she snatched her hand away she wasnt to open it she didnt want to see inside her head the echo of her heart pounded like a musical rhythm an old songmne she couldnt forget not a dream emma reminded herself she was wide awake and she had waited most of her life to see what was behind the door with rigid fingers she opened the door in reality and in her mind and she knew oh my god emma bev soothing the baby on her shoulder reached out what is it it was pete what is pete in the hall he was in daffens room bevs fingers closed over emmas arm what are you saying he was in daffens room that night when i opened the door he turned and looked at me someone else was holding daffen making him cry i didnt know him pete smiled at me but he was angry i ran away the baby was crying its samuel bev murmured its not daffen emma come sit down it was pete on a moan she pressed her hands to her face i saw him id hoped you wouldnt remember when she lowered her hands she saw him standing in the doorway he held a flashlight in one hand and in the other a gun clutching the baby bev stared at the shadow of the man in the doorway i dont understand this whats going on emmas overwrought pete spoke quietly his eyes on emmas youd better come with me not again emma told herself it wouldnt happen again before she could think she hurled herself at him the flashlight popped out of his hand sending the beam in crazy arches over the walls and ceiling run she screamed to bev as she struggled to get up and away take the baby and run get someone hell kill him she shouted kicking out as pete grabbed for her dont let him kill another baby get dad with the baby wailing bev fled toward the confusion on stage its too late emma said when pete hauled her to her feet theyll catch you theyll be here any second already spotlights were glowing on stage shouts and running feet closed in desperate he dragged her onward emma stopped struggling when she felt the barrel of the gun under her jaw they know its you she didnt see me he muttered it was dark she cant be sure he had to believe thathad to or it was all over she knows emma winced when he dragged her up a flight of stairs everyone knows now theyre coming pete its finished no it couldnt be hed worked too hard planned too carefully i say when its finished i know what to do i can fix it they were above and behind the stage now far below she could see the lights and confusion taking her hair he wrapped it tight around his wrist if you scream ill shoot you he needed to think confused he continued to drag her along she stumbled and as he pulled her up she yanked the pin from her jacket and let it drop seizing a chance he shoved her into a freight elevator it was time time that he needed it was supposed to have been so easy in the dark while everyone was confused he should have been able to get to her he still had the pills in his pocket he had planned to force her to take it would have been easy smooth quiet but nothing had gone easily just like the first time why sick with vertigo emma sunk to the floor why did you do that to darren sweat was running off him drenching his crisp linen shirt he wasnt supposed to be hurt no one was it was just a publicity stunt she shook her head to clear it what your mother gave me the idea he looked down at her he doubted shed give him much trouble she was white as a sheet shed always had trouble on planes elevators with heights he glanced at the buttons on the panel why hadnt he thought of it before the opening act would be starting the show must go on he thought illusion was the first order of the day while millions of people around the country were watching the record industry pat itself on the back a few confused guards were looking for emma backstage up here he had time to think and to plan she felt the elevator shudder and bump to a halt what are you talking about janeshe was always pressuring for more money threatening to go to the press with this story or that story she worried me at first until i began to see that the publicity about you equaled a boom in record sales he pulled her up she was limp with nausea and clammy with icy sweat so much the better with his arm around her neck he dragged her up another flight of stairs she had to keep him talking emma bit back the sickness and the fear bev had gotten away and the baby someone would come looking for her he didnt worry about her screaming now she could yell her lungs out and no one would hear shoving open a door he pushed her out on the root the wind slapped across her face tore at her hair and cleared her head we were talking about darren she kept her eyes on his as she backed away the sun was still bright one part of her mind wondered how it could be day when shed been in the dark for so long i need to know why she backed into the low wall then swayed at the dizzying view below clenching her teeth she looked back at him tell me why you were in darrens room he could afford to indulge her and himself hed nearly lost control for a moment but he could feel himself leveling now hed find a way out everything was fine for a while then it started to flatten out we were having some internal troubles with the group as well they needed something to shake them up jane came to me with blackpool she wanted me to make him a star a bigger star than brian and she wanted a cut she got drunk he waved his hand in any case she offered me a solution we planned to kidnap darren the press would eat it up a lot of sympathy a lot of sales the band would pull together blackpool and jane could keep the money and everyone would be happy she wasnt worried about the height any longer or about the gun with the wind in her hair and the sun dropping lower at her back she stared at him youre telling me my brother was killed to sell records it was an accident blackpool was clumsy you came in it was a poor set of circumstances a poor set she did scream then loud and long as she struck out at him backstage of the auditorium was in chaos when michael rushed in in the audience a cheer rose up as another winner was announced where is she he took her bev was clinging to brians arm she was still out of breath from her race down the hall with the baby he had a gun she held him off so i could get the baby away and find help pete she said still dazed it was pete it hasnt been more than a couple minutes brian told him securitys already after him get this building blocked off michael shouted to mccarthy call for more backup we need a floorbyfloor search which way drawing his weapon he headed down the corridor he flashed his badge to a uniformed guard this floor secured he didnt come out on stage with or without her we figure he took her up i want two men back to the wall michael started up the stairs he could hear the music pumping from behind him as he climbed it took on a hollow echoing tone his palms were wet making the first turn he checked his grip then swept the area with his weapon at the clatter on the stairs he whirled and swore when he saw the four men grouped together get back downstairs shes ours too brian said i havent got time to argue bending michael retrieved the phoenix pin a swatch of silvery material caught in the clasp is this emmas she was wearing it tonight johnno told him i gave it to her michael stared at the elevator then slipped the pin into his pocket shes using her head he murmured seal off this area he shouted to the security guards and keep up the floorbyfloor he punched the button on the elevator and watched the numbers light up above the door tbll mccarthy he took her all the way up listening to the rumble of the elevator he began to pray were going with you brian said this is police business its personal brian corrected its always been personal if he hurts her im going to kill him myself michael shot a grim look at the four men behind him youll have to get in line pete shoved emma back sending her sprawling while he tried to catch his breath thats not going to do any good i dont want to hurt you any more than i must emma he was a baby she pushed herself up you bought him a silver cup after he was born with his name on it for his first birthday you rented a pony for his party i was fond of him you murdered him i never laid a hand on him blackpool got too rough panicked i never wanted to hurt that boy she dragged her windtossed hair out of her face you just wanted to use him to use him and my fathers fear and pain for some bloody publicity oh i can see it she added brian mcavoys son stolen from his crib rock star pays a kings ransom for safe return of beloved child thats what you had in mind didnt you lots of print lots of film at eleven reporters crammed on the front yard waiting for a statement from the terrified parents then more of the same when the baby was returned to loving arms but he was never returned was he what happened was tragic dont talk to me about tragedy tbo anguished to be afraid she turned away the gun was trained on her she knew it it didnt seem to matter after all these years she remembered and it left her hollow but worse much worse was to know it had been for nothing you were there at his ftineral with the rest of us your eyes down your face solemn all the while you were getting just what you wanted a boy had to die unfortunately but you got your press didnt you she turned back you sold your bloody records ive devoted nearly half my life to them pete took a long calming breath i shaped and i molded i made deals listened to their problems solved them who do you think made sure they got everything that was coming to them who made certain that the record company didnt play any games with royalties who fought so that they would reach the top she took a step toward him there was enough of a need to survive to stop her when he motioned with the gun do you think they needed you she spat out do you really believe that you mattered i made them no they made you saying nothing he reached in his pocket be that as it may even what happens tonight will add to the legend brian and johnno are oddson favorites for song of the year with a bit of luck the group will pick up a couple more for best performance rock and best album id thought it a nice touch for you to hand out the award brians daughter and the tragic widow of drew latimer tragedies sell he said with a shrug well have one more tonight he held out two pills take these theyre very strong itll make it easier she looked down at them then back into his face i wont make it easier very well he put them back in his pocket its a very long fall emma he grabbed her holding her against him at the edge by the time you hit ill be on my way down he had it worked out now calm and precise i came to see if you were all right when the lights went out but you went wild i chased you up here concerned you were hysterical and i was too late to save you all these years and you still blamed yourself for your brothers death you finally couldnt live with it anymore he forced her around to face the fall one of her combs came loose and spun off into empty space no one knows but you and no one but you will ever know she clawed at him fighting her way back from the edge her strength threw him off balance and for an instant she was free then he clamped an arm around her waist and began to heave she lost her footing teetered then threw her weight back against him screaming she saw the sky and ground revolve michael broke through the door at a run he shouted but neither of the two locked in a lifeanddeath struggle heard he saw pete raise his gun and fired his own the wall caught emma at the waist stealing her breath hands grabbed at her dragged at her until half her body tilted over the edge dazed she saw petes face below her his eyes wide and terrified the fingers on her wrist slipped and released then he was falling falling momentum had her sliding toward him hands were dragging her back pulling her away from the wall her feet left the floor again but there were arms around her squeezing holding her safe and close through the ringing in her ears she heard her name repeated over and over michael she didnt have to look but let her head drop on his shoulder michael dont let go i wont i remembered she began to sob then through the tears she saw her father standing beside her dad i remembered she reached out for him emma watched me rames from the fire stevie had built in the hearth he stood beside it hands in his pockets saying nothing they had all come home with her her father pm and his family johnno bev made endless pots of tea though no one spoke she sensed the shock was wearing off into bewilderment there were questions that could never be answered mistakes that could never be rectified regrets that would never completely disappear but they had survived emma thought the odds had been against them individually and as a group but they had survived even triumphed rising she walked out to the terrace where brian was alone watching the sea he would suffer emma thought it was his nature to pull problems into his heart and mourn whether they were his or the worlds then somehow he would turn them into something to be played on guitar or keyboard with flute and violin moving to him she rested her head on his shoulder he was one of us brian said after a moment hed been with us since the beginning i know when i saw him with his hands on you i wanted to kill him myself and now he watched the play of the early moon on the water i can hardly believe it all happened why he turned taking her into his arms for gods sake why did he do it she pressed hard against him listening to the ebb and flow of the sea how could she tell him if he knew the reasons he would never be able to make music again i dont know we could ask ourselves forever but it wouldnt change she drew back dad we have to set it aside not forget but set it aside a new beginning god no she smiled i wouldnt want to begin again not for anything finally i know where i am and where i want to go i dont have to be afraid anymore i dont have to wonder and i can stop blaming myself because i didnt run this time you were never to blame emma none of us were come inside she drew him into the light and the warmth in the silence she walked to the television and switched it on i want to hear them say your name as she watched the set pm touched her arm emma unable to find the words he brought her hand to his cheek here we go mates johnno laid a hand on brians shoulder as the nominees for song of the year were announced emma held her breath then let it out on a laugh when she heard brian mcavoy and johnno donovan congratulations she swung her arms around both of them oh i wish i could have handed it to you next year johnno said giving her a quick hard kiss its a promise its important she said squeezing brians hand it means something dont let what happened spoil this for you or for me no he relaxed and when he smiled she watched it reach his eyes he threw an arm around johnnos shoulder not bad for a couple of aging rockers mind your adjectives bri johnno winked at emma jaggers older he lifted a brow when he heard the knock on the door ah the call of the grayeyed infatuated copper shut up johnno emma said pleasantly as she hurried to answer with conroy at her heels michael sorry it took so long he dragged on the dogs collar to keep him from leaping okay sure she leaned down the beads of her evening dress glinting to rub between conroys ears we were just passing out congratulations dad and johnno won song of the year no we were just leaving bev was already picking up her wrap if ever shed seen a man who wanted to be alone with a woman it was michael theres a pot of tea in the kitchen she added flicking a glance over her shoulder to get the others moving before emma could protest she pulled her close times too precious to waste she murmured michael she put her arms around him thank you she said quietly and pulling back smiled welcome to chaos they made their way out one at a time while a disinterested conroy sniffed around then went to sleep in the corner theyre quite a group michael stated when the door finally closed no pun intended yes they are youre not going to mind having dinner with the lot of them tomorrow are you no he didnt give a hang about tomorrow only tonight the way she looked the way she smelled the way she smiled at him come here he held out his arms when she was in them he found he couldnt let go in the hours that had passed hed thought hed calmed himself but now holding her it all crashed down on him hed almost lost her she could feel his rage building degree by degree dont she murmured its over its really over this time just shut up a minute he brought his mouth to hers hard as if to convince himself she was whole and safe and his if he had he didnt she lifted both hands to his face you saved my life yeah he backed away digging his hands into his pockets if you have to be grateful could you get it over with fast she tilted her head we havent had much of a chance to talk im sorry i couldnt come back with you i understand maybe it worked out for the best gave us both a chance to settle i havent been able to pull that off yet he could still see her teetering on the edge of the root wanting to block the image he turned to pace the room so how was your day she grinned it was going to be all right it was going to be just fine dandy yours he shrugged kept moving picking up little odds and ends and setting them down again emma i know youre probably tired no im not and the timing sucks no she smiled again it doesnt he turned back she looked so beautiful the dress shimmering down the light from the fire catching in her hair glowing on her skin i love you ive always loved you we havent had a lot of time to let things just happen id like to say that im ready to give you that time he picked up a crystal butterfly then set it down im not michael if i wanted time id take it she stepped toward him what i want is you after a long breath he took a small box out of his pocket i bought this months ago id wanted to give it to you for christmas but i didnt think youd take it then id figured on being traditional having a candlelight dinner music the works with a halflaugh he turned the box over in his hand i guess its a little late to start being traditional now are you going to give it to me with a nod he held it out id like to say something before i open it carefully she studied his face every inch every angle if this had happened five or six years ago i wouldnt have appreciated it or you the way i can tonight her hands werent steady she let out a frustrated breath as she fumbled with the lid oh michael its lovely she looked up from the ring absolutely lovely be damn sure he told her you take it and thats it she strangled on a laugh thats the most romantic proposal a woman could possibly dream of ive already asked you too many times he cupped the back of her head in his hand hows this the kiss was soft gentle and promising no ones ever going to love you more than i do i only want a lifetime to prove it thats good she blinked back a film of tears thats very good taking the ring from the box she studied it why three circles she asked running a fingertip around the trio of linked diamond spheres ones your life ones mine he took it from her and slipped it onto her finger and ones the life well make together weve been connected for a long time she nodded then looking up reached out to him i want to start on that third circle michael right away about the author nora roberts was the first writer to be inducted into the romance
