companion dug was exasperated forget it ed im not interested in any silly computer game they all claim to be so easy to play and so exciting and every one of them has a squintillion stupid things you have to do just to get started and then the games are just awkward figures on painted backdrops and you have the mayi syndrome the whatr you know no matter what you do you get an error message and you have to start over because you forgot to say may i or something just as idiotic before you did it computers are great at that they figure youre supposed to know everything before you start and theyre going to make you do it over and over until you finally figure out what they want by which time youre sick of it all i dont want to waste my time but his friend edsel had the annoying fault of being too persistent til bet i can find you a game youll really like no mayi syndrome no dull backdrops real adven piers anthony ture something youll get into easy and never want to leave and ill bet you cant there is no such game because real people dont program them just computer scientists who lost touch with reality decades ago its a bet ed said immediately whatre the stakes dug refused to take it seriously my girlfriend against your motorcycle done i always liked your girlfriend anyway give me a week to get the game in and you can kiss her goodbye meanwhile hey i wasnt really dug protested but edsel was gone oh well it wasnt as if there was any real risk dug wouldnt take his friends motorcycle anyway now it was time to get into his homework so he called pia instead hey i just made a bet with ed the stakes are you against his motorcycle she laughed you better hope you lose because that cycle needs work i know i wont really take it but hell really take me if you lose he likes me suddenly dug was nervous you mean ifyoudt a bets a bet dug you have to make good on it you know that she hung up shaken he stared at his unopened books she had hardly seemed surprised and not at all annoyed had he been set up it didnt take a week edsel had the game saturday morning you crank this into your computer and call me when youre sick of it if you dont call in an hour im calling pia for a date because ill know i won arent you going to stay and help me get the thing loaded you know its going to take time just to nan the bet is that you can do it yourself with no hassle and youll really like it so if im right you wont need me at all or care that im not around if im wrong youll be on the phone within an hour to let me know demons dont dream half hour more likely dug said grimly whatever so try it and find out ed departed he seemed so sure of himself but dug had never met a computer program he liked other than the one that blanked the screen after five minutes and he seriously doubted that he would like this one but if it was easyloading hed give it a fair try and still be on time with the phone call he looked at the package as he went upstairs to his room companions of xanth this appeared to be a silly fantasy setting exactly the kind dug didnt much tike how could ed think hed go for this even if it wasnt too hard to get going then he looked again there was a picture of a young woman of truly comely face and figure in an outfit resembling the sinuous contours of a serpent wouldnt it be something to meet a creature like that maybe she was the inducement they figured that some poor sap like him would buy the game in the hope that she was in it if she was it would be only as an animated flat picture a ripoff in spirit if not in technicality he settled himself by his computer table and turned the system on while it wanned up and went through its ritual initial checks and balances he opened the package there were no instructions just a disk there wasnt even the usual warning note forbidding anyone to copy it just the words insert disktype axanthtouch enter he had to admit that was simple he inserted the disk typed the mysterious word and touched enter there was a momentary swirl on the screen then a little man appeared almost a cartoon figure the figure looked at dug and spoke his words ap peared in type in a speech balloon above his head hi im grundy golem im from the land of xanth and i speak your language im your temporary companion if you dont like me you can get rid of me in just a minute but first listen a bit okay because im here to take your hand and lead you through the preliminaries without con fusion any questions you have you just ask me you do piers anthony that by touching the q key or clicking the right side on your mouse so go aheadask why not dug touched q there was a ding a huge human finger appeared and nudged gnmdy on the shoulder so hard that he stumbled to the side hey not so hard dug had to smile okay so you have a question you have one of those primitive mundane keyboards right so you have two ways to do it you can type the question so i can see it or you can touch enter and it will bring up me list of the ten most common questions at this stage then you can use your arrow keys to highlight the question you want and touch enter again or just shortcut it by typing the number of the question you want ill wait while you decide if you want me to resume without waiting touch escape grundy took a step back twiddling his tiny thumbs dug found himself intrigued despite his cynicism he touched enter grundy reached down and caught hold of a bit of string at the bottom of the screen he pulled it up and a scroll of print unrolled there were numbered questions how do i get out of this crazy game how can i shortcut to the action who is that creature on the cover can i get my money back if i quit now how do i get a better companion how do i save my place so i can take a pee break and pick up where i left off what makes you think this game is so great can a friend play too whats the prize for winning demons dont dream o how many printed questions are there and can i call them up anytime dug smiled it seemed they had had some player input he touched which he took to be he realized mat it couldnt be listed as because when a player touched the it would take him to without giving him a chance to complete the number that was one of the things computers did pretending not to know what the player really wanted the question highlighted grundy came to life there are a hundred questions hi this edition of the companions of xanth game and mere may be more in future editions as we get more player feedback you can call up the list anytime by touching help and paging down for twodigit numbers you can hold down the first number while you touch the second and both digits will register but its probably easier just to ask me it probably was but dug decided to play with the list a bit more the questions were still on the scroll so he touched grundy animated again to quit this game touch alt escape and turn off the set but i hope you dont quit yet you havent given us a fair chance we hardly know you they hardly knew him as if they were real and he was a mockedup player that seemed arrogant but also intriguing dug touched to shortcut directly to the action touch shift escape but i strongly advise against this because meres more you have to do like checking in and youll be stuck with me as your companion once you know the ropes you can skip this whole scene but please dont do it this time fair enough so far mere had been no confusion and he had not yet gotten into the game proper he could skip ahead and look at it but it made sense to give the golem his chance he touched piers anthony that creature on the cover is nada naga xanths most luscious eligible princess she is one of the available companions grundy cocked an eye at him maybe its time you asked about companions if that isnt clear yet so dug typed what about companions im so glad you asked about companions grundy said that is of course the name of this game and the main thing that distinguishes it from others in this game you are never left to flounder helplessly guessing at the procedures you have a companion to guide you through anything you need to know you can ask your companion and if he doesnt know the answer hell give you a responsive guess he will also warn you when you are going wrong and in general be a true friend to you you can trust your companion absolutelyexcept for one thing touch y or enter if you want to know about that one thing dug was tempted to touch the escape key instead but was hooked so he touched enter that is smart of you grundy said you see your companion is your truest friend ordinarily but there is one chance in seven that he will be a false companion that one will pretend to be your friend but will lead you into mischief and doom so if you get that one you must be wary and not take his bad advice unfortunately there is no obvious way to tell a fair companion from a false companion because they look and act the sameuntil some key point in the game when the false companion will betray you you must judge only by assessing the quality of the advice you are given and recognizing bad advice if you are able to identify your false companion you can not exchange him for another once you choose your companion you are stuck with him throughout the game you can ask him to go away but then you will be alone in the game without guidance and are likely to get eaten by a dragon or suffer some worse fate it is better to keep him with you but to be wary of him it is possible demons dont dream to win the game with a false companion just a lot more difficult the golem paused so dug typed in a related query suppose i just quit the game and come back new if you try to leave the game and return so as to get a new companion you will find that the layout of the game has changed so that not only are you not certain whether your new companion is true or false you are not sure whether paths which were safe before remain so if you are well along in the game it is better just to continue but it is your choice of course this warning rather than turning dug off intrigued him so he could never quite trust his companion that promised a special thrill of excitement that would not have been there otherwise he looked at the listed questions and touched the prize for winning the game which is not easy to do is to receive a magic talent which will be yours in any future games you play we do not know what that talent is but it will surely be a good one that will be a great advantage for you sort of like getting a free pass to another game dug shrugged he didnt care much about fantasy anyway so his wasnt much of an inducement he was beginning to get bored with this so he touched grundy frowned i was hoping you would decide to stay with me i can speak the languages of animals and plants and learn things that others can not then he smiled but maybe you still will choose me here are the six other companions from which to choose he pulled up another scroll this contained six names goody goblin horace centaur jenny elf marrow bones metria demoness and nada naga dug recognized the last name the luscious creature of the cover he didnt need to check the others he highlighted nada naga and her description and a picture appeared piers anthony nada naga princess of the naga folk of xanth which are humanserpent crossbreeds capable of assuming either form or one in between age unmarried intelligent nice beautiful assets maturity and ability to assume fighting form liabilities princessly limitations being a princess was a liability dug had to laugh he was prepared to cope with it what fun it would be to have such a woman as his companion without hesitation he touched return the picture expanded and nada naga stepped out onto the main screen thank you grundy she said in a dulcet voice actually it was print in a speech balloon but dug could almost hear it i shall take it from here grundy sighed and walked offscreen nada turned to dug please introduce yourself she said appealingly just type your name and description so that i can relate to you eagerly he typed dug male age so she was five years older who cared this was only a game why hello doug she said i am sure we shall get along very well oops dug he typed no o its not short for douglas either its just dug she lifted one dainty hand to her mouth blushing prettily oh i apologize dug please forgive me actually if she wanted to call him doug or douglas let her do it from her it would sound just great no need he typed quickly i never met a princess before it was a game but it had become an interesting game and he wanted to play it for what it was worth he realized that he was losing his bet with edsel but he no longer cared he just wanted to continue playing it is a liability being a princess she said it was nice of you to select me anyway i shall try to be an effective companion for you demons dont dream im sure you will be perfect he typed speaking the words at the same time really getting into it dug may i give you some advice she asked prettily anything you want he said his fingers flying to keep the pace it will be easier if you get into the scene with me so that we can relate to each other more readily do you know how to do that id love to get into the scene with you he agreed but youre on the computer screen and im out here in real life so maybe it was a foolish business getting emotionally involved like this treating her as if she were a real person but it was fun he was amazed at how responsive she was this is true but though i can not come out to join you you can in effect come in to join me you have to suspend your disbelief a bit and refocus your eyes til try he wished he could forget this was a fantasy game and just live the fantasy himself with this lovely woman you see the screen looks flat to you because you are focusing flat but if you will try to focus your eyes on something behind the screen as if it were a window to another world you will find that it becomes rounded see if you can do it rounded she was already so nicely rounded that he hardly cared about the rest but he obligingly tried to focus his eyes beyond the screen the image of nada fuzzed somewhat that was all i dont see to be getting it he said see the two dots at the top she asked pointing now he saw them hovering just above her speech balloon try to make them become three dots then you will be in the right range it may not happen right away but once it does you will know it okay he typed he was glad that he could do it by touch so that he could answer her without taking his eyes from die screen he refocused his eyes trying to make die piers anthony two dots into three he didnt really believe that anything would come of this but he wanted to give his best try to whatever she asked him to do the picture blurred refocused and blurred again the two dots became four then bobbed a bit and fused into three and then quietly die third dimension came dug stared literally the picture was now d he wasnt wearing colored glasses or using one of those twopicture stereo dinguses it was just the computer screen but now the screen had become like a pane of glass a window opening to a scene beyond nada naga stood in the foreground with the grass of the glade behind her and the fantasy jungle in the background it was all so real he was stunned thats better nada said smiling i see you in rounded form now dug she saw him as rounded she was the most delightfully rounded woman he could imagine but he did not type mat in instead he made a safer statement its amazing how did it happen she frowned prettily i dont suppose you would believe me if i told you theres some magic involved he shook his head i dont believe in magic thats too bad that is the second and greater step when you manage to do that you will truly be in the game suspension of disbelief he agreed i really wish i could but im a skeptic from way back as they say im from missouri she looked blank i thought you were from mundania mundania cute notion i think missouri is a state in mundania the people there always have to be shown something before they believe it so if you show me magic ill believe it otherwise she smiled she made a sinuous ripple and suddenly she was a snake with her human head this is my naga form which is natural to me my magic enables me to as demons dont dream sume human form or full serpent form she became a coiled python whose reptilian eyes fixed on him as it slithered from the fallen garments but he was not revolted he could take snakes or leave them he knew they were beneficial creatures so he just left mem alone this one did not dismay him at all he knew it was nada in the context of the fantasy game it would be useful to have such a reptile on his side if some game threat materialized as was sure to happen when he really got into it i realize there is magic in a fantasy game he said carefully things happen all me time in movie cartoons and such people get flattened by steamrollers and then pumped back into round with a shot of air and they are normal again so you might say that i believe in magic in such a context but never in real life the snake slithered behind a screen carrying the womans piled clothing in its mouth in a moment the human form reappeared from behind the screen decorously dressed but if you come into xanth then magic will work if i went to mundania i would not be able to change form id be just a little helpless snake she frowned i know it happened once but here we follow our rules so when you can manage to believe then you will experience magic when i believe that til be crazy he said sourly no you will just be in another realm but you dont have to believe to play the game just remember that our rules govern here ill do that dug said surprised by her responsiveness it really seemed as if she were a real person communicating through the barrier of his disbelief how do i play this game she smiled again the glade lighted when she did that it really did become brighter as if a slow flashbulb had gone off so it was a foolish technical effect he still liked it she was just such a beautiful woman that he could bask all day in her smiles piers anthony take my hand nada said and i will lead you into it she extended her lovely hand to him dug reached for the screen then caught himself he typed i take your hand the scene expanded now he seemed to be in the glade and nada stood beside him about half a head shorter than he she turned to him her bosom gently heaving her browngray eyes complementing her graybrown tresses suddenly browngray was dugs favorite color thank you dug it is so nice to have you here its so nice to be here he said discovering that disbelief was getting easier to suspend at least in this context he knew he would never get close to a woman like this in real life so he might as well do it this way certainly the way the scene had come to life was amazing now this glade is a safe haven nada said but the moment we go out of it were playing the game proper and there will be challenge and trouble so while i dont want to bore you with too many explanations you arent boring me dug said quickly she could have been delivering the worlds dullest lecture on shakespeares most boring historical play and still have fascinated him he was satisfied just to remain in this glade and watch her talk because she seemed to be genuinely interested in him that was surely the fakery of the game programming but it was excellent fakery he remembered a challenge that was ongoing companies were trying to build a computer that could maintain a dialogue with a person so effectively that the person would not know it was a computer the computer would be in a sealedoff room so the person couldnt see and would have to guess whether there was a computer or a person in there so far no computer had fooled the experts but it was getting close nada naga as an animated projection for such a computer program was awfully close she seemed so alive and not just because of her appearance she smiled again as he had hoped she would thank demons dont dream you dug i need to be sure you understand what is happening because it is my job to take you as far through the game as possible and if you fail to win the prize it wont be through any fault of mine but my ability is limited and in any event the decisions are yours i can only answer your questions and advise you i myself dont know the winning course but i do know xanth and so i will be able to guide you away from most of its dangers she paused glancing at him are you familiar with xanth never heard of it he said cheerfully im not a fantasy reader i gather its a hokedup fantasy setting with beautiful princesses ugly goblins walking skeletons and smoky demonesses he had picked that up from the list of alternate companions i presume ill have to cross mountains and chasms and raging rivers and fight off firebreathing dragons and find special magic amulets to enable me to get into magically sealed vaults where the treasure lies and that there are so many threats lined up that the chances are ill be wiped out early and then ill have to start over knowing a little more about what to avoid frankly id rather just stay here and talk with you his glance fell to her bosom and bounced away because when he was standing this close to her he could see right down inside he loved the sight but didnt want her to catch him staring she might put on a jacket ruining the view you do seem to have a good notion of the game she agreed she inhaled and he almost bit his tongue but you cant win it by staying here so soon we shall have to start the trek normally the best first step is to go to askfee good magician humfrey for advice unfortunately he charges a years service for a single answer to a question since that isnt feasible for you right no point in going there lets talk do you ever date mundanest date do you mean one of the seeds of thyme we might find one of those if we go to the right garden piers anthony he laughed i mean do you ever go out with mun danest i am about to go out into xanth with you to show you the best route to i mean like doing something together seeing a show having a meal talking having fun her lovely brow almost furrowed we shall be pursuing the quest together and we shall see what xanth has to show along the way we shall talk as much as we need i hope this is not unpleasant for you she just wasnt getting it so he tried once more like maybe dancing together and kissing nada gazed at him a peculiar expression crossing her face she was finally getting it i think not i am here to be your companion i am not your romance please do not try to kiss me dug laughed again but it was to cover up embarrassment she had told him no plainly enough if he tried to kiss her she would turn into a serpent and chomp him i was just asking so what else do i need to know about the game because if he had to play the game to keep her with him it was worth it then he had to laugh at himself nada was a game figure on his computer screen he couldnt kiss her anyway yet here he had gotten all interested in the faint hope mat she might agree to do it he really was getting into mis but wouldnt it be great if it were possible and she were willing she was so much better than the girlfriend he had just lost to his friend so foolish as it was he was going to try to please her hi the hope that eventually she would agree to kiss him even if it could be in name only nada got down to business it is almost impossible to win the prize directly because we dont even know where to look for it so we shall have to go see the good magician and hope that you can make some kind of deal with him for his advice i know the way there so will guide you however the path is dangerous hi places and we dont know what might happen so we shall have to be demons dont dream very careful there are enchanted paths but those are for the regular folk of xanth we shall have to go crosscountry she glanced up smiling briefly that means we will encounter those mountains chasms rivers and dragons you described and may not even get as far as the good magicians castle if we dont and im out of the game may i ask for you again the next time i play you may do so but i will not be able to help you any better than the first time because the threats will be changed so you may be better off choosing another companion who may work better for you will you remember me in the next game yes but it may be difficult for me because i may have seen you get eaten by a dragon that would be traumatic for me then ill try not to get eaten he said gallantly is there any good way to discourage dragons that depends on the dragon i will be able to back off a small one but a large oneit is better simply to hide arent mere any repellents or weapons or whatever so i could travel prepared there may be if you are clever enough to find mem this is one of my liabilities i do not know very much about human weapons or how to use mem if you wish to exchange me for a companion who does such as horace centaur no thanks ill try to make do on my own dug looked around is mere a town nearby where we might get weapons or supplies that might be our first stop there is isthmus village i could take you there but the people are not friendly to strangers it might be better to avoid it there are fruit and nut trees and egg rolls and pie plants so food will be no problem and perhaps you could prepare a staff or cudgel for your defense bat dug was feeling ornery no lets try isthmus vhlage first thats a funny name why is it called that nada bent down to sketch a map in the dirt in the center piers anthony of the glade dug caught a compelling glimpse down her front and wisely gave no sign though he feared his eyeballs were about to bulge out of their sockets talk of threedimensional effects this is the general outline of xanth she said this is where we are at the edge of the isthmus here is the village a little farther along it derives its name from its location dug tore his errant eyes away from her dcolletage long enough to glance at the map why thats the state of florida he said surprised you mean were in the florida panhandle if that is what you call it it is the main route to and from mundania which is why we meet mundanes here but this is not your mundane state this is xanth and you must remember mat because there are things here you are unlikely to find in mundania he had been glimpsing some of them but of course he couldnt admit it good enough lets get moving she straightened up nodding she stared to walk to the edge of the glade and it was evident that he was walking with her because the scene shifted with his motion this should be interesting if only because of its realism he didnt care about the prize he just wanted to stay hi the scene ogre fen jenny elf waited nervously in the chamber reserved for the prospective companions sammy cat unconcerned snoozed in her lap she had to serve a year for the good magician humfrey because she had asked him a question and gotten an answer but he had sent her to the demon professor grossclout instead and now she was part of this weird game for mundanes why the demons wanted to run a game for mundanes only the demons knew but she was obliged to play her part nada naga had just left being chosen as a companion by a mundane player that left the demoness metria the skeleton marrow bones the zombie horace centaur and tfae polite goody goblin in a moment a new person arrived to fill the vacated space hi the roster she was a woman just about as beautiful and well endowed as nada she wore a gown as brown as the bark of a tree and her hair was as green as foliage hello the woman said is this the companions denr x the others sent glances around but none of them con piers anthony nected jenny realized that it was up to her to answer yes it is come and join us im jenny elf here to serve out my service for the good magician the woman stepped inside i am vida vila a nature nymph i owed professor grossclout a favor she took a seat vida vila the skeleton exclaimed we have met before i am marrow bones i brought prince dolph through your region several years ago vida nodded i thought you looked familiar but i am not good with skeletons they all look alike to me that prince must be about grown by now yes he married electra and they have twins oh pooh vida said dispirited that was impressive because for that instant she became a growly bear but she quickly reverted i hoped to marry him myself when he got old enough princes dont grow on trees you know or i would have grown my own now hear this a disembodied voice blared it is time for the selection of the false companion but we already had that selection jenny protested she had been relieved when the lot had not fallen on her because she did not want to be false to any person try not to let the mush in your head show the voice said sternly it was professor grossclout of course the demon in charge a new false companion must be selected before each player chooses his companion so as to preserve the odds remember only the chosen one will receive the indication that one must conceal the status from all others no one must know until it is revealed in the course of the game oh get on with it clout metria muttered did i hear a mutter the voice demanded dangerously metrias mouth zipped shut in fact a zipper appeared demons dont dream across it she was a demoness but she knew whom not to aggravate the professor was said to be a creature who had been wheeled from hell or something the selection is now jenny kept herself perfectly still no indication came she had escaped selection again what a relief after a moment she looked around at the others and found them looking around too each was trying to discover who had been selected but none of them could tell it could be any of the seven of them because grundy golem was also a potential companion maybe the lot had fallen on him look out here comes a player metria said peering out the window immediately they all sat still in their seats so that their images would be ready when the player asked to see the prospective companions they could see the player in the one way window but he could not see them until he asked to he she it was a girl she looked sort of ordinary but bat was typical of all mundanes her hands hovered over the keyboard which was the clumsy way mundanes had to access magic and her eyes were fastened to her side of die window grundy golem was the master of ceremonies and he was good at it hi im grundy golem im from the land of why hello grundy the girl exclaimed im so glad to see you how is rapunzel that set even the loudmouthed golem back shes fine shes home because shes expecting a delivery by the he paused do you mind telling me how old you are sixteen the girl said brightly i know all about the adult conspiracy i attend a progressive school uh yes grundy said still somewhat at a loss so have come to play our companions of xanth game kirn i won a talent contest and this was the prize to piers anthony get the first copy of the new xanth computer game i love xanth so here i am urn there may have been a mistake youre actually the second to play the second oh darn whos first a boy named dug we didnt realize that the first had been promised to you well it wasnt exactly promised but the games not officially on the market yet so i figuredwell never mind im used to being second she looked sad jenny was getting to like this girl for some reason maybe it was because she looked so ordinary but had so much personality the boy dug had been handsome but more like a blank in character and jenny was glad he hadnt chosen her to be bis companion of course he had chosen nada any male human being would but this girl kirn was different hi a number of ways so you know about xanth grundy said trying to get reorganized now that this introductory spiel had been broken up but do you know about this game oh sure all i need to anyway i have to choose a companion and shell tell me everything else you can choose a male companion if you wish grundy said i happen to be available gee grundy youd be great you can talk to anything but maybe id better at least check the others just in case the window became twoway now kim could see the six available companions oh theres jenny elf kim exclaimed delighted and sammy cat hey jenny i wrote you a letter jenny felt a thrill of pleasure at the recognition but i didnt get an answer jenny squirmed but i know how it is you have a whole lot of other stuff to do like getting better the mundane jenny i mean of course i couldnt get a letter from xanth kim turned to grundy im sorry grundy i like you really i do but jenny elf s my favorite and sammy can find anything except home ive got to go with her demons dont dream thats all right grundy said graciously there was soothing else he could do he walked out of the glade jenny stood and stepped through the window into the main scene carrying sammy she was really glad to be chosen because kim seemed like a nice girl who already knew about xanth jenny was also doubly glad now that she was not the false companion it no longer mattered who else had been selected because the player had chosen and would deal only with jenny hello kim jenny said thank you for choosing me i will try to be a good companion for you oh i know you will kim said enthusiastically i wish this could be real instead of just an old game but i dont guess you cant tell me how to step into the real xanth well not quite jenny said apologetically but i can you two steps that will bring you a lot closer first you ive to refocus your eyes do you see those two dots i see mem in a moment following jennys instructhe girl had succeeded in bringing the third dimen skra instead of being a oat image beyond die screen she became a rounded one and the screen seemed more like a window it was almost as if they were in the glade together oh this is wonderful kim exclaimed the other thing is harder you have to suspend your disbelief if you can do that then you will seem to be right here in xanth because youll believe it oh i want to believe it kim exclaimed id give lything to be hi xanth for real but deep down inside always know this is a game and not real jenny was saddened to near mat how could she conthe girl mat it was mundania that wasnt quite real tpat that was why this was the harder challenge people just ifpuldnt make themselves believe what they didnt believe well we can play the game anyway jenny said at the visual magic is working now i dont know what prize is or where to find it so i think you will have pi piers anthony to go to ask the good magician humfrey if you dont mind mind id love to meet the good magician will i get to fight my way into his castle too yes im afraid you will wonderful oh this is so thrilling i cant wait to get started jenny was somewhat taken aback by this enthusiasm she herself had had some trouble adjusting to the land of xanth which was so different from the world of two moons where she had lived before but of course kirn was mundane so she had to be thrilled to be anywhere else we can start now if you wish sammy can find us a safe path past the ogre fen for each player started from a different place in xanth so they wouldnt interfere with each other dug had started from the isthmus but this was farther to the east the demons moved the site back and forth each time oh are we near the ogre fen ogre fen will we get to see an ogre we dont want to see an ogre jenny protested ogres are dangerous if we get near any of them they are liable to squeeze us into pulp and plop us into a cook pot or worse if theyre in a bad mood kirn looked disappointed well could we maybe just sneak by where they cant see us so we can just catch a little glimpse it would mean so much to me jenny saw that they had a problem look kirn maybe you are used to reading about xanth where nothing really bad happens to major characters they just get scared but it always turns out okay in the end but youre not a xanth character you are a player and if an ogre catches you hell do something mean to you like biting off your head and youll be out of the game furthermore if you should come back in the game not only will you have to start from scratch with a scrambled set of threats that ogre will remember you and come after you faster next time it doesnt get easier to start over it gets harder so you dont demons dont dream want to run afoul of any ogres theyll ruin your chances even if you dont really die when they pull you apart and use your legbones as toothpicks im sure sammy can find a way through the ogre fen without encountering any ogres and thats what we should do but i dont want to get caught by the ogres kirn protested i just want to see them so when i go home i can say i saw a real live game ogre whats the sense in playjng if i cant see what i want to see well i sort of thought you might want to win and get jhe prize x well of course i want to win the prize but the fun is fdso in the playing i want to experience every part of xanth and enjoy it to the utmost its great already just seeing it in threedee and talking with you just as if youre real v it was worse than jenny had feared underneath all her knowledge of xanth kirn really didnt believe at all so she wasnt taking it seriously enough she had an attitude ftoblem this was sure to lead to mischief but kim was the player and she was the one who made the decisions all jenny could do was help and advise her well if you insist on seeing an ogre well go see an ogre jenny said ill have sammy try to find a path that leads to a place where we can see without being seen but i still think its a bad idea its a terrible idea kim agreed but fun too adventare is the spice of life lets go s so jenny set sammy down find a path that leads to a place where we can see an ogre without any ogres seeing sb she told him dont run ahead just find where it ittarts she had learned how to manage the cat so that she didnt have to chase madly after him when he went to find something she had first come to xanth when sammy had plashed off to find a feather and she had followed him so b wouldnt get lost but gotten lost herself since then she jad been stuck in xanth but soon enough she had come like it though she did miss her family back on the piers anthony world of two moons the last thing she wanted to do was have sammy run into some other world so that they wouldnt be able to find their way back to xanth sammy headed off jenny held on to the invisible leash the demons had given her so that she could fell by its tug where the cat was sammy couldnt feel the leash in fact he didnt know she had it it stretched just as far as it needed to invisibly long but contracted as she caught up until it was invisibly short so she no longer had to dash pellmell after the cat trying to keep him in sight he was always within the feel of her hand however this did not make things perfect because the cat took the most direct catroute to whatever he was finding if this was along a path fine but it could as readily be under a thorn bush or up along a tree branch or through a river or under the nose of a sleeping dragon sammy would zip by before the dragon woke but jenny was slower larger and smelled of elf and all those things made a difference to a dragon so care was still required in this case the cat merely zipped through the thickest tangle of a cornfield the corn popped madly as she forged through it oooh firecrackers kirn exclaimed delighted no just popping corn jenny said oh i hope the sound of it doesnt alert the ogres then she felt something sticking to her she looked and discovered kernels of caramel corn they were overripe and gooey so they made a real mess she tried to pull them off her clothing but they had melted in and wouldnt come out well this was the kind of nuisance that happened when she chased after sammy soon they came to the cat who was sitting at the end of a path licking the caramel from his fur this was the one jenny glanced at kirn kim was not really here instead there was the square window to mundania showing her as she sat at her keyboard the window was always right in sight so that the player could see the game scene it moved along with jenny so it was easy to forget that demons dont dream jenny was traveling alone physically kim would not really be in the scene until she achieved the second act of belief and believed in magic but that would happen as the game progressed some things just took time to believe jenny picked up the cat they followed the path through the deepening reaches of the dread ogre fen jenny would be glad when they got out of here because it was the kind of place only an ogre could like the trees were warped the victims of ogre pranks some had been tied in knots and others looked like pretzels some were in tatters showing that once an ogre in a bad mood had passed the ground was no better it was grudgingly shifting from a swamp to a bog and thence to a marsh soon it would become a full fen fortunately the path itself was dry this was because the ogres preferred awful paths so didnt use this one thus sammy had found the one safe from ogres or at least less dangerous no path was truly safe from an ogre they passed some cords hanging down from branches extending over the path jennys elbow brushed one it twanged loudly immediately several other cords twanged forming a quartet of notes as if several people were singing whats that kim inquired startled a vocal cord jenny said i hope it doesnt attract the ogres but when she tried to move on she brushed another cord and there was another group of simultaneous notes she shuddered the ogres were sure to hear this music they were lucky no ogres came jenny breathed a sigh of relief but she knew that the danger wasnt over they needed to get out of ogre country they came to a hugely spreading tree whose trunk looked like thick rubber and whose branches had rubber rings spaced along them the tips of the branches touched thin wires which in turn swung away through the branches of other trees there was a faint humming coming from the wires and now and men a crackling sound piers anthony what kind of tree is that kirn asked its grotesque jenny studied it she had had to take a cram course in the flora of xanth so that she could be a good companion and identify anything that might be either helpful or dangerous its an electricitree she said it has a lot of power i think kirn laughed im sure it has maybe this is where our electric power comes from i see the wires headed away we belter not stay here too long the electric field might be bad for us jenny looked sure enough die trees roots extended down into a shimmering field there was water below but the wire grass grew up thickly she hadnt run into this in her studies maybe she had snoozed through that particular lecture an electric field is harmful she asked well we dont know for sure but folk dont like to live too close to power lines just in case then they heard an ominous thudding and the ground trembled the ogres are coming jenny said alarmed they must have heard the vocal cords after all wed better hide in the tree so she scrambled up with sammy scampering up ahead of her and the screen view that connected mem to kirn angling along just in time the first monster was already heaving into awful sight of course there was no such thing as a good sight near an ogre except the sight of a last way out of sight oooo an ogre kim exclaimed quiet jenny hissed horribly alarmed ogres had adequate hearing adequate to locate whatever they wanted to squish flat or pound into oblivion or chomp into quivering fragments what are they doing kim asked in a lower tone jenny studied the scene it was a whole tribe of ogres males and females and they seemed to be looking for something then they spied it a glowing ball nestled in the electric field one ogre lumbered into the field and demons dont dream grabbed the balland burned his hands he dropped it with a small curse that set fire to the nearby grass or maybe it was the fiery ball that did that i think theyre collecting a ball of lightning to heat their cook pot jenny whispered ogres arent smart enough to make their own fire so they must have to take it where they find it a lightning ball kim exclaimed how xanthly not so loud jenny warned but it was too late an ogre perked an ear me hear thing near he said jenny felt deepest dread then he cocked an eye me see a she disaster we have to flee jenny said but the only route out was the one they had come in on and the ogres were standing too close to it the big male ogre was already stomping toward the electricitree they were trapped the ogre reached up and whammed the branch they were on with his hamfist the whole tree shuddered and me branch vibrated violently jenny was jarred right out of her perch she screamed as she fell but the ogre swept hn hamhand across and caught her by the scruff of her collar see she he exulted waving her around for the others to inspect leave her alone kim cried shes with me the ogre peered at the sound of her voice there was the windowscreen showing kim beyond fox in box he grunted and grabbed the screen he hauled it up to snout level upside down eeeek kim cried as the picture jolted around her hair fell away from her body as the screen was inverted then the ogre got it turned over and her hair flopped back into place let go of that screen she said shaken imagination in the game is fine but this is ridiculous the ogre laughed me dump in sump he said shoving the screen down into the water of the marsh oh kim cried as her picture emerged blub now her hah was soaking wet stop that just lookme cook the ogre said carrying both piers anthony jenny and the screen toward a huge pot an ogress was setting up the lightning ball was already under it and die muddy swamp water was beginning to bubble jenny tried to think of something to do but couldnt they had fallen right into the worst possible situation captives of the ogres she had tried to warn kirn to be careful and quiet but the girl hadnt paid enough attention but now kim regrouped her composure you cant do this she said angrily the ogre paused evidently perplexed he was trying to figure out how to ask why not but couldnt make it rhyme so he just stood there stupidly ogres were good at that but then he put it together not got jenny still couldnt think of an answer she was really washing out as a companion she should have thought of some way to stop kim from insisting on coining here but kim was now defending herself you cant cook us just like that were people you have to win us in a contest all the ogres looked at each other confused they had never heard of this that meant mat they couldnt be quite sure it was wrong but jenny was confused too what kind of contest an ogre could win just about any physical contest especially if it required strength ogres were justifiably proud of their strength and ugliness how now the ogre who held them inquired we must have a stupid contest kim said to see who is most stupid the ogres liked that they were most proud with most justification of their stupidity they were bound to win such a contest rules tools the main ogre said in what in a smarter person would have passed for bad rhyme and worse logic its like a game kim said you must be the ver and m be the pid those are our names but we have to find the rest of our names when we do well know who is smarter and so who loses the ogres were confused that wasnt surprising so demons dont dream was jenny what did kim have on her mind she obviously wasnt stupider than any ogre and would be hard put to it to prove it especially to an ogre me ver the ogre said she pid he was so confused mat he wasnt rhyming first put us down kim said you cant play with your hands full the ogre set me screen down next to the bubbling pot he set jenny down beside the screen the other ogres settied on their haunches waiting to see what to make of this kim brushed back her hair which was drying now we will take turns naming us until we find names that fit how know the ogre asked in another sloppy attempt at rhyme why the other ogres will know kirn said brightly when they hear a name that makes sense theyll exclaim with recognition the other ogres looked doubtful their doubt was well taken they were hardly smart enough to recognize any sense in anything even if they understood the game which they didnt tu start kim said sil thats the name can you match it to our names the ogre pondered hard fleas jumped off his head annoyed by the heat but it was no good he did not know what to do uke this kim said you are silver i am silpid are those good names the ogre pondered harder a wisp of steam rose from his head as a thought tried to forge through heavy resistance he was unable to form a conclusion neither could the other ogres jenny saw that the ogres name made a word silver that could be considered a name but it didnt seem to be very unintelligent that might be why the ogres couldnt recognize it what was kim trying to do well then kim said they must be bad names you tty one now piers anthony jenny was afraid the ogres hair was going to catch on fire as he tried to think but just as the first curl of smoke appeared he got it bop veiy well kirn agreed you have challenged me to make good names with that you are bopver and i am boppid are those good names the ogres remained doubtful so did jenny they were nonsensical names kirn looked disappointed i guess i couldnt make any good names with your suggestion so ill make another for you riv can you make good names from that the ogre was finally catching on me rivver he said she rivpid there was a stir among the other ogres rivver an ogress said river good name oh my kirn said looking unhappy you did make a good name its probably a really stinky river too the ogres clapped their hamhands pleased they were getting into it now but jenny wasnt she didnt see how this was going to keep kirns screen out of the boiling pot she knew that if kirns picture got boiled it would be just as if she got boiled she would be out of the game then kirn frowned but is it a really obtuse name then seeing the ogres confusion she clarified her reference witless the ogres considered the matter and slowly concluded that it was not ogrishly witless now it was the ogres turn to offer a name chomp he said kim concentrated now let me see you are chompver i am chomppid are those good names it turned out that they were not she had lost her chance again but now it was her turn to supply a name stu she said can you make a good name with mat the ogre tried me stuver he said she stupid there was a pause then an exclamation they had rec demons dont dream ognized a name she stupid an ogress exclaimed she stupid stupid then they were all chorusing it stupid stupid stupid jenny began to get a glimmer where this might be headed kim sighed i guess you have done it you have found a good name for me im stupid the ogres were quick to agree but we still havent found a good name for him kim said after a moment do you have another one to try the ogres were unable to change mental gears so swiftly and could not come up with a name well then lets try cle kim said does mat work the ogre managed to put it together she clepid me ctever there was another slow reaction the ogres recognized a word ctever clever he clever why so he is kim agreed that must be his name clever clever clever clever the ogres chorused kim frowned now we both have names he is clever i am stupid so which one of us is more stupid she stupid the ogre said nailing it down so he is clever and i am stupid kim said so i am more stupid than he is they chorused agreement suddenly jenny saw the point so she wins because she is me moststupid the ogres stared at each other how had this happened kim had won the stupid contest they had to let her go but when jenny started to walk away the ogre stopped her elf no stupid he said elf go potty he picked her by the scruff and swung her toward the hot pot sammy cat perched on her shoulder seemed about ready to jump off oops kim had won her own freedom but not jennys without jenny as her companion she would not fare well piers anthony in the game she would not actually die if they dumped her in the pot the demons would conjure her back to the character storage bunker but she would be through for this session then we shall have to have a contest for the elf kirn said but well need new names she pondered briefly lets see youre male so you must be called gent she is female so lets call her belle can we find good names the ogre couldnt think of one so kim suggested one co me cogent the ogre said she cobelle cogent jenny saw that kim had this set up for another win but it didnt work because the ogres didnt recognize the word then the ogre suggested a name trying to force a win for his side dum kim considered carefully then you are dumgent and the elf is dumbelle again the slow reaction dumbelle dumbell dumbbell she dumbbell kirns mouth opened in seeming dismay oh you have named her shes a real dumbbell all right but jenny remained smart enough to keep her mouth shut the ogres agreed but the game wasnt over because the ogre still had to be named kim suggested intelli and to the amazement of all they got a good name out of mat not intellibelle but inteuigent intelligent after some further consideration the ogres realized that they had been had again they had to let jenny elf go too the two hastened to depart kim had evidently seen more than enough of real live ogres for the day but jenny had to admit that she had done a very nice job of getting them out of their picklement she might make a good player after all however there was a lot more of the game to go and not all the other creatures they encountered would be stupid isthmus nada hoped for the best but expected to settle for less she had indeed been chosen to be the companion of a teenage mundane male which was her worstcase scenario he had already tried to get fresh and male freshness was really stale for her almost as bad he knew nothing about xanth and did not believe in magic this was bound to be a real chore it had seemed considerably more romantic when the demon professor grossclout had first broached the notion he had explained that clio the muse of history was getting ready to write up another volume in her ongoing history of xanth she had assigned the production chore to the demons they expected it to be a good story and there were openings for major characters therein provided their heads are not full of mush he said nada wasnt interested she had little concern for the business of the muses and less for demons and none for the role of a major character i just barely escaped having to marry a child last time i was a major character she reminded him now she hoped to remain com piers anthony fortably retired and let others carry the burden of notoriety ah yes the professor said knowledgeably you needed to marry a prince and only two were convenient one was underage and the other was your brother naldo naga now both are securely married and you are xanths most eligible princess he gazed at her through his impressive spectacles have you considered that such an episode may be excellent for introducing you to new prospects nadas sleeping interest began to stir prospects if a new eligible prince of sufficient age is to show up anywhere it will be in such a volume i should think you would want to be on hand for the occasion the demon was beginning to get to her nada was now in her thoroughly marriageable decade and time was passing it would be disheartening if a suitable prospect escaped because she wasnt keeping an eye on the scene but why are the demons involved in mis she inquired demons are never major characters they care nothing about human events unless they wish to interfere with them will you make a princessly oath of secrecy the professor asked the question has an answer but it is not given for mere humans to know i am only half human nada said no one ever called me mere she inhaled it was an action that normally had a peculiar effect on any adult human males in the vicinity making them become more reasonable and attentive especially if she happened to be leaning forward at the time precisely grossclout said yawning in this manner he demonstrated his immunity to this particular magic now her female curiosity was stirring too something phenomenally significant might be in the works very well so oathed it is truly demon business grossclout confided the demon ecar is attempting to take over xanth naturally the demon x objects to this so the two are demons dont dream settling it in the demon way by a contest of innocents in a dream but demons dont dream nada protested because they dont sleep he agreed except for confused ones such as metria they merely go into stasis and think however mortals do sleep and do dream which is what keeps the realm of the gourd in business mortals also have waking dreams thus they will dream for the demons the game of the companions of xantb is intended to be an animation of such a dream wherein mortals can participate as if it is reality one of them will win the prize and one will not this entire volume of the muses history is to be devoted to this decision thus it falls to the lesser demons to make the arrangements and to the mortal folk to play it out we do not know what will constitute a win for the demon xfan but we are certain that this matter affects us most intimately nada was horrified if the demon x dl loses magic will disappear from xanth this too so it does behoove us all to cooperate hoping that our efforts will facilitate his success but suppose we unwittingly make him lose the professor grimaced he was very good at it having terrified generations of hapless students at the demon university of magic that would be unfortunate he remarked his tone making nada feel exactly like a student she did not dare question the matter further she agreed to participate in the volume thereafter she attended rehearsals diligently because the professor assured her that she would be chosen to be the companion to a mundane player a mundane she shrieked horrified i dont want to associate with any mundane the professor could be amazingly reasonable when he hied grey murphy was a mundane and grey murphy was good magician humfreys assistant and a magician in his own right if nada didnt marry a prince she could marry a magician they were of piers anthony similar status princess ivy had already sewn up grey murphy of course but it did illustrate the point it was theoretically possible for a mundane to be worthwhile particularly if the demon xcan should lose grossclout said as if reading her thought he had had generations of practice in that sort of thing too reading the guilty faces of students mundania would then be much more important and you would do well to have an association with a mundane so nada acceded to the notion of being a companion to a mundane but i wont let him touch me in any adult conspirational way she said firmly the demon glanced at her torso which was among the firmest hi xanth naturally not he agreed he will probably be underage anyway underage she shrieked echoing her horror of two moments before i have had it with underage males this is simply the nature of mundanes who are interested in fantasy games he explained soothingly they are all rebellious teenagers it is in the big book of rules she allowed herself to be soothed but how do you know that i will be selected to be a companion arent there any other prospects certainly there will be six or seven but suppose one of mem were your brother naldo and the mundane player were female whom would she choose regardless naldo she said immediately he is xanths handsomest and most accomplished prince until recently xanths most eligible bachelor and if the mundane is male nada opened her mouth and closed it again he had made his point in his irrefutable professorish manner thus the rehearsals which included male demons playing the parts of uncouth teenage mundane males with grabby hands nada had to learn how to discourage these without biting then heads off because in her large serpent form she could readily do mat and the professor made clear that this was a nono players were not to be harmed demons dont dream in any way by their companions in fact it was tile companions task to ensure that their players were not hurt at all and to help them proceed through the game and win the prize but suppose hes really obnoxious nada demanded then may i chomp him no you must find some innocuous way to avoid his unwarranted attentions but mundane males are famous for their oafish persistence in the face of polite demurrals true consider it a challenge i shall do no such thing i resign my position hi this stupid game the professor looked pained please do not force me to exert disciplinary persuasion forget it im not one of your demon students im a princess i am departing these premises forthwith i can not allow you to do that who cares what you allow you have no authority over me unfortunately for you i do have authority oh give me one indifferent reason why i should remain here against my princessly preference grossclout sighed a small cloud of smoke do you remember when you and electra toured the realm of the gourd you tasted some red whine so i tasted some red whine she agreed i wanted to identify it so what so any creature who partakes of the food of the realm of the gourd thereafter remains bound to the gourd had you forgotten that nadas hands flew to her face to cover up her unprincessly gape of horror oh my i had forgotten therefore you have an obligation to the realm of the gourd the demons have acquired the option on mat obligation you must participate in our project that will acquit you nada realized that she was stuck for it the demon pro piers anthony fessor was notorious for leaving nothing to chance wearily she returned to the rehearsal now she was glad of those tedious rehearsals because she was well versed in turning aside obnoxious male moves without in any way diminishing her princessly status or maidenly appeal she could handle herself that of course did not make die situation fun but at least it was tolerable this dug promised to be exactly the type she had rehearsed against he was tall handsome halfway smart and oafishy ignorant of magic furthermore his hands were just twitching to put a move on her he had spied her in the lineup and his orbs had spun into twin wow position what a job this was going to be but once it was done she would be free of her obligation to the gourd possibly it might even be worth it they came to isthmus village because dug had exercised his prerogative to make decisions and naturally had made a bad one he was from mundania where food evidently did not grow on trees he thought they had to get supplies even weapons how could he use a weapon from the other side of his screen he needed neither food nor weapon here as long as he refused to believe in magic as long as he thought it was just a game at least that gave her some respite as long as he did not believe he could not truly enter the scene and thus could not annoy her with anything other than verbal harassment of course she would have to handle the reaction of the villagers when they saw the screen traipsing about it did not take long for the villagers to notice them a gruff village headman approached what are a beautiful nada princess and a weird magic screen doing in our desolate village he demanded gruffly of course we wish to obtain supplies and weapons nada said dutifully we are traveling to see the good magician and fear privation along the way why dont you just use the magic path we cant its supposed to be a challenge so the protection of the enchanted paths are denied us demons dont dream well you wont get any help here we are angry folk who dont like outsiders were you not so beautiful we would be inclined to chastise you listen twerp you cant talk to her like that dug exclaimed from the screen sure enough he was getting them into trouble its all right dug nada murmured they cant hurt us yeah id like to see them try he said aggressively the headman grimaced we may oblige you apparition come out of that wandering screen and we shall enjoy giving you a decent thumping boy id sure see about that you old goat nada moved to cover the screen as well as she could with her body blocking dug off from the scene we shall be going immediately thank you kindly sir she said to the headman oh no we wont dug cried as the screen circled around to recover its view of the proceedings much as i like the sight of your backside there was a slight fuzziness about the last word that indicated that the magical translation had had a problem evidently he had used a different word that might or might not mean the same thing nada had the distinct impression that had it been possible for him to reach through the screen he would have done something that required her to wham him across his insolent face oh do you think so you seclusive wretch the headman said as other villagers closed in around them each looking more surly than the others just because you can hide behind a lovely woman you think you can insult us no no nada said desperately hes not trying to insalt you he just doesnt understand she tried to cover the screen again this time being careful not to show her backside to it unfortunately this was worse not only did she have the impression that dug was peering down the front of her dress the village men were inspecting her posterior what a mess the bleep i dont understand dug shouted the word piers anthony bleep was strongly fuzzed showing that the adult conspiracy had blocked out the original word which was odd she had never heard of it operating that way before for one thing there were no children close by and dug at sixteen was eligible to join the conspiracy there should have been no suppression of speech much as i like looking at your bleeps up close angry herself nada stepped away from the screen folding her arms across her bosom she would let dug and the villagers exchange their own words she had done all she could to avert trouble but since both parties seemed to want it that was that get out of the village the headman shouted back we dont want your kind here we have trouble enough already not without our supplies dug said a canny look crossed the headmans face and how will you pay for supplies that evidently made dug pause he didnt have anything he could pass through the screen but in a moment he bounced back with information you bleep what would you like to know how ugly your puss is how big your feet are we dont need information we need to be rid of the censorship the headman said what can you do about that censorship dug exclaimed you mean you have that here we certainly do and its a horror its power is increasing all the time too soon it will totally enslave us making us wholly miserable instead of merely frustrated this was new to nada but perhaps it offered an avenue for resolution of the crisis what is a censorship she asked its a ship of course it sails into our port every day and its censers send their incense smoke through our village ruining our dialogue and incensing us that is why we are so angry all the time demons dont dream censorship dug exclaimed laughing so thats what it is i had thought it was something more serious we find nothing humorous about it the headman said we just wish to be rid of it but its just a pun where i come from its a serious matter they take books out of the libraries and they stop the people from knowing the truth about government and next titling in countries where its really strong they get into thought control exactly at first it seemed mild even beneficial to protect our children but it kept protecting more things and more people until now we are almost slaves to it but we are powerless to throw it off dug reconsidered okay i guess maybe you do have a real problem i dont like censorship i want to make up my own mind what i should read or hear i guess you do too that is the truth the headman said dourly nada still found this confusing why dont you just ask the ship to go away we should have done that at the outset the man agreed but we were seduced by what it seemed to offer it promised us advantage indeed dominance over all others sheer folly we now know to our cost there are a number of ships and some will depart when asked but this one though it masqueraded as a nice one is actually tne worst of them all and once it establishes control it never lets go by choice does this particular censorship have a name dug asked ft is the dread vessel bigotry if only we had fallen victim to some other ship such as politics or literary or prudish or social we might have escaped i understand that some ships really do have the welfare of their victims in mind but not this one this one closes out all other views being absolutely intolerant of differing belief we deeply regret ever being lulled by its seeming care for our welfare it cares for no welfare but its own dug nodded with agreement you got that right okay piers anthony this must be a game challenge something i have to handle before i move on so well help you get rid of it will that be a fair exchange for our supplies the headman forgot to be angry we would give anything we have to be rid of that ship and its insidious fumes deal dug said then exactly how does it work i mean does the smoke smell bad or something no it has only a faint perfume but wherever it circulates it suppresses anything it deems to be offensive it is a puritanical vessel that will not allow any bleep bleep or bleep thoughts to be expressed the man turned his head and spat disgusted by his inability to say the words this of course ruins our fishing building social lives and even our entertainment because it is impossible to perform tough manual chores without venting an occasional bleep or to woo a maid without telling her bleep or to play a game of dice without saying bleep wow dug said you mean it really does stop you from saying bleep he looked surprised as he heard his own word yeah i guess it does boy i dont blame you for getting mad nobody likes getting censored and incensed to be sure that headman agreed gruffly looking less angry many ships do that and originally this had appeal we thought to improve our speech but we assumed that our wishes for speech would govern we discovered that us rules governed instead and not merely for speech that is merely the first stage soon it will begin controlling our actions and finally our thoughts but we have been unable to escape the devious incense fumes from the censers of the ship worse the definitions are expanding originally it was only cursing it stopped but now we can not even say bleep dug nodded i mink i have it i read about it in civics class what do you call a female dog a bleep i thought so pretty soon it will be running your entire demons dont dream lives because censorship feeds on its own power to enforce its rules they dont have to make sense thats not the point they just have to be followed or else eventually you wont even be able to breathe without choking on the fumes and life wont be worth living exactly we are already somewhat short of breath the other folk nodded agreement and some coughed nada was amazed dug was actually getting along with the villagers he understood their problem maybe she had misjudged him okay what do i have to do to get rid of this ship it is very hard that is why we can not do it for ourselves but perhaps an outsider not yet fully suppressed by me fumes could manage it you have to get the solution thats what i want the solution dug agreed what is it is a magical fluid that can put out the censers so mat the incense no longer burns only that special solution can do it when the incense no longer burns there will be no more smoke and no more fumes then the ship will be unable to harm us and will have to go away dugs mouth quirked nada realized that he still was not taking this quite seriously but she decided to stay clear as long as the dialogue was making progress and where may i find this magical solution it is beyond the pail beyond the pale dug said of course you must take the pail and bring the solution back hi it that is the only way i shall try to do that but just how far beyond the pale uh pail is this solution we do not know we know only that it is in the possession of the fairy nuff fair enough yes if you can convince her to give you the solution all will be well ill do that which direction is the pail that way the headman said pointing to the side piers anthony well lets go dug said briskly i shall return nada had no idea whether they would be able to find the pail let alone the fairy nuff or get the solution but at least this was better than quarreling with the villagers she walked in the indicated direction and the screen walked with her soon they saw the pail it was colored daylight blue and looked very bright and nice but as they walked toward it it receded staying out of reach i begin to see why the villagers didnt get it dug said but well have to prove were smarter can you get around beyond it so i can herd it in to you for answer nada changed into small serpent form and slithered out of her clothes then she realized that she shouldnt have done that how was she going to get back into them without dug seeing her body a princess could not allow a mere man to see her torso or her panties especially not a mundane man but she would have to worry about that later she had already changed she slithered rapidly around to the side and through the underbrush she circled around until she was well beyond the pail then she started to changeand realized that she didnt have her clothes here she couldnt grab the pail unless she had hands so she slithered back under the brush near a blanket bush changed back to human form wrapped a blanket around her and walked back out to intercept the pail she lay down hiding men changed back to serpent form keeping the blanket more or less in place so that it would be there when she changed again now dugs screen advanced on me pail the pail retreated teasing him but when it crossed the place where nada lay she abruptly changed back to human form grabbed its handle with one hand and her blanket with the other gotcha she exclaimed with unprincessly vernacular the pail flung itself about but could not get free after a moment it hung quiescent defeated great dug called his screen hurrying across the terrain now we can go on beyond the pail demons dont dream in a moment nada said stay here i will be right back she hurried back to where her clothing was she picked it up went behind a very elegant and even symmetree and hastily got back into her formal human garb she was careful not to let go of the pail because if it got away from her she knew they would not catch it in the same way again the she walked out to rejoin dug she had managed to get by this incidental personal crisis but she would have to be more careful next time she needed to change they moved onand discovered snow it covered the path and extended into the forest to the sides this cant be right nada said xanth is warm there is snow only on the mountaintops and sometimes in unusual storms there hasnt been any storm here and its not cold maybe it only looks like snow dug said she squatted and touched a finger to it it was cold and somewhat gooey she licked her finger eye scream she exclaimed surprised ice cream eye scream she clarified pointing to her eye and mouth you scream oh i scream whats it doing here i dont know it must be coming from somewhere see it seems to be flowing and melting then lets find out where its coming from maybe we can get around it or at least across it she said her slippers were already thoroughly gummed up it seems to be flowing from somewhere ahead of us as they went the ice cream became colder and harder so that her feet were no longer gummy now they were cold dug within his screen had no problem he just floated over it fortunately she spied a shoe tree she plucked a warm pair of boots from it and put them on now her feet were all right and the blanket over her dress helped keep the test of her warm but she hoped they found a way out of piers anthony the eye scream soon because she knew she would get cold again as soon as she stopped moving they came to a castle formed of packed sugary snow it wasnt a big castle but that was because there was not an awful lot of eye scream available to make it ft had nice windows formed of thin sheets of ice maybe whoever lives here knows what this is all about nada said she went up to the frozen chocolate door to knock she discovered that there was a screen door before it there was a large eye set in the screen who are you the eye screamed i am nada naga companion to dug mundane who is a player in the game we are trying to find the fairy nuff i dont suppose she lives here the eye screen blinked no she lives on down the fairway of course but you cant reach her unless you settle with my mistress of the castle first nada was getting cold standing there who is the mistress of the castle the ice queen of course the eye was still screaming that seemed to be its only mode of dialogue then may we talk to the ice queen nada asked trying not to shiver with the chill actually the mistress isnt here right now the eye confided with a conspiratorial wink her clone is here she looks just like the queen though then may we talk with the ice queen clone the ice queen clone dug chortled the eye eyed him you find something funny about that dug perhaps remembering how sensitive the villagers had been decided to back off no im an iscreenclone myself this kid was quick on his mental feet nada realized the eye was mollified sure the eye twisted in its socket so as to look back beyond the door hey mistress the eye screamed theres a luscious eyeful of a maiden to see you demons dont dream have you eyescreened her a voice called back yes i screened the eye screamed theres an i screen with her are they appropriately awed the maiden is shaking and her teeth are chattering nada was shivering cold but decided not to clarify the matter then send them into the cone room and have a scone for yourself the door opened follow my glance the eye screamed looking into the hall there was a dotted line marking its glance nada entered with the screen close behind when she looked back she saw the eye screen scone rolling up the cone room turned out to be shaped like a giant cone unsurprisingly hi its center was an old woman wearing a snowy shroud i am the ice queen crone she said nada realized that of course the clone would not admit to being a copy she was pretending to be the real crone am nada naga and yes yes i heard the eye scream she said impatiently you want to reach the fairy nuff but first you have to lo something for me or i will turn you to luscious slush or maybe slushious mush yeah dug said id like to see you he hesitated as the ice queen clone lifted a cold finger preparing to fanplement her spell i mean that wont be necessary what do you want of us i want a new flavor of eye scream of course one no one ever heard of before what have you got nada was blank but dug came to the rescue no problem how about spinach souffle ice cream for the child who wont eat his vegetables wonderful the ice queen clone cried i love to make children suffer i will make up a potful right away just so long as i dont have to eat it dug said now will you let us go on to see the fairy nuff piers anthony of course just go right down the fairway there she indicated a door hi the side of the cone they went out the door and found themselves on a sunny green expanse there was no snow why this is a golf course dug said surprised it looks like a finely clipped lawn to me nada said as surprised the fanway of course that is where the fan enough would be hi this crazy place what would a fairy want with a lawn dug glanced at her through the screen then shrugged i suppose there is a pun there you know this place what do you call it zanthmight be okay if it wasnt for all the stupid puns they are there for the critics nada explained because the critics cant handle the intelligent puns and they hate to diink theyre missing anything critics are like that he agreed nada grew warm as she walked and had to take off the blanket and then the boots but this was certainly preferable to the snow in the center of the fairway they found a kind of exhibit or marketplace with things set out for inspection this is a fair nada said we must be getting close its some affair he agreed looking around a fairground on a fairway in the center of the fair with flair was the booth of the fairy she was very fair even beautiful with scintillating wings but she looked sad as they approached nada discovered that the fairy was not female but male he was so delicate that he seemed feminine from a distance his booth was set out with decanters of all shapes and sizes containing fluids of many colors are you the fairy nufft nada inquired hesitantly whats it to you snaketailt he snapped cant you read it on the ledger he pointed to the words fairy nuff demons dont dream listen you winged freak dont talk to her like that dug said why not screenbrain the fairy demanded because shes a lovely and good person and shes trying to do her job thats why you androgynous creep nada couldnt help it she was getting to like aspects of dug mundane she kept her mouth shut well you arent any of those things you midgetbrained mundane the fairy retorted so what did you come here for we need a solution dug said just give us a bucket of it and well get out of your face and what will you give me for mat solution you fugitive from dreariness dug paused tit for tat eh no thats the next booth over they looked at the next booth where several barebreasted nymphs perched a man was approaching it hauling along a bag marked tat nada decided not to inquire further dug seemed quite intrigued by the nymphs however his eyes seemed eager to zip over there hauling his head along after them dont forget what youre here for nada murmured he forced himself to remember without perfect success what are those creatures they are nymphs of course females almost without minds existing only for the sport of the moment but what a sport he breathed if you want to have brainless fun she agreed yeah he seemed oblivious to her tone that is evidently just about your velocity the fairy remarked that got dugs attention whats it to you nuff you never heard of play fair play of course the fairy said ouch i walked into that one okay what do you want for your solution piers anthony i want not to be the object of misrepresentation you dont have a solution for that my solutions apply only to others dug considered exactly what kind of misrepresentation are you the object of folk insist on calling me gay when as you can plainly see i am nothing of the kind i want recognition as the sour individual i am let me see if i have this straight you are a fairy therefore folk call you gay exactly i have no idea why they think all fairies are gay dug pursed his lips seeming to think of something obscure maybe this is a problem its better to avoid he said exactly how is your name spelled dug could have read it on the ledger but for some reason his eyes were straying back to the nymphs eff aay eye are why enn you eff eff try spelling it faerie that will change things it just might muff looked extremely dubious which was the way nada felt how could such an irrelevant change affect the attitudes of others very well he touched the ledger and the letters shifted now it read faerie nuff another person approached the booth what are you spelling nuff he asked seriously nothing to interest you clodbrain faerie nuff snapped what a grouch the man said moving away nuff stared after him its magic he breathed right dug agreed now they know youre not gay how about our solution nuff made a negligent gesture take any bottle dug told nada but who said to she asked nuff said demons dont dream so it seemed she lifted a nice decanter of purple elixir pulled off the stopper and poured it into the pail when she set it back on the table it refilled of its own volition she replaced the stopper thank you nuff she said you earned it the faerie said sourly but when she looked in the pail it was empty had nuff cheated them she started to speak but dug beat her to it did we misunderstand the nature of the deal he inquired in what was for him a remarkably peaceable tone fair well nuff said waving nada looked aroundand saw several wells she hadnt noticed before i think its in a well she said so they went to the wells there were five of them labeled a b c d and e one of them must have the solution they could haul away dugs face lighted fairenuff he exclaimed wellenuff we want enuff we want enough yes she agreed perplexed they went to well e which was somewhat isolated from the others well e nuff alone dug said with satisfaction it makes weird sense there was a bucket on a rope nada let the bucket down into the well until it splashed in the water below she drew it up the fluid was purple matching mat of the bottle they had chosen nada poured it into the pail and this time it stayed there good she said relieved good e nuff dug agreed cheerfully they returned the way they had come when they reached the castle of the ice queen clone they walked around itand found themselves immediately in a snowstorm nada had forgotten to bring along her boots and blanket and was suddenly cold again try a drop of solution dug suggested nada dipped her finger in the pail and flicked a drop of fluid out into the snow immediately the storm calmed and a clear path opened before them the solution was working you are really coming to understand how things work here dug she said impressed piers anthony well i always was a quick study he said once i caught on to the rules of nonsense i just had to apply them so it seemed he was young arrogant and a mundane but he did have his points they returned to isthmus village we have the solution dug announced wheres the ship the headman led the way south to the port there was me sinister ship with its great awful censers hanging fore and aft on its hull was its name bigotry nada felt a tingle of horror as she beheld it this ship was made from the disgusting wood of the bigotree no wonder it smelled so bad it was surrounded by an aura of suppression it was impossible for mere to be any joy or freedom near it there seemed to be no sailors on that dread vessel it was a ghost craft bearing no living creature what person could stand to be near it looks good dug said lets get aboard her and douse those censers that meant that nada would have to do it because dug wasnt really hi mis scene he was protected by his screen she sighed silently and got into the dingy little dinghy boat the headman showed mem she set the pail between her knees and took the oars she hauled on mem they were heavy but she heaved hard and made them move the headman watched as the dinghy moved out she was alone except for the screen boy you sure look great when youre moving like that dug said staring at her front as if things werent bad enough why dont you take an oar she gasped because she was a maiden she did not speak the rest of her thought and shove it somewhere loathsome in fact because she was a princess she could not even think of it in greater detail frustrating as it was she suffered the same sort of repression the censorship brought to the isthmus only hers could not be doused by any solution she wished that just once she could step out of her role and do something fiendishly unprincessly demons dont dream meanwhile the awful mood of the ship intensified there was an ambience of gloom hatred and loathing the snip was here on a mission of destruction seeking to extirpate not only all pleasure in life but ultimately life itself total repression so that it would no longer be possible even to breathe and all the victims could do was expire and rot away what a cargo of malice her breath was getting short and not just from her effort of rowing it was as if a depressing weight were bearing down on hei squashing out her strength and will how much longer could she continue the dinghy touched the somber hull okay tie the boat close and carry the solution up mere dug said this isnt nearly as hard as i thought it would be nada tried to make an angry remark but the overpowering fumes of the censers left her barely able to breathe so she took the pail in one hand and grabbed a rope ladder with the other she hauled herself up rung by rung until she made it to the deck great dug said what an antique this is i wish i had a model of it nada just wished he could be physically here to suffer the effects of this ship of doom she dragged herself across the dark planking toward the nearest censer it was as if she were climbing a mountain and the slope got steeper with each step she had to drag each leg forward through a seeming miasma that clung like rotten goo every breath seemed to bring in a thick sludge of vapor that soiled her tenderest innermost recesses she closed her eyes and plowed on come on nada youre real close dug said encouragingly just a couple more steps then heave the pail up and slop some in two more steps it might as well have been two more worlds nada couldnt even keep her feet any longer the stench from the looming censer was overpowering her last resolve and she was falling the pail was tilting its precious solution about to spill out across the deck wasted piers anthony hands caught her and the pail come on weve got to get this done dug said we cant give up now he coughed phew what a stench he lifted the pail from her slackening grasp and lurched forward his breath wheezed his body trembled he seemed to be swept back by a sickly wind but he fought forward just a little more closing the grudging gap between the pail and the censer he heaved the pail up tilted it and splashed some solution into the censer there was a pouff and a hideous cloud of vapor spread up and out it soiled the air then thinned and faded away the incense had been extinguished for the first time she saw the lettering on the censer hatred a breath of clean air swept in nada sprawled on the deck inhaled how sweet it was they had done it they had overcome the censorship the isthmus would be free then another whiff of awfulness came nada looked and saw the far censer they had extinguished only one of the two the job was only half done she dragged herself up she had no idea now she would ever make it the length of the ship and to the other censer she would just have to try oh brother the other one dug said staring across at it i dont think i can make it as her mind cleared nada realized something dug youre in the scene he looked around startled i guess i am how did that happen it means you believe she said i dont believe i just couldnt stand to see you struggling like that when im the one who got us into this tiling it wasnt fair you must believe im real or you wouldnt care he stared at her i guess maybe i do men he shook his head not really believing his own belief maybe its just that when i realized this was serious i had to believe i couldnt let censorship win even in a joke land like demons dont dream this he smiled well maybe we can make it to the other censer together maybe we can she agreed take my hand he took her hand then they walked together across the deck it was much easier now there was far more strength in unity that she had imagined also she now knew mat the solution worked and that gave her more courage what they were doing wasnt pointless all they had to do was do it right and the censorship would be finally defeated the fumes intensified but their effect was no longer overpowering the two of mem forged onward not even slowing they reached the grim censer and dug lifted up the pail and poured out more of the solution the fumes stopped a glow came from the censer but not of burning incense it was the glow of clean daylight the gloomy cloud surrounding the ship was dissipating and the deck was brightening they had defeated the second censor censer more readily than the first nada looked at it its letters said ignorance hatred and ignorance dug murmured awed the two pillars of bigotry and ill bet this is the ship of fools too because only fools would let such bad things govern mem and only fools would try to stop all others from saying or even thinking what they wanted to nada said fortunately we dont have a lot of that in xanth we have plenty in mundania though he said i guess thats what makes it such a dreary place he looked around damn im glad to be here then he laughed hey i swore it didnt get bleeped out the censorship really has been beaten it really has been she agreed for now but it will surely be back once it returns to its source and gets its censers restored i guess so too bad but lets get off it and get back to isthmus village we have a whole adventure to get through so they did this was only the beginning water kirn was glad to get out of the ogre fen ogre fen she knew herself to be a smart and therefore unattractive girl but it had taken all her ingenuity to outsmart those stupid ogres she wanted no more such encounters this was after all supposed to be a fun game wasnt it so which is the fastest way to the good magicians castle she asked jenny elf well its south but we shouldnt go that way what do you mean shouldnt go that way why not kim remembered how jenny had warned her against messing with the ogres and in retrospect she appreciated that advice more than she had in futurespect henceforth she would pay more heed to the advice of her companion because of the elements kim remembered oh yes those five regions in northcentral xanth air fire water earth and the void going from south to north what jenny asked seeming confused whats the problem demons dont dream thats not the order of course it is i read it in the visual guide theres a map well the guide is wrong is it a mundane book of course that explains it mundanes dont know about magic well ive have to see it to believe it we should be closest to the void and south of that is earth youre right about the void but the next one down is water the water wing in the shape of i get it it has little waves on it too and fire is in the shape of flames and air is like a puffy cloud everythings punnish in xanth okay lets circle the void and go see the water wing you dont really believe me jenny said i didnt say that but it was true kim didnt believe that the map was wrong it was in print after all maybe we should go east to the sane jaunts river jenny said the birds are there but they wont bother us if we didnt do anything to annoy mem why should birds bother us anyway we can just shoo mem away some of them are big birds big birds is that another pun i dont think so i mean rocs rocksoh rocs the hugest of birds like roxanne roc in the nameless castle yes we dont want to bother any rocs they know were in the game but still we shouldnt take chances they had taken chances in the ogre fen and almost gotten wiped out kim could have sworn that her hair got wet when the brute dunked her screen that was her imagination of course but it had been uncomfortable at the time she didnt want anyone turning her screen upside down again either she had felt giddy as the whole landscape inverted and swung around just bow an ogre could grab her screen she didnt know it was just the picture of piers anthony xanth she saw but funny things always did happen in xanth okay lets go by the birds kim agreed id like to see a roc anyway as long as im on this tour from a distance she no longer wanted to see any monsters up close because now she was afraid that one of them would smash her screen or eat it and it would go dark and exclude her from the game she wasnt yet ready to quit the game by a long shot they found a path that went east these were not enchanted paths kim understood because those were reserved for regular xanth folk it was just the games excuse to force the players into outoftheway places where they could get into trouble ff players were allowed to use the enchanted paths there wouldnt be much challenge anyway it was surely more interesting along the bypaths in due course they came to the bank of the river kim was disappointed she had hoped that it would be a real fantasy spectacle but it was just a meandering stream similar to any in her own realm however the plants along its banks were interesting she recognized a pillow bush and a pie tree if only she could eat a meal here and stay the night so she could use these things but it was her fate as a mere player never to actually be in the land of xanth she hated that limitation some plants were unfamiliar they looked like hollow straws sticking up from the foliage what are those she asked jenny looked ohstrawberries we use them to drink tsoda pop strawberries she should have known farther along there was an odd stick on the ground jenny picked it up holding it so that kim could see it she discovered a red pair of lips on its surface dont tell me let me guess she said lipstick of course jenny agreed some girls use them to make then lips stick to things more firmly ive never been demons dont dream quite sure why unless theyre afraid their kisses are too short the ground shuddered something large and solid was coming jenny hid behind a tree and kim peeked past her shoulder it was an animal with a bovine body horns and a weird widemouthed head it sniffed the air smelled jenny and looked at her with its bulging eye croak it bellowed croak kim asked well its a bullfrog jenny explained the creature leaped into the river made an enormous splash and disappeared under the surface it was a bullfrog all right they walked on along the river kim half hoped she would see a water dragon but she didnt it was like mundania the creatures were there but seldom to be seen maybe it was just as well are we south of the void yet she asked after a bit maybe we should cut back west now i dont think so jenny said cautiously oh come on lets go see kim found a path and forged along it no no jenny cried its not safe but kim was being willful again she knew it but also knew that she was tired of walking down the river she wanted to see the water wingor the earth region to verify that her map was correct she came abruptly to a line of demarcation the trees of the forest were reasonably normaland then there just didnt seem to be anything much it wasnt exactly a wall or precipice she just didnt seem to be able to focus on it how odd stop jenny cried from behind dont take one step farther oh dont be silly kim retorted i cant take a step here anyway im just looking at it through the screen except that she wasnt exactly looking she was just well trying to look piers anthony so she moved forward suddenly there was a scene ahead a gently sloping valley with lush green turf and pretty little flowers of several colors sprinkled throughout pleasant puffy clouds drifted above delicate columns of mist hovered over a lake and the air was sweet oh this is nice she breathed then the view jerked and turned sideways the terrain spun horrendously hey kirn cried whats happening there was a change of scene suddenly there was jenny elf her arms spread wide hands clenching on something the lovely landscape was gone what are you doing kim demanded i saw a really beautiful place and i want to go back there im hauling you out of the void jenny said youre lucky i managed to catch hold of the back of your screen otherwise you would have been gone because nothing can cross out of the void once it is past that boundary but i was just looking kim protested im immune to getting caught because its just a picture to me well your screen was getting caught jenny retorted and what happens to your role as a player if you fall into the voidr that sobered her i lose she admitted and i have to start over again with the hazards at least as bad thats no good even if i do lose the first time i want to get just as far as i can so i know what to look out for next time thank you jenny you did the right thing thats all right jenny said but she looked shaken and kim knew why it was now twice mat kim had willfully gotten them into trouble til try to behave better really i will kim said contritely but jenny still looked wary they returned to the river and moved on south suddenly a huge bird took off ahead of them perhaps startled by their approach that must be a roc kim exclaimed but then she saw that it had four legs with hooves and the head of a horse noits a winged horse demons dont dream an alicorn jenny said i never saw one of those before a what an alicorn a winged unicorn there arent many but sometimes a griffin and a unicorn will meet at a love springwell i dont know what happens but men we have alicorns what do you mean you dont know what happens kim said sharply i read about how you were inducted into the adult conspiracy at age fourteen and you must be fifteen now only a year younger than meand know what happens youre mundane jenny said mundanes have funny ideas about things but for the purpose of this game im still a child with the limits of a child professor grossclout decreed it so i cant know anything mats in the adult conspiracy even if i might know out in real xanth why should you be defined as a child kim asked surprised so i will have the innocence of a child thats an advantage in some situations i may be able to help you get somewhere or do something that an adult couldnt that would be interesting kim said very well we wont discuss how alicorns come to be they get delivered by the stork or whatever yes they moved on kim never did get to see a water dragon but she realized that there was plenty of xanth to go yet it was clouding up a storm was building in the sky xops jenny said try to stay out of sight that looks like fracto who cumulo fracto nimbus the meanest of clouds he always blows an ill wind if theres anything interesting happening he comes and wets on it i oh pooh kim said intrigued now she remembered ftacto with contempt im not afraid of any ot cloud piers anthony a vague face formed on the cloud i heeeard thaaaht fracto puffed so what youre just a bag of wind ixnay jenny was murmuring dont work him up but it was too late the angry cloud was swelling up like a toad with gas looming over diem already the first cold gusts of wind were coming bearing the first fat drops of water fractos mouth pursed and blew out a much fiercer wind containing flecks of sleet they were in for it im sorry kirn said realizing that mis could indeed be mischief i guess my big mouth has gotten us into another its all right jenny said without overwhelming enthusiasm lets see if we can maybe get up hi a tree so we dont get flooded out its not all right kirn said youve been trying to do your job but im justwell i know im no beauty so i try to make up by being smart with my mouth its a defensive mechanism only sometimes im doing it when i shouldnt like right now and making it tough for you so ill try to watch it okay okay jenny agreed with an appreciative smile meanwhile they had fractos rage to deal with jenny cast about for a suitable tree to climb but all the trees in view were wrong in separate ways some had tall featureless trunks not easy to climb some had thorns and many were too small sammy find us a close tree to climb jenny said to the little cat sammy bounded off wait for me jenny cried chasing after him kirn followed her screen just seemed to go wherever she looked exactly as if she were really hi the scene and much of the time she forgot that she wasnt kirn heard a faint eerie music it was enchanting but too distant to be intelligible they crossed an open area kirn saw a giant spreading acorn tree beyond easy to climb and sit in the cat knew exactly where to go but fracto chose this moment to demons dont dream strike with all his fell force a solidwell liquidsheet of rain came down to smite them the water smacked into her screen blurring it she wished she had windshield wipers sammy jenny cried diving down the cat had gotten swept into a sudden gully washer which was taking advantage of a gully and he was getting washed away to the side jenny grabbed him but then fell into the gully herself more rain poured down sluicing across the scene kim grabbed a handkerchief and tried to wipe her screen but her hand just passed through it without effect how silly to mink she could affect a scene within the computer game mi jenny cried being carried along by the rushing water she was flailing but couldnt get free because she was holding the cat with one hand and water was coursing in from all around there was a rumble of satisfaction from fracto he was succeeding in messing them up kim followed along unable to do anything to help she felt really guilty because she was the one who had set off the irascible cloud while jenny was the one paying the consequence jenny she called knowing it was point but maybe she could help she could go ahead and see if mere were any good places to get free of the gullywash then she could tell jenny and she could get out of there but the storm just seemed to get worse and she just couldnt see anything other than bits of overhanging branches and more water flowing in all the world seemed to be water again she heard that eerie music it was as if someone were singing and playing a stringed instrument it was ethereally lovely but still too faint to understand the gullywash became a stream and the stream a river rfan tried to find a shore or even a shallow place but the kites had retreated leaving a broad expanse of water with piers anthony still more rain pelting down to trouble the surface jenny was being carried into a veritable sea then she heard a sinister rushing sound that sounded likelike a waterfall right ahead she hurried back to find jenny who was doing her best to stay afloat with die cat her hair and clothing were matted and her spectacles were thoroughly fogged you have to get out kirn cried theres a waterfall sammy perked an ear he meowed jenny smiled he says its only a cataract she reported a cataract naturally the cat wouldnt worry about that but it remained a serious matter for a person you dont want to go through that kirn said who knows where it leads i dont have much choice jenny said sadly im sorry i wasnt a better companion for you but if you move on south maybe you can still find the good magician and go on with me game dont be silly kim said im not going to leave you here but how could she do anything useful the sound of the cataract swelled within it seemed to be that eerie melody not quite drowned out tantalizingly familiar as if mere were a damsel with a dulcimer somewhere beyond but between her and hem was the crashing water kim floated along trying desperately to mink of something and failing the rain was still pouring and a stiff wind was boosting jenny right on toward the disaster maybe it wasnt so bad maybe it was just a little bit of rapids and then the water would drain off to the side and jenny could scramble out onshore run went ahead to take one more look it was much worse man she had had any right to fear there was a misty veil and beyond it a plunge into a dark ocean that seemed hopeless she turned back to find jennyand the elf was already there being carried right into die plunge jenny shrieked as she floated over the brink kim dived for her her hands caught hold of something demons dont dream then she too was hauled over the brink instead of saving jenny she had just gotten herself into trouble they fell seemingly endlessly water was all around in columns below was a frightening whirlpool they plunged into it jenny was swirled away kim inhaled to try to scream but breathed water she choked then something was hauling her she struggled feebly to no avail whatever it was would have its way with her she landed on a warm grassy bank she blinked seeing the head and shoulders of a man she had been rescued jenny she gasped jenny elf shes in there the man dived under the water a fluke showed as he disappeared a fluke kim sat up coughing out pockets of water she was utterly bedraggled but safe and the rain had stopped but where was she then jenny elf appeared still holding sammy she seemed to be swimming rapidly but without effort just halfway sliding across the water kim blinked then realized mat jenny was being carried by the man who seemed not to need his arms for swimming how strange the man set jenny on the bank beside kim she was smaller than kim had realized being only about twothirds her own height but of course she was an elf other elves of xanth were even smaller the man started to haul himself out of the water eeeek jenny cried you cant change here im not in the adult conspiracy oops the man said then i remain in merform for the nonce he flipped up his nether section and lo it was a green tail he was a triton a man with the tail of a fish thank you for saving us jenny said i am jenny elf and this is kim a player in the game im her companion ff i may ask i am cyrus merman the man said son of morris merman and the siren my mother makes beautiful music but she no longer makes it for strangers piers anthony that music kirn exclaimed that was the sirens song cyrus looked chagrined oh you heard it we thought no one was near my mothers music always leads strangers to trouble so she never she didnt know jenny said we were just passing and then we ran afoul of fracto and he blew up a tempest and washed us into the water wing the water wing kirn cried with recognition thats where we were heading you picked a treacherous route cyrus remarked it was fortunate i happened to be near of course i was near because i was listening to my mothers music i dont have a wife to keep me distracted you see i thought the siren stopped her music kirn said perplexed i read how chester centaur destroyed her instrument where the magic was for a long time she wouldnt sing or play at all cyrus agreed but there are so few people in the water wing dial it seemed safe so she remade her magic dulcimer and now my father and i love to listen the music doesnt hurt anyone it is just incredibly fascinating to men who must come and listen to it the problem is that they tend to forget what they are doing and crash their ships into rocks or do other foolish things but my father and i are used to it and anyway we are unlikely to drown so we just listen and enjoy it oh i would like to hear some more of it before we go kim said all i heard was so faint but i loved it my aunt the gorgons talent affected only men when she was young cyrus said but when she matured so did her power until it affected everyone even animals i think the same is true for my mothers talent then we should listen before we go jenny said because kim wants to experience all the things of xanth as she goes along cyrus turned his handsome gaze on kim what is this demons dont dream game you are playing he inquired you look like an attractive but otherwise ordinary young woman to me kim opened her mouth but stalled out before speaking attractive shes mundane jenny explained she won a talent contest and the prize was to be the first to play the demons xanth game of companions somebody else sneaked in and was first so shes actually the second but still shes playing the game were going down to ask the good magician how to proceed since we dont know where the prize is or even what it is i mean its a magic talent but we didnt know what talent cyrus considered i suspect it is a good talent so as to provide a strong incentive for the players i suppose it would be especially strong for mundanes who otherwise can never have magic kim finally found her voice it hardly matters since i can never actually be in xanth all i can do is play a role from the other side of the screen the screen he asked blankly this one kim put her hand out to touch it and froze astonished your screen is gone jenny exclaimed now i remember you grabbed my hand trying to stop me from going over the waterfall but instead i pulled you down i must have pulled you through the screen but you couldnt have kim protested theres no direct contact cyrus smiled are you saying that i merely imagined hauling you to shore it certainly seemed like contact to me kim reached down to touch the ground it was solid she touched jennys shoulder it was there she reached for cyrus then hesitated by all means touch me the merman invited in fact lean over the water and i will kiss you that should be contact enough was he daring her or teasing her kim decided to take piers anthony him up on it after all she would never have another chance to kiss a merman uh i dont mink jenny started worried kim leaned forward and cyrus leaned forward and their two faces met they kissed it was wonderful you are an effective kisser cyrus remarked smiling i must be here kim said dreamily you must have taken the second step jenny said now you believe in magic so it seems all the way real kim agreed but i know it isnt but in xanth illusion is part of our reality cyrus said so if you have the illusion that you are here that is good enough for me you must come and meet my parents jenny looked alarmed tm not sure but i want to hear the siren sing kim said id love to meet your folks cyrus excellent allow me to go change when my mother changes she can form a sequined dress at the same time but i have never mastered that ability i shall return he swam away changes kim asked they can turn their tails into legs jenny explained but men they are bare as a juvenile im not allowed to see a bare man that is why i had to stop him from changing before oh changing from merform to manform kim said then she thought of something else why were you alarmed when he offered to introduce us to his parents in xanth people mostly meet people just as they are jenny explained but if they bring their parents in it means they may be getting serious serious like maybe getting married married kim exclaimed astonished he likes you hes not married so but im only sixteen demons dont dream so maybe he would have to meet your parents too prince dolph was still fifteen when he married electro jenny smiled i understand they had a time trying to figure out how to signal the stork because neither knew but they did manage to do it this is ridiculous im not about to get married certainly not to signal any stork this is only a game maybe its not a game to him remember you did kiss him thats a pretty strong sign jenny shrugged of course im not parry to the adult conspiracy so maybe im all wrong kim was nonplussed she was not at all sure the elf was wrong she liked the merman but this was getting ridiculous maybe we had better get on out of here men maybe we had better jenny agreed they stood and kim became aware of two things her clothing was sodden and chafing because of the dunking and jenny was not only smaller than she was she had pointed ears and fourfingered hands she was different not only from kim but from other xanth folk but already cyrus was returning now he was with legs and he wore a shirt and trousers he looked twice as handsome as before it was too late to get away and it would have been impolite to go without waiting anyway kim realized that she wasnt eager to separate from him quite yet for all the mischief it might portend mat kiss had been fun back home no boy had kissed her and complimented her the way the merman had right this way ladies cyrus said grandly my folks are expecting you kim wasnt quite sure how she felt about mat but she did want to meet the siren about whom she had read they followed cyrus along a pleasant path soon they came to a nice little house it seemed to be made of glass but me glass shimmered as if not quite solid cyrus saw her looking water bricks he explained lacunas son ryver made them for us water bricks may i touch one she asked timidly piers anthony certainly they are tough its just his magic hes good with water thats a talent we respect here in the water wing kim gingerly touched a brick it was soft but resilient giving way only a small amount before resisting like a velvetcovered block of stone ryver was indeed good with water the door opened and a lovely older woman stepped out this was the siren come in come in she said we have set the table for you set the table but kim knew she couldnt eat because she wasnt really here or could she about all she could do was try it and see what happened then the siren got a closer look but youre soaking wet both of you come inside well have you dry and changed in no time inside it was pleasantly warm a fire was burning in the hearth the sticks there were translucent and colorless waterlogs of course ryver wasnt the only one who was good with water the siren bustled them into a lavatory whose walls were fortunately lined with opaque water bricks and helped them out of their sodden clothing and put them into nice fresh dresses jenny looked much improved her regular trousers and jacket had made her look like a child while now she looked more ike a young woman a very petite one by human standards but still ladylike you look wonderful kim jenny said which was what kim should have said to jenny first you too she said belatedly but she sneaked a peek at the ice mirror on the wall and saw that she did look rather nice in contrast to her usual maybe the magic of xanth was enhancing her too bad she didnt have that magic in mundania they went out to join the family kim tried to remind herself that this was all just a game setting but it did indeed seem like a friendly backwoods family and she liked demons dont dream it maybe fracto had done them a favor blowing them here so that cyrus had had to rescue them morris merman was a handsome older man also wearnig legs and clothing for the occasion so youre cyrus young woman he said affably kim knew she should demur but she didnt quite know how she looked desperately at jenny jenny tried kim is just passing through this is a game to her a game morris exclaimed that was a serious kiss kims emotions were getting so mixed it was as if someone were stirring a big wooden spoon in them she loved being complimented but knew she couldnt afford to be taken seriously i mean shes a mundane just visiting xanth and a mundane the siren said it was sounding worse and worse maybe we can talk later kim said uncomfortably but underneath her embarrassment was the wild excitement of recent developments she had made the giant second step and now seemed to be right in xanthand a handsome magical man had kissed her and called her attractive who needed to win the prize this was fun enough the siren served water cress water chestnuts water lemon water rice and water fowl served on water lily leaves for a beverage there was seltzer water this was after all the water wing somewhat dubiously kim tried her first mouthfuland it seemed real so her belief was strong enough now to make it work relieved she went ahead and enjoyed her meal then they sat before the fire and the siren played and sang for them it was absolutely beautiful and wonderful and it evoked emotions kim could not define she wanted to be here always piers anthony now we must talk cyrus said there is something i would like to ask you kim mundane oh i really dont know very much about things here kim had thought she knew a lot but she had made so many mistakes that she realized she was an ignoramus he was unfazed as you know i am unmarried i am twentyeight years old and it is past time but until now i have not had much opportunity to find a suitable woman now i think i see that opportunity oh no kim had almost forgotten about that she loved mis adventure but she knew she couldnt stay and she knew she couldnt marry anyone here she didnt want to hurt anyones feelings especially not anyone as handsome and nice as cyrus she looked at jenny but it was evident that the elf didnt know what to say either kirn had once again overridden jennys cautions about kissing cyrus and meeting his parents and thus sent signals she had not properly understood how was she going to get out of this pewter dug was glad to be on the way again with a knapsack of supplies and some weapons that business with the censorship had seemed like a joke but had turned deadly serious maybe that was because it was all too easy to joke about serious things avoiding really coming to terms with them he had never much liked censorship mainly because it always seemed to cut out the fun parts of anything he wanted to read or watch but he hadnt taken it seriously until he had seen nada naga struggling across the deck of the ship trying to do the job that he dug had undertaken to do that just wasnt right suddenly he had come to believe in the importance of the mission and with that belief it seemed had come acceptance of the larger situation the realization mat some genuine values underlay all the funny fantasy stuff he was seeing maybe he didnt really believe in magic but he did believe in those values and was willing to sacrifice in order to support them maybe most people went through life without ever discovering such values maybe even poking fun at them but those were empty people who didnt count piers anthony of course he also happened to be with a beautiful woman and wanted to impress her that had to figure in she had let him know early on mat she was not about to go on a date with a mere player but maybe if he did something really worthy she would change her mind so he had had that other reason to get into it she might be a mere fantasy character in her fantasy setting able to do a type of magic nobody in his right mind would believe but she was the loveliest creature he ever expected to see even if he never got to first base with herin fact even if he never came up to bat with herhe wanted her faint favor he wanted her to remember him as more than a teenage jerk from mundania that potential memory had become very important to him they were walking east proceeding along the isthmus toward central xanth because mis was a game mere was bound to be another challenge soon things never just carried along smoothly in games that was why he had wanted supplies and weapons though nada had claimed mat they were unnecessary she had said mat mere were many tilings to eat along the way and that it was her job to protect him from harm so he would not have to defend himself but he didnt want to depend on the largess of the land for food a good game would see mat they wound up hungry at some point and he certainly didnt want to depend for protection on the woman he wanted to impress so maybe she thought he was being foolish but he was playing it smart he hoped actually he sort of hoped for a bit of trouble to come because he wanted an excuse to try out his new weapon it was a magic sword the grateful isthmus village headman had given him it was supposed to be infinitely light for the user and infinitely heavy for the opponent what mat meant was that he would never get tired swinging it but if he used it to fend off an opponents blow it would be as solid as a boulder so nobody would brush his sword aside to get at him he was no expert swordsman but mis demons dont dream should give him a great head start in using his weapon if only he could find a pretext to try it out they came to a river it wasnt broad or savage but it was big enough so that it was clear that they could neither jump over it nor wade through it the path went up to the bank and resumed on the far side maybe meres a boat dug said looking along the bank i fear not nada said why are mere alligators in the water so we cant swim i see no allegations but i think there is normally a bridge mat must have been removed before we arrived to make the river a challenge to cross he said well it doesnt seem like much of one if it is safe to swim we can do that l am not sure we can you see mis is my liability he glanced at her if you have any liabilities i sure cant see them i have princessly limitations oh yes there had been a mention of that like what i may not show my human body to a man who is not my husband oh you cant go naked because youre a princess yes an ordinary woman could do so if she chose provided mat the one who saw her was not underage you are not quite underage though mere are those who would argue the case but as a princess i must set a perfect example of propriety so human nudity is impossible for me in this instance and allowing a man to see my uh undergarments would be worse worse you mean that bra and panties are worse man she blushed please dont use such terms in mixed company they are integral to the adult conspiracy dug sighed inwardly he had sort of hoped to get a look at her body coincidentally pretending not to notice but piers anthony the game makers had scotched that what about using your snake form that doesnt count as naked does it no serpents have no concerns about nudity neither my full serpent form not my natural naga form presents any problem but if you wish me to accompany you in my human form there is a difficulty he did prefer her in human form she might be the worlds most beautiful serpent but he was no judge of serpent beauty he had more of a notion of human beauty and she had that in overflowing measure okaysuppose you cross in serpent form and then change back to clothed human form when youre dry i must resume human form in order to don my clothes i can leave them behind when i change to serpent form but i can not don them in serpent form so she had to be a naked woman before she could be a clothed woman it figured so ill turn my back while you change will that do it it may but i fear trouble and i must try to protect you from it you mean something will maybe attack us when my eyes are closed but your eyes will be open wont they so we wont be unprotected she looked doubtful but nodded then lets do it he said briskly this hazard is a lot easier to handle than a dragon she still looked dubious but did not argue but its okay for you to see me he asked no impropriety mere if you do not object she agreed actually he would not ordinarily care to have a woman see him naked but this was different in several ways first it was only a game so wasnt really happening second if he couldnt see her body maybe be could get a little bit of the feeling by letting her see his body this gave him just a flicker of comprehension how a flasher might feel third he wanted to show mat nakedness was no big thing in the faint hope that eventually she might agree demons dont dream bat mainly he wanted to get across mat river and he didnt want to get his clothes or supplies wet so he just had to do what had to be done he went ahead and stripped not letting himself think about it too much it was a funny thing disrobing in a game that seemed so real but sort of exhilarating too it made him feel free as if civilized hangups were being dumped along with the clothing could mis be the way nudists felt he was getting an education in feelings from me oddest situations naked he didnt look at nada in fact he didnt face her either he just jammed his things into the top of his knapsack and closed it tight then he waded into the wain holding the knapsack up when he was deep enough to swim he went into modified sidestroke so he could keep the knapsack clear of the water it was easy enough and be hoped nada was impressed soon he was across as it really wasnt very far he found bis footing and walked on out he set down the knapsack and shook himself dry still facing away from the princess okay you come on across he said i wont took no you must watch she said because there could be some other danger such as a harpy attacking while i am defenseless i watched you and you must watch me okay he said surprised he got into his underpants and turned his body was not yet dry enough for the rest of bis clothing nada was in her naga form a serpent with her human head her clothing was neatly bundled she must have done it while in her human form then changed before he tamed but how was she going to carry her bundle then she assumed full serpent form the snakes mouth opened wide and bit down on the bundle the serpent slithered smoothly into the water she was carrying her handle as readily as he had carried bis but now he understood her point if something attacked ilier right now she would be unable to fight back because piers anthony her jaws were taken by the clothing if she dropped the clothing to tight then she would be unable to dress when she resumed human form later it would be quite awkward so he had to protect her in this moment of her vulnerability that made him feel obscurely good fortunately nothing attacked the serpent completed die crossing dropped the bundle and became the naga finish dressing the human head said dug hastily did so then he turned to face away so that nada could change first to human form then to human clothing he picked up the knapsack to close it up again and put it on then he noticed the shiny buckle on it shiny buckle reflective if he held it up just so could he possibly manage to see he fought with himself could it be so bad to catch just a distorted glimpse if she didnt know how could a creature invented as a game character know or care especially when she thought the real crime was showing panties it wasnt her panties he wanted to see he lifted the knapsack angling it so that the buckle turned the reflection showed the tops of trees then the river then suddenly the screen was blank dug was back in his room staring at a dead computer screen a system malfunction no way he had done it he had broken a rule and the game had kicked him out bleep he looked around everything seemed so infernally mundane not like the pretty colors and magical contours of the game he had never realized before exactly how dreary ordinary life was why had he done it he had known he wasnt allowed to look at the body of the princess he hadnt known that the game had this way of enforcing its rules but mat didnt matter the point was that he had tried to do wrong and had been punished for it oh nada naga im sorry he breathed experiencing cutting remorse then he seemed to hear something he cupped an ear demons pon t dream listening he didnt hear anything but taint words appeared in the screen dug dug where are you it was nadas speech very faint but definite the lockoat wasnt complete tm out in mundania he answered then remembering he typed it on the keyboard there was a pause was he getting through the screen remained dark except for the faint glow where a speech balloon might be dug is that you i cant see you my screen went blank he said as he typed it what happened there was no point in trying to conceal it i tried to see you he typed in the buckle on the knapsack im really socry and i apologize i deserved my punishment the screen brightened now he could see nada clothed standing beside the river near her was his fallen knap she turned to face the screen but did you actually see me her speech balloon asked no but it didnt matter i tried after i promised not to fm disgusted with myself tf you didnt see me then i have not been compromised she said i can still be your companion except that im out of the game he typed ill have to start over somehow that seemed dreadful no it is just a warning you can return to mis scene if you are careful dug was abruptly excited i can great ill be really careful he refocused his eyes and in a moment the scene became threedimensional but the screen remained he was seeing the scene without being in it nada peered through the screen at him what is the matter tin seeing it but i cant seem to get back into the icene he said maybe thats my remaining punishment piers anthony no your belief must have been damaged she said can you get it back how could he patch up a damaged belief the game had punished him doubly first by kicking him out and second by reminding him that he was just a figure behind a screen unable ever to be really part of the scene he was never going to go against a game rule again he had gotten into the scene the first time by suffering a realization that there was something of importance underneath the punny facade he had come at it obliquely not quite believing in magic but believing in something so what did he believe in mis time dug closed his eyes searching within himself what was the nature of his belief suddenly he knew what it was he believed in the game because it had had the power to boot him out when he tried to cheat it was a real world there beyond the screen the computer was merely his limited access to it maybe his being in the scene was an illusion but it was a real scene he seemed to be in he might have doubted before but now he believed oh dugyoure back nada exclaimed hugging him hugging him he opened his eyes immediately she drew back oh i have done something unprincesslyr she cried appalled ill never tell he said gallantly but he would never forget either that was the best hug he had ever felt and maybe the best he ever would feel oh thank you for a moment i feared i had disqualified myself no i was the one who almost did that dug looked around all of it was mere he was definitely back in the scene he intended to do his utmost to remain in it because fantasy or reality this was the greatest experience of his life they were across the river which had in its fashion proven to be a much greater challenge than it had seemed demons dont dream nada looked around i see a pie tree she said i feel like doing something wicked after that scare such as eating something fattening can hardly imagine you being fat dug said trying not to look too closely at her body well it certainly wouldnt be princessly but i dont splurge often she walked to the tree and plucked a rich lemon meringue pie would you like some dug she inquired prettily could he eat here there was one way to find out yes thank you she drew a knife from somewhere in her clothing and cut across the pie dug was startled there had seemed to be no place in her costume to conceal such a knife but of course she was a magical creature she might have a magic pocket the rules were different here as he had just been so forcefully reminded she handed him a slice of pie he took it and tried a bite it was delicious it probably wouldnt have been if he hadnt believed but that was no problem now i should explain that companions represent another kind of challenge nada said as they ate we may be approached but only in appropriate manner oh ive learned my lesson he reassured her hastily yes you were penitent and you apologized therefore you were allowed to reenter the game you could not have hugged me but i was able to hug you because you had moved me to do so even if it was unprincessly it was one great hug were i other than a princess it would be easier for you to relate to me dug realized that she was telling him something significant not outright but obliquely that if he wanted for example to kiss her he might be able to do so if he impressed her enough to make her kiss him so the proscriptions werent absolute he just had to learn to play the right it was good to know piers anthony they finished the pie in short order then they resumed their walk after a time a flying dragon spotted mem it veered toward them blowing out anticipatory puffs of smoke dug drew his sword but nada stopped him a sword wont work against a firebreather she pointed out it would toast you before you could use your weapon dug had to agree i guess wed better hide behind a tree men no i will simply scare it away suddenly she was a small snake slithering out of her fallen clothing that was supposed to scare a dragon but once she was free of the clothing she changed into a large serpent in fact it was huge three times the size of the dragon then she lifted up her giant head opened her enormous mouth to show a terrible array of fangs and sent a ferocious hiss at the dragon the dragon didnt argue it made a uturn in air and fled the serpent slithered back to nadas clothes dug didnt need to be asked as he had said he had learned his lesson he also had a glimmer how she could stop him from kissing her by biting his head off he turned and put his face to the trunk of the nearest tree and closed his eyes he waited until nada told him it was all right to look when he did look she was back in her normal lovely human form you are impressive he said he was not referring to her human form thank you she knew what he meant they resumed their trek dug was happy not only had he returned to the game he was now experiencing its full adventure what more could he ask the day was declining we shall have to make camp for the night soon nada said because i am not competent to protect you well against the predators of the night night already it seems like only an hour she shook her head perhaps time is different in mundania it may be that only an hour has passed there demons dont dream but here much of a day has passed i suppose if you prefer to leave the game and return in the morning nuhhi i dont want to get out of the game at all if i can help it i might not manage to get back in she considered that seriously i think you should be able to return if you obey the rules and maintain your belief certainly you should be safer there but shouldnt i be exposed to the danger instead of copping out i mean is that fair play i dont know i think that is your option i understand that it is possible for a player to depart and to return to the game another day without any time having elapsed in the game this is marvelous magic i do not understand but surely convenient for you dug recognized her description of a saved game of course it wouldnt change when not being played well i didnt think i would like this game when i heard about it but i do i want to play it right that means day and night if i win i win if i lose i lose you do not object to sharing a tent with me dug managed to keep his face sober i do not object i will keep my eyes away if you just tell me when she smiled and he realized that he had scored another minor point then we must seek a suitable campsite soon they found one it was marked campsiteenchanted it looked very nice but just what exactly does it mean enchanted he asked it means that bad creatures can not attack here so we may sleep without fear but i thought we couldnt use the enchanted paths this is not a path it is a safe area players are allowed to use these thats a relief because dug had learned to take the fantasy threats seriously he knew that if he got chomped by something that went bump in the night or bumped by something with teeth he would be out of the game he piers anthony could appreciate how dangerous it could be to sleep unprotected there was a big fabric plant growing nearby they harvested some blankets and canvas and soon had used available ironwood poles to fashion a framework there was a box of magic tent pegs mat gripped the edges of the fabric and held them firm nada knew what she was doing a good deal better than he did so he followed her lead the resulting tent did not look professional but neither did it look incompetent they spread pillows from pillow bushes on the ground and the blankets over them then they harvested potluck pies from the pie trees and some milkweed pods dug was getting used to the way puns became real here this was just the way it was in xanth there was a pleasant stream crossing a corner of the protected site nada went there to wash please do not look she said politely dug went to the tent lay down put his head in the pillow and closed his eyes tightly he had always been a quick study and the game had taught him well absolutely no peeking soon she came to the tent your turn she said he got up and went to the river he was not surprised to find it cool and pleasant on his skin he had been reminded that mis was a game from which he could be excluded but also mat while he was in the game it was increasingly real so he no longer questioned that reality he reveled in it whatever the rules of this fantasy land were he would follow them literally from now on nada was sitting up on her pillowbed when he returned she was in a stunning nightdress which actually was far more discreet than it seemed showing no extra flesh dug i must ask you something she said hesitantly all die rules he exclaimed im not breaking any one of mem she smiled of course my concern is this i normally demons dont dream sleep in my natural form but if you would prefer that i retain human form i will i understand mat some people are uncomfortable in the presence of reptiles he needed no thought at all before answering make yourself comfortable nada i know who and what you are ive seen you change to snake form and if wake and find a serpent beside me ill understand because much as he liked her human form he now knew mat it was completely off bounds and he didnt even want to be tempted only if he behaved himself absolutely could he ever hope to be allowed not to behave himself so he was going to do all he could to keep her happy she might be his companion but he was going to be a perfect escort for her too thank you dug her face did not change but her body melted into serpent form the nightdress sagging around it she slithered out of the apparel formed a loose coil and laid her human head on the pillow there would have been a time dug reflected when such a sight would have amazed him but that was history as of a few hours ago he changed into the pajamas she had laid out for him and lay down on his own bed sleep was magically swift and restful dug could not be sure whether he slept eight hours or one or one second because this was a game it could be just a fadeout fadein leading to the next scene but it seemed like slumber next day they came to a sign shortcut to success there was an arrow pointing down a side path does this make sense dug inquired i have not been told about this nada said frowning dont believe that such a sign is normally here that suggests that it has been set up for die game does that mean we have to go that route by no means a challenge set up for the game is as likely to be troublesome as rewarding it may be safer to avoid it and make our own way south piers anthony dug considered about how much farther is the good magicians castle several days at our present pace we shall also have to cross the gap chasm which is formidable and the shortcut might take us there sooner a magical route could take us there in one moment she said two moments at the most but it could also lead us into mischief i suspect it is a gamble which can either help us greatly or complicate things greatly depending on how we manage to handle it what do you recommend now she considered a good halfmoment do you like traveling with me dug forced himself to be subdued yes you would not mind taking several extra days i would not he would not mind taking several extra years with her even if he never got to look at her body then i recommend avoiding this shortcut because i can convey you to the good magician by the slow route while i am not sure what will happen on the shortcut but dug was becoming canny about his real objectives which do you prefer nada she was surprised my preference does not count you are the player i am here to be your companion to help you accomplish your desire in the game except if his desire was to grab her and kiss her failing that his desire was to please her he didnt care about winning the game he just wanted to stay a while longer in this magical land and be with her and make her smile on occasion i would love to be with you extra time he said carefully but i realize that for you this is just a job and i dont want to make it more burdensome than it has to be i can go either the safe slow route or the mysterious adventure route which would you prefer it to be i have to confess that i am femininely curious about that shortcut she confessed femininely but i seriously question whether it is wise so demons dont dream im curious too he said one thing this game had done it had made him figure out his true desire pleasing her was more important than being with her for a longer time so shortcut it is the foolish mundane has made another foolish decision she shot him an appreciative glance that made it all worthwhile regardless of the outcome perhaps not entirely foolish she murmured they followed me shortcut it led to a marshy glade with oddshaped depressions near a sharply rising mountain nada looked uneasy but didnt comment dug sniffed the air what is mat smell did a whale die here after eating a mountain of cabbage nada sniffed oh i dont like this neither do i if thats the good magicians castle ahead he needs to catch up on a centurys worth of baths i fear it is an invisible giant nada said faintly oh is he going to step on us then wed better get onto the shadow of that mountain worse because the ground shook the very trees seemed to jump in fact some did jump as if kicked by an invisible foot then a swatch of nearby forest was abruptly flattened as if the foot had landed on it the smell intensified dug stared that invisible giantyou werent joking a princess seldom jokes another swatch of forest flattened its coming toward us dug cried run for the mountain i fear we have no choice she agreed running with him even distracted as he was by the overpowering stench and the threat of being stepped on dug couldnt help but notice how she looked when she ran he wished he could watch that when not distracted but he would never tell her that of course it wouldnt be mundanely they reached the mountain there was a cave opening leading into a dimly lighted tunnel another invisible foot landed squishing more forest it piers anthony was alarmingly close wed better hide in there dug said not if we can help it nada said he hesitated why not ft cant be worse than here oh it can she said i fear this is pewters cave it shouldnt be here its south of the gap chasm but the shortcut must have conveyed us there a pewter cave you mean it is used to store metal carvings no it another invisible footprint was forming this one was right before them and the ground was rapidly indenting toward them as if a huge boot had landed heelfirst and the sole and toe were coming down the smell had become an intolerable stink they launched themselves into the cave where the boot couldnt reach just in time for me whole region shook and dust stirred everywhere except where the footprint was oh nuisance nada swore we have been driven into pewters lair the shortcut is a pewter plot whats so bad about pewter its just tin and lead an alloy they use to make pretty figurines and things this is com pewter xanths evilest machine she explained he was turned into a nice machine recently but for the purpose of the game he is defined as he used to be he changes reality in his vicinity so as to have everything his way now were really in trouble and its all my fault because i told you to try the shortcut com pewter another stupid pun no i told you we would try it obviously this is a special game challenge so ill just handle it and go on no sweat you cant just handle pewter she protested he handles you well well see about that dug marched on into the cave having concluded that foolish boldness would impress her more than ineffective caution they came into a larger cave where mere was a collec demons dont dream tion of junk a screen stood up in the center of that pile welcome mundane player it printed so this was the dread machine but dug had learned not to dismiss magic tilings contemptuously they could indeed fight back here in this land of xanth hello com pewter what can i do for you you can serve me forever the magic screen responded apart from that you can forfeit your game no choices in between none well i dont care for those options dug said firmly so ill just be departing now its been nice meeting you mundane player changes his mind oops then again maybe ill stay and chat with you awhile dug said discovering mat his mind had indeed been changed he was beginning to understand what nada had meant about the evil machine changing reality this could be worse trouble than he had figured on now wait you evil machine nada protested you arent allowed to give him a nowin eitheror you have to give him a chance to beat you who says the screen demanded irritably the demon professor grossclout she retorted he set up the rules for the game and if you dont obey princess companion chokes and is unable to complete her sentence the screen printed nada choked and coughed not finishing her sentence but this was enough to give dug the hint so its tins demon big cloth who runs the game not you and he says you have to give me a fair chance which means you have to give my companion a chance to advise me otherwise otherwise what ignorant mundane dug did not like being called ignorant but since mat ac peers anthony curately described him in this situation he let it pass he made a flying guess otherwise you forfeit screenforbrains and i win now let nada go girl completes her irrelevant remark the screen printed grudgingly grossclout will make mush of your crockery brain nada finished i would like to see him try nada rose to the challenge if i snap my fingers he will appear she said because thats my signal for game interference she held up her hand fingers cocked damsels hand goes numb nadas fingers sagged she could not snap mem but i can snap mine dug said want to bet he wont respond to somebodys finger snap from this area ignorant mundanes hand goes numb dug lost sensation in his hand this computer was sharp but now nada was free my hand has recovered she said you cant control bom of us at the same time so now ill snap no need the screen printed quickly it was only a joke have you no humor the mundane will be given an even chance dug had seen that kind before bullies who claimed it was only a joke when they had to back off he had never liked that kind at least they had backed the ornery machine off a bit so ill have an even chance he said getting it officially stated because it was apparent that statements had the force of reality here i shall give you three tasks to perform and nuhufc dug interrupted ill define the rules again he hoped to prevail by getting his definitive statement hi first he knew that any tasks the evil machine set would be almost impossible to accomplish well have a pun riddle contest first one who cant guess the others riddle loses because he was pretty good at riddles demons dont dream nuhttf the screen printed one must answer and the other fail if both answer or both fail the round is null dug had to admit that was fair at least he had defined the nature of the contest okay ill go first he paused but die machine did not object so he dredged up a punnish nottoodirty joke he had heard hoping nada wouldnt object what is spelled with a hymen maidenhead the screen printed ouch pewter had heard the joke now he was down one and if the machine floored him hed be lost how did the demons pull the kissmee river straight what river dug asked blankly hes mundane nada said he doesnt know our landmarks you have to tell him before using them the kissmee river flows southward along eastern xanth connecting the kissmee lake to lake ogrechobee the demons pulled it straight ruining it by what magic did they accomplish this now something clicked there was a river somewhereflorida i thinkthe kissimmeethat the corps of engineers channelized you mean this is a pun on that answer the question dug looked at nada it is true she said the demons did do that you must answer in the real world the demons had simply dug a straight channel and routed the river through it eliminating the meanders it had been reckoned an environmental disaster no magic there and no puns it had been one seriously unfunny business how was he supposed to make a joke of it i guess they used a pushmipullyou spell on it he said without much hope error the screen printed heehee but he wasnt quite lost yet you have to show that piers anthony you have a good answer dug said because if you dont it doesnt count that is true nada said relieved hie evil machine wasnt fazed they pulled the ss straight making them ls thus kissmee became killmee with no more curves and when the ss went straight making them small ls die river became straight too it did make punnish magical sense dug knew he had lost okay pewter you beat me he said what now you are in a dream which is our reality your reality is our dream return to it com pewters screen showed a picture dugs room with his messy bed in the background and used socks on the floor mundaniasuddenly the dreariest possible place he looked at nada im sorry i lost i really wanted to stay with you but i have to go yes she said sadly i have failed you no i failed myself i didnt make the grade he was determined to be a good loser it was all that was left he faced the screen how do it step through so dug lifted a foot and put it to the screen which seemed to grow larger his foot passed through without resistance and landed on his chair in a moment he was through and back in his room he turned and saw nada on the screen but you can play again dug her speech balloon said if you ask for me silence the screen printed then it went dark dug was definitely out of the game hydrogen cyrus merman was about to pose his question to kirn jenny quailed fearing that the pleasant evening was about to become extremely awkward even without much knowledge of the things hidden by the adult conspiracy she could tell that this was an extremely serious matter she had failed to protect kim from this and so had not been a good companion dear perhaps you should give her the background he siren said to her son remember kim is not from xanth and she may not understand otherwise certainly cyrus agreed if it is not too boring jenny knew that kim would not be bored by any postponement of the dread question were sure it will be most interesting she said quickly he smiled it is nice of you to say that jenny elf certainly it interests us but we are natives of mis region oh we want very much to know kim said with all the faint heartiness she seemed able to muster the irony was mat she really did look very nice in the dress the siren had provided and had she been a regular denizen of piers anthony xanth such a union would have been entirely appropriate so cyrus was twentyeight he was still a handsome vigorous man surely nicely experienced who could be good for a girl of sixteen there were many such girls in xanth who would jump at the chance then we must do it in appropriate style morris said for this history has become a play and we like to reenact it on significant occasions jenny and kim exchanged another glance of doubt significant occasion but what could they do except agree hoping that some diplomatic way would turn up to get out of this misunderstanding we must assume roles cyrus said for this narrative concerns the curse fiends and their concern is acting indeed it was from one of their traveling troupes that we learned it of course we can not hope to do it as well as they do but it is more fun being in it ourselves kim found a bit of her voice a play i was interested in acting but she broke off looking troubled oh you were the siren asked solicitously what happened to prevent it ii guess i wasnt right for the part kirn said reluctantly the part cyrus inquired couldnt you have any part you wished kim laughed hardly people have to try out for parts and only a few get the good ones i didnt want to be a person lost in a crowd scene so i tried out for the ingenue the more fool i after that disaster i stayed away from acting ingenue the siren asked the role of the lovely quiet innocent girl but surely mat was perfect for you cyrus exclaimed a perfect disaster im a talkative pushy unlovely girl surely this is not so morris said you have seemed if anything somewhat reticent demons dont dream jenny knew why because of this embarrassing question of marriage but she didnt dare try to clarify that and you have not seemed at all forward the siren said you have been if i may say so extremely well behaved and you are lovely cyrus said even when you were bedraggled i saw the beauty marks on your face beauty marks kim exclaimed those are zits cyrus brow furrowed do they not serve the same purpose in mundania just as jenny elfs freckles add luster to her face jenny jumped she did have freckles as did electxa who was now a princess but she had never been sure they were an enhancement now she saw that kim was trying to suppress a flush this was evidently an embarrassing subject for her perhaps she thought the mertolk were teasjag her yet if they were not it was no better because it meant they believed she was suitable for marriage somehow mis predicament just got worse as die mer people got nicer it is obvious that mundanes know little of character or beauty morris said but as it happens mis is a violent narrative with no important female players would you prefer to assume the role of a prominent male kim was taken aback oh i couldnt but jenny saw a possible avenue of escape here an unfeminine role might be just the thing to divert the notion of marriage you should try it kim she said it could help kim looked at her gradually comprehending a pushy male she said yes that could be good then she glanced at the others i mean a real challenge to portray someone thatthat different that is the heart of acting morris said to assume a role that is quite different from ones own nature and do it effectively this should test your skill well im really not a good actress actor i never got roe chance to be in a play piers anthony until now morris said here are the roles loudspeaker who is die villain he is a powerful magician well kim said dubiously jenny could appreciate why it would be a challenge to play the pan of a male and another to be a villain and another to be a magician when she knew so little of the true ways of such folk i shall be happy to be loudspeaker this time cyrus said it is certainly a challenging role quite unlike my nature morris nodded and there is hydrogen a beneficial magician arent mere any well just ordinary parts kim asked plaintively there are some morris said but i understood mat you wished a leading part this one seems good jenny saw how tempted kim was despite her uncertainty so she gave her a nudge why not try it kim the worst you can do is make an awkward mess of it kim paused assessing the prospect in the manner jenny had if she made an awkward mess she might become unattractive to the merman and he would not ask her to many him it might be embarrassing but for the best so guided by this nudge she agreed i will be hydrogen excellent morris said now loudspeaker being evil has no friends but hydrogen being good does one of these is the young woman bee who is always on call to help so if jenny wishes to he his loyal companion and adviser yes jenny exclaimed i will be bee on call and there is an assortment of other men lesser characters ranging from lowly to magicians with their wives and families my wife and i will fill those roles and she will make the background music so as to generate the realism with a little bit of cooperation and imagination we shall see the scenery form jenny wondered how that could be since the merfolk did not have the magic of illusion but it didnt matter she just hoped that the story would divert cyrus attention demons dont dream from kim so that the play would not be followed by an uncomfortable scene but she wasnt at all sure this would happen now i must explain that in this narration we do not actually move about morris said we only speak our parts it may facilitate the effect if you close your eyes at first until the mood takes hold jenny was glad to oblige she did not fancy herself much of an actor anyway and this made it easier then she realized mat she could contribute in another way by humming because it was her magic talent to form a dream when she hummed mat anybody who wasnt paying attention could enter maybe she could form a dream of what the merman described and they could all seem to be in it but where is the script kim asked script morris seemed perplexed to read our lines from so we know what to say oh nothing like that is needed i will narrate the background and each role will speak as appropriate it is never quite the same twice this gives it renewed vigor oh improvisation kim said i suppose i can try mat she seemed less than certain however now we commence morris said they sat back in their comfortable water chairs and closed their eyes the siren played her dulcimer it was beautiful as before but eerie jenny felt a lukewarm shiver ripple through her spine that music really was magic it was doing things to her imagination so mat she began to see a landscape in fact it was the map of xanth as seen by a flying roc with all its little trees and hikes and the gap chasm jaggedly crossing its center jenny hummed faintly forming her dream from that description it was easy to do working along with the sirens music morris spoke gravely setting the scene in the year following the first wave of successful human colonization of xanth there piers anthony came the seventh wave the human king roogna had died almost a century before in battle with the invading sixth wave and there had been a time of distress but now things were relatively quiet the seventh wave unlike some others was peaceful its members had fled their own land to escape harassment by more powerful groups and did not wish to inflict their ways on anyone else or to do harm to either people or animals they remained together rather than mixing with the human folk already here and married among themselves consequently the magic talents of their children were relatively weak being mostly what is termed the spotonthe wall variety a person could make a spot of color appear magically on a wall but of what real use was it this lack of significant magic made the seventh wavers feel inferior which tended to isolate them even more they were poorly equipped to defend themselves against the depredations of dragons who liked to tease them by snatching them up toasting them with fire and feeding smoked pieces to their offspring often the more talented other wavers were as bad abducting them for slaves they retreated to the deepest wilderness in the most unexplored region of xanth but there were violent ogres there who harassed them by twisting them into pretzel shapes hurling them into orbit around the moon and other nuisances so they built a castle under lake ogre around the vortex that was the gateway to the underworld and there they were able to hideuntil the demons came up from below to interfere with them by molesting their women and twisting their mens heads around to face backward on their bodies demons dont dream we have to have more magic they concluded at last so in the year they set up a research group to discover the secret of magic talents it was an ambitious undertaking they did not want to wait another generation for stronger magic to develop in their offspring they wanted actually to learn to manipulate the talents they already had to make them more effective immediately it was called the talent research group headed by the good man hydrogen whose talent was to make dirty water become clean this was considered to be the best talent the seventh wave had produced which was why he was put in charge even so it was not phenomenal because anyone could duplicate his feat by pouring water through a bag of sand and changing the sand every so often morris paused in the narrative and there was a silence jenny had found herself seeing the group of people beset by dragons hostile folk and ogres finally hiding in the great ogre lake and trying to find magic now she realized that this was only the background it was time for the players to play oh hydrogen she said how are you going to find the secret of magic talents kirn realized that it was her turn why er well just have to study the matter and see what we can come up with then realizing that that was inadequate she added bee go call the others together well have a brainstorming session a storm on a brain kim laughed who knows that might be good magic but what i meant was that we should have a good talk about it and see what ideas we can come up with we cant do anything if we dont have a good plan of action so bee called the others hey others come together hydrogen wants to storm your brains piers anthony there was a shuffle of feet and when jenny closed her eyes again she seemed to see a number of people coming to join them soon her dream took better hold and she saw them clearly we are here one of mem said his voice didnt even sound too much like moms i want you all to make suggestions hydrogen said any suggestions no matter how silly they might sound because the good idea we need may be the one mat seems too silly for anyone else to consider no negative comments are allowed i have heard it said that there is unity in strength someone said i have noticed that our weak talents are sort of similar is it possible that we could get together and reinforce each others talents making one big strong talent its an idea hydrogen agreed but it has never been done before someone objected in xanth talents never repeat then receiving the stares of the others oops that was negative wasnt it i take it back could we change our talents by mimicking otherst another asked all orienting on the same talent thats another idea in harmony with the first hydrogen said how about a talent that will set the ogres back another asked like maybe a powerful curse it seemed good to hydrogen so they got together and tried to emulate the one who had a faint power of cursing and it worked at first all they could do was produce a floating voice saying but in time that unified curse became strong enough to wilt nearby foliage after a year they took their group curse out into the field for field testing a brute of an ogre stood in the field me see he flea he exclaimed as he advanced on the group ready to squish the flea with one swat of a hamfist one hydrogen said counting two three they all threw their pieces of the curse together directly demons dont dream at the ogre it detonated in front of his face it scorched his eyebrows and burned the fur of his nose temporarily blinded the ogre stumbled away swiping at the air he wasnt retreating because ogres didnt know how to do that he was merely advancing in the wrong direction it worked bee cried jubilantly the curse foiled the ogre but it wasnt strong enough to foil a group of ogres so they returned to their laboratory and labored for another year in that time they developed the curse to such a strength that it could blow an ogre into the next scene la feet they were now able to drive the ogres away from lake ogre forcing them to start their long trek across the length of xanth to the ogre fen ogre fen the talent research group was a success but it is not enough to handle dragons hydrogen said grimly we must keep working so they had another brainstorming session and looked for something even more potent they also set to work training the rest of the seventh wavers to unify their talents because though each persons magic was small the accretive effect was large they began to call themselves the curse friends but those on the receiving end of me curses preferred to call mem the curse fiends that was all right their neighbors were learning respect thanks to hydrogens talent research group in three more years they had their second breakthrough they discovered how to expand their talents now hydrogen focused on his original ability to clean water and learned how to tap the basic elemental forces so that he could permanently enhance the properties of any substance loudspeaker a member of me group was now able to expand his talent of amplifying his voice and could use it to create words of power other group members enhanced their own simple talents in the course of me next several years eight of them managed to build up piers anthony their talents enough to enable them to qualify as magicians what a change from their former puniness but now came unforeseen consequences of power each person having tasted more of it than he had ever believed possible wanted yet more resentments flared others wondered openly why hydrogen should be the leader when there were now many excellent talents hydrogen tried to maintain peace but people who had been nice and mild and powerless now were grasping and savage power had corrupted them hi direct proportion to its increase then loudspeaker did the unspeakable he used his words against his own people he used an especially potent word to turn the other members of the research group into green chobees who promptly fled to lake ogre where they were lost they remembered none of their manlike lives and wanted only to chomp men they had very long mouths full of sharp teeth so it was dangerous to get close enough to try to reason with them so there was no alternative except to rename the lake ogrechobee and let them be at least others would be warned of the danger by the name actually there was a bright side now no strangers could wander across the lake and find gateway castle beneath it because the chobees would chomp any who tried only hydrogen escaped because he had been away at the time of the sneak attack he realized that loudspeaker had to be stopped before he caused even more trouble the only one who could stop the evil magician was hydrogen because he was the only other surviving magician among the curse friends loudspeaker you have done a bad thing he said grimly but i will stop you it didnt seem like much of an oath but the people applauded bee went to call other cursewielding actors hydrogen formed them into a new group whose joint curse could be charged with his own elemental energy now they had a weapon capable of destroying loudspeaker the evil magician meanwhile had gone to a region north of the gap chasm in central xanth he had set up demons dont dream a palace formed of spliced words and used other words to enslave the resident fairies harpies and other creatures of the air so that they had to do his bidding there was a chain of linked words around the whole estate and each word was barbed no one could get close without receiving a terrible tonguelashing he had what seemed to be an impregnable bastion but hydrogen assembled his team and they stood on a mountain opposite the palace hydrogen stood at the pinnacle and called across to the evil magician loudspeaker i demand mat you surrender and practice evil no more otherwise we shall blast you out of your fortress their only answer was a barrage of sharp words they flew like daggers and slammed into the wooden shield the heroes hastily erected for hydrogen had expected more treachery and had prepared for it okay you asked for it hydrogen cried with noble righteous ire onetwothree his loyal group hurled their joint curse modified to contain plenty of hydrogens magic it was an air attack it struck the palace and blew it away it whirled around searching for loudspeaker but he was not there he had sneaked out during the night leaving only his sharp words to guard the palace the curse its target undestroyed was unfulfilled it continued to search me area blowing wildly hydrogen had not thought to put dissipation into it in case of failure so it just continued to rush around never relaxing there was nothing to be done except to let it be hydrogen and his band had won the battle but not yet won the war oh fudge hydrogen swore thus mere came to be the region of air where the wind eternally whirled and searched seeking what wasnt there loudspeaker retreated north and set up another small evil empire this time using his words to dominate trolls goblins and other denizens of the earth battalions of mean creatures marched around the central earthworks piers anthony shouting awful insults at any who were foolish enough to come into range it seemed to be another implacable retreat hydrogen sent bee to scout out the territory bee reported that it was an ugly place almost as drear as mundania mundania hydrogen exclaimed what do you have against mundania then reconsidering he said oh i forgot yes it sounds pretty bad so he gathered his force on the ground near the empire and called again to the enemy loudspeaker give it up or we shall bury you the only answer he received was a barrage of thrown spears tipped with the sharpest words yet these plunked into the hasty shield with expressions that caused the groups ears to burn loudspeaker certainly had an evil way with words sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me hydrogen called several of his group were startled they had never heard mat particular expression before and it did not seem to make a lot of sense here in xanth where names could be devastating then they launched a massive adapted curse it looped up across the land and came down directly on the earthworks boom the earth flew up and out with rocks spewing across the landscape and melted rock flowed across the scenery some bits of stone coalesced in the auto form tiny glass teardrops which would have seemed highly significant to mundanes but were merely fragments here but the curse couldnt find its target because loudspeaker had again cravenly fled the curse searched diligently refusing to quit until it had accomplished its mission hydrogen had forgotten to put a dissipation inlo it again there had just been too much on his mind and that detail slipped through the cracks as it were thus came to be the region of earth where the ground demons dont dream continually moved and mountains spewed their intestinal lava out randomly it was not exactly xanths nicest place hydrogen shook his head im having some trouble getting the hang of this heavy magic he confessed meanwhile loudspeaker had moved north again and used more words to dominate firebreathing dragons salamanders and other hot creatures he fashioned a castle of burning words and surrounded it with a ring of fiery language once more he seemed to be securely ensconced but hydrogen refused to quit he brought his group up to the edge of the territory loudspeaker he called now you quit destroying the environment like this or til blast you out his only answer was a fiery word from a dragon the tongue of flame licked against the hasty shield and heated it until it melted the men had to drop it before their fingers got burned so mats the way it is hydrogen said annoyed well til just fight fire with fire then his group fired a curse so hot it set the neighboring air on fire and blazed across the sky until it seared into the castle and blasted it to flaming fragments the very sky caught on fire and it flickered forever after called the aurora a forest on the ground burst into a flame so fierce that it was never possible to put it out but once more the target was missing loudspeaker in cravenly antihero fashion had sneaked out leaving his unfortunate assistants to bear the brunt of the fire curse the fire looked and looked burning everything it encountered but the evil magician just wasnt there so why hadnt hydrogen put a time limit on the curse i really thought we had bun this time he said sheepishly in mis manner came to exist the region of fire where flames were eternal and only creatures of flame could survive for any length of time fireflies and spitfires loved it but few ordinary people or creatures resided mere i guess im just not much of a hero hydrogen confessed woefully piers anthony meanwhile loudspeaker had moved north again into the veriest heart of unknown xanth thinking no one would find him there he settled by a nice lake and compelled the poor fish to serve him and water nymphs had to disport themselves for his satisfaction around his water works a monstrous water dragon curled ready to chomp anyone who intruded water fowl kept sharp eyes out for the approach of any hostile forces it seemed that no one could bother loudspeaker here but hydrogen had not learned how to quit he brought his group to the verge of the lake and sent loyal bee to investigate bee was always on call and always finished her task before starting another she swam quietly through the lake and observed its formidable array of defenses this will be a very wet undertaking she reported so hydrogen came up to the lake and called loudspeaker now you get out of here and become a nice model citizen or ill wash you out his only answer was a great splat of bilge water that almost drowned his group then the water dragon and water fowl oriented on him and massed for an attack well then it will be a water war hydrogen said wetly his group pumped out a curse so wet that it would have drowned the sun if it had struck that orb fortunately he sun had the sense to stay well away from it the curse went splat on the water works and washed everything into the lake it filled the lake to heaping and then piled up into a mountain whose crest foamed angrily looking for its target but loudspeaker was gone again the water searched all over washing a deep depression into the land but could not find him so it made a liquid shrug and settled into flatness overflowing into the west where it formed the halfbaked bog and into the east where it drained off into the sane jaunts river and it was done because surprisethis time hydrogen had remembered to put a time limit on the curse thus came to be the water wing a passive region demons dont dream where men and creatures could reside and interbreed it was a rather pleasant place overall and soon developed a nice community of merfolk who had consideration for the local environment and always welcomed visitors meanwhile loudspeaker had set up operations to the north this was a desolate region where no one cared to go and the truth was mat loudspeaker wasnt too keen on it either but he was running out of options since hydrogen had pursued him to all the nice regions he had to try a nasty one maybe then he would be left alone long enough to build up his army and magic and conquer xanth in style because this was his fell ambition to make all the land slave to his merest whim even if his whim wasnt nice he was collecting a band of whims who would do whatever he wished and whatever no one else wished he had even found a cute female whimsy to entertain his offhours hydrogen was a slow learner as was shown by the time it took him to learn to put limits on his curses but in time he did get there so this time considering that loudspeaker always retreated before the solid curse could score he put bee on the job of cutting off the escape in fact this time she would even make the challenging call hydrogen had a secret reason for this so bee went around to the north then stood at the edge of the ugly place and called out the challenge loudspeaker quit this funny business and give up your bad magic or i will curse you into irrelevance her only answer was a whimsical blob of garbage that went splat against her shield so bee called hydrogen and told nun about it and he swore a medium oath that he would mis tune blow the enemy into sheer nothingness he readied his groups worst curse an awful nothing bomb loudspeaker thinking that the charge would be from the north tried to sneak back south to hide in the nice lake of the water wing but this was where hydrogen was now hydrogen bombed him the nothing curse exploded piers anthony forming a tremendous dome of chaos that destroyed everything in its range then sank down through the ground in a singular fashion and was never heard from again in fact nothing else that entered that singularity ever returned because nothing had made its ultimate home here thus came to be the void the home of nothing around its edge was an event horizon where normal events stopped and became nothing only largely imaginary creatures like the night mares could enter the void and return this time loudspeaker had not escaped even his memory was gone so that only a few storytellers knew he had ever existed he was now nothing and hydrogens job was done now hydrogen considered he realized that a great deal of damage had been done by this momentous campaign against evil all of the battles had done damage to central xanth he wanted to see that never again would there be havoc wrought by an air attack earth encounter fire fight water war or void violation it would be better if the secret of modifying magic talents were lost so that no other person could make himself into an evil magician as it happened hydrogen was now the last of the original modified magicians so he sent the other members of his group back to gateway castle except for bee on call men settled in the water wing and devoted the rest of his life to developing the talent of keeping a secret finally he perfected it and invoked it and forever after no one in xanth was able to rediscover the secret of modifying talents hydrogens last great enchantment had made it impossible hydrogen married bee of course and their descendants became the merfolk of the water whig they had to marry humans and fish in alternate generations to maintain their status as mer people the curse friends remained a closeknit group with weak individual talents all of mem related to cursing and became great actors the villages around lake ogrechobee were always glad when one of their troupes arrived because their plays were always superb demons dont dream thus it was a regular circuit of the lake in time no one remembered mat the talent research group had even existed or that for fifteen years mere had been havoc in central xanth while things were being put to rights for more than two and a half centuries xanth was reasonably quiet until the onset of the eighth wave but that is another story morris concluded jenny opened her eyes the ancient scenery of xanth faded away with its heroic deeds and misdeeds she was back in the present with the nice mer family she was no longer bee on call but jenny elf however she now knew a good deal more about xanth than she had now we know the background cyrus said it was a stroke of fortune for my father when the siren arrived brae because then he could marry her instead of a fish now i would like to do something similar jenny saw kim freeze as hydrogen kim had become a reasonably bold if errorprone hero now she was just a girl who remained errorprone or perhaps errorsupine what was she going to do which brings me to my question for you kim cyrus said this is something which perhaps only you can do for me but which is supremely important to me it concerns my marriage i i kim managed to say before her voice freaked out and fled jennys voice had already done so morris and the siren looked on benignly therefore i must ask you kim cyrus continued grandly whether you will allow me to travel with you until i find a suitable mermaid elsewhere in xanth to marry for you see i am not used to traveling beyond the water wing and fear i would encounter mischief if i did so alone you are the first human traveler to pass this way in some time as my father says you seem to be the right young woman for this purpose because you are not of xanth and so there is no impropriety in our keeping company for a time we merfolk are highly conscious of the proprieties perhaps because we derive from the playacting piers anthony curse friends with a man there would have been no problem of course but it may be a long time before a traveling man passes this way kim looked as if about to faint with relief perhaps tinged with a dab of disappointment jenny emulated bee on call and stepped into the breach she found her voice where it had been cowering under her chair kim will be happy to have you travel with us she said until you find a suitable mermaid to marry kim scrambled to find her own voice but it was just out of reach so she nodded her head vigorously smiling there were tears in her eyes excellent cyrus said heartily this is a great relief to me at last kim recovered her voice me too she squeaked we are so glad mis has worked out the siren said now you must rest here for the night so as to be fresh for the morrow kim and jenny were glad to agree black wave nada glared at com pewter arent you proud of yourself she said severely you tricked my player into coming here with that shortcut and herded him into your cave and used your superior knowledge of xanth to defeat him in the riddle contest so now hes out exactly the screen printed smugly thereby making me a failure as a companion i hope youre satisfied i am oh youre impossible i am an evil machine ho ho ho i liked you better when you were a nice machine i was nice only because lacuna tricked me into recompiling now in the game i get to be evil again but you are welcome to assume your luscious serpentine form and curl around my hardware anytime naga creature piers anthony well dug will come back into the game despite you you crock of capacitors then he will have to meet me again and defeat me in a harder game than before i will have the sinister pleasure of dumping him again so you had better show him your panties while you have the chance princess you unspeakable cad she cried outraged youre lovely when angry nada snapped her fingers professor grossclout appeared he was an imposing old demon complete with fangs and tail this annoying machine is insulting me she said grossclout frowned this made his natural grimace even more formidable you come to this position with a head full of mush and you complain because your charge washed out nada suffered an instant of absolute unholy any then she realized mat the professor was baiting her as he did with those he hoped might someday improve it was actually almost a compliment i hope to do better next time she said bravely a peculiar expression fought to cross die demons face but lost nada realized that it was a smile which would have been in alien territory had it emerged maybe just maybe if you succeed you will become a creature worth knowing he grudged then to pewter carry on evil machine thank you pewter replied obviously dirilled with the compliment grossclout twitched a little finger negligently suddenly nada was back in the companions dugout with grundy golem me demoness metria goody goblin horace centaur marrow bones and a new one vida vila what happened to jenny elf nada asked she was chosen to be kirn mundanes companion grundy said demons dont dream oh so vida came in to replace her hi the roster no vida replaced you but im still here nada protested confused vida laughed i replaced you men jenny was taken now you have returned so maybe now im replacing jenny do you mind nada had to laugh too no of course not i was just surprised by the change i shouldnt have been how was it goody asked politely ft was awkward at first because dug was trying to express crude male interest in me vida smiled it comes with me territory she said inhaling she was of course one of xanths loveliest creatures nada realized that had she been hi the lineup dug well might have chosen her instead of nada now hear this professor grossclouts voice blared it is time for the selection of the false companion oh mat she had forgotten she sat up straight so as dot to betray any reaction along with me others the selection isnow you nada was too petrified to jump the lot had fallen on her she was now die false companion oh disaster but she had to play it out because part of her role was to conceal it from others that way no other participant in die game could tell her player to beware of her she had to keep it secret acting exactly like a fair companion until she found the perfect chance to send him into ignominious loss she gazed around pretending not to know who it was and saw the others doing the same except with mem it was not pretense then she shrugged as if realizing she would never know the others did the same looking relieved so she made herself look relieved too oh how she hated this a rote of ultimate deceptionit just wasnt princessly look outhere comes a player metria said peering out the window exactly as before nada wondered piers anthony whether she had been the false companion last time she would have enjoyed it being forever mischievous they sat straight in their seats ready for consideration nada gazed out the oneway screen and froze it was dug of coursereentering the game and she knew exactly whom he would choose because he knew her and liked her and trusted her this time she was required to betray his trust oh woe another voice sounded in her head you will receive further instructions you will obey them implicitly without imposing your own judgment on their merit yes she responded unhappily could she possibly hide behind one of the others so that dug would think she wasnt available mis time hi im grundy golem im from sure thing grundy dug said amicably lets cut it short okay im a retread maybe just for variety he would choose one of the others such as vida who was even lovelier than nada because she could change her form to match her mood maybe metria who would take him exactly as far as her mischievous impulse went possibly even flashing a naughty glimpse of her panties at him before vanishing in smoke maybe even a male so he wouldnt have any problem crossing the river ill take nada dug said as she had really known he would he had sealed his fate the innocent fool he had forgotten that a new game meant a new false companion who could even be the last games fair companion she stood and stepped through the window hello dug she said according to the formula i will try to be a good companion for you it was a lie she would pretend to be a fair companion awaiting the chance to mess him up worse the false companion was not supposed to do any ill early because she might only betray her nature without washing out her player giving him the clue how to handle her she had to wait until late in the game when he had his best chance to winand make him lose instead so demons dont dream that it would be much more difficult for him to reenter the game and win because the hazards grew more formidable as progress was made and any hazard that defeated a player had to be overcome in the next game when it would be worse that was to discourage players from deliberately washing out so as to get a better layout next time its great to be back with you he said gladly ive already refocused my eyes and in a moment i should be all the way back inside the game indeed as he spoke he was becoming more sharply defined and his screen was fading he had caught on well and wanted to believe in the magic so was doing it i am glad to be your companion again she lied oh how she wished he had not chosen her this time but she was stuck for her revised role if he asked her whether anything had changed she would have to lie if she gave herself away or tried to wash him out early so as to get out of the false assignment with minimal damage she would be in trouble herself professor grossclout would know and disallow it so she couldnt arrange to accidentally show him her panties or anything like that not that she would of course it wasnt princessly well lets go he said happily this time im going to do things better and not goof up the way i did before nada concealed her sigh little did he know they set out along the path now its okay to go get supplies and all at the isthmus village dug said that turned out satisfactorily i mean we did them some good right and we abolished the censorship so i wont avoid mat ill just do it more efficiently mis time but the game layout will be different she reminded him and you will be unable to avoid your nemesis com pewter no matter what you do because he will remember just as i do she was now a false companion but she had to play the part of a fair companion and this was exactly what a fair companion would say in fact she would have to act exactly the same as she would have until after he got by pewter because it was pointless to wash him out piers anthony when it might occur naturally her job was not merely to wash him out but to wash him out just when he was on the verge of a significant breakthrough or victory to make it as painful as possible for him so she had to be the perfect fair companion until mat dastardly chance came to be the perfect false one thats okay he said in his mundanish idiom i want to settle with pewter anyway he was just lucky beating me in that riddle contest i just didnt know enough about xanth she saw that be was in danger of hurting himself through overconfidence she should warn himbut the fair companion would not have the heart to hurt his feelings and the false companion noted that his attitude would make him an easier patsy so she allowed her silence to be taken as agreement the path led to a strange village its layout was different and me houses were dissimilar and the peoplenada had never seen folk exactly like these they were just like regular humans but they were black or at least dark brown whats this dug asked startled as he made a similar observation the layout has changed nada said i didnt realize that it would be mis drastic this is an entirely different village you said it those are blacks you recognize mem well not as individuals but they arei mink me dictionary word is negroes people from africa we hadi mean in mundania there was an uglythey were brought over as slaves and men after a war they were freed but the white folk never did really accept mem its supposed to be all equal now no discrimination butwell its like that censorship one of those bad things mat exist nada found this confusing white people brought black people to their landand men would not accept them not as free people not as equals not to live next to there was a whole lot of trouble about integrating the demons dont dream schools because he saw her blank look just take my word im white and im not proud of what my people did but its not all that easy to set things right i mean once there was this black girl hi my math class and i sort of bleed the look of her she was almost as pretty as you in her way and smart too but i knew if i even said boo to her id lose most of my friends and her brothers would maybe beat me up so i just had to ignore her and i guess she thought i was pretty snotty but i mean it just wasnt worm the hassle probably she thought i was a jerk anyway so mere never was anything there but i wishwell i dont know what i wish but i feel sort of bad about it nada was perplexed and relieved perplexed because it was apparent that the social attitudes of mundanes were stranger than she had known and relieved because this had nothing to do with her role as a false companion and she could just put that aside for now and not mink about it you wanted to associate with her but others would not allow it yeah i guess her name was princilla not priscilla and i thought it was a really neat name you know princillalike princess nada said appreciating it yeah like you but whites just dont date blacks in my town not if they want to stay healthy its even worse if a black man wants to date a white girl were all in classes together and we play ball together and we ride the bus together but theres a line he shrugged but thats there now were here im sure xanth doesnt put up with that bleep what do we do there is no need to visit mis village she reminded him we dont need weapons and food grows on trees so the only reason to stop here is if there may be something you can learn or acquire that will help you farther along hi the game which is doubtful this was the truth you know in other games you have to go fetch a magic key or something before you can get through a locked door to get something else this isnt that sort of game piers anthony i dont think so i suppose there could be a key but i dont know where a locked door would be i really dont know how you can get where you have to go thats why we need to see the good magician yeah well maybe there is something i can learn here that will help me so lets go talk with these people as you wish it was amazing so far her status as false companion had made no difference at all at the rate dug was going he very well might wash himself out despite anything she could do leaving her clear both with respect to the game and her conscience it was ironically a somewhat endearing quality hi him hi mere dug called as they approached the nearest man this was a carpenter or at least a man doing some sawing of wood he seemed to be building a house slowly the black man paused staring at them he did not speak look i mean no harm dug said last time i passed this way there was a whole different village here im amazed how it changed so suddenly if you dont want to talk to me okay ill just move on im not looking for any trouble but i sure am curious what happened the man turned his gaze on nada she smiled cautiously there was a subdued glow when she did that brightening the mans face that happened sometimes he had to smile back you got one pretty woman there he said shes not my woman dug said quickly shes just my companion evidently realizing that this lacked clarity he made a more formal introduction this is princess nada naga shes just showing me around the game the man nodded that must be some game this is dug mundane nada said he has to find his way id a prize we think i am a native of xanth so i am guiding him but it is clear that there are some parts of xanth i dont know very well myself i never saw folk like you before youre a magic woman the man asked yes i can show you if you wish she wasnt eager to demons dont dream do this because then there would be the complication of returning to her human form without allowing her body or underclothing to be seen but it was her job to help dug get through the game for now and if showing her magic was required then she would do it show me the man said so she assumed serpent form and slithered out of her clothes then she assumed naga form we are serpent folk she explained this is my natural form other black folk were walking toward them nada hoped they were friendly she did not want to have to assume large serpent form and fight them to protect dug but the game required that she do so if necessary you really are magic the first man said okay change back and well talk now dug interceded she cant just change back because then people would see her bare body she needs a private place the man nodded body like that i can see why he turned and shouted at the halfbuilt house hey man someone to see you all right jaff a black woman called from the house dug picked up nadas clothing wadded it into a bundle and proffered it to her go ahead nada he said ill be all right she returned to full serpent form took the bundle hi her mouth and slithered toward the house she did seem to have broken the ice man opened the door and nada slithered in then she set down her bundle assumed naga form and explained im a nagaa serpent woman i need a private place to resume my human form and get dressed the woman hesitated this is the only room in me house were still building it oh its all right for you to remain nada said just so long as mere are no men or children my mans outside no children piers anthony so nada resumed human form and quickly got into her clothing youve got some human form the woman said well im supposed to im a princess tnere are others like you yes we naga folk live mostly in the mountains underground we fight goblins when they try to intrude goblins no offense intended nada said quickly some goblins are nice i have friends who are goblins but the woman burst out laughing did i say something funny nada inquired nettled goblins raid our stores man said we dont like them either its just mat what you said sounded so much like what weve heard when white folk talk about ms about how were okay as long as we stay in our place nada was mindful of what dug had just told her about the strained relations between the white and black folk of mundania are you by any chance from mundania thats what you call it yes we left because because they wouldnt let you be equal or intermarry ine woman nodded something like mat but we dont know that its different here this is one weird place but the folk are white actually mere are other colored folk in some places nada said green purple gray maybe we should try to meet them i suppose you could i dont know where they live now but there used to be some around castle roogna nada was all the way dressed now they went out dug was talking with a group of men it seemed to be friendly dug saw her hey i think we can make a deal he said these good folk will give me supplies if one of them can travel along with us to see if meres a place in xanth they will be welcomed if its okay with you it is your decision to make she reminded him but perhaps we should learn more of these folk before deciding demons dont dream the black men glanced at each other and glanced at bit longer at nada sure lets talk jaff agreed they walked into the village where there was a larger more finished house they settled on crude wooden chairs jaff seemed to be the spokesman since they had talked with him first were from what you call mundania he said we crossed only a couple of years ago we were having a bad time no good jobs things were tight and then somehow we found mis path to this magic land and we said hell it cant be worse man what we face at home so we moved here with our families but there were some strange things here like pies growing on trees and real live dragons and goblins so we found a place to camp and sort of hunkered down and now were trying to decide whether to settle here or look around some more weve seen some of the people here and theyre white were not sure how theyll be we dont want trouble we just want decent jobs and lives but things just seem to get weirder the farmer we go in this land so we arent sure yet what to do you must be a wave nada exclaimed a waver a wave of colonization there have been ten or so and each wave usually brings a lot of violence but not all of them so you must be the black wave if you dont want to fight i know the folk here dont want to fight you we always need more human folk in xanth and there are plenty of places to live this sounds pretty good jaff said still wed like to check it out before we do anything much look dug said im just a visitor here myself as i told you when my game finishes ill have to go back to mundania but i dont think theres anything in the rules mat says i cant take someone else along i should get a good tour of the region because i have to find whatever it is i have to find and anyway i can make side trips if i want to so i think its a fair deal you fix me up with some supplies and a weapon to defend myself and til take along one of you and he can ask all the questions he piers anthony wants and maybe find the place youre looking for then he can return and tell the rest of you about it nada was uneasy about this and not just because of her ugly mission i dont know dug turned to her you have a problem with thatt he asked half smiling yes you are a player and i am here to guide you and protect you to the best of my ability that was now a halftruth and she hated it but she was bound by the rules of the game but it is not my job to guide or protect any other person i might save you from mischief but the other would suffer it when he wouldnt have if he had not come with us jaff looked at her you are protecting him he was obviously dubious you saw me change forms she replied evenly i can become a big serpent if i choose she sure can dug said enthusiastically she backed off a flying dragon once and she knows xanth so she can keep me out of trouble if i dont insist on blundering into it anyway jaff looked at his wife mari spoke shes a good person jaff shes a princess of her kind her folk fight goblins jaff turned back to dug were ready to risk it if you are then lets do it dug said who is coming there was a pause then a man who seemed to be in his thirties spoke i think i can handle it the others nodded agreement sheriock can handle it jaff said ill have to get things from smith sheriock said by all means jaff agreed sheriock went to another part of the village so they got together supplies and gave dug a good solid club for a weapon and sheriock joined the small party he was neither large nor handsome but seemed alert nada wondered whether he was a plant by the game demons dont dream representing some additional challenge after all the isthmus village had led them into a considerable challenge and black village was where it had been so must have been arranged by the game dug had chosen to get along rather than antagonize the folk of the black wave but the challenge might not yet be over should she warn him about diis or keep silent she was now a false companion she kept silent the three of them were soon on their way along me path but evening was approaching just as when they had passed this way before was the time fixed by then location or was it coincidence she had thought it was still morning when dug lost the riddle contest and left the game but perhaps it had been afternoon so this might be evening of another day it really didnt seem to matter all she had to be concerned about was getting him safely through to com pewter and if he didnt lose to the infernal machine again she would find something worse to make him lose then she would be free of her uncomfortable obligation and if he came back a third time and chose her again she might be a fair companion we shall have to make camp for the night soon nada said right dug said and we know where lets get on to it you know where sheriock asked i thought this region was just wilderness we have explored it and found no safe havens nada nodded that must be right she agreed this is our second effort in the game dug got eliminated by com pewter the evil machine and had to start over the geography got changed so probably the enchanted campsite we found before is no longer there the geography changed when did you pass mis way before yesterday dug said there was a different village here then piers anthony sherlock shook his head we have been here for a year well you would say that youre part of the game tno you are part of the game we came to xanth on our own and i assure you it is no game to us dug looked at nada can you figure mis out which is real what we saw or what they saw thats easy to resolve she said realizing what the key had to be the path is enchanted not to protect us but to direct us to the challenges of the game so isthmus village must be in one place and black village in another and the path took us to each in turn making it seem that they were in the same region isthmus village sherlock said we know of that it is about a days walk from here the people are taciturn and unfriendly and they refuse to use any expressive words thats changed dug said they were being oppressed by a censorship but we managed to douse its censers and now the folk are expressive and happy again i wish there were a ship we could abolish to make us welcome sherlock said nada realized that though she was doomed to betray dug she did not have to do the same for sherlock whether or not he was part of the game i do not think you are unwelcome here she said mundania is a dreary awful place but this is xanth it may be xanth and it may be magic but we have encountered unfriendly animals and people sherlock said the isthmus villagers the dragons the goblins nada laughed those dont count the isthmus folk we explained about they were unfriendly to us too at first dragons always attack people they see us as prey and goblins are mean to everybody unless they are taught respect that is improving now since gwenny became their first lady chief but thats only one tribe the others are still bad you dont seem to have met the regular human folk of xanth yet demons dont dream its true you are the first travelers to pass who accepted us the others either shied away without coming into the village or were polite but refused to associate with us thats why we were cautious about you the others were probably cautious because they didnt know you she said strangers can be dangerous even strange trees can be dangerous he laughed yes so we discovered theres the one full of tentacles tangle trees she agreed there are many dangers in xanth thats one reason the visitors in the game are given companions to guide them i dont know everything about xanth but i can spot the obvious threats she paused for example theres one now dont touch that object she pointed to something lying in the path ahead of them thats just an old horn sherlock said that is a stink horn she said if you touch it it will make a foulsmelling noise dug laughed saythat sounds like fun he bent to touch the horn no nada cried but she was too late bbbrrrrrrummpppoopoohh it sounded like die worst imaginable odor as it blew back dugs hair and smirched his face he stumbled away but it was no good the stench had gotten on him oh now well have to clean you up she said dismayed otherwise you wont be fit to be near thats for sure sherlock agreed holding his nose she did try to warn you fortunately there was a small stream not far away they went to itbut nada hesitated i dont mink thats a normal stream she said i dont care what it is i just want to get clean dug said he dipped his hand and scooped out water to splash on his face uhoh youll have to wash your clothes too sherlock said maybe you better just change to new ones i see a trouser tree nearby ill see what else i can find piers anthony dug just squatted there staring into space come on get out of those things nada said briskly no i cant do that he said you would see me and i am very sensitive to that because you are a beautiful princess i would like to know better and i dont want to make a bad impression on you and i would make a bad impression if i appeared naked before you and anyway i dont know if mere really is anything else to wear so i had better stick with what i have on and in any event i have to wait to see what sherlock comes up with and wasnt i a fool to touch that horn it really stunk me up and i wish i had listened to you but naturally i had to just barge ahead and get in trouble as i always do because thats my nature and i see the disgust on your face and that hurts me because mats not the way i want you to see me because id rather be kissing you you lovely creature in fact if i had my druthers id do more than kiss you but in this weird hind i cant even look at your panties without getting booted from the game and thats a real pain so i just have to keep quiet about it and try not to make a fuss but you must really be disgusted right now i know i sure would be if i were in your shoes and thats a stream of consciousness nada cried appalled they are very pretty shoes too he continued without interruption i must say more like slippers really making your feet look nice and of course your legs look nice too and id really like to run my hands overhey why am i talking like this he demanded dismayed i cant stop myself im saying everything thats on my mind no privacy whatever and every time i look at you it gets really embarrassing because the water of the stream of consciousness made you have to say everything thats on your mind she said loudly using her own voice to drown out his voice in an effort to prevent him from embarrassing them both any more all i can think of is how luscious you are and i dont demons dont dream care if you are a princess and are several years older than me i just want to grab you and i will go fetch sherlock she screamed and fled before hearing any more what a disaster this was she found sherlock who was returning with shirt trousers and shoes did you get him clean sherlock asked or do you want me to scrub him you being a woman thats a stream of consciousness she cried hes speaking everything on his mind his eyes traveled up and down her torso thats bound to be trouble he said is mere an antidote i dont know i dont know what to do then well just have to gag him until we figure sometiling better out sherlock said here i found a scarf too it should do the trick dug saw mem coming i dont want to be saying all this he said looking desperate its just coming out anything that triggers a thought out my mourn it comes now im bound to say something about race relations because sherlock is black and i want to keep my mouth shut and i cant and im bound to insult somebody even though i dont want to and what are you planning to do with that scarf youre not going to choke me are you i really dont mean to be like this i cant help it if my crowd never let me play with black children and my friends called them ni he stifled himself by clapping his hands to his mouth this is a gag sherlock said let me put it on you he did so and dug did not resist he had at last been silenced nada concluded that sherlock knew what to do i will go look for a campsite she said and walked away she was in luck there was an enchanted campsite in a different place from the prior one they would be able to spend a safe night she set about garnering fruit and pies for supper and canvas for a tent after a while the two men joined her dug was clean in the new clothing and still gagged he looked grateful piers anthony rather than miserable sherlock instead of being a burden to have along had named out to be a great help what a disaster it would have been had she been the one to touch that stream of consciousness she would have blabbed out her false companion nature she hoped the effect did not last long with dug mis job was difficult enough without mat sherlock looked around i dont remember this place and ive been through here im sure it was just plain old forest before it must have been set up for the game nada explained the game is superimposed on xanth and niteracts with xanth but we dont want to bother too many regular xanth folk who know nothing about it but your path led you right to our village he pointed out either you are game folk or the demons decided you were a legitimate challenge she said maybe it doesnt matter just so long as we find a good place to settle we dont want to remain where we are but we dont want to walk into trouble either if you are the black wave you will find a place to settie every other wave has maybe dugs challenge here is to help you find that place from what he says i gather that some mundanes would not even try to help you thats for sure he hesitated if mis is where we spend the night separate tents if you prefer x change into my natural form to sleep if you dont mind being in the company of a humanheaded serpent it would be easier to set up just one tent for sure if dug doesnt mind dug gagged shook his head no he didnt mind then lets see what we have here sherlock opened his pack and brought out a coil of wire we can tie this between two trees to support the canvas and i have metal tent pegs too they hold better than the scrounged ones usually demons dont dream you have metal things she asked surprised how did you get them smith makes them anything we need from swords to plowshares he really knows how to work metal he has magic he can change the form of metal usually those from mundania lack magic no magic hes trained is all dug laughed through his gag they looked at him so he pulled it down black smith he said it does make sense then he pulled the gag back up before he could say too much more sherlock smiled hes a blacksmith certainly but what would be the point of magic since he can do it all with fire and tongs well a magical blacksmith would shape oars from ores getting an iron oar or silver oar she explained something like that maybe not silver as that isnt black it sounds as if your mundane black smith is more versatile maybe so he agreed they put up the tent and settled down to supper but another problem appeared how was dug to eat with the gag on i wonder sherlock murmured the way things work here maybe it would do what would do saw some humble pie growing near the river he said rising humble pie she exclaimed maybe it would so sherlock fetched a humble pie and they fed dug a piece in a moment dugs endless monologue faded out he was now too humble to bore the others with all his thoughts rhow did you ever think of that nada asked impressed sherlock shrugged elementary he said he had not eaten any humble pie nevertheless nada was sure they were going to get along bubbles kim had been enjoying the game now she was enjoying it more she liked having the handsome merman along being satisfied that he was not trying to marry her for one thing he knew this water wing well so they would surely make excellent progress through it without running afoul of whatever threats it offered for another he was excellent company he was mature clever polite and generally nice what more could a girl ask they started at the eastern fringe of the water wing and floated west in a water boat mat sought and followed me various currents going their way it was slow but comfortable each of them had packs with supplies provided by the mer family cyrus showed them how to fish not for food but to attract exotic specimens to the lure there were rainbow trout their semicircular bands of color making the surrounding water beautiful there were the tiny white specks of light that were starfish and one that was too bright to look at a sunfish a swordfish playfully feinted at the boat and a sawfish made bulging eyes at them it saw them demons dont dream but after a time this palled they were on a seemingly endless expanse of water going somewhere but not fast kim was getting bored this wasnt exactly her idea of adventure then she saw a glimmer in the air it wasnt a bird it was a bubble a shimmering soap bubble perhaps just floating innocently by the light glinting iridescently from its surface where had it come from where was it going who had blown this pretty little bubble kim didnt know and didnt much care it was just interesting to watch it was followed by another bubble a bit larger and shinier then a third in fact there was a chain of bubbles drifting along on a vagrant eddy of wind passing the boat and moving on each was larger and brighter than the one before it as if the bubble blower were growing and gaining experience then a bubble seemed to have something in it kim strained to see but could not make it out just a reflection maybe yet a peculiar one the next bubble was empty but the one following that definitely had something in it kim peered closely but still couldnt quite make it out so she reached out and caught the bubble it popped the moment she touched it and the object fell into her hand it was a twisted paper clip not readily usable how had it gotten inside the bubble how had the bubble managed to remain floating with this weight inside it this was such a curious matter she hadnt realized that paper clips even existed in xanth they were mundane she tried to bend the paper clip back into shape but it was beyond redemption she considered dropping it into the water but she didnt want to be a jitterbug finally she hooked it into a buttonhole as an impromptu decoration meanwhile the bubbles were still drifting by and still getting larger there seemed to be a loose chain of them crossing the lake coming from who knew where and going to who knew where else when she looked behind she piers anthony saw the diminishing line of them disappearing in smallness when she looked ahead she saw die line maintaining its size but realized that was because the bubbles were still growing so that their size balanced perspective there must be some pretty large bubbles at the end of that line she peered at each passing bubble now a number of mem definitely had objects inside them they were all different but there was something similar about mem too what was it one bubble carried a worn clothespin another had a chipped cup another had an empty bottle and so on a torn picture a worn shoe a stopped clock a book with the cover torn off a pair of socks with holes in the toes everything was in some way defective or useless these were all throwaways things mundane people no longer wanted that explained the twisted paper clip she worked it out as the bubbles moved on by this was a magic land so it had magic problems and magic solutions maybe even punnishly literal she thought with a smile somewhere there would be a solution that was a magic solution a drink or elixir these bubbles were like trash bags just put your junk hi mem and let it float away a disposal network the bubbles were probably going to a central dump where they would pop and deposit their refuse no fuss no muss no bother wouldnt it be nice to have something like that at home somehow this stuff must have strayed into xanth so was being conveyed away the bubbles continued still growing larger one had a broken bicycle another had a stuffed chair with the stuffing leaking a kiddy car with the steering wheel gone a large old worn dog a wait a minute kirn snapped back to the dog bubble what was a living creature doing in the trash because the dog was alive it was lying there with its nose on its paws breathing slowly and gazing out without much interest it demons dont dream was nondescript mostly shades of brown with some white around the edges a mongrel undistinguished and that was why of course with no special pedigree and well beyond the fun of puppyhood she was no longer a desirable pet maybe she was ill so she had been thrown away kirn had heard of this sort of thing sometimes people would just dump their pets off on country roads and drive away hoping someone else would take care of them of course usually mat didnt happen instead the poor pets expired of starvation and exposure never understanding how they got lost that just made kim so mad but she had never had a pet so maybe she didnt know how it was maybe she would have a different attitude if she had had the experience of keeping in an aging or sick pet but she doubted it the bubble was drifting on behind the dog lifted its head and gazed at her it gave its tail half a wag men sank back into hopelessness it knew it was doomed kim reached for the bubble but it was now too far away and what would she do anyway with a tired old dog ft probably had fleas it was better just to let it go it would soon be dead anyway no one would care no she cried she stood up and then leaped for me bubble her hands touched the shimmering surface and it popped and her arms closed around the dog but she was falling because she had leaped from the boat splash they fell together into the water help she cried she could swim but not while holding a large dog in her arms and she was not about to let go of the dog because she didnt know if it could swim then cyrus was there swimming extremely efficiently with his tail he caught her and the dog and heaved them back into the boat where jenny blf helped them get untangled what happened jenny asked amazed did you fall out of the boat no i leaped out of the boat kim explained to catch me bubble the bubbler piers anthony didnt you see the line of bubbles floating by jenny shook her head no cyrus heaved himself back into the boat keeping his tail there were no bubbles he said it must have been a daydream i think i caught a glimpse of mare imbri she must have brought you that nice dream no bubbles kirn asked then what about this she let go of the dog who was now sitting in front of her a dog jenny cried its been so long since ive seen one of those a bitch cyrus agreed you found her in the water what do you mean a bitch kirn retorted shes a perfectly nice dog then she remembered that this was what a female dog was called a bitch just as a female horse was called a mare and a female pig a sow oh im sure shes nice jenny agreed extending her hand but the dog shied away fearfully its all right kirn said stroking the dogs damp back jennys my companion the dog relaxed accepting jennys touch then sammy cat stepped forward kirn was worried but then realized that the little cat would not step into danger and he knew how to find what he wanted sure enough the two animals sniffed noses then sammy walked away satisfied he was jennys cat and jenny had been accepted so sammy was accepted too cyrus extended his hand but the dog retreated from him too she didnt growl she just grew nervous shes your dog cyrus said i never heard of a daydream turning real like that but it must have happened kirn looked around there were no longer any bubbles in sight they had vanished they couldnt all have drifted away so quickly so maybe it had been a daydream but die dog was real as real as anything in this game had it been a challenge to rescue the animal what do you call her jenny asked my bubble dog i dont know kim turned to the dog she noticed that the dogs mouth was marked with black demons dont dream and white so that she seemed to be smiling though it was merely a color pattern and not true emotion i think someone waswas throwing her away because shed old all the bubbles had old worn or broken things but when i saw a living animal ii just couldnt let it happen perhaps you should check to be sure she is healthy cyrus said diplomatically he knew that the chances were that the dog was not kim seized the opportunity bubble dog let me see if there is a tag on you or something kim said there wasnt probably such identification was unknown in xanth let me get you dry while im at it she brought out a towel and rubbed the dogs fur at the same tune checking for mange fleas or broken bones but the bubble dog turned out to be surprisingly healthy she was solidperhaps seventy poundsbut not fat and her fur was so thick it was like dense carpeting she was very quiet not growling whining or barking and did not try to get away her teeth were clean and there were no signs of infestation she was healthy just old maybe shes magic jenny suggested there are very few straight dogs in xanth she might be a werewolf or something are you magic kim asked the dog the dog just looked at her not seeming to understand perhaps she was dumped because she was not magic cyrus suggested well wont dump her kim said firmly shes a nice dog and i like her and i dont care if she is nonmagical so am i but then a nasty thought occurred but im only visiting here what happens to her when i go home i would try to take care of her jenny said but i dont think she likes me nonsense kim said she just doesnt know you yet kim herself was almost as new to the dog as the other two were why should the dog accept her she knew the answer she was the one who had rescued piers anthony the dog from the bubble thus she had earned a special place in the dogs affection that was ail right as long as the dog did not attack the others she couldnt just keep thinking of her as the dog there had to be a name all right youre officially the bubble dog kim said bubbles for short okayr the dog did not object she lay down in the bottom of the boat and went to sleep bubbles it is cyrus said i wonder if i could daydream of floating bubbles and find one with a thrownaway young beautiful mermaid kim laughed who would throw away a young beautiful mermaid unless she had a terrible temper jenny said smiling mermaids do not have hot tempers cyrus said somewhat stiffly the water keeps them cool and calm except when theres a storm kim asked mischievously merfolk dive below when there are storms maybe shes hungry jenny said how can she be hungry when we havent found her yet he asked then he shifted streams of thought oh you mean the dog perhaps so they did not have any dogfood in their supplies but they did have water crackers kim took one and offered it to bubbles the dog sniffed it considered and finally accepted it she settled down to eat it slowly the boat moved on the slow progress soon became boring jenny and cyrus slumped snoozing and so did kim until a sharp bark woke them all up kirns eyes popped openand there was a head looking over the boat she stifled a scream afraid that it would merely provoke the monster jenny was doing the same its a water dragon she whispered frightened and were way far from land but cyrus did not seem to be worried thats just plesio he said hes friendly demons dont dream thats a plesiosaurus kim exclaimed from the age of dinosaurs for she had at one time been fascinated by the dinosaurs and had learned a number of the forms of the age of reptiles this extremely longnecked flippered creature fit the description yes he really likes to please people cyrus said he must have seen us poking along and decided to help speed up our journey he unshipped some rope tossed out the end and die creature caught it in its mouth then it swam briskly ahead pulling the boat swiftly along but bubbles couldnt have known it was all right kim said stroking the dogs head she tried to warn us of danger yes she did jenny agreed we can sleep safer with her along now their progress was rapid the surface of the lake fairly whizzed by a shore appeared ahead and soon they reached it plesio halted and dropped his end of the rope thank you cyrus called as he coiled the rope they took out water paddles and moved the boat into shallow water and then into a broad marsh but i thought we were doing to a river kim said the withacookee river jenny agreed it flows from the halfbaked bog so first we have to get through the bog oh now she remembered the map why is it called halfbaked kim inquired because half of it is next to the fire region cyrus said thats not my favorite place but the best channel passes close by there so well have to use it all too soon kim saw what he meant there was smoke on the horizon billowing up from what looked like a wall of fire and the channel through the marsh led toward it the green plants along the bank turned white with the increasing heat and then brown why mat looks almost like marshmallow kim explained yes this is the mallow marsh cyrus agreed if you are hungry you can eat the toasted mallow plants piers anthony kirn reached out and pulled off a mallow it was crinkly brown on the outside but gooey white inside she tasted it toasted marshmallow sure enough jenny ate some too then jenny offered a mallow to bubbles but the dog would not take it so she handed it to kim and kim offered it and this time bubbles took it this was a onegirl dog without doubt the wall of fire loomed closer kim realized mat the reason me channel was so close to the fire was mat this was the only place too hot for water plants to clog we shall have to move rapidly cyrus said i shall enter me water and pull the boat as plesio did that will protect me from the heat and speed our travel if the two of you are able to paddle well try kim said bravely that firewall was now impressively high and hot her clothing had long since dried out she dipped her hands in the lukewarm water and splashed herself wet again the water itself was warm but did help cool her jenny understanding did the same it would help them survive the fire as an afterthought she splashed some water on bubbles who glanced at her but did not protest jenny paddled near the front of the boat and kim paddled near the back on the other side trying to time her strokes to match the elfs cyrus pulled by holding a short length of rope between his teem and swimming vigorously the boat moved well but still the high flames were ferocious bom girls had to pause frequently to splash more water on themselves and on the dog near the wall of fire the water was boiling but it seemed to be cooler below the surface now the source of the flames was apparent a row of burning trees somehow they seemed to maintain their height and mass and foliage despite burning up how could that be thats firewood cyrus explained well that made sense in this magic land kim had al pemons dont dream ways known how punnish xanth was she just tended to forget when under stress kim heard growling it wasnt bubbles indeed the dog heard it too her floppy ears perked up it was coming from the firewall but how could there be any living tiling mere firedogs cyrus gasped pay them no heed they live in the hot steel and iron section and harass passersby but they cant leave the fire region kirns fevered mind wondered whether there was a pun buried there steel and iron steel andironsame as a firedog back home she kept paddling though she feared that her hands were blistering the growling faded but was replaced by a heated hissing firedrakes cyrus explained very fierce birds but the drakes too were confined to the fire then there came a hot buzzing dont tell me kim gasped let me guess firebugs right the channel began to veer away from the firewall to kirns great relief then there was a fiery neigh that would be a firehorse sparkling insects flew out and danced above the water fireflies bubbles barked kim started to reassure the dog men realized that the dog might have smelled something she looked aroundand spied a serpentine form writhing across the surface of the water toward them suddenly she knew what it was firehose she screamed cyrus lifted his head and stared that will burn through the boat he said alarmed then wed better hurry kim gasped doubling her effort the boat went faster but she saw that the firehose was going to touch it jenny saw the danger she stood up and whirled her paddle she brought it down across the firehose making a great splash of water and fire the hose startled pulled back for a momentand the boat slid by untouched there was an angry cry kim looked and saw the flam piers anthony ing outline of a man standing before his firehose shaking his fist at them sorry fireman you cant burn us this time she called as the boat put distance between them a flaming human female form appeared she held some kind of firestick she pointed it at the boat bubbles barked duck kirn cried throwing herself down a bolt of fire shot over the boat just missing her that was no duck cyrus said that was miss fire so silly of me to confuse her kim said away from the firewall at last they relaxed catching their breaths they were surprisingly determined this time cyrus said usually they dont really try i wonder what got them all fired up its probably a game challenge kim said realizing it was getting too easy for me to make progress so they heated it up that must be it jenny agreed you have a loyal companion to help you but the challenges do get harder as they go few players are supposed to make it through to the prize cyrus nodded i see this will be an interesting excursion i must say you rose to the occasion kim no that was jenny who rose kim said to cover her pleasure at the compliment she stood up so she could bash the firehose so we could pass true but you gave the alarm no mat was bubbles she barked kim stroked the dogs head he shrugged your modesty becomes you im not modest im pushy i just did my part the same way the rest of you did of course he agreed but he did not sound quite convinced the dog was getting restless so they paddled to the bank and let her scramble onto land where she did her canine business evidently she was a housetrained canine which was fine kim liked her very well it was fun having a pet even if it was only in the game demons dont dream hi they resumed motion through the halfbaked bog it was extensive but by paddling and poling they made good progress it is getting late but we must reach the headwaters of the wimacookee river by nightfall cyrus said why kim asked cant we camp here she was so tired mat she hardly wanted to push on farther than she needed to no there is no solid land here just marshy islands and it would be uncomfortable for you to sleep in the boat but mainly there are the allegations the what jenny asked allegory a related species perhaps the allegories are found in the ever glades while the allegations are here we dont dare relax until we are out of their range kim realized that these puns might have unpleasant representations okay on we go i hope we dont meet any but she suspected that the game would not let her get by without tackling this next challenge she was right bubbles barked as a large aquatic reptile swam toward them with a ribbed greenish hide solid threshing tail and a mouth stuffed with more gleaming teeth man she cared to try to count keep moving she murmured to cyrus and jenny you are intruding on my territory the allegation said with some justice i shall have to chomp you cyrus was silent and kim knew it was because he could not refute the charge it was up to her we are traveling an established route she said you dont have authority to interfere the allegation pondered evidently she had managed to refute it meanwhile the boat was moving then the creature made another accusation you are transporting an illicit animal i shall have to chomp it oh no you dont kim cried putting her arms around the dog this is my pet and nobody chomps her without first chomping me the allegation paused again it seemed she had refuted piers anthony it again the boat was still quietly moving but the thing hadnt given up you are a mundane you have no rights in xanth i shall have to chomp you oops she was indeed mundane so she couldnt refute that what was she to do while she considered the creature was nudging up closer ready to snap at her even if it missed her it would surely catch the boat and rip out a chunk causing the whole thing to dissolve but she knew there had to be a way through so she made what she hoped was a good refutation i am a mundane player in the game have the right to tour xanth as long as i play the game you cant chomp me unless i make a mistakeand i havent made one here curses the allegation muttered turning aside she had foiled it the boat slid on through the bog soon the land on either side firmed up and pretty plants appeared the withacookee jenny exclaimed seetherere the cookees growing the cookies kim agreed so now at last we can camp yes cyrus agreed you handled that allegation very well kim thank you she replied feeling more justifiably flattered after all there were only so many compliments a girl could take from a handsome man before they started getting to her thats odd cyrus said that wasnt here the last time i passed mis way and mere ahead was what looked like an enchanted campsite does the game provide safe havens for players kim asked jenny yes but you have to find them yourself it seems i did kim turned to cyrus this must be about the edge of your range it is i travel the water wing freely but seldom venture far into the neighboring regions nevertheless im sure this was mere jungle before demons dont dream it surely was kim agreed but the proprietors of the game must have set up rest stops hi outoftheway places and mis is one of them im certainly glad to have it which was perhaps her understatement of the day she had used her wit and gotten through just fine but she had been lucky too she was willing to bet mat luck wouldnt hold much longer they tied the boat and walked into die campsite cookee plants grew all around as well as fruit and nut trees and assorted material bushes she knew this would do just fine for the night cyrus went to a private spot changed into legs and went to work collecting materials and pitching two tents while kim and jenny picked fruits and nuts pies and milkweed pods and piled them on the picnic table there was even a dogwood tree bearing dogfood kim put some of that hi a wooden dish for bubbles and the dog liked it an this is living kim remarked as they ate bom cyrus and jenny looked surprised this is routine he said not for me where i live pies dont grow on trees and milk doesnt come in pods this really is the land of milk and honey she picked up a honeysoaked comb she had found and began licking the tines clean she would be able to use it on her hair when all the honey was gone well they dont where i come from either jenny said but its the way it is hi xanth theres nothing special about it kim shook her head you folk dont know when youre well off you have such wonderful lives compared to the pollution and parsimony and poverty we have thats why everyone who knows about xanth wants to come here even if only for a few hours in a stupid game cyrus was interested what are the mermaids like hi your world kim laughed there are no mermaids well maybe some fakedup ones in tourist shows but those are just piers anthony regular women with their legs bound into tailcostumes nothing youd be interested in he was surprised there are no crossbreedmgs with fishr none that sort of thing just doesnt happen in mundania in fact there can be trouble when different races or cultures marry it happens but not often people stick mostly to their own kind he shook his head truly has it been said mundania is dreary truly kim agreed kim and jenny settled down for the night in one tent and bubbles lay down at the entrance satisfied to be a guard dog cyrus always the model of decorum slept in his own tent in the morning they took turns washing men ate and disassembled their tents so as to leave the camping area pristine for the next travelers they got hi the boat and set off down the withacookee river they didnt need to paddle the gentle current carried them slowly along toward the west and north but dont we want to bear south kim asked we do jenny said but the river will take us to the sea and then we can paddle on along the shore bypassing the gap chasm and other menaces such as com pewter we can land south of it and find a path going inland we can pass castle roogna and go on to the good magicians castle its not a straight route but its a fairly easy one com pewter kim said the evil machine id like to meet you dont want to meet pewter jenny said alarmed kim sighed jennys advice had been good so far as she had found out when she didnt follow it no evil machine she agreed regretfully the cookies growing along the banks became fancier there were clusters of ginger chocolate chip banana walnut raisin and molasses cookies growing out of beds of demons dont dream sandies pinwheels spun around on their stems kim reached out to pick one no jenny cried as kim was about to take a bite but she was too late as usual kirns mourn was already in motion she bit out a piece and it tasted very good why did you try to tell me no she asked theres noming wrong with this pinwheel cookie thats not a pinwheel its a punwheel jenny said oh what will it do to me make me a pundit it cant make me a pungent because im not a man im a girl still i suppose i could go around telling jokes the way a pungent would i could be his pungirl maybe she paused whats the matter youre punning in circles jenny said kim looked at the cookie she had taken a bite and it had affected her speech ill try to watch my punctuation so as not to punisb you any more she said punctually maybe well find an antidote soon cyrus muttered even bubbles hid her head under the seat as if trying to shield her ears from the sound kim decided to keep her mourn shut until the effects wore off she just kept acting impulsively then regretting it they saw things swimming they looked like more allegations there were also small shoes in the water kim knew what those were water moccasins she was glad they were secure in their boat because this was not the best place to wade or swim later in the day the river widened and there were marshes to the left the marsh water bubbled effervescentty lake tsoda popka jenny exclaimed oh i remember when che and gwenny and i had our first popkasquirting fight of course gwenny wont do anything like that now shes a chief and ches her companion so he has to behave too she took an empty water bottle and dipped it into the lake but im not a chief and not a piers anthony companion to a chief im just an innocent elf girl who doesnt know any better so i can do it and she held her thumb over the top shook the bottle violently and squirted tsoda water all over the boat i know about that game kim said managing not to pun she grabbed another water bottle and dipped it in the lake ill puncture your balloon soon they had a fullscale squirt tight going while cyrus too decorous to participate retreated to the farthest part of the boat and bubbles hid under the seat then something horrendous loomed ahead it made a bubbly roar they paused to stare at it the thing was like a swirling mass of gelatin with colored bubbles throughout whats mat punk in the punch kim asked thats the tsoda popka monster cyrus said it must have been attracted by the commotion well tell it to punt on out of here kim said but the monster perhaps aggravated by the puns reached out a bubbly tentacle to strike the boat the tentacle hissed effervescentlyand where it touched the boat the boat began to hiss and sparkle too whats happening kim asked alarmed i think the popka monster turned the water boat into tsoda water cyrus said alarmed it is dissolving away the monster sank out of sight but that did not end the problem the boat was now bubbling at a great rate and becoming jeuylike they had to scramble out of it before it dissolved away there they stood on a somewhat spongy bank they were all right and they had saved their supplies but they had lost their boat they would have to walk the rest of the way unfortunately they seemed to be on a squishy island around it swam the allegations moccasins and other things with projecting fins kim opened her mourn no pun came out she wasnt surprised their situation did not seem at all funny germ dug was better in the morning being neither consciously streaming nor humble for sure he was going to watch what he ate and drank after this the path was just beginning to veer south when they came to a grove of very tall trees i am not sure about this nada said i think these are hassle trees if so we should avoid them we dont need any tall hassle dug agreed have not been this far sherlock said i hope you folk know how to deal with me dangers of mis region the best strategy is simply to go around this grove nada said but there was only one path and that one proceeded through into the tall hassle grove nada could leave the path and travel in serpent form but the two others could not guess well just have to chance it dug said the game doesnt give us much choice it may be a game to you sherlock said but its pretty serious to me i mean if you lose youre suddenly piers anthony back home in mundania right but if i lose im food for a dragon or worse youre right dug said i think i got the better deal getting supplies from your village if you want to break the deal ill give you back the stuff but youre going on i have to ive got a game to play then im going on too just lets be careful okay super careful dug agreed i dont want to wash out again they walked on into the tall hassle grove dug was afraid that the trees would sprout arms and attack but they seemed stable they were so tall that they shut out the direct light of the sun putting the path into gloom there were no animals in sight then they heard something at first it was faint but it became louder as they moved toward it it was a sort of thumping and swishing as of something very large jumping around and breaming hard the ground shuddered dug exchanged a glance with sherlock the black man shrugged the path led only two ways forward and back by the time they reached the center of the tall hassle grove the whole forest seemed to be shaking as if an earthquake were practicing its moves it was hard to keep their feet on the bouncing ground but there were no roars or other indications of a hungry monster maybe it was something impersonal like a boulder bouncing up and down inside a volcano they moved forward almost on tiptoe though it was hard to tell how they could have made any sound loud enough to be heard over the deafening reverberations at last they spied a large glade sunlight streamed down in a region hike an amphitheater in the center was a flock of birds birds dug asked surprised he had to yell to make himself heard over the noise rocs nada yelled back by their color id say female rocs but whatever can they be doing demons dont dream for the birds were standing in a line flapping their wings and kicking then feet up that was the source of me swishing and thumping they were so solid that when they set down their feet the ground shuddered for the rocs were large birds each was big enough to carry away an elephant if it chose if it could find an elephant it was sherlock who caught on theyre rockettes he exclaimed practicing their routines rocettes nada agreed female rocs but what do you mean by routine dancing a chorus line high kicks they do seem to be doing that she agreed but to what point sherlock exchanged a glance with dug well they like h in mundania dug yelled just then the rocs halted in perfect unison resting their feet and closing their wings it was the end of their act silence fell like a sudden curtain just in time to catch dug at the top of his voice his words carried right through the glade with loud and perfect clarity every huge bird head turned toward him uhoh sherlock murmured they cant fly through the forest nada said we can escape along the next path follow me she shifted to large serpent form and slithered rapidly forward dug paused only long enough to snatch up her clothing and jam it into his pack then he and sherlock galloped after her the rocs evidently annoyed by the intrusion launched in a mass into the air they bore down on the fugitives but the circle of trees ringing the glade was too close the birds had to land before they crashed so some dropped down to pursue afoot while others winged on up over the forest to peer down at the path from on high this was one tall hassle for sure dug thought nada serpent slithered out of the glade down the next path through the forest dug and sherlock followed the nearest roc screeched as she made a grab for mem with iso piers anthony her claws and beak the sound was deafening but she overbalanced not being accustomed to hunting on her feet and fell beakfirst on the ground dug felt the great whomp just behind him and kept going then he realized that sherlock wasnt beside him he snatched a look backand saw that one outstretched talon had snagged sherlocks pack the man was trying to get loose but die talon had plunged right into the ground anchoring him dug stopped turned and hauled out the club they had provided he ran back toward sherlock watch it you fool the man cried shes watching you indeed the huge head was lifting and the huge near eye was orienting even stretched flat on the ground the bird could readily snap him up because the foot was close to her head what could he do if he fled sherlock would be done for if he didnt both of them could be done for because his club was a puny thing compared to that monstrous beak if he had gotten another magic sword this time around but he did have a knife that would have to do he put away the club and got the knife the rocs head swung toward him the beak opened then he saw a stink horn growing almost in front of him he jammed the point of the knife through it bbbrrrrrrummppoopoohh the foulsmelling sound ripped through the glade staining everything but dug paid no heed he held his breath squinted his eyes and lifted the thing up toward die rocs gaping mouth he whipped the point about so that the stuck stink horn flew offinto that mouth the roc snapped at it reflexively then her eye assumed a somewhat startled somewhat disgusted look as if something tasted monumentally bad a wisp of putrid stench leaked out from the corner of her beak dug didnt wait to watch he already had a pretty good notion how the big bird felt instead he ran up to sherlock demons dont dream and the claw and wielded his blade it bit into the claw as if it were so much tough wood this was like hacking down a tree except that his meager blade lacked the heft to do much damage the roc screeched it seemed he had struck a nerve she yanked her talon out of the ground hauling sherlock into the air he slid off the talon landing neatly on his feet go man he shouted dug realized that he was just standing there watching he put his legs in gear and ran as fast as he could for the path he almost expected to have a talon skewer him on the way but he made it intact he joined sherlock behind a hassle tree they looked back at the roc she was dancing in a much fancier pattern than before trying to get the stink horn smell out of her beak that was one smart ploy sherlock said appreciatively nothing else couldve distracted her you saved my life i was lucky dug said it wasnt false modesty it was an exact description well it looked good from here sherlock said come onweve lost the serpent lady they resumed motion down the path nada was waiting in her naga form what happened she asked i thought you were right behind me bit of a problem dug said lets move on before that roc realizes that this path is wide enough for her to run along if she keeps her wings closed indeed the roc was already drawing that conclusion she was blowing out the last of the stench and advancing on the path she was not nearly as fast on her feet as she would have been hi the air but she was a mighty big bird and could surely move as rapidly as they could nada resumed her slither and they followed running they heard the thumping as the rocs big feet hit the ground her footsteps seemed slow but that was deceptive they were far apart dug snatched another glance back and saw that she was gaining on them piers anthony fortunately the path was winding which slowed the big bird because she could not maneuver her bulk in this confined space as readily as they could then they came to a fork they dashed right because that bore south and had the luck to hear her take the left fork losing the way but they had hardly begun to relax before a roc wheeling in the sky squawked loudly there was an answering squawk from the ground followed by the screech of claws skidding to a halt the other rocs were correcting her course how are we going to escape with hose spy eyes up there dug demanded there might as well be a satellite video unit nadas pretty face on her serpent body looked perplexed who sat light what did he do on it never mind i was speaking hi mundane we cant get away as long as those rocs are watching from me sky unless we hide between the trees of the forest until they go away she said sherlock glanced to the side forget it i never saw such impenetrable underbrush dug looked too he saw a solid mass of thorns brambles and what looked like poison ivy no hiding place mere well just have to keep moving and hope things improve he said he realized mat mis was a rather anemic excuse for leadership but it was the best he could do for now they ran on it took the roc a while to reverse her course and get on the correct path so they had a bit of leeway maybe the game was giving mem a chance then they came to a small swift river it was too wide to jump over and way too strong to wade through however mere was a footbridge over it and a sign stop pay troll sure enough from under the bridge was coming a tall thin brutishly ugly manlike creature with a warty countenance the troll blocked the access to the bridge dug realized that this was another game challenge he demons dont dream had to get across mat bridge before the roc caught up so he approached it forthrightly whats the toll trolir all your wealth the troll rasped wealth i dont have any wealth im just a poor player strutting and fretting my hour upon this stage too bad the troll crossed his ugly but all too serviceable arms still blocking the way at that point the sound of the pursuing roc became louder suppose we just push you out of the way and cross without paying dug demanded then my friend the diggle will push the bridge out of the way and you too if youre on it diggler from the ground beside them a formidable snout appeared it had to be the hugest worm anybody ever dreamed of the diggle is the largest of the voles nada explained it travels through rock and works only for a song maybe the troll sings to it but a vole is a mammal dug protested this is a worm uh friend sherlock said in mundania there are mammals and worms here hi xanth its different dug realized that it was true the old familiar rules just didnt apply here he had seen that when nada first turned from woman to serpent okay the diggle works for a song that lets me out they tell me that i couldnt carry a tune if i had two others to hold up the ends of it the diggle is not too choosy she said but please dont try to sing im sure it would offend my princessly sensitivities that made sense he had no intention of embarrassing himself that way anyway he would have to settle with the troll okay heres my money he said digging into a pocket he found a handful of coins the troll peered at the coins what manner of wealth are your he inquired piers anthony im a measly dime the tencent piece replied im a plugged nickel the fivecent piece said were cheap pennies the onecent pieces chorused dug almost dropped the coins they were speaking money talks sherlock said smiling are you solid and true wealth the troll asked the coins laughed us were strictly small change we arent even the pure metals were supposed to be the pennies arent pure copper and the nickel isnt really nickel and the dime doesnt have any silver at all dug saw that the coins wouldnt do it he brought out his wallet and offered a dollar bill are you solid and true wealth the troll asked apparently he had a bit of magic and could make money talk me im not worth the paper im printed on im just one buck the least of the folding money denominations this cheap mundane is trying to foist off zilch on you where would you spend me anyway xanth doesnt use money how did mere paper ever get confused with wealth the troll asked well originally i was backed by gold or silver the paper dollar said but once they got the paper established they quietly removed the backing so now im only worth what folk think im worm and thats less every year they keep printing more of us and that makes us worth less worthless the troll agreed the sounds of the roc were drawing closer dug knew he had to find some way to pay the troll what else will you accept he asked desperately the creature looked around does your black servant work well sherlock began to get angry hes not my servant dug snapped hes a friend traveling with me hes not for sale then your naga princess nada hissed outraged shes not a servant either shes my companion demons dont dream precisely is she soft at night shes guiding me through xanth dug said quickly no deal on either of mem the troll shrugged then you cant pay the toll go away now the ground was shaking as the roc came closer they did not have much time left dug looked desperately around he saw the bridge and the river coursing through its deep channel part of the long body of the diggle was in that channel it must have drilled through the river along with the ground beside that torso was a bit of fluff something percolated through his mind this was the game there always had to be a way through but it wasnt necessarily obvious anything odd might be a clue and that bit of fluff was odd there was no other fluff and no pillow bushes in the vicinity it wasnt from a leaking pillow it was almost as if it had been carried along with the diggle as it magically tunneled through the ground what kind of a hint could it be well he could ask nada do you see that bit of fluff what do you think it is nada looked why mat looks like a germ she said a germ you mean the diggles infected it looks healthy to me her lack of a more complete answer just might suggest that there was more to this that she was not supposed to tell him he had to figure it out for himself germs dont infect things hi xanth not exactly she said evasively suddenly he had a faint nagging thought which side was she on was it possible that she could be a false companion he had almost forgotten about that chance no she couldnt be she had been too loyal she simply wasnt allowed to tell nun some things that were supposed to be game challenges the troll meanwhile was simply standing there like a cartoon character who was no longer active his job was piers anthony evidently not to attack but to be a barrier reacting only when approached another game aspect xanth had turned leal but the game aspects were slightly flawed perhaps deliberately he got down and reached for the fluff he held it in his handand began to get another idea suddenly the pun registered this is the germ of an idea he exclaimed yes she agreed i wasnt supposed to tell you but now i can because you figured it out yourself the one who has it becomes smarter in thinking up new ideas it must have been carried along with the diggle after it passed the brain corals pool this is the gameapproved explanation for its presence he asked knowing that it was he had found the key now all he needed to do was figure out how to use it the roc burst into view perfect timingof course he realized now that this threat had been carefully choreographed to give him just enough leeway while keeping him scared it was indeed part of the game but he still had to make the right move or he would be booted out of it again he lifted the fluff to his forehead lets have it germ whats the wear it came to him use the diggle use this giant worm thing here was where his companion should have useful advice how can we use the diggle to escape the roc he asked her why i suppose we could ask it to carry us along she said as if surprised by the question she was a fair actress but not perfect in that respect but you would have to sing to it you surely have a better voice than i do he said i surely do but this is something you must do for yourself as the player dug looked at sherlock you heard the lady the black man said it probably wont pay attention to me demons dont dream desperate dug turned back to nada but what about your princessly sensitivities she glanced over his shoulder at the onrushing roc perhaps i can stand it for a while then lets go he said he tucked the germ into a pocket diggle that roc is about to smear us into messy pieces getting your nice hide all icky carry us away from here ill sing to you the diggle who had been as quiet as the troll came to life more of its long body drew out of the ground the thing was so big that the torso was as thick through as that of a horse the three of them jumped on bestriding it actually nada remained in naga form so just lay close dug opened his mouth and forced himself to sing i dream of jeannie with the light brown hair he sang badly offkey he saw both nada and sherlock wince the diggle began to move just as the rocs beak came down the diggle plunged under the groundand carried mem along with it there was no impact they just went under as if the ground didnt exist or as if it were no more than water or even air it was dark with veins of rock showing the diggles magic was at work then it stopped sing before the ground congeals nada cried alarmed oh he had forgotten to sing i dream of brownie in the light blue jeans he sang with even worse melody the diggle resumed motion and the ground did not congeal so dug kept singing and the diggle kept traveling since they were underground the rocs couldnt follow he had found the way to escape that prior challenge he realized that the diggle was making pretty good time this was a fast way to travel south then the diggle stopped again but i was still singing he protested you started to repeat yourself sherlock said the thing may not have much taste in music but it must get bored with old stuff piers anthony but i only know so many songs dug said and parodies of singing commercials the ground was starting to congeal he could feel it thickening around them becoming viscous he didnt want it to turn all the way rock solid choka cola stinky drink he sang pour it down the kitchen sink smells like vinegar tastes like ink the diggle resumed motion and the ground turned thin again but eventually dug was out of parodies too the ride would have to end diggle take us up to the surface he said im about to run out of music music sherlock muttered pained nada murmured agreement she sounded somewhat ill and dug doubted that it was from motion sickness the two of them had made a great sacrifice listening to him sing for so long the diggle wended upward as dug sang his last ditty it reached the surface as he finished they dismounted thank you diggle dug said a bit hoarsely you were a great help the diggle dived back under the earth leaving no trace of its passage the ground was solid aint magic wonderful dug remarked gazing at the undisturbed ground i think that was a diseased germ sherlock muttered rubbing ms ears i still have it dug said it may be useful again where are we sherlock asked this must be the withacookee river nada said what kind of a name is that for a river dug asked a descriptive one i have to go change nada said she assumed full serpent form took her bundle of clothes hi her mouth and slithered off dug looked around they were not far from the river this one was too wide for a little troll bridge and indeed they saw no bridge on it there were however all manner of cookies growing along its banks that explained the name the water was calm but he suspected it would not demons dont dream be wise to try to swim across this one because it was large enough to contain monsters sure enough soon he saw a long low snout followed by a faint ripple then he saw a single fin projecting from the water then a small puff of vapor as of a water dragon quietly exhaling steam waiting for some fool to swim by how were they to cross he brought out the germ and put it to his forehead again got any more ideas he inquired use the cold cream cold cream surely it didnt mean the stuff women used to remove makeup do you see any cold cream around here be asked sherlock sherlock looked around all i see is a cream puff which i think til eat he went to pick it up it seemed to be growing from the ground like a puffball heythis is still hot how can it be hot if its growing it hasnt been baked in an oven well it might as well have been its piping hot sherlock blew on his fingers cooling them the cream puff remained on the ground nada returned in human form suitably garbed whats happening she inquired tm looking for cold cream dug said so far all weve found is a hot cream puff she looked i never heard of a hot cream puff theyre always cool and cold cream is always cold this puff is hot sherlock said she went to it thats cold cream i know it when i see it because on occasion i use it she bent to touch it hoo it is hot what can be the matter with it look at mis sherlock said theres a hot potato beside it potatoes dont grow hot either she said but hi a moment she had verified this too this is most perplexing dug saw the outline of a box formed from metallic rods piers anthony enclosing the two objects couid this be a hot box he asked with hot rods for the sides by this time he knew that he could not trust the mundane uses of such words a hot box she exclaimed that explains it the plants are being cruelly heated by the hot box we can eat the potato and rescue the cream puff which i might as well have for cosmetic but they are both too hot to touch you dont need any cosmetic dug said youre already perfect then lest she misconstrue his attitude he added no offense she smiled almost blinding him no offense sherlock delved in bis pack i just happen to have heavy heatresistant gloves here he said just in case i had to handle a small fiery dragon or something he donned them then lifted up the potato it was nicely baked but when he lifted the cream puff something odd happened this is turning cold it must be compensating for all that heat dug said it is naturally a cold substance so it must have been really struggling to stay cold in that hot box now mat we have removed it all the effort is making it too cold say sherlock said the things trying to freeze my hands then the full meaning of bis germ of an idea burst on dug take it to the water let it freeze the water sherlock hurried to the river and dunked the cold cream immediately ice formed and spread outward mind if i ask why he asked so we can freeze our way across dug said i got that idea from the germ sherlock shook his head this is almost worse than the idea you had to sing he said yet that did get us away from the rocs nada said and a good distance down the length of xanth but this time we dont have an angry roc bird chasing us sherlock pointed out demons dont dream as if on cue there was a mean sound to the north as dug realized that it was probably choreographed by the game and it would probably be a worse threat than the last in the nature of a game that sounds like werewolves nada said looking alarmed why not gardenvariety wolves dug asked as he headed for the water xanth has very few ordinary wolves or dogs she said there once were some but they bred themselves out of existence the same way man once did now that doesnt make a lot of sense dug said species can fade out by not breeding but they can only get stronger by breeding a lot not in xanth if a species interbreeds with other species the crossbreeds are their descendants thats not bad but it does mean that the original species diminish my naga kind arose when human folk bred with serpent folk and the centaurs were crossbreeds between humans and horses and the mer folk derive from humans and fish and the harpies from humans and birds there are many such mixed species and few original species they were foolishly free in then breeding its a wonder the storks didnt balk at all those mixed deliveries only the fact that humans kept coming in new waves enabled them to maintain their pure population she looked at sherlock which is why your black wave should be welcome your difference from other humans here is trivial sherlock nodded thats about the first time ive liked having a white person call me trivial but considering how different you are i cant argue lets get on with the freezing dug said for sure sherlock pried the ball of cold cream out of its socket hi the ice and dunked it in the nearest liquid water beyond in an instant that too was frozen the pack of werewolves appeared sure enough some were in canine form and some in shaggy human form and piers anthony some were in between all were howling villainously lets move it dug said ill try sherlock squatted sliding the cold cream forward the water froze around it he moved out onto the new ice freezing steadily ahead get on it nada dug said ill defend the rear he drew his knife you are becoming more like a hero she remarked approvingly i just dont want any of us to get chomped he stepped on the ice after her the ice now formed a xanthlike peninsula extending into the river he chopped at it with the knife trying to separate them from the land he hoped the resulting ice island would stay afloat the werewolves arrived the first beast landed on he narrow neck of iceand broke through it splashing into the water the ice the three of them stood on floated free there was a ripple in the water a green snout was moving smoothly toward the werewolf but the wolf scrambled out before the long green jaws parted to chomp him the other wolves milled on the bank knowing better than to set paw to water dug and his friends were on their way however they were now at the mercy of the slow current of the withacookee river where would it take them he also saw brightly colored fins what are those he asked fearing the answer loan sharks nada said everyone knows theyll take an aim and a leg if you let them then well just have to stay out of the water dug said he should have known that something egregiously punnish would turn up to make things worse we should have brought a paddle sherlock said as he continued to add to their ice island now were up the crick without one thats the way the cookee crumbles dug said you can use your club to paddle nada said dug tried it but it was remarkably inefficient and the is demons dont dream land started to rotate maybe i can freeze a keel so it wont spin sherlock said he maneuvered the cold cream so that a spike formed projecting like a tail he dipped the cream so that the freezing went deep soon the ice floe stabilized and dug was able to start it nudging across the river then he heard a voice it sounded like a girl hey nada naga it called there beyond the far bank of me river was a small party of people waving their hands who are they dug asked surprised jenny elfand the other mundane player nada said and someone else a strange man this should get interesting the other player dug hadnt realized that there was one this should indeed get interesting uhoh sherlock said dug glanced at him whats the matter the cold creams giving out its no longer freezing the water dug realized that the game was hitting him with another challenge their little ice floe would soon melt dumping them hi the river he saw the predators circling hungrily this is getting too interesting he muttered chasm kim saw the peculiar party crossing the river she had been alerted by the woof of bubbles dog a pack of werewolves was baying hunting down something and it seemed to be a group of people but the people had a raft or something because they were out on the water where the wolves couldnt reach them then one of the people turned so that kim saw her profile thats nada naga she cried who cyrus asked he was stuck in human form because of the mean creatures in the river and the lake they would quickly chomp him if he tried to change form and swim nada naga shes the companion for the other player so that must be the other party your competition kim well sure id like to win the prize kim said but i like playing the game too in fact i just like being in xanth lets see if theyre as curious about us as we are about them so jenny cupped her mouth with her hands hey nada naga she called demons dont dream in a moment nada answered jenny elf is that you yes were stuck on a squishy island and sinking can you help were freefloating on an ice floe and melting can you helpr were they destined to watch each other pass being unable to get together to separate and never see each other again after coming so close or to watch each other sink into the water and bog victim of the predators kim didnt like either notion this is another game challenge she declared there has to be a way for us to help each other if we want to if we can just figure it out hi time they considered i could pull their ice floe to shore cyrus said if someone protected my flank from allegations moccasins and loan sharks nada could do that jenny said if someone protected her flank cyrus peered across at the other party how could that luscious girl protect anyone else shes a serpent woman jenny explained she changes into a serpent the same way you change into a fish tail he nodded seeing the possibilities they are drifting toward us but i see that they are precariously perched what can we do about that jenny asked concerned sammy jumped from her shoulder to cyrus pack he put his paw in the end of the rope showed can you throw your rope that far kim asked catching on sammy had found what they could do no it is light rope and must be weighted if it is to carry sammy jumped to kirns pack i think jenny started kim delved into her pack she brought out a spare pair of shoes here is your weight he knotted the end of me rope around the shoes then hurled it toward the diminishing ice floe a black man there caught it and held it then jenny and kim braced piers anthony cyrus while he hauled on the rope drawing the other party closer then the melting ice floe capsized dumping the three into the water for an instant they were stunned by the calamity then sammy jumped up on kirns head and batted at her forehead as if coaxing out a thought kirn cried out directionsand because she was the player the others followed them immediately jenny hold the rope cyrus take a weapon and dive for them kim herself delved in her pack finding a knife then before jenny could protest she dived into the river herself sammy jumped from her bead to die back of bubbles who looked a bit startled but did not protest the cat was much smaller than the dog so his weight was not a problem meanwhile the other player was reacting similarly loop the rope around us all he shouted face out well defend ourselves while they haul us in hi two and a half moments cyrus reached the other party and in two more so had kim they joined the others roped together facing out the sharks and allegations were circling but the party now bristled with knives and a spear and one of its number was a serpent with horrendous fangs another had a powerful tail and evidently knew how to swim very well to intercept any hostile creature jenny pulled on the rope her feet were sinking into the marshy hammock braced by the dog and cat but she was able to haul the mass of people slowly toward her they finally reached the island but did not try to scramble onto it we need to find solid land instead kim cried from the water sammy stood on bubbles back and said something in cat talk the dog moved reluctantly into the water and swam toward another hammock the cat on her back bubbles understood what sammy was saying they are showing the way jenny cried follow mem then she scrambled into the water herself still demons dont dream holding the rope the water here was not deep she was able to wade far enough to catch up to the group she got inside the loop next to the serpent so that she too could defend herself from the creatures outside it was a clumsy messy business but they pushed with their feet and stroked with then free hands and nudged in the direction shown by the animals soon the ground under the water became firmer and they were able to walk on it chestdeep then waistdeep then kneedeep at last they stood on solid land againand saw a path ahead there were on their way but what a motley crew they were dog serpent merman three humans and one elf were soaked through and spattered widi mud only the cat was pristine lets get clean before we make our introductions kim suggested the others were glad to agree sammy where is there a good place to jenny started the cat bounded off down the path they followed forming a ragged line soon they came to a larger clearer lake evidently one of the sections of lake tsoda popka it sparkled effervescently but the cat was dipping a paw daintily cleaning an imagined speck kim squatted and dipped out a handful this is champagne she exclaimed were supposed to wash in this well we know just how to do it jenny said she fetched out an empty bottle and dipped it in the lake in three quarters of a moment everyone had bottles and they were in the midst of xanths most uproarious fizz fight lake champagne might never be the same but they were getting clean then nada naga who had assumed human form underwater rather than miss the fight went off in one direction to find a clothing tree and cyrus and sherlock went off in another to find then own tree leaving jenny and kim and dug to hold the fort as it were they had more or less exchanged names during the cleanup bubbles and sammy piers anthony settled down to snooze beside each other in the sun seeming to get along fine so youre the other player kirn said boldly are you enjoying it so far i sure am dug agreed and im only here on a dare a dare you didnt want to play dont go for computer games or silly fantasy by my friend ed dared me to try one i bet him my girlfriend against his motorcycle that i wouldnt tike it he smiled sheepishly i lost you bet your girlfriend kim asked uncertain how to take that yes pia shes eds girlfriend now i think maybe i was set up but i couldnt even be mad after i saw nada you go for that type kim was being guarded for some reason she didnt care to analyze it might be mere coincidence that dug was a handsome young mundane man who wouldnt shes a knockout but shes a naga princess jenny said and she doesnt go for younger men so i learned he spread his hands dont look at me mat way shes the worlds most beautiful woman and fm just a sixteenyearold jerk im just saying that anything i might have lost back home no longer mattered after i saw what was here he focused on kim that handsome mermanhes not interested in you either ill bet same reason hes looking for a mermaid kim agreed hes just traveling with us until he finds her same way sherlocks traveling with us until he finds a place for his people to settle he paused look kim i guess were supposed to be in competition but i want you to know i dont care about the prize i just like being in the game demons dont dream me too she said discovering that she was losing interest in the prize you too i got into this on a dare but i figured you really wanted to play i do want to play just to be in xanth i love xanth its so much more interesting than mundania yes it is i dont know anything about it but i havent been bored since i got hi and not just because of nada its some place she nodded so do you want to travel on together for a while if the rules allow it sure we may have nothing in common except mundania but thats enough of a cross for us both to bear he glanced at jenny youre her companion do you know if its okay i dont know any reason why not jenny said i dont mink there are any rules really except about things like not looking at a girls panties he laughed i learned about mat the hard way i tried to sneak a peek at nadas and i got blotted out of the game i mean my screen went blank and i had to scramble to get back in ill never do that again he looked around which reminds me we need to get changed too these clothes wont be worth much after this workout we can change after the others find clothing jenny said were just keeping an eye out now in case anything else threatens but as long as bubbles doesnt bark and sammy doesnt wake its safe bubbles kim explained about the way she had found the dog shes really very good she concluded its a shame that someone was throwing her away fm sorry i cant take her with me when i return to mundania she can stay with me and sammy jenny said quickly we wont let her be thrown away again fm sure professor grossclout will allow it who dug asked hes the demon in charge of the game compared to piers anthcmsty him every other persons head is full of mush but hes not too bad if you ever manage to get to know him demons in charge of the game why well i think its because of the demon xcan hes the source of all the magic of xanth he wanted the game to be played so the demons are handling it thats all i know what kind of a demon so they had to explain to him about that by the time they had done so the others had returned that was a surprise kirn eyed one party then the other nada was in trousers and a male shut cyrus and sherlock were in dresses all we could find the black man said embarrassed same here nada confessed but now we can go in the opposite directions and change cyrus said relieved this time jenny and kim went with nada while dug went with cyrus and sherlock the girls found the tree and picked out nice dresses suddenly i feel very feminine kim said i like it but nada reconsidered i believe i will remain hi trousers she said you get tired of getting stared at kim inquired it isnt a problem ive had well youre not a princess kim nodded ruefully that must be it they returned to the central camp they saw the three males coming back from the other direction all appropriately garbed they settled down to eat and to get to know each other better kim noticed that cyrus and nada seemed to find each other interesting well bom were crossbreeds and he was almost as handsome as she was beautiful wouldnt it be something ifbut no it wasnt her business to speculate they organized their party and set off south it was more interesting kim thought having a larger group also safer perhaps if they didnt encounter anything truly for demqns dont dream midable it was getting late and they would have to find a campsite before too long they came to a centaur range kim could tell because the path widened and was beaten down by hooves soon a male centaur galloped up he was an impressive figure of horse and man with a large bow and a quiver of arrows centaurs were notorious for their marksmanship they could score on anything they fired at who are you to intrude on our range he demanded he seemed to have a slight speech defect there was something familiar about him then she identified it he was horace the zombie centaur one of the prospective companions since he hadnt been chosen he was now on backup duty as jenny and nada would have been had they not been chosen so he was in costume his zombie nature concealed she was sure it was him regardless kim looked at dug hes male you take it she murmured because of course a player had to handle it this could be another challenge dug stepped forward we are travelers playing a special game he said we arent looking for trouble were looking for a place to spend the night in peace if you come in peace you are welcome to spend the night hi our village horace said dug glanced at nada and kim glanced at jenny nada and jenny both nodded centaurs could be trusted apparently dug had handled the challenge appropriately by ex pressing their desire for peace kim was relieved centaurs were bad enemies and good friends and there would be no need to fear any dangers of the night here so horace led them to the village this appeared to be a group of stalls but there were humantype houses too evidently for those who served the centaurs several other centaurs came out to greet them among them two mares kim saw dug and sherlock blink at the sight of the barebreasted lady centaurs those were the fullest breasts she had ever seen and she suspected that the sight had far piers anthony more impact on the men but both had the wit to mask their reactions she managed to mask her smile actually she would love to have an upper torso like that to make male eyes pop there were passing introductions then the centaurs showed them to their stalls which turned out to be fairly nice little houses with nice beds of straw inside the three women shared one and the three men another bubbles and sammy found comfortable places of their own in the straw and were instantly asnooze it took a while longer for the others to eat and settle down but in due course they too were asleep so this had turned out to be no challenge kirn thought but she knew mat if dug had given the wrong answer the party could have been in desperate trouble was dug a naturally diplomatic person or had be been lucky this time it was important for her to know because he was her competition even if she no longer cared about the prize in the morning refreshed they resumed their journey would you like a ride as far as the gap chasm horace centaur inquired kirn exchanged another glance with dug a ride was mis another challenge yet centaurs were trustworthy maybe this was just the games way of moving them along rapidly to the next challenge in some other variant there could be a real row with the centaurs or a dragon waiting along the path but in this one it was at the gap chasm so the sensible thing to do was to get on down there without wasting time it was as if the game got impatient with delay and wanted to get on with the action why not dug said after a pause as long as our friends can ride too your friends are welcome horace said if i may inquire sherlock said is there a place here where a new community could settle horace was surprised what kind of community demons dont dream a human black wave community horace looked at the other centaurs we could use more servants he said for the menial chores sherlock frowned well keep it in mind he said evidently intending to do no such thing why should his folk settle for more of the same kind of treatment they had in mundania so six centaurs carried the party rapidly southward kim carried bubbles dog with her and jenny carried sammy cat on the back of another centaur the scenery fairly whizzed by kim would have preferred to go slower because she was a bit afraid of the next challenge getting across the gap chasm was bound to be no easy matter she knew there was an invisible bridge but how could hey find it if they tried to go down into the chasm the gap dragon would get them nobody crossed the gap with impunity all too soon they arrived there was the huge chasm with its base shrouded in fog and the sheer brink of it taunting them there was no bridge in sight of course they dismounted and the centaurs galloped away what next dug heedless of the scary depth explored the verge he walked east soon the nature of the chasm changed the land did not drop straight down but descended in a series of halfloops so that it was possible to go down without falling we can handle this he said enthusiastically but there is a dragon below nada warned him you can be a big serpent and scare it off he said i cant scare that dragon not the gap dragon the only safe way to handle him is to avoid him tvell we can have sammy cat show us a way down and across that will avoid the dragon he was so confident that it was annoying perhaps nada said guardedly kim could see that the naga princess had her hands full trying to keep dug out of trouble she couldnt even change forms both ways in his presence because of the piers anthony problem of clothing it probably wasnt much fun for her being his companion but it might not be much fun for jenny elf either being kirns companion because kim was impulsive too this could be trouble cyrus said glancing up kim followed his gaze an ugly little dark cloud was scudding from the north is that who i fear it is she asked cumulo fracto nimbus he agreed you encountered him before sure did he always rains on the party there was a rumble of thunder the others looked up they shared glances of dismay hey whats the big deal dug asked so a little cloud passes so it rains a bit that wont stop us thats fracto nada said fractal fracto xanths worst cloud we had better get under cover whats all the fuss about one tiny cloud he demanded itll be gone soon enough if you do not care to heed my advice perhaps you should exchange me for kirns companion nada said somewhat stiffly dug looked surprised then he glanced at jenny elf thoughtfully i guess maybe theres something im not picking up on here he said but as i see it we can wait until an actual storm threatens but the others knew better they were already hurrying to find the makings of a tent kim went to a pie tree she had spied to gather a good meal to eat while they waited for me clouds fury to expire jenny was going for pillows there was no telling how long they would have to wait i cant believe this dug said one stupid little cloud youd think it was a hurricane or something there was another nimble the cloud was expanding puffing itself up voluminously a puffy face was forming on its surface a chill gust of wind came down demons dont dream what an ugly puss dug remarked staring up at it sammy meowed dug looked around i didnt mean you he said flashing a smile the cat relaxed we could use some help on this tent sherlock called dug finally realized that this was serious he went to help pitch the tent the first fat drops of rain spattered down then their nature changed hey thats sleet cyrus exclaimed kim held out her hand hard pellets bounced off it steer thats hail she said they got the tent finished and piled unceremoniously into it as the hailstorm intensified bubbles and sammy joined mem not wanting any part of the storm the dog huddled close to kim nervous about the closeness of so many relative strangers but not making any fuss kim was also highly conscious of dug wedged on her other side now the hail had become snow piling down in turbulent flurries they were safe under the canvas and they had blankets too so they were comfortable kim just couldnt keep her awareness off her closeness to dug under a shared blanket if only something like this could be real as in a date thats more of a cloud than i figured dug said paying her no attention snowon a warm day not only that sherlock said its colored if youll excuse the term kim peered out she saw pastel hues the snow was all the colors of the rainbow its pretty she said nothing fracto does is pretty nada said darkly they ate the pies while the storm continued i wonder why fracto came here right now jenny said how could he know we were here tne game kim exclaimed he was sent by the game its another challenge a cloud sent to mess us up dug asked but all we have to do is wait for it to peter out sherlock shook his head i dont know much about clouds or magic but ill bet this is going to make a differ piers anthony ence for one thing this chasms going to be twice as hard to cross covered in snow dug nodded youre right after the storm passes that tunny snow will remain itll slow us down slow us down kim asked maybe it will speed us up the others looked at her we dont want to jump into that blind nada said the smaller crevices will be covered up and the slopes will be treacherously slippery we should wait until it melts but that could take days kim protested no im thinking of skiing down on that snow that would make a tedious trip easy skiing dug said i tried to ski once and almost broke my leg that was just a little slope this canyons a mile deep even a skilled skier could get himself killed he had a point run had skied but she was no expert and this would be no easy course well we could sled down it maybe whered we get sleds sammy stirred he was about to head out into the storm when jenny caught him not yet sammy she said wait till it stops snowing dug pursed bis lips he can find sleds sammy can find anything jenny said proudly except home so there must be sleds nearby can you be sure they are near nada asked actually i cant jenny admitted sometimes things are way far away but i know hell find the closest sled there is okay so we can get sleds dug said but sleds can be dangerous too on an uncharted slope i was ready to walk it but i dont know about this maybe sammy can also find a safe route down kim suggested then we could follow on sleds i wouldnt let him go alone jenny said but maybe he could ride on a sled with me and sort of indicate whether it was safe to go on i mink that might work demons dont dream finally the storm eased fractos rages were severe but seldom endured long but what damage they could do in a short time kim and the others climbed out of the tent the snow was several feet deep almost burying the tent they had almost to tunnel to the surface it was a changed world colored snow lay everywhere changing the landscape the nearby trees had piles of blue snow on their foliage while bushes were buried under yellow snow the level land was covered in brown while the descending slopes of the gap chasm were clothed in black but it was definitely snow kim dipped a finger and tasted it black icy flakes they foraged for heavier doming there were yellow jackets growing nearby and the cold had frozen their stingers so that it was possible to wear them there was also a boot tree with a fine selection ranging from bootees to jack boots before long they were all suitably bundled up looking like so many stuffed dolls kim realized that all this was unlikely to be coincidence the game had set up its challenge with supplies in place and moved in the storm when they arrived they were not going to go hungry or cold they merely had to make it down into the gap chasm now sammy jenny said the cat bounded away leaving pawprints in the snow the dog less adventurous remained in the tent jenny followed the cat and kim followed jenny soon they came to a sled shed kim knew it was that because mere was a sign on the door saying so the cat bounded op to the door and waited until jenny opened it they went inside there were two big rounded devices one was labeled robert and the other roberta but these arent sleds jenny said at least not like any ive seen sherlock arrived those are bobsleds he exclaimed amazed they have nicknames jenny inquired piers anthony now kim recognized the type she had seen them race in the winter olympics on tv horribly swift three or fourman sleds they were supposed to careen down into the chasm in these but we dont know the first thing about handling aa robert sled she protested weakly oh i wouldnt say that sherlock said i rode on one once course it wasnt far or fast just a little demo hill i was the steersman i probably couldnt have steered it wrong if id tried on that track but i did sort of get the great feel of it thats the king of sieds for sure kim felt a sinking sensation they were going to do it go down into that dread chasm on bobsleds they hauled the sleds back to camp look what we found nada said pointing kim looked there were two clearly shaped trails down into the chasm with square signs posted where each divided how did those signs get there kim asked i dont see any tracks in the snow and they werent there before it snowed must be game magic dug said we really have to sled down those trails but how will we know which way to go i see the signs say right and left he said so all we have to do is follow those road signs what kind of challenge is that she demanded i dont trust this ah youre just chicken to take the ride you bet im chicken she retorted nettled why would they go to all this trouble to set up a challenge then tell us how to get through it to get us quickly down to the bottom where well have to figure out how to avoid the dragon it did make morbid sense but still she didnt trust it this whole business was just too elaborate well lets do it dug said sherlock and nada and i can take robert and cyrus and jenny and kim take roberta well race each other down to the dragon demons dont dream who will men eat the first arrival so the second can get through kim said acidly that finally made him pause but he recovered well tackle that problem when we get there he was hopeless and she was hopeless to be so intrigued by him but she reminded herself that it was only a game the worst that could happen was mat they would wash out and be back in mundania or was it what would happen to the others if the players disappeared the companions would be all right probably but the otherscyrus sherlock and bubbles could be stranded in the snow in the gap with a deadly dragon coming the game was no longer the fun it had been but what could she do skip out on a challenge she was stuck for it they hauled the bobsleds up to the ends of the two hails sherlock showed cyrus how to steer its mostly leaning actually he said but you have to time it right and pull on these handles here then sherlock went to the other sled and got in nada got in behind him and dug was ready to push and jump in at the back their own sled had cyrus jenny with bubbles and sammy and kim as the pushoff rider they got set do we really have to race kim asked maybe it would be better to have one sled try it first it is set up like a race jenny said probably its better to race there was just no getting out of this kim got set to push off she looked across at dug on your mark he called get set go kim pushed the sled tipped over the rim and started down she leaped onto the back and hung on it felt exactly like falling in half a moment they were zooming toward the fork the sign said left sammy says go right jenny screamed indeed the little cat was almost scrambling out of the sled on the right side piers anthony so cyrus steered it right they entered a slanting ledge overlooking a sheer drop into the chasm then threaded past an outcropping into a kind of narrow valley there was another fork with another sign left go left jenny cried as the cat scrambled left they went left kim looked back and saw mat the path of the right fork turned and went directly down the face of the chasm an impossible drop they came to a third fork and sign this one said left again right jenny cried and they went right the trail looped around found a channel and debouched on a large level ledge the sled slid to a halt they got out kirns heart was thudding two of those signs were wrong she said outraged one of them would have dumped us into the chasm cyrus and jenny looked back up the trail youre right cyrus said he looked shaken we cant trust the signs all of them said left but we had to go right twice we couldnt just do the opposite of what they said because one of them was correct so theres no consistent pattern where is the other sled jenny asked sammy jumped from her arms and bounded along the ledge they followed soon they spied it jammed in a dead end about halfway between the ledge and the top its occupants seemed to be all right though disheveled and annoyed the middle sign was wrong kim called it sure was dug called back youre lucky yours were right ours werent we ignored them sammy knew the way thats some cat he said then dug and sherlock and nada made their way down the slope to the ledge their sled was hopelessly jammed and unusable sherlock paused to look carefully at the signs and then went to check the signs on kirns trail they consulted with only one sled only one party demons dont dream could continue in fact mere was only one trail leading down from the ledge i think this challenge can have only one winner dug said ruefully well you can have it kim said this sledding scares me and so does the dragon below id rather find some other way it is possible to go around the gap chasm nada said but its a long way and mere are dangers i dont care ive had all of the gap i care to dug pondered id as soon go on down and get it over with but not with wrong signs you could make it with your cat but wed probably get skunked again say i mink i have it figured sherlock said returning its not what they say its where they are when you have to go right the signs on the right when you have to go left its on the left kim looked youre right its like the game of scissors scissors sherlock asked and the others looked similarly blank its a game most of me players have played it before so they know the rules but there are a few newcomers who dont they sit in chairs in a circle and pass a pair of scissors around each one says i receive these scissors crossed and passes them on uncrossed or whatever and changes the scissors to match its different for each one depending on the scissors but when a newcomer does it chances are hes wrong and everybody knows it they keep playing until he catches on its not the scissors its the legs so maybe someone has his legs crossed and he passes the scissors on uncrossed saying theyre crossed and everyone agrees but the poor innocent whos looking at the scissors the signs dug said theyre the scissorsand you have to look at where they are instead of what they are thats the challengeto figure out the key before you get creamed and this was just the practice run to give us a chance piers anthony before we blow it for real kim agreed though one of those wrong paths sure looked final to me it isnt sherlock said i saw where it has a leveling slope after the drop tike a ski jump then it deadends it looks worse than it is so now we know cyrus said but we have only one sled i for one would rather not use it so lets go find some other way kim said gratefully let them have our sled if they want it im not eager to ride down nada protested dug pursed his lips how do you feel about it jenny i dont mind which way as long as i have sammy to guide me dug looked at kim want to exchange companions kim was astonished can we do that she had thought nadas suggestion to that effect was sarcastic we can try it and see what happens i never saw any rule saying no kim considered this amazing proposal jenny was good and sammy was useful but nada could become a serpent and a formidable bodyguard dug would need the cats ability to sneak through the chasm valley without blundering into the dragon it seemed a fair exchange lets do it she decided so nada naga joined kim and cyrus while jenny joined dug and sherlock sammy cat remained with jenny and bubbles dog remained with kim it all seemed even then nada assumed large serpent form and slithered up the snowy slope she could handle it better in that form man in the human form the snow gave her sinuous body purchase she reached a small tree clamped her teeth on it and let cyrus and kim use her body like a rope to climb up more readily when they reached the sapling nada went on up again after several such stages they reached die top cold but safe then kim held out nadas jacket while cyrus faced away so nada could return to human form and get quickly dressed demons dont dream were up kim called down to the others who were now out of sight on the ledge okay dug called back from below been nice knowing you were going down there was the sound of the sled moving and now we have to start our long walk around the gap chasm kim said but im relieved not to have to ride down any farther the others nodded agreement so it almost seemed did bubbles dragon dug watched the other party scale the slope leaving the gap chasm his feelings were mixed he was sorry to see nada naga go because she was the most luscious female creature he could imagine but she had also been a distraction he had been more or less blundering through the challenges and that was no good he needed to focus clearly on what he was doing he wasnt interested in winning the prize just in extending his time in the game but he realized that he had to keep winning challenges and following the general course of the game or he would soon enough be dumped out of it so nada had probably been a net liability not because of her but because of him jenny elf in contrast was not a romantic figure he had no hankering to see her panties or body and her cat was one supremely useful creature the way he had found the bobsleds and the correct path down the slopethat was a tremendous asset in this game so jenny made all the sense nada didnt for him he should be able to do much better now demons dont dream but why had kirn agreed to the exchange she hadnt wanted to sled down into the depths and meet the dragon he could appreciate why but jenny would have gone out of the chasm with her nada hadnt wanted to sled on down but would have because she had to follow the route her player decided on so they hadnt had to switch for that reason what did nada offer that kirn wanted well protection of course nobody much messed with nada in her huge serpent form nobody it seemed except the gap dragon she had been quick to point out that she couldnt back off that particular monster and he had been quick to pick up on that fact so despite what he had said he was worried there was a real threat down there and he had better have a notion how to handle it before he got there so now kirn had that serpent protection was that what she wanted he turned to look down into the chasm cold fog shrouded die depths so he couldnot see more than the beginning of the trail they should be able to navigate it successfully now that they had the key to the signs if that went wrong sammy cat would let them know so the trip down shouldnt be a problem but the dragon would be more than enough to make up for it what are we going to do about that dragon he asked the others thats bothering you sherlock asked in mock surprise me too if it eats me im gone if it eats you im stuck down there with no game player to lead the way the companion doesnt have to help me you know if dug gets eaten hell disappear from xanth jenny said then ill call professor grossclout and hell take me out ill ask him to take you too why should he bother because the game isnt supposed to interfere with regular people of xanth youre a regular person so the professor will have to put you back where we found you she hesitated if i may ask why did you come with dug andnadar piers anthony i am a member of the black wave im trying to find a place for us to stay where folk will be glad to have us or where there are no other folk to be concerned oh like the curse fiends she said the whatr they were folk of the seventh wave who settled hi lake ogrechobee and became die curse friends only others call diem the curse fiends they remained sort of isolated and never really mixed with the other folk of xanth so i guess youre the fifteenth wave you want to be separate like them no not really but were prepared to be if thats the way of it these curse friendstheyre not really fiends then no theyre just people they act in plays and go on tours entertaining others i think maybe they would have mixed but nobody invited them to exactly maybe i should talk with the curse fiends after we get by the dragon dug said firmly nobodys talking with anybody if he gets eaten first sheiiock and jenny exchanged half a glance mans got a point sherlock said can ask sammy how to get away from the dragon jenny said but i dont think sure enough the cat started running up the slope in the same direction kirns party had gone jenny had to chase after him cancelling her statement so he wouldnt keep looking for the way away from the dragon then dug had a notion that evil cloud whatshisname fractalhe still around there was a warning rumble from the depths the mist was part of the cloud and he was still there maybe better not to aggravate him by mispronouncing his name sherlock murmured fracto fracto dug said contritely sorry about that of course we dont want to aggravate him he could blow up a storm again and bury us sherlock looked at him as if suspecting dug of some demons dont dream devious purpose but did not comment sherlock was right dug now knew how to get by the dragon kim called down from above they had made it out of the chasm okay dug called they were ready to get into the roberta sled but sherlock hesitated whats the matter dug asked ive got long legs thats not enough footroom in this sled for me isnt it the same as the other sled no take a look sherlock climbed inand his rear came back into the second persons place it looked uncomfortable for him and it would push the other two back so that there wouldnt be enough room for the third person at the end well have to change the order dug said jenny you try it jenny got in but her legs were much shorter not reaching far into the front dug and sherlocks longer legs couldnt fit in the remaining space so again there wasnt room for the third man then ill have to do it dug said he got in and jenny took the middle with sammy cat in her lap and sherlock took the end now they fit perfectly sherlock showed him how to steer it was not hard the man assured him the other sled had been magically responsive so that it seemed that even a thought directed it all dug really had to do was hold the handles and focus on where he wanted to go and it would go there belatedly he wondered had the game arranged it this way because he was me player who should handle his challenges himself the prior run had been for practice so it didnt matter who steered the sled but this one was for the money how could the demon proprietors have known that dugs sled would be lost and that he would change to the other one they must have had magical information they got settled hi the roberta sled and started down dug knew this was going to be one harrowing ride but he reminded himself that it was after all only a game there piers anthony was always a way through and they had found the way through for the sled he hoped the sled started with a frightening plunge it gathered such velocity that dug abruptly doubted that he had a true path down this could only end in a splat he felt jenny tense a glance back showed her frozen with half a scream in her mouth and the cat was hiding his head under her knees then the ground curved up and the sleds runners took a better grip on reality but before jenny could get her scream the rest of the way out the trail made a savage turn and ended in a square dropoff there was space at either side so that he could steer off the trail avoiding the disaster but the trail was clear and mere was no sign so it should be right despite the appearance what should he do dug had only seconds to decide he froze that meant mat he did nothing the sled rushed on down the trail and off the dropoff dug heard a muttered sheesh from the rear then out of the fog loomed a wall and in the wall was a crevice and the sled slammed into mat crevice and zoomed on the trail had jumped a gap in the slope had the sled been moving slower it would have crashed into the wall beneath the gap flattening them and dropping them into whatever lay below had he steered it off the trail he might have brought it to a stop but they would have been stuck partway down the wall of the chasm so he had made the right decision by default they came to a fork the sign said right and it was on me right side so dug steered it that way this path dropped so that they sped up again and again there was a bit of nervous choice there seemed to be several tracks all converging farther down so it made no difference which one he followed but some were more ragged than others the sled struck a bump and sailed into the air and he almost lost control it did make a difference because they could capsizeor whatever it was mat a bobsled demons dont dream didif he managed it wrong so he steered for the smoothest path and corrected course as they bounced around gaining proficiency he managed to keep them upright and pointed forward the tracks converged then the main track suddenly curved up so sharply that it looped what is mis a rollercoaster ride dug demanded rhetorically no a flume ride sherlock said as the loop exited into a bank of snow that shook loose and slid down the slope they were carried along in the flowing current of white powder the snow had given up being technicolor and was now plain vanilla white again they were falling part of an avalanche but it was not an easy ride dug had to keep steering by focusing lest they turn over or turn sideways this was like one of those purely mechanical computer games requiring constant finger dexterity and spot judgment to avoid being dumped fortunately he had played a number of such games before getting bored with men intellectual simplicity and had a fairly steady hand if this is the right trail dug puffed through the enveloping snow id hate to see the wrong one thistoo leveled out at last they came to another sign saying right but they couldnt see me fork it had been hidden by the fall of snow where could they steer dug solved the problem by going right at the sign the sled hit it and crashed on the others understood the logic he hoped they had to go along the path marked by the sign which meant that the sign itself would be beside it they might not be on the path but it would be close to them sure enough the sled bumped men dropped into a slight channel it had found the path then the sides rose up and hey were cruising through a ushaped valley he had to steer with excruciating care to keep them on course by banking on the turns this was a really nervous workout but was mis the correct path how could he be quite sure the valley curved taking them around and around until they had completed a circle but they were below the prior piers anthony track it was a corkscrew turn the walls closed over the top and they were plunging through darkness dug heard water was there an underground river here then light came and he saw that they had entered a cavern with a hole in the ceiling for a sunbeam ahead was a waterfall the water came from the right side and fell into the center of the cave where it flowed on to the left the sled bucked like a bronco as it traversed the slush by the river they could still crash there was another sign left but it was on the right side at least were on the proper trail sherlock said sounding relieved as dug steered the sled directly toward the waterfall how can you be sure jenny demanded seeing disaster looming because they wouldnt put another sign on a wrong trail theyd just terminate it then they plunged into the sheet of falling water and through it there was space behind it descending sparks flashed as the runners scraped against bare rock they skidded onto sand and on down through a round hole just large enough to let mem through they sailed out into space and bright light and landed with a plunk on a monster pillow bush pillows popped sending fluff flying wide but they had stopped safely they were at the base of the chasm they climbed out and looked around behind mem was the steep slope of the chasm wall with its tiny hole up just too high for a standing man to reach from the floor ahead of them was a flat open expanse beyond it was the far wall of the chasm rising vertically to a ledge and thence to another ledge to either side was the length of the great valley curving out of sight it was actually a pleasant enough place there was even a pie tree a short distance away then they felt a shudder in the ground it was followed by another whomp whomp the gap dragon jenny cried hes comingand we cant escape him here demons dont dream if you have a plan sherlock said wryly its about time to put it into effect first i want to settle with that stupid cloud whatshisname who couldnt put out enough snow to cover die slope dug said there was an angry rumble from above fracto was listening and reacting to the criticism but its the dragon we have to settle with first jenny said alarmed the whomping was getting louder no its mat wimpish cloud dug insisted if fractal had the gumption god gave a turnip hed have laid snow all me way down to the floor so we could coast down properly instead of having to shunt into a watery cave but i guess hats what happens when you depend on airheads there was a louder rumble but it was matched by the closer whomping in a moment the gap dragon would round the turn and spy them dug sherlock said looking pale around the gills which was a good trick tm sorry dug said stoutly but i just cant let inadequacy pass that pipsqueak cloud didnt do his job right and we had to land in a bed of pillows instead of a bed of snow the way it should have been i dont know why the demons chose such a malingerer they should have known flacto would botch it you keep getting the name wrong jenny shouted over the double noise of rumbling and whomping youre just going to make fracto even madder so who cares if fatso gets mad dug yelled its about time someone called a wimp a wimp he couldnt work up a decent blow down here hes just a stupid washout the mist along the slope pulled itself into a furiously swilling cloud jags of lightning shot out from it the baleful face of fracto formed staring down jenny screamed the gap dragon no mats crapto the least of clouds you can tell by his vacuous expression i mean down on the ground there she pointed piers anthony dug looked indeed it was tire dragon a serpentine sixlegged creature with a long mouthful of teeth puffing steam dug stood his ground dont worry he shouted framto wouldnt dare wet on the gap dragon so the poopy cloud cant get at us sherlock opened his mouth as if about to address an idiot then there was a little flash above his head that wasnt lightning he had caught on to what dug was doing yeah he agreed clouds are notorious cowards fracto exploded pieces of cloud flew everywhere each with the same furious face of the original toothpicksized jags of lightning flew out from them sticking into the ground one minijag struck the charging dragon on the trail the dragon whirled unhurt but stung by the barb he sent a sizzling stream of steam at the main remaining body of the cloud unfortunately the hot vapor only gave the thing a joh of extra energy the central blob expanded rapidly incotporating the surrounding cloudlets more lightning flashed suddenly fracto was formidable aw its all flash and no snow dug called the things too hot to make snow anyway the boiling cloud turned gray then snow began to fly in a moment mere was a blizzard obscuring the dragon dug grabbed the hands of the others silently he led them back to roberta sled still amidst the pillow bush they grabbed pillows to protect themselves from the sudden cold they heard the dragon casting about searching for them but the blizzard made visibility almost zero as long as they were silent they could not be found except by accident sherlock squeezed dugs hand appreciatively the ploy had worked and was hiding them from the dragon but dug knew that this was only part of it before long the cloud would storm himself out and the snow would melt and the dragon would be waiting for them so they had to act while the storm remained in silence which demons dont dream meant that he couldnt explain the rest of his plan to the others he would have to show them by action he tied pillows to his body by knotting their corners together he got rope from his pack and strung it out so the others could hang on to it not losing him then he set out across the floor of the gap he knew which way to go because the sled pointed that way if he veered a bit to the side it didnt matter he would find the wall soon enough he heard the dragon moving still searching there was a hiss as steam seared out to melt the snow but more kept falling as fracto proved himself the skirling snow blotted out both vision and mell dug angled his walk to steer well clear of the creature any little mistake could bring the steam and then the dragon and it would be over if this werent a fantasy game he would have been almost too frightened to act as it was he was nervous enough suddenly the wall loomed ahead good he got down and silently scooped up a double handful of snow he formed it into a ball then rolled the ball picking up more snow when the ball was as large as he could conveniently handle he rolled it to the base of the wall and left it there then he started another the others caught on they made snowballs of their own and rolled them big and added them to the first one the pile grew rapidly and expanded into a ramp which they quietly packed firm then they rolled balls up it to make it higher wedging them into place and filling in the crevices with more snow by the time the storm began to ease the ramp extended all the way up to the first ledge in the wall well above their heads they rolled balls up to that ledge forming a second smaller ramp extending from that ledge to a higher one dug wasnt sure that the second ledge led where they needed to go but there was no way to find out except to get there and see the snow stopped falling the mist cleared up there was a snort the dragon spied them get up to the ledge dug cried piers anthony they scrambled leaving their last snowballs behind the dragon whomped toward them but now there was a thick layer of snow on the ground interfering with his navigation he spun to the side and rolled tail over snoot that gave the three of them time to make it to the ledge the dragon righted himself and blew out a thick stream of steam the snow shrank nervously away from it the dragon walked slowly toward the wall melting snow before him it was impressive then sherlock realized something the ramp he can use it too oops we must knock it away quickly dug said he and sherlock sat on the edge of the ledge and kicked at the ramp while jenny hauled in the loose rope and coiled it but the ramp was packed solid now and gave way reluctantly we built too well sherlock said the dragon reached the base of the ramp his steam melted the packed snow he paused considering he was not all that stupid it turned out he aimed his steam upward and started mounting the ramp dug got out his club and whammed at the snow but this too was ineffective because he didnt dare swing hard enough to do real damage for fear of hitting sherlock stand back he cried ill bash this out sherlock got out of the way dug braced himself and swung a huge swing the club bashed into the snow caughtand jerked out of his hands oh no dug cried diving for it he got his hands on it but overbalanced falling onto the ramp himself he scrambled to get back but couldnt instead he toppled off the ramp he grabbed at it but succeeded only in breaking his fall somewhat he landed on his feet beside the ramp holding the club now he was in for it one moment of carelessness had dumped him into the worst possible situation he was pretty sure he couldnt fight the dragon it wouldsteam him before he got close enough to do any damage but maybe the dragon was too dull to realize what had demons dont dream happened maybe the creature would keep climbing the ramp and and what gobble up the other two people hey steamsnoot dug cried waving his weapon the dragon spied him he pondered again then he got smoothly off the ramp and advanced on dug he was not so dull as not to realize that the morsel on the ground was easier to nab than the two on the ledge dug ran in a moment he heard the dragon whomping after him but again the snow interfered and the dragon got fouled up in his own torso it seemed that it required a delicate balance to whomp and the snow prevented this that gave dug slightly more of a chance than otherwise dug ran in a circle pursued by the dragon who had to melt a path ahead of him even so he wasnt exactly slow dug looped back to the ramp and charged up it but the dragon whipped back on his tail much faster he had a cleared area where he had been as dug tried to cross to the ledge the dragon whomped his foresection sailed right up and came down across the ramp his weight and mass knocked out a section of it dug slid to a stop almost falling on the dragons back the monster was already bringing his head sinuously back ready to chomp him could he smite that snoot with his club he lifted it in both handsand the dragon sent a waft of steam and almost boiled him where he stood had he not still been protected by pillows he could have been finished right then dug had to reverse and run back off the ramp now the ramp was out and he was trapped on the floor of the chasm the dragon was getting steadily more savvy well could he fight after all it seemed ridiculous to have the club and never even try to use it if he timed the blasts of steam so as to dodge them then struck from the side he stood his ground as the dragon closed on him he watched for the steam the dragon inhaled started to exhale and dug threw himself to the side but his foot slipped in the slushy snow and he fell on piers anthony his face the blast of steam passed just over his back the snow melted around him dug scrambled up he plunged to the side trying to get into position for a strike but the dragons snoot was tracking him and the dragons torso was inhaling could he strike before the dragons breath reversed and cooked him he tried but die dragons head dodged to the side and fired another hiss of steam at dugs feet dug leaped clear and the steam melted the snow where he had stood he landed on his back in the snow his club waving helplessly some hero he was turning out to be as he scrambled back to his feet he saw that there was a hole in die ground where the snow had melted it was just about big enough for a man to fall into he was lucky he hadnt stepped there when it was covered by the snow he tried once more to bring his weapon into play but mis time the dragons tail whipped around and stung his hand he dropped the club and retreated his hand smarting he was having one close call after another it was no good trying to fight the dragon he just wasnt cut out for it he really didnt know how to use the club and was as likely to hurt himself as the enemy he was probably better off without it but the dragon was better coordinated than he was he couldnt outmaneuver him what could he do to escape dug turned around and ran directly away from the dragon but the dragon whomped after him with distressing vigor dug tried to dodge again and slipped again he sat upand there was the dragons snoot right before his face the dragons mouth slowly opened dug realized that he was done for he had blundered all the way made a thorough ass of himself and now would be dispatched he was disgusted why hadnt he used his brain to figure out some effective strategy instead of just scrambling aimlessly through the snow his brain suddenly in this seemingly hopeless situation it was perking onto high this was the game there was always a way through maybe several ways that hole demons dont dream in the groundhe might have crawled into that and escaped the dragon of course there might have been danger down mere like biting insects ferocious rats or goblins maybe it was an escape he could have used if he had chosen goody goblin as companion goody would have related to the other goblins and gotten him through if he had taken horace centaur as companion he might have ridden away from the dragon he doubted that whomping could match the speed of a gallop if he had stayed with grundy the golem might have talked with the plants down here and gotten information where there was a secret passage through the wall or something marrow bones the walking skeleton might havewell he wasnt sure what marrow might have done but there was surely something but he wasnt with any of those he was with jenny elf whose little cat had been unable to find a way out and in any event he was now stuck here alone so there might be many ways out but he had managed to avoid them all and make his situation worse because after provoking fracto into hiding them with the blizzard he had stopped using his mind and just slogged ahead physically he saw now that the dragon knew it was the game those near misses with the steam had been intentional maybe getting confused by the blizzard had been an act too in real life he would have been chomped immediately the dragon had been giving him a chance to get away if he only had me wit to figure it out now the dragon was pausing giving him one more chance he had to take it he reached into his pocket and found the germ of an idea he didnt need to put it to his forehead he knew what to do with it in this punnish realm dragon beware he cried ive got a germ if you chomp me youll get it the dragon hesitated so it did understand his words and it was cautious about a germ few predators cared to eat diseased prey probably the dragon knew it wasnt that kind of germ but by the law of the pun he had to accept it dug had finally used his brain and found a way piers anthony go ahead he said playing it for what it was worth as he got up chomp me gobble up the germ maybe it wont hurt you for sure it wouldnt hurt the dragon the dragon closed his mouth considering then a thought percolated through he aimed his snoot and inhaled he was going to cook the prey getting rid of the germ that way but now dug was on his feet he put them into gear and ran for the wall a jet of steam singed the snow beside him anotfier close miss thanks dragonbreath dug muttered but he knew the dragon wouldnt miss too many more times there were limits even to the game he had to make good his escape now or it would surely be never he touched the germ to his forehead as he ran the idea came to him jenny he called let down the rope for me anchor it jenny threw down one end of the rope while sheriock tied the other end to a crag dug reached it grabbed it and hauled up his legs just as another bolt of steam splashed against the wall where they had been he handed himself up the rope walking the wall with his feet rappelling it was called or something and the dragon was letting him do it because it was an approved way to escape obviously in real life the dragon could have dispatched him instantly but the game required that the player be given every chance it had surely been the same with the roc in the tall hassle tree forest and the censorship all he had to do was to learn to play the game right he made it to the ledge and heaved himself over just in time his arms were starting to cramp from the unaccustomed exertion no matter that this was just a game and he wasnt really here and his real body was sitting mesmerized by the stupid screen he was into the spirit and sensation of it and he felt what he was supposed to feel which at the moment was mostly joy because now he understood what he needed to to get wherever he was going he had made the sensible decision to part company with demons dont dream nada naga getting rid of a foolish distraction now he had made the decision to play the game right after almost losing track and getting skunked he stood on the ledge and peered down at the dragon the dragon peered up at him then the dragon winked but one thing nagged dugs mind he had been clumsy even after making allowances he had fallen almost right under the dragons snoot at that point he had made what should have been a fatal mistake and paid the price for it com pewter had shown no mercy on him when he lost the riddle contest why had the dragon been so much more generous he reviewed it in his mind suspecting that there was some key element he had missed key elements were important here they could apply to more than one situation as had been the case with the germ he wanted to fathom this one he had fallen down while trying to bash out the ramp so the dragon could not reach the ledge so then he was on the ground and the dragon was mounting the ramp the dragon was about to gobble up the two people trapped on the ledge so dug had cried out attracting the dragons attention to himself and there it was he had in the heat of the moment acted selflessly he had put himself in peril to save his companions no matter that the dragon wasnt really after them because one was the companion and the other was just a fellow traveler dug had done a generous thing he must have earned a bonus point and because of it the dragon had let him go after a reasonable show now he understood so now he winked back at the dragon after which he turned around lets see where we can go from here he said im sure theres some way up what does sammy say the little cat bounded up the snow steps the two had made to the higher ledge he knew where to gonow that piers anthony they were past the dragon the companion could help but the player had to handle the main challenge okay and what would be the next challenge he could find out jenny what will we find south of the gap chasm he asked the elf girl as they followed the upper ledge to a hole in die cliff that now appeared im not sure of the details but i know theres quick sand and slow sand there she said and the gnobody gnomes and the cow boys and the knockkneed knights now why do i have the feeling that those are not ordinary gnomes or young men who herd cows dug inquired rhetorically the cow boys are bullheaded she agreed and the knights are empty and theres also com pewter somewhere hi there pewter this was the one he had been waiting for the rematch jenny elf didnt realize that he had already encountered the evil machine and had a score to settle he should have known that his path would lead him there because he could not win the game without nullifying whatever had balked him before so now he knew his next major challenge this time he intended to be prepared pewter he murmured im going to kick your metal butt then he focused on their climb out of the chasm because he had learned better than to ignore the details of the moment sammy cat was leading the way but there could still be complications they were now in a wormlike tunnel wending upward festooned with spider webbing but the worm would have had to be the size of the diggle well maybe it had been a diggle who forgot to phase out when traveling so left a hole in the ground just so long as it led them back to ground level meanwhile he would keep an eye out for anything that might enable him to handle pewter so mat he could continue playing the game and remain in xanth merci kim walked east along the gap chasm the snow was already melting it seemed that the evil cloud could blow up a snowstorm but couldnt actually cool me land that was just as well fracto had caused too much misery already i guess wed better fill you hi on what we were up to before we met kim said to nada naga jenny and i encountered the ogres of the ogre fen then ran afoul of fracto and got washed into the water wing where cyrus rescued us on the way out i found bubbles she patted the dog cyrus is looking for a wife nada glanced sidelong at cyrus so i garnered he wouldnt happen to be a prince would he no im just a regular merman cyrus said why i have been looking for a husband she said candidly but i would prefer to have a prince i would not do for you anyway because i must marry either a mermaid or a fish i would prefer the mermaid i am not surprised the naga sometimes must marry either full human folk or full serpent folk but we prefer our piers anthony own kind however we also many to cement liaisons with other species but this is done only between princes and princesses but your brother naldo married mela merwoman kim said she wasnt a princess was she my brother prince naldo has an eye for the ladies she replied evenly he happened to catch a glimpse of melas panties and decided to marry her mela fills her panties very well considering her age shes young cyrus asked no old but she retains her youthful proportions which are generous my brother noticed she shrugged males have never been much for following me rules our father was annoyed until he met the merwoman then he concluded that mis was a warranted exception to our policy sounds like sexism to me kim muttered her proportions are surely not more generous than your own cyrus said diplomatically oh i believe they are you have to understand mat merwomen are not quite the same as mermaids they are better endowed i think it is because the sea is colder than the hikes and rivers perhaps the salt has something to do with it she glanced again at him have you ever swum in salt cyrus never but i shall be happy to give it a try i understand that the merfolk of the sea and the merfolk of the lakes are incompatible for that reason nada said but that is only hearsay kim heard something is that a storm down inside the gap chasm she asked tlie others paused to listen that sounds like fracto nada said do you think mat dug was crazy enough to aggravate that cloud again well i was crazy enough to do it before kim said dugs like me in some respects oh do you like him yes i guess i do kim said shyly demons dont dream why didnt you say something well where i come from a girl doesnt you are not where you come from nada pointed out kim shrugged still hes from mundania too hes handsome while i she didnt care to finish i suppose he is nada said i hadnt noticed he does seem to be interested in she hesitated mature women oh was he getting fresh with you kim asked morbidly curious he died to glimpse my panties and almost got put out of the game after that he was more careful so that explains it kim said i thought he was remarkably polite for a teenage boy he became polite he seems clever enough when one allows for his immaturity all mundane boys are immature thats why they need girls to mature mem nada smiled theyre not so different mat those of xanth she peered into the chasm i think thats another snowstorm i wonder whats going on down mere a small light flashed over kirns head melting the last of the snow in her vicinity a blinding blizzard would mat hide them from the dragon i think it might nada agreed then dug mustve deliberately insulted fracto to create that diversion kim said delighted so they could get through safely you do like him nada said but he has no interest in me so it doesnt matter lets get on and win this game bubbles was happy to lead the way her tail curling up in a perfect semicircle the path was clear and there were no bad creatures in the way but kim knew mat there would be another challenge before too long she hoped she would be ready for it as they went they had to discard items of clothing be piers anthony cause of the returning warmth it was hard to imagine that this had so recently been a snowscape bubbles barked kirn looked around because there was always something when the dog gave warning specks appeared in the sky they danced around growing larger they did not seem to be birds or insects their outlines were squared off and their motions too bobbing what are those kirn asked nada looked kites i think they like to fly about the gap because of updrafts mere oh i used to love to fly kites kirn exclaimed are these magict everything is magic in xanth nada said theres a string cyrus said he strode forward reaching for it i wouldnt nada said warningly but he was already grabbing the string he hauled on it bringing the kite down it was a huge cubic thing brightly colored the kite suddenly plunged looming close it swept into cyrus knocking him down then free it sailed back up out of reach kim dashed over to help him are you all right she asked worriedly cyrus sat up shaking his head three little birds were flying around it cheeping just dizzy i think he said dizzily what happened you grabbed the string of a box kite nada explained it boxed you kim helped him stand he was unsteady but the little birds evidently decided he was all right and flew away no more kites he said no more kites kim agreed nada looked around thats odd whats odd kim asked concerned she saw that bubbles seemed perplexed too we seem to be a good deal farther along man i would demons dont dream have thought this looks like the terrain beyond gap village and maybe beyond the goblin village too kim realized that the terrain had changed during their distraction by the kite they were still north of the gap proceeding east but the lay of the land was different could this be a device of the game to move us more rapidly to the next challenge it must be nada agreed professor grossclout has demonic powers well he is a demon kim agreed as they proceeded kim saw that not only had the scene changed it differed in type instead of idle stones by the wayside mere were crystals in fact they soon became fancier with pretty colors they looked like diamonds rubies sapphires emeralds opals amethysts garnets and all manner of other gems many were small but some were large and a few were huge kim gazed at diem in wonder oh ive always loved pretty stones she said but the best i could afford was smoky quartz which is to real gems as glop is to gold fvc never even imagined such a display i think theyre hiquigems nada said impossible to use highque gems kim asked are they dangerous no they are harmless but you really cant touch them bubbles was sniffing at a nearby gem kim squatted reaching for the lovely red spinel the size of an apple i wont get shocked or anything nothing like that but you are wasting your tune kirns fingers closed around the beautiful gem she picked it up with an oooh of appreciation admiring its facets then something happened oh i dropped it she exclaimed chagrined indeed something red fell to the ground but it didnt look like a gem it looked like a blob of red gelatin it landed silently then as her eyes focused on it she saw that she had piers anthony been mistaken it was the same gem she had picked up undamaged but how could she have dropped it it had somehow seemed to flow through her fingers a weird sensation she picked it up again cautiously again it fell but this time she saw it happen the thing lost form became a big drop of red liquid slid between her fingers landed on the groundand reformed into the gem cyrus tried to pick up a diamond it too slipped through his grip and turned up on the ground unchanged he stared bemused hiquigems nada repeated they dont allow folk to move them its like a dream kirn said as impressed by the willful magic of the gems as by their number size and beauty they seem so real yet they might as well be illusion much of xanth is illusion nada said the rest is puns and dragons pun the magic dragon kim murmured under her breath smiling they walked on through the glorious display slanting sunlight struck the myriad facets of the gems and refracted even more colorfully up so that they walked through anas pretty as the ground apparently this was just a passing diversion not a challenge unless she was supposed to find a way to take one of the gems could there be one among them that was takable that would help her in the future she decided to let it be she preferred to leave these magic stones alone they left the gems behind they rounded a turnand there before them was the broad expanse of the sea the path went right down to itbut so did the chasm so the only way to cross the chasm was to cross the sea and mis time they didnt have a boat had this trek been for nothing maybe we can make a boat kim said it isnt far to cross to the other side of the chasm demons dont dream perhaps we can swim across cyrus said i dont see any monsters this is salt water nada reminder him see there is saltwater taffy growing by the shore all die more reason to try it he walked boldly to the beach and dipped his toe vow warned you nada said youre a freshwater merman cyrus stepped back chagrined that brine is awful what selfrespecting creature would touch that let alone swim in it there was a cheery cry from the sea oooooo it was a melodious female voice with the accent on the first syllable are you land folk lost they peered out to sea there was the head of a young woman she was swimming we are trying to get to the other side of the gap chasm kim called back but we dont know if its safe to swim and one of us doesnt like the salt water the woman swam rapidly closer its perfect salt water she said indignantly i have spent all my life in it to illustrate her point she dived under showing her flukes cyrus stared thats a mermaid he cried merwoman nada clarified look at her dficolletage indeed kim saw that the creature was superbly endowed in fact she had a set of breasts best described as monumental yet perfectly contoured the kind kim herself would never dare dream of having cyrus attention was no less fixed than kirns own what a creature he breathed another little light flashed over kirns head theres your wife maybe she said whats that the woman called from the sea tm kim human and this is nada naga kim called back are you married no bachelor mermen dont grow on shoe trees you piers anthony know my mother had to make legs and trek endlessly on land to find a suitable husband another light flashed your motherwas she by chance mela merwomant no there was no chance about it she was melantha from the day the storkfish delivered her as sure as water quenches fire im her daughter merci why did she need a husband cyrus said didnt she have your father mercis lovely brow clouded a stupid dragon toasted him when i was away at a school of fish just ten years ago when i was a merchild mother fretted a bit men finally took the plunge as it were and went landward to nab her man it was all so complicated it wasnt as if she was choosy all she wanted was the nicest handsomest most manly bachelor prince available she finally landed prince naldo naga since then shes been so busy entertaining him mat i hardly see her they seem to believe in long honeymoons its pretty lonely now i am dangerously close to twentyone hardly a mergirl any more and nary a merman in sight indeed she was hardly a girl theres one in sight now kim said merci meet cyrus merman merci turned her beautiful dark eyes on cyrus really lets see you in tails i cant change here cyrus said im a freshwater creature oh sure merci retorted how do i know youre not a regular ordinary sneaky man trying to trick me into legs so you can catch me away from water and make me do something nymphly with you im tired of you louts who think its all right to tell a girl anything just to get your germy hands on her innocent torso nada made an appreciative move i like this creature she murmured so do i kim replied not as much as i do cyrus said then to merci demons dont dream find me some fresh water and ill be glad to show you some germfree tail theres a freshwater spring a little way up the beach merci said so they walked up the beach away from the chasm and bubbles found the spring she lapped some of its water it was hot but bearable cyrus dipped his toe and pronounced it fit turn your backs ladies he said to kim and nada i must strip so i dont ruin my clothing they dutifully turned their backs in three quarters of a moment and half an instant there was a splash they turned again and cyrus was basking in the spring but i cant see your tail from here merci called then come over here he called back merci swam to the very edge of the sea she changed and stood resplendent with a fine set of legs bubbles went down to intercept her with a woof merci walked up across the beach to the spring and peered down you are a merman she said delighted get your tail in here he invited the waters fine dont be silly im allergic to fresh water the only way i can handle it at all is in this form she gestured at her legs with her hands he eyed her appraisingly actually you are not wholly unattractive in that form though it can not of course compare with your natural one evidently it was not a violation of merfblk propriety to view a merwoman in legs or a merman in tail like this creature merci murmured maybe he can make legs again so you can get acquainted on land kim suggested im not sure that would be decorous merci said certainly it wouldnt cyrus agreed however we can make it decorous by donning human clothing perhaps kim and nada will be so kind as to fetch you a skirt while i return to my trousers so they took merci to a nearby fabric plant and wrapped a length of seersucker around her body fashioning a ser piers anthony viceable dress they found lady slipper flowers and put a delicate pair of slippers on her dainty feet nada brushed her somewhat matted hair and set a passion flower in it now she looked just like a perfectly lovely human woman they returned to the spring where cyrus was dry and back in clothing he looked like a perfectly handsome human man oh you are surely the creature i wish to marry he said except and you are surely the creature id like to wed merci agreed except except that you cant stand each others water nada said what irony suppose we had merchildren cyrus said they might be intolerant of both kinds of water i fear our love is doomed merci said sadly kim knew the feeling she reacted against it there must be some compromise she said couldnt you uh get together in human form and return to your lake and sea betweentimes that would be uncouth cyrus said legs are so clumsy and unaesthetic tails are the only way to party merci agreed they certainly seemed to be well matched there must be some way kim said we just have to find it it would be nice cyrus said merci is exactly what i have been looking for except for the incompatibility of medium he glanced at her wrapped torso again in fact perhaps even more than i was looking for freshwater mermaids are somewhat more slender thats fine if you like that type merci remarked i find i like your type well well figure it out kim said maybe theres a spell but at the moment maybe you can help us merci we need to find a way to cross safely to the south side of the gap chasm you might swim if you dont mind fiftydegree water and a loan shark or two kim had tried swimming in eightydegree water once demons dont dream and found it too cool for comfort i think swimming is out anyway cyrus cant touch sea water is there a tunnel or something merci pondered there is a tunnel under the gap but it is not safe it must be safer than sharkinfested water kim said it is a goblin tunnel merci explained ouch nada said i dont relish goblins i can chomp one or several but they tend to come in hordes we had better avoid that kim looked around again knowing she would see nothing useful i wonder whether there is enough dry wood to make a raft i suppose you could build a raft merci agreed it should only take a few days kim sighed maybe it will have to be the tunnel and knowing the way the game works well have to prepare to fight off the goblins game merci asked shes from mundania nada explained shes here as part of a game the demons organized im her companion here to guide and protect her oh well i will show you the nearest entrance to the tunnel but dont know how you can deal with the goblins once when i made legs to walk to land to fetch some flowers goblins tried to catch me so they could do something horrible to me since then i have been very cautious about going on land and i dont like goblins at all the merwoman led the way to a thicket of bushes some distance back from the gap where the land was not too far above sea level there beneath their cover of foliage was a hole in the ground bubbles sniffed it its dry kim asked though it goes under the water its dry merci agreed though i understand there are portals in the bulkheads to flood it if necessary cant think why the goblins would want to make it that way this is naga work nada said examining the bricked piers anthony rim of the hole i recognize the type naga must have made this and later lost it to the goblins we have been slowly losing ground to mem for centuries hi fish school they taught me that the goblins once roamed freely on the ground merci said but that now there are relatively few there most are underground that is true nada said the harpies and humans warred with them and drove them out of much territory but they are in goblin mountain and theres always the goblinate of the golden horde the worst tribe of them all we dont know much about the ones deep belowground but suspect there are many she turned to kim hold my apparel i will investigate this then nada turned serpent and slithered out of her collapsing clothing kim picked up the outfit and folded it the serpent slithered into the hole and disappeared they must go on merci said to cyrus but must you go with mem there seems to be little point in my remaining here he said sadly i can not enter your sea realm any more than you can enter my lake realm i fear our love is doomed before it starts i must go on to see whether i can find a fresh mermaid i suppose you must she agreed perhaps we shall kiss before we part perhaps we shall he agreed perking up slightly it will be a remarkable experience she said dreamily and a poignant memory kim had another notion hey what about a wetsuit she asked we do not wish to get our clothing wet cyrus said gently it is not as durable as skin and scales no i mean a bodysuit for diving we have mem in mundania we use them to keep the water out and the heat in so we can swim in cold water if one of you wore a wetsuit could you swim in the water of the other wi suppose merci agreed it would not be very com demons dont dream fortable but it might enable us to visit each others homes but it would not be very nice for summoning the stork cyrus said which is an occasion which should not be ruined i fear it would be little better than doing it in human form ugh she agreed i suppose it could be tolerated in an emergency true human beings have to tolerate it knowing nothing better kim was getting to feel like an inferior species imagine having to as they put it summon the stork while wearing ungainly legs fortunately nada returned at this point she formed her human head on her snakes body it is clear though there is the smell of goblins about it i think we can get through if we move rapidly and are lucky but how will we see in that darkness kim asked there is glow fungus on the walls it seems dark compared to daylight but is light compared to night you will be able to see well enough lets go then kim said why dont you come too merci you can return to the sea from the other side if you want i suppose i could the merwoman agreed she did not seem at all eager to separate from cyrus and he seemed to return the uneagemess kim climbed down into the hole bubbles scrambling along with her and the two merfolk climbed down after her the interior was not dank as she had feared but a bit like a subway tunnel with tiled walls as her eyes adjusted she saw the glow on the wall the tunnel curved away they followed it in a downward spiral now bubbles was happy to lead the way her tail curving high the dog was never so happy as when she was escorting people somewhere the glow seemed to piers anthony get brighter as they went though she knew this was just the continued adaptation of her eyes she lost count of the circles they completed this was a good deep tunnel but finally it straightened out and headed in what she trusted was the right direction from it debouched side tunnels every so often going she knew not where maybe mis had once been a subterranean naga city she wondered what that community had been like then the main tunnel narrowed and the offshoots stopped bubbles barked nada slithering along in her naga form abruptly lifted her head i smell fresh goblin she said alarmed they were not here before maybe they make regular checks kim said is there anywhere we can hide no we are directly below the gap now and below the water of the sea inlet within it this is the narrowest section then wed better go back and take an offshoot kim said maybe theres a room or something to hide in there but they are coming from the rear nada said then wed better run forward they are coming from that direction too kim recognized a game challenge when she encountered it they were pinned underground between converging hordes of goblins how could they get out of this fix her concentration was interrupted by the approach of the goblins look fresh meat one cried from in front you have it wrong zilchpuss one cried from the rear first we entertain ourselves wickedly with the damsels then we dump them in the pot youre both wrong another cried first we boil them until they turn blood red then we use mem for entertainment then we eat them dont you know anything about protocol bubbles growled this was getting more serious by the instant not only demons dont dream were they going to be cooked some of them were going to get tortured as well kim hadnt realized that such things happened in xanth but she hadnt reckoned with the goblins there had to be a way out but what was it all she saw on the walls were indented handholds no tools or weapons her desperate gaze crossed the low ceiling she saw a circular indentation a portal they could let in the water of the sea but how would they breathe the merfolk could breathe waterbut one of them would be caught in the wrong kind of water so there was mischief no matter what bubbles woofed she was sniffing a circular indentation in the floor right below the one in the ceiling whats that kim asked wild hope flared a secret escape it is marked for fresh water nada said peering at the inscription on it the upper one is for salt water apparently my people had uses for each perhaps when they cleaned the tunnel no escape both portals sealed off water kirns heart sank to about the level of her stomach and her stomach sank to her belly meanwhile the goblins were advancing like the jaws of a vise or perhaps more accurately like the pincers of a garbage scoop they had clubs and spears but werent waving them threateningly not wishing to damage the merchandise before having their fun with it then kim thought of a way maybe this was a sealed tunnel which meant that the air was likely to be trapped in it that just might be their salvation open the ports she cried both of them let the water in but cyrus and merci said almost together you open the top one merci thats sea water it wont hurt you you open the bottom one cyrus thats fresh water it wont hurt you then just hang on staying in your piers anthony type of water were going to wash these goblins right out of our hair but how will we breathe nada asked therell be air in the top half of the tunnel just keep your head up and hang on we have to stay right here in the center the two merfolk applied themselves to the hatches they turned the plates unscrewing them kim grabbed one of the handholds set in the wall with one hand and caught bubbles collar with the other nada curled her tail into another handhold cyrus portal opened water blasted in at high pressure deflected by the cover which seemed to be anchored from below by the screw in its center he hung on to that cover holding it steady so that the water sprayed out in a rough circle mercis portal opened water blasted hi from above similarly deflected she hung on to that anchored cover so mat her water also made a circle for good or ill kirns plan was now in effect the surging waters merged on either side coursing down the tunnel the water was cool but not unbearably cold the currents swept into the goblins fore and aft shoving them back they were too surprised even to swear effectively suddenly they were fighting for their footing and their lives because they were not anchored the waters quickly filled the tunnel pushing violently outward but a level of air remained trapped at the top having nowhere to go kim held bubbles up so she could breathe it while breathing it herself nadas face was close to hers and she did the same the best place to be was in the center where there was no unified current just the chaotic backsurge soon the goblins were gone they had been swept out in both directions helplessly where they went kim didnt care they hardly deserved any good breaks close hatches kim cried the merfolk turned the disks the other way screwing demons dont dream them back into their niches it was hard work but they had leverage they got them closed and the spraying water was cut off the roar of it subsided and the currents calmed nadas human head glanced around that was well wrought kim she said you won the challenge i didnt mink you would figure it out in time it was a close call kim admitted if bubbles hadnt called my attention to the second portal i dont think i would have seen the answer she kissed the dogs wet ear and bubbles wagged her tail as well as she could in the water now let me see nada said can slosh through water and hold on better in human form were all females here except cyrus and hes a merman who has no concern about nakedness as long as he is in his natural form true cyrus agreed i do not wish to offend but my interest in creatures without tails is small so i will change nada became human a splendid figure of a bare woman in any event it is all right because im not wearing panties at the moment now i believe i can find me way out by following the old naga signals she started half walking half swimming along the flooded tunnel cyrus looked at merci now theres what i call an interesting creature he said from head to tail merci returned his look with similar candor i feel the same then the little light flashed over kirns head youre both in the same waterand not having trouble both merfolk were startled how can that be cyrus asked i cant stand salt and i cant stand fresh merci said this water is brackish which makes it uncomfortable but i can stand it i agree he said i can stand brackish water though it is not my delight piers anthony tire salt and fresh water mixed kim said so its all brackish now half and half now the twain can meet the twain can meet merci said approaching cyrus maybe we can make it in mis water she put her arms around him maybe we can he agreed kissing her several little red hearts appeared floating around them their tails twined together nada turned back dont make it here wait for the nuptials the kiss broke and me hearts faded of course merci said blushing certainly cyrus agreed embarrassed the proprieties must be observed too much was already being observed nada remarked kim was privately slightly vexed she knew dial part of the propriety related to her they considered her at age sixteen to be a borderline case and were careful to honor the adult conspiracy she had been curious about just how merfolk did make it still it was nice that the merfolk had discovered how to relate to each other she set her face forward and followed nada there was no sign of the goblins who must have been washed right out of the tunnels perhaps to some lower level where they were trying to figure out what happened the water slowly sank so that it was waist deep men knee deep the tunnel widened and more crosstunnels appeared all similarly flooded there was a sound of falling water suggesting that mere was indeed a drain somewhere the tunnel would be dry again in due course they needed to get out of it before mat happened because it was only the water that kept the goblins out nada led mem to another spiral this one going up the water was left behind that was a relief for bubbles who definitely preferred land to water the two merfolk had to change to legs and don clothing from kirns pack while demons dont dream the others turned their backs finally they climbed out through a hole they were on the south side of me gap chasm and there on the beach was a small wooden boat merci could have brought that across to us if we had only known it was there kim said chagrined why so i could have merci agreed surprised i have known about that boat for ages kim almost inquired why merci hadnt told her about the boat but she knew the answer she hadnt asked this was the game where the player had to figure things out kim had inquired about a passage and merci had answered kim had not asked about a boat a raft yes but not a boat she had missed the obvious well nada and bubbles and i have to be on our way kim said i guess youll want to stay here cyrus with merci when you want to get together with her all you have to do is find a place where a river meets the sea and the water mixes or maybe theres a freshwater spring under the sea where there can be a similar effect im sure youll figure it out i am sure we will cyrus agreed i thank you kim mundane for bringing me here you have indeed solved my problem and mine merci agreed she turned to cyrus i know where there is a freshwater spring by the shore i would love to show you more tail i am eager to see it he said they kissed again then waved farewell and walked eagerly down along the beach arms around waists so the adventure resumes kim said with mixed feelings she was glad for the merfolk but also envious of their happiness she knew that she faced a horrendous trek though the jungle where she might encounter anything at all it was the nature of the game dug blinked in the bright light as they emerged from the vole hole sure enough there was solid jungle all around he turned to jenny now this is the game he said and i understand were somewhere near the lair of com pewter the evil machine and that i have to settle with him before i can get much farther so do you know of a fairly direct safe path there i want to get this over with sammy jumped down and scampered along a faint path that seemed to appear only after the cat found it wait for me jenny cried chasing after him theres a path sherlock agreed but are you ready for the machine i understand those things can really mess up folk who dont know how to handle them for sure maybe i need to think about this a little more sammy stop jenny cried hes changed his mind the cat stopped losing interest in the path the others caught up to him the path where the cat had been was demons dont dream clear but ahead there seemed to be nothing but brambles briers and branches maybe a slightly indirect route dug said smiling maybe passing a place where there is something i need sammy resumed motion this time his pace was slower so mat they could keep up and it curved more but the oddity of die path remained there didnt seem to be any until the cat found it they came to a large field filled with weird plants theres something here you need sherlock inquired with a lifted eyebrow theres sure to be dug said so ill just start looking for it if you tell sammy exactly what it is hell find it for you jenny said i dont know exactly what it is but i hope to know it when i see it dug said why dont the two of you get some rest while i look this may take a while both jenny and sherlock looked perplexed but sammy didnt in fact sammy elected to join him in the search dug stepped into the field he saw mat the assorted plants were in rows and each had a little sign identifying it that ought to help the first plant he looked at had a number of light cones each looking suitable for ice cream or as it was in xanth eye scream sure enough it was labeled coneflower but that wasnt what he needed as he squatted to look at the next he developed an itch in an awkward place he straightened up and faced away from the others so as to be able to scratch it inconspicuously but the itch had gone so he squatted againand die itch returned the closer he leaned toward the plant the worse it got making him fidget something awful then he saw the sign and understood cockljbur as he moved toward the next which seemed to be a clump of grass something chafed in his trouserleg he looked down and saw a number of long arrowshaped morns in it he pulled these out carefully and resumed piers anthony motiononly to have more strike him he looked at the sign no wonder this was arrowgrass then his clothing seemed to get tight around the joints suspecting the next plant he squinted to see its sign from a distance sure enough it said bindweed next to it was a knotweed which he avoided now he came to a nicer section passing butterweed milkweed and candytuft those would do with a meal if there werent enough from other sources then he encountered a more awkward section spying lovegrass virgins bower bridal wreath and matrimony vine near those was a twinflower obviously this was what a woman needed if she wanted to reproduce more rapidly just send such a flower to the stork depot to let the stork know how many to deliver the next section was animalistic there was a cattail kittentail pussytoes dragonhead hounds tongue and squirreltail then full creatures bee plant butterfly weed chickweed duckweed goat grass monkey flower and oyster plant but none of them were what he needed then there were assorted sewing plants pincushion needle and thread thimble berry leather flower and hemlock that last was evidently what women wearing long skirts used to prevent the hems from unraveling so that they stepped on them there was a warning it shouldnt be taken internally lest it lock up the innards the next section had an emaciated skeleton weed a bright shooting star a wallflower and a paintbrush slopping a new color on it then came some seed plants stickseed tickseed and bugseed sammy was inspecting the last closely yes dug murmured harvesting some of its seeds that may be what i want he put the seeds in his demons dont dream pocket and went on because he did not want to draw attention to the nature of exactly what he wanted then he came to an ugly section cheatgrass poverty weed sneezeweed tumblegrass and choke cherry he managed to sneak past those without suffering too many afflictions but what followed was worse a patch of stinkweed he had had enough trouble with the stink horn to know the danger of this so he intelligently moved right on to the smartweed and then wisely to sagebrush the last plant in the row was labeled cryptogramma this was very puzzling he just couldnt figure it out so he left it alone it was also called rock brake but he couldnt tell whether it stopped big rolling stones or broke them up into pebbles he walked back along the second row there were endless wonders mere but he paid them less attention because he already had what he had come for then he saw a group of monias old middleaged young and new this might be even better so he took a new monia flower and set it in a buttonhole he returned to the others did you find what you wanted sherlock inquired dug coughed i think so you okay man sounds as if you have some congestion ill be all right dug said trying not to hack he hadnt realized that the flower would take effect so quickly but of course things could be instant in this magic land he would just have to suffer through sherlock and jenny had fixed a good meal but dug did not have much appetite he felt feverish and weak and his breathing was getting difficult but he pretended to be normal he had a reason they finished eating and moved on following the leisurely paths sammy found dug had to struggle to keep moving listen meres something wrong sherlock said ever since you looked through that garden patch youve piers anthony been stumbling as if youre sick what happened in merer nothing i can tell you dug said hoarsely just let me be sheriock exchanged one long glance and two short ones with jenny and let it drop the long glance bounced on the ground and shattered when it was dropped but the short ones survived intact but when dug staggered stumbled and fell jenny took action youre my responsibility she said because im your companion i will get in trouble for not guiding you well if you lose because you are too ill to continue we must find a healing spring that will make you well dug was now too sick to protest effectively he knew that what she said was true but he also knew mat he had to persevere or he would lose again to pewter he could not tell them why lest the evil machine learn of his words through some spy and be prepared to foil his ploy sheriock matte a iravois from wood and vine softening it with pillows he lifted dug onto it and hauled him along that way jenny had sammy find the nearest spring she wasnt able to clarify its particular type it seemed that to the cat one spring was much like another she was able only to establish that it not be a regular ordinary water source it had to be a magic spring as it turned out mere was one not too far away they reached it but were cautious dug heard them discussing it though he was now too tired to join the dialogue we have to be sure its a healing spring jenny said because there are different kinds such as love springs and bate springs it will be worse than nothing if we dose him with the wrong kind of elixir but how can we tell without trying it sheriock asked we dont want to taste a love spring or a hate spring either we certainly dont she agreed no offense to you because a love spring isnt just romantic it leads immediately to a violent summoning of the stork that would be demons dont dream a violation of the adult conspiracy because im still a child we dont want to violate any conspiracy sheriock agreed but inaction isnt any good either we have to test me water somehow could we just sniff a little so all we get is a mere suggestion maybe that will be all right she agreed doubtfully let me try it first then if i start getting romantic or whatever you run away those springs must be potent sheriock remarked exactly so jenny got down and sniffed the spring oh i feel young she exclaimed well you are young what kind of spring is it not a love spring she decided i dont love you or hate you but i do feel changed so maybe youve been healed of whatever was bothering you he said reasonably this must be the one we want maybe im not quite sure theres something odd about it you better sniff it too and see what you think sheriock got down and sniffed wow i feel two years younger you look a bit younger too she agreed is it healing you no i have a sore toe and its still sore maybe you should dip your toe and see if it heals good idea sheriock removed his shoe and dipped his sore toe the skin turned fresh but did not actually heal then they paused while an insect flew down to taste the water but the insect turned into a grub it must be a transforming spring jenny said it changed into another kind of bug no it reverted to its earlier form sheriock said insects hatch from grubs its their youthful stage he broke off realization coming a youth spring jenny cried this must be the foun piers anthony tain of youth nobody knows where it is and we stumbled on it by accident sammy didnt stumble on it he reminded her he was looking for a magic spring thats right and what a spring he found but it isnt the one we want dugs only a year older than i am really he doesnt want to be any younger youre fifteen sherlock asked i thought you were a child i am a child by game definition but outside the game im sneaking up on adult status and actually i know the secret of the conspiracy maybe i look younger to you because im an elf im smaller than a human girl my age would be that must be it he agreed well none of us need this elixir so wed better move on its an irony though a lot of people would give their fortunes to drink from this people are funny she agreed dug wanted to tell them to mark the place carefully so they could find the spring again because the knowledge would be invaluable but his breath was so short he couldnt speak they resumed then search following the cat to another spring dug caught a glimpse of it before sherlock laid the travois flat on the ground the spring was round with a quilted surface as if the waves lacked the energy to ripple properly this time when jenny sniffed she turned over and lay down on the water it must be an ether spring putting you to sleep sherlock said horrified no it isnt she replied its a bed spring oh i could just lie here forever and sleep indeed she was floating on the soft water it was one big water bed dont do mat he bent down and picked her up he carried her away from the spring until she recovered enough to stay away i guess youre right jenny said sadly this is not the demons dont dream time to rest but it sure was the most comfortable bed i ever felt so they moved on again dug faded out feeling delirious so didnt know how long it took to reach it but it was definitely later in the day jenny sniffed it faint stars appeared in her eyes oh guest stars she said smiling i love them then she turned to look at sherlock in fact i love get away from there sherlock cried thats a love spring much better than a hate spring she replied dreamily get away he repeated firmly anything you say you handsome creature she moved languorously away wouldnt you like to carry me again not this time you just breathe the air away from the spring for a while until it wears off reluctantly the elf girt did so dug had never had reason to question the black mans decency but if he had this scene would have resolved it he was getting just enough of a whiff of the spring to understand that it would be extraordinarily easy to take advantage of a situation so they set off for yet another spring as the day waned dug hoped the next one wasnt a hate spring because then jenny and sherlock might come to hate him and leave him to expire alone as the sun set they came to it jenny sniffed i think this is it she said excited youre not trying to trick me into tasting a love spring sherlock asked dip your sore toe he did heyit healed they brought some of the water to dug with the first drop on his lips he began to feel better he swallowed and felt better yet he inhaled the vapor and his lungs began to clear this was definitely the healing elixir but his chest did not heal quite all the way he knew why he was still wearing the new monia flower and it piers anthony was still sending illness into his lungs he could have been better long ago if he had just thrown that flower away but he refused he had to wear it just as if it were harmless im better he announced but id better take some of this elixir along just in case of relapse he dipped a small bottle in the spring filled it and corked it it was amazing how sick he had felt though he knew mis was all pretense an effect of the game couldnt touch him in real life it certainly had seemed real though it was now dusk they foraged for food and camping materials and set up for the night there was no regular camping place here evidently they had wandered from the normal route of the game but if anything happened they could heal quickly because of the spring dug thought he had been resting while the others worked but now he discovered how tired he was he sank into blissful sleep in the morning they resumed their trek heading for com pewters lair at first they had to pick their way through thick jungle dug wondered why since it seemed to thin in a nearby valley then he saw a dragon feeding on something and realized that the easiest route was not necessarily the best sammy cat was leading them the safe waywhich was where the dragons werent foraging his encounter with the gap dragon had been more than sufficient to teach him respectand that had been merely a steamer not a firebreather they heard a companion there ahead was a clearing and in the clearing was a giant spinning object whats that thing doing here dug demanded i think thats the big top jenny said its part of another story i dont think we had better mess with it dug was learning to take such warnings seriously we leave it alone he agreed now they were able to use some of the paths sammy cat seemed to feel these ones were safe they came to an pemons dont dream other area of commotion it seemed to be an enclosed field with many animals confined the stock market jenny explained its full of charging bulls and bears its not safe for ordinary folk to enter people get trampled there all the time and wiped out dug nodded literal bulls and bears it figured the mundane version was scary enough he understood he didnt need to mess with this one they also bypassed a big shopping centaur dug didnt even ask at last they approached the region of the evil machine dug remembered how easy it had been to reach it before using the shortcut but now they were in much better control he would not be blindly stampeded into pewters cave this time he was able to appreciate how cunningly this particular trap was laid the shortcut to success had indeed been a shortcut for an innocent who didnt ask where it went or whose success it meant it had amounted to an enchanted path safe from other hazards lulling him into false security then the invisible giant had come scaring him into the one seemingly safe placewhich was the worst place dug felt his lung congesting he quietly took another drop of healing elixir and felt better the new monia flower remained bright and firm the color of diseased lung tissue with spots of congestion it was still trying to do its job that was the way he wanted it but he was really glad that jenny had insisted on finding the healing spring mat made all the difference now if his devious and punnish plan jest uh just worked he had a spot decision to make should he be wary of the giant and sneak in to confront pewter by surprise or pretend to be spooked in the usual fashion so mat the evil machine did not realize what player it was at first he decided on the latter course that would be easier and would surprise pewter just as much perhaps more because it would seem that this was a new victim being driven in a piers anthony surprised machine was more likely to make a mistake and that was what dug wanted pewter was dangerous but the game required that he could be beaten and surprising him was surely the best strategy in fact dug had a different companion now and a fellow traveler if pewter saw them first he would be sure mat mis was a different player he would probably figure that it was kim and so would be prepared to freak her out rattling her and making her fail to think of whatever her winning strategy might be um friends dug murmured before we go on theres something i must explain i met up with pewter before and got skunked i got kicked out of the game and had to start over with different paths and challenges thats why im being so careful now hes got a slick routine to drive folk into his cave and then he changes reality to whatever he wants it to be now sherlock this isnt your responsibility so maybe you should wait here until i settle with him one way or the other but i think youre stuck for it jenny being my companion yes jenny said its my job to warn you to stay away from pewter but i know you cant do mat because you have to beat him to cancel out what happened before so ill try to help you but once were mere i wont be able to do anything because hell just change my script youre the only one who can stop him and i dont know how you can do that sammy wont be able to help against him either right its always the player who has to handle the real crunch if its a game challenge my illness wasnt supposed to be part of the game so you and sherlock got me out of it he paused by the way if i didnt say thank you before ill say it now i really appreciate what both of you did for me during my illness and ill try to repay you some way i just did what im supposed to jenny demurred youd have done the same for me if i got sick sherlock said demons dont dream i know mat but a false companion might have just let me be washing out and there are plenty of folk who would have figured it was no skin off their noses so bom of you really helped me and i hope i can turn in a good performance report on jenny or whatever it is and i hope well find the ideal place for the black wave lets get on with the action sherlock said gruffly dug could see that the man wasnt much for compliments and he liked that okay so jenny and i will head in just as if we are surprised by all of mis and let the invisible giant drive us into the cave one thing you can do for me jenny if you will you lead the way into the cave so that pewter sees you first i want him to think its kim until the last moment you do have a plan she said appreciatively i do it may not work but ill give it the old college try he turned to sherlock if i lose i wont come out of that cave but if jenny calls the demon game master and explains how you got stranded here because of the player maybe hell tell you where to go a place for your wave i mean its worm a shot dont worry about mat sherlock said tin coming in with you i want to see this dread machine somehow dug wasnt surprised sherlock hadnt backed off from anything yet okay if you want to follow jenny in itll really surprise the machine then ill appear and try to polish him off with my sneak play its sure got me fooled sherlock said youve just been really sick and you still dont seem all the way recovered despite that healing water yet youre eager to get back into the fray maybe im just a crazy teenager dug said smiling crazy like a fox maybe foxes arent crazy jenny protested theyre pretty smart like wolves she looked momentarily pensive no one commented they walked out into the path leading by the cave piers anthony soon there was a shuddering of the ground trees crashed in the distance hey theres a meteor crashing sherlock said no thats just the giant i think he wont actually step on us remember to spook when he gets close there was another crash and a giant footprint appeared no problem sherlock said they spooked they ran down tile path away from the approaching giant steps the mourn of the cave appeared and they scooted into it just ahead of the last footprint so far so good jenny ran ahead toward the dim light of the interior chamber sherlock followed good thing we found this cave he called that monster almost squished us its com pewters cave jenny cried quick we must get out of it there was a pause then she spoke again no we must go on inside dug hanging back smiled pewter had written a change on bis screen i dont like the look of this sherlock said then but maybe its okay dug moved quietly toward pewters chamber where the two were now standing but sherlocks not the player jenny protested hes just a fellow traveler dug saw a big question mark on the screen pewter had been caught by surprise he had assumed that jenny was escorting a player and that sherlock was mat player exactly as dug had hoped the evil machines circuits had to be in turmoil now was his chance he strode boldly forward no i am the player he said i have come to stop your clock you crock of refuse the screen flickered dug mundane error no error capacitor face i fought my way back just so i could settle your metallic hash demons dont dream you could not have not with your companion well i did and i changed companions along the way which you didnt anticipate did you screenforbrains change program adapt for smartposterior mundane teen recompile the screen went black while the recompilation proceeded dug didnt give it the change to complete its operation and heres how im going to do it you nutty and bolty contraption on my return route i picked up the germ of an idea and here it is he brought out the bit of fluff and dropped it on the machine rejected the screen printed desperately and a bugseed dug continued relentlessly thatll put a bug in your program for sure rejected the screen was flickering and heres the piece of resistance dug said pardon my french he lifted the flower from his buttonhole my third offering to you which you cant refuse because youve already rejected my first two he held the flower above the screen a new monia posy that will give you a virus for sure he dropped it a virus nonononoooo tough turnips dug said cruelly he who lives by the pun dies by the pun youve been infected wirebrain in other words you lose the screen went crazy characters and symbols flowed across it in weird patterns then the words general system failure appeared then the letters fell from tile words and collected in a pile at the bottom of the screen the screen faded into black lets get out of here dug said satisfied this pile of junk has nothing for us they walked out through the passage sammy was happy to show the way what kind of logic was that sheriock inquired whats this rule about not rejecting three thingsr computers are logical but not sensible dug said piers anthony smugly in pewters state of confusion it seemed to make sense but i probably could have taken him out anyway with the new monia just by throwing it at him because a virus is a virus and that one was good and potent you saw what it did to me that flower jenny exclaimed should have realized thats why i made it seem like just a decoration dug said i figured if you didnt catch on pewter wouldnt eitheruntil i told him in mundania a living virus and a computer virus are two different things but in xanth they have to be the same so i punned him to death that was brilliant sherlock said dug smiled elementary the giant was nowhere to be seen of course that didnt mean anything but he wasnt heard either so they proceeded along the path unmolested i think youre going to do well in this game jenny said maybe maybe not i just make it a point to learn from my mistakes my first mistake was having eyes only for nada naga my second was not taking puns seriously so i dumped nada and now im playing the game to win but the truth is im just in it for the challenge and the fun now i think mis is a great if foolish adventure well your next challenge should be the good magicians castle jenny said one tiling nagging me sherlock said maybe nothing nothings nothing here dug said whats your point you mentioned nada naga i can see why you found her distracting so did i but mere was something funny about her well shes a princess jenny said they tend to be sort of reserved except for princess electro who wears blue jeans its not that shes a lovely creature and a good lady demons dont dream but there was something about her when you said how a false companion would just have let you be sick something nagged at me i finally figured it out nada would have let you go no she wouldnt dug said ill never forget how she fought to help me douse the censorship the whatr that was in my first game session the one i wiped out on with pewter but that was my doing nada was in my comer all the way except when i tried to sneak a peek at her panties and even then she welcomed me back i know shes human under the princessly mantle certainly she is jenny agreed shes a good person she was willing to marry prince dolph despite not loving him because he loved her and her family needed the liaison with the human folk then she got hi trouble with the gourd realm really by accident so now shes serving her time with the demons in this game same as i am but she always does her best and shes always nice im sure she is sherlock said doggedly i could see mat myself maybe thats why i picked up on the wrongness it was as if she felt guilty for something something relating to you dug i saw it when she looked at you when you werent looking at her she has no cause to feel guilty about me dug said i was the one who died to sneak a peek at her body she had warned me not to but i he shrugged i was young and foolish she never did anything wrong of course she didnt jenny agreed she would never do anything wrong the very notion would tear her up then her eyes widened oh no she breathed right sherlock took a breath so how would she react if she maybe got selected as a false companion the second time around dug was stunned it could be different each time couldnt it she could be true the first time and false the second time still its hard to believe mat she could piers anthony she wouldnt exactly have a choice she had to play by the rules of the game i remember now jenny said she was the one who suggested that you exchange companions could it be because she didnt want to be false to you dug dugs mind was spinning suddenly little things were clicking into place why had com pewter been so sure that he couldnt fight his way back with his companion maybe because the evil machine had known she was false just waiting for the perfect opportunity to wash him out why had nada been reserved in little ways when she had been more open before her attitude had subtly changed as if she were possessed of some secret sadness exactly as would be the case if she were required to turn traitor to the one she had before been pledged to help the more he pondered it the more certain he became mat it was true nada was a false companion she had not tried to torpedo him because he wasnt far enough along to make it really count too soon and he would just come back hi another game and take another companion or take her again when she wasnt false so she would wait hoping that he would wash out on his own but if he didnt and was about to win the prize then she would arrange to betray him making him forfeit his victory now that he knew this he could anticipate that betrayal and reject her advice at the critical time if she said the left fork had the prize he could take the right fork the key was in judging just when she was going to pull her act of betrayal forewarned was forearmed but it would still be tricky still it hurt to know that she was now his secret enemy he had given up on trying to see her panties but had hoped to win her favor now that was impossible brother he muttered shes like another virus lurking to destroy the one shes with good thing you switched companions eh sherlock said i didnt switch for that reason dug said i didnt demons dont dream realize then he got the point run now shes got the false companion shes in trouble it means shell lose sherlock agreed tjnless she can play again and get back into it but by mat time i may have won the prize its not fair so sherlock inquired dug came to his decision so im going to find her and warn her or take back my false companion im not going to let her take the fall for me youll have trouble finding her youll likely have to go off the game routes i know itll be rough not right to put you through mat so i guess this is where we part company im sorry we didnt find any good places for your folk to settle but maybe you can go down to the good magicians castle and ask him jenny can tell you how to get there im sure forget it sherlock said im not leaving you yet i just wanted to be sure youd say what i thought youd say but this is no longer the game really dug protested if i mess up im just out of it but if you get in trouble your people will suffer youve got more at risk than i do more to gain too how do we know where ill find a good place it may be in the middle of some area you never were slated to cross i might as well take a look at it and a party of three can travel better man a party of two especially when one gets sick dug agreed relieved glad to have you along then he turned to jenny where do you think they went and where can we best intercept them sammy will know she said the cat jumped down wait for me jenny cried dashing after him they were on their way foundry kirn was sweatyhot stingingscratched and wornout fatigued this might be a game not quite real but it felt distressingly real right now bubbles dog did not seem much better off though she didnt complain oh well just have to rest kirn said she found a spreading tree with wide ridged roots radiating out she sat down leaning back against the trunk and pulled the dog into her what did i get you into bubbles she asked rhetorically youre old you dont want to struggle through wilderness like this maybe i should have left you in mat floating bubble bubbles whined her tail dropping low kirn hugged her no i couldnt have done that you needed someone to adopt you and i guess i needed a pet i never had a dog before im glad i found you a huge serpent appeared its head changed becoming human oh mere you are nada said i thought id lost you were just so tired kim confessed this perpetual demons dont dream jungle are you sure there isnt some easier route to the good magicians castle nadas face was unreadable there may be but there are complications the direct route would require us to cross the kissmee river and though it has now been restored to its original friendly contours that can be awkward kim thought about swimming through kissmee water there could indeed be complications would they be kissing water fish or each other if she were still traveling with dug she might have risked it better avoid that she so i have been trying to find a path north of lake kissmee nada said but i am unfamiliar with this region so it is difficult kim was beginning to miss jenny elf and her cat sammy who could find things he would have found them a safe walkable path as it was they just had to struggle through still it seemed harder man it had to be then she spied something through the trees it was a cloud in the sky but not a rainy one it might even be smoke was it true in xanth as in mundania mat where there was smoke there was fire and where mere was fire could there be civilization travelable paths anything seemed better than this endless jungle kim hauled herself back to her feet lets investigate mat smoke she said tm not sure that is wise nada demurred why not lt may be a smoker dragon ouch kim hadnt thought of mat then her impulsive nature got the better of her but it might not be a dragon she said lets go see carefully nada shrugged which was impressive in her natural form and slithered out in the direction of the smoke kim and bubbles followed before long it was apparent that the smoke was coming from the chimney of a little house hi the wood if mat piers anthony house is made of candy im going to be a mite suspicious kim muttered it turned out to be a normal house with wooden walls and a thatched roof still mat did not guarantee that its occupant was friendly but kim was so tired that she did the easy thing she hoped for the best she approached the door and knocked while nada waited nearby hi serpent form the door opened a woman stood there she was absolutely repulsive she opened her warty face yes she said in a voice like gravel in a gearbox kim glanced down at bubbles the dog hadnt barked that suggested mat this woman was not a menace she might even be a decent person under all mat piledon ugliness imim a traveler looking for an easy route to the good magicians castle kim said hesitantly i wondered if why you poor ghv the woman graveled you look so tired and hungry you must come in and have a bit to eat kim glanced again at bubbles still no objection she decided to trust the dogs judgment thank you she said im kim this is bubbles may she come in too of course dear if shes housebroken kim realized that she didnt know about that i she started doubtfully oh thats all right clean it up if theres a problem im ma anathe i love to have visitors but i receive so few they entered roe house it was larger inside than outside which was possible in a magic land it was neatly arranged and clean let me serve you some gruel anathe grated as if rocks were caught in a grinder it is simple but all i have im sure it will do kim said doubtfully she took her place at the wooden table anathe set a wooden bowl of gruel before her and an demons dont dream other down on the floor for bubbles the dog lapped hers appreciatively once again reassuring kim so she took the wooden spoon and tried a cautious sipand it was good ft definitely was not gruel and unusual punishment now about your trip to the good magicians castle anathe graveled she seemed to have only those two tones grate and gravel you must get on the enchanted path i cant kim said apologetically imim a player hi a game and i have to take my chances oh so thats why you are so far into nowhere the woman grated thats why you are visiting old anathe ma youre desperate kim considered her response some diplomacy was in order it is true but if i had known how nice you are i would have visited anyway thats sweet of you to say anathe said sourly i dont know much about this game but i know better than to interfere with demons if they say you cant use the enchanted paths then you had best avoid them that means you will have trouble crossing kiss mee yes kim agreed the gruel was making her sleepy she saw that it had the same effect on bubbles who was going into a dognap unfortunately that will route you past the foundry aname continued the centaurs may be difficult they dont like strangers there she continued to talk but kim was just too tired and sleepy to listen she put her head on the table and slept she woke to the sound of nada nagas human voice what have you done with her i warn you if you have hurt heryoure not one of the game challenges so you have no call to hush woman anathe granted your friend is just sleeping how could you let her get so tired and her poor dog toothat animal is too old for prolonged adventure kim was about to raise her head to reassure nada but piers anthony something made her wait she had not chosen nada as her companion dug had she had gone along when he offered to trade but she had never been quite sure this was legitimate so while nada certainly seemed to be a nice person and a competent companion kim had just the slightest guilty tinge of doubt about her would nada do the same job for her as she would have for dug so she was curious how nada would react when kim seemed to be in trouble did you give them a magic potion nada demanded the demons wont like it if no potion anathe graveled just good simple gruel with a tiny drop of healing elixir it was all i had they were both ready to collapse when they came here i couldnt let them go on like that if youre supposed to be helping them you should be ashamed nada stroked across the chamber to the table kim are you all right now kim lifted her head she felt somewhat refreshed it had indeed been good gruel im all right i was just so tired i must have fallen asleep are you sure nada herself look unsure yes anathe is very nice her gruel is very good kim reached down to pat bubbles who was now also awake the dog wagged her tail nada did a visible reassessment then she turned to anathe i think i owe you an apology i assumed dont bother the woman grated i understand everyone thinks that i must be as evil as i look it is why i live alone appearances can be deceptive nada agreed awkwardly yes few would believe you are a serpent woman now nada was startled how did you know that anathema smiled the effect was horrendous there are old pine needles in your hair but none on your clothing so you werent rolling on the ground you must have been in another shape a werewolf would have walked demons dont dream over the fallen needles but a serpent would be right down in them i knew that a lovely young woman like you would not be guarding a person unless she was sure of her power i have heard about the naga folk you must have been in serpent form and just changed true nada brought out a comb and ran it through her lustrous graybrown hair several needles fell out as well as some bits of thread there are those who see me in serpent form and are horrified at least you can change your form nada nodded you have no magic to compensate my talent is making good gruel there didnt seem to be much help there well thank you nada said we must be on our way yes i was just telling kirn the route you must try to get past the foundry without aggravating the centaurs we shall try nada said but how can we repay you for the gruel kim asked standing the pleasure of your brief company was enough anathe graveled she bent down to pat bubbles head and the dog wagged her tail then in a murmur only kim could hear be watchful girl i fear something is afoot they left and resumed their travel west there was a path from the house which made it much easier kim continued to feel better as if the gruel had a developing effect as it was digested bubbles too was more alert then kim realized something the dog had accepted ma anathes pat she had shied away from all others before except for kim herself bubbles had been right that the woman was not evil and the dog even liked her in her nondemonstrative fashion that was most interesting especially since bubbles was just as cautious about nada as she was about anyone else and anathe ma had warned her about something kim might have dismissed it but she trusted the dogs instinct anybody bubbles trusted enough to receive a pat from had to be taken seriously but what should she be watchful piers anthony for she didnt know and probably anathe had not known either it was just intuition but it aligned with kirns own something was subtly not right all she could do was follow the advice to be watchful that she would the path wound along through the forest as if it had not a care in the world sometimes it made a straight rigid backbone while at other times it practiced sinuous curves it flirted with a big tangle tree but stayed just out of reach once it set a couple of muddy puddles for unwary feet bubbles hesitated looking nervous kim was learning the signs the dog was shy about most people especially strangers and barked when there was danger she ignored most objects but distrusted those that were unusual so there must be something unusual here she saw a patch of flowers beside the path but they were strange even for xanth they were grotesquely ugly and they smelted worse yet she recognized them as roses they had the general configuration of roses but somehow gave the opposite impression perhaps that was because they were the color of barf with the smell of puke beyond them were regular roses pretty and sweetsmelling only one circular patch was ugly kim paused could this be a garden cultivated by anathe but the woman did not have an ugly house or personality and her gruel had been good why should she have ugly roses there must be some other explanation then she saw a single small chip of wood in the middle of the ugly patch it looked like a fragment of the heart of pine the kind her dad had used to start a fire hi the fireplace because it had so much clotted sap that it burned like a torch suddenly it clicked reverse wood she cried she stooped to pick it up be careful nada exclaimed that could be dangerous not to me kim replied im a mundane i have no demons dont dream magic as far as i know reverse wood reverses magic not mundane things nada looked doubtful but did not protest kim picked up the chip and sure enough it did not hurt her or change her perception but the roses that had been in its vicinity were already changing becoming as lovely as the ones beyond the range of the chip they were magic blue roses with chocolate perfume the magic had been reversed by the wood she held the chip down for bubbles to sniff the dog evinced no fear of it apparently it had been the reversed roses that had bothered her she was evidently mundane like kim so that chip didnt affect her directly that sent kim into a brief spell of wondering if bubbles was of mundane origin how had she gotten into that floating bubble mundania did not have any magical trash disposal well maybe sometime she would learn the answer kim tucked the chip into a pocket she was sure it would come in handy in due course after all this was the game things didnt happen just by accident maybe a dragon would try to toast her with fire and the wood would turn it to cool water the chip was surely the key to an upcoming challenge there was a dim sound ahead but it grew brighter as they approached it it sounded like metal being pounded they came to a cabin formed from knotted trees thats an ogre den nada said alarmed kim had had more than enough experience with ogres she looked for a way to bypass the cabin but again the jungle closed in thickly making it impossible to deviate from the path they would have to chance it maybe those ogres arent looking for trouble she said with faint hope peaceful ogres thats an oxymoron but bubbles wasnt barking and that was a positive sign as anathe had shown not all ugly folk were bad anyway the way she was being channeled here suggested piers anthony that it was another challenge so she would just have to handle it watchfully the sound turned out to be an ogre pounding centaur shoes these were not like people shoes they were ushaped bits of metal sparks flew up with each blow and the metal turned redhot there was no forge the ogres blows were so hard that the heat came directly from them kirn wanted to try to sneak past without the ogre noticing but knew that the game would never let her get away with that sure enough in a moment the ogre looked up and saw her see she he roared but bubbles didnt bark so kim stood her ground in a moment an ogress came from the house or was she an ogress there was something exceedingly odd about her and in a moment kim realized what it was she wasnt ugly she was at worst ordinary no fangs no hairy nose just a reasonably homely countenance kim had heard of only one unugly ogress in xanth but this one wasnt she was it possible that there were two of them what was ogredom coming to the ogress looked at kim simultaneously bubbles growled that meant trouble the ogress did not seem threatening she smiled and stepped toward them but bubbles whined and hid behind kim was this the danger anathe had warned her about was the pretty ogress smiling to cover some sinister plot what could it be the woman was making no threatening gestures nada naga stepped in front of kim stop there ogress she said firmly but the ogress didnt stop she just kept smiling and advancing nada annoyed strode forward to intercept her what are you up to nada demanded i just want to touch you the ogress said extending her hand why nada asked with understandable mistrust demons dont dream i just have to do it the woman said then she lunged forward and her hand touched nada immediately nada changed not to serpent form she became ugly in fact she was as hideous as ma anathe the ogre woman in contrast became radiantly beautiful oh ugh nada cried realizing what had happened she changed to serpent form but that didnt help she was an ugly reptile kim now had some understanding of the threat but she didnt care hey change her back she cried advancing on the ogress i cant the ogress wailed i want to but i cant its my curse what do you mean you cant kim demanded if you can enchant a person you can break the enchantment cant you no i cant it is my talent to make others ugly to take their beauty for myself i have to do it i cant stop myself and it ruins me because no ogre will marry a pretty ogress father has been trying to get me married off for years but every time i start to get suitably ugly some pretty girl comes along and ruins it she broke into tears which was a decidedly unogrish thing to do kims mind was chugging along with a high compression ratio was this the challenge if so there was a way to handle it suddenly she knew what that way was take this she said bringing out the chip of reverse wood touch her again the beautiful ogress took the chip confused she poked a lovely finger at the serpent as if afraid it would get bitten off nada realizing that kim was onto something remained still and allowed herself to be touched suddenly the serpent was beautiful and the ogress was mediocre the effect had been reversed oh the ogress exclaimed delighted what fine magic what is it it is reverse wood kim explained it reverses the effect of your magic piers anthony you mean that with it the ones i touch will become pretty while i turn ugly oh this will change my whole life i must have it what do you want for it oh i just found it by the path kim said you can have it but i can tell you something you might like to do inhere is a woman in a house to the east who is very ugly she yes anathe ma i have always envied her ugliness touch her with the chip and her ugliness will be yours oh i will the ogress cried father i must run but when i return ill be truly ogrish she ran off down the path before long the ogress would be phenomenally ugly and a kind old woman would be beautiful it seemed fitting kim picked up nadas clothes and put them in her pack nada continued in serpent form as there was a male in view they paused by the laboring ogre he ignored them bubbles did not seem unduly distressed so kim figured he was not a threat to them she had the feeling that there was more here to be gleaned this work must be connected to the foundry and she would have to pass the foundry the ogre was doing impressive work his centaur shoes were minor works of metallic art and were surely a great help for those centaurs who required them but what was there here that might help her handle the foundry the ogre pounded a hot fragment of metal tore free and spun into the ground almost by kirns feet she stepped back not wanting to be burnedthen reconsidered and stepped back to where she was she picked up two sticks and used them to pick up the cooling metal it was almost in the shape of a crude key a key could be just as the chip of reverse wood had helped solve a problem this might help solve another when she encountered that problem she had the answer now all she needed was me question maybe demons dont dream she found a heavy leaf and set the key in that then she folded the leaf around it and put mat in her pocket where the reverse wood chip had been thank you ogre she said girl some welcome he grunted continuing his labors kim walked on satisfied she had the feeling that she was making progress in the game but had she taken care of the thing anathe had warned her about she wasnt sure once they were beyond the illkempt view of the ogre shoemaker nada returned to human form she was completely lovely again there was no doubt of this because she was bare every charm practically scintillated kim gave her back her clothing stifling another surge of jealousy oh to look like that i think i found a way to thank anathe for her kindness she said now she will look as nice as she is im just glad you had the reverse wood chip nada said i have no desire to be an unbeautiful beast neither did kim but magic wasnt going to make her beautiful she would always be a distinctly ordinary girl in and out of the game they moved on there was a sign ahead foundry i hope mis is the last challenge before we reach the good magicians castle kim said i like xanth but im getting tired of constantly exercising my brain and body it has been wearing for me too nada said no offense how did you get to be a companion kim asked she had read the xanth books but couldnt remember that detail did you volunteer no i committed an indiscretion in the realm of the gourd and was required to pay for it in this manner jenny is serving her year for the good magician having done a favor for a friend well at least you get to stay in xanth dug and i have to leave when our games are over but you can return to play again piers anthony yes but its not quite the same i wish i could live here all the time all mundanes do they crested a hill and there in the next valley was the foundry a huge building surrounded by centaurs many of them were lying down others were standing but seemed uncomfortable they approached the nearest centaur cautiously if i may inquire kim inquired what is going on here we are all foundering the centaur replied pained is that not evident i guess it is kim said i suppose this is because of the foundry this too should be evident but why did you come here if it is so dangerous for you we came to attend centaurvention of course but a random cursor passed and dropped a cursory curse rendering our vention center into this awful foundry now we are unable to get away because of our tender feet theres an ogre making centaur shoes to the east kim said would those shoes help you to walk certainly but none of us can hotfoot it over there and in any event there probably are far too few shoes for us what we need to do is nullify the cursors curse then the foundry will be gone and we will not need shoes i am sorry to learn of your distress kim said but i am not sure what i can do about it its really not my problem have no concern when you attempt to pass the foundry as you must to proceed along your route you too will founder then it will be your problem also kim considered that this definitely sounded like a challenge she would have to rise to it what do you think i can do about it since you have not yet foundered you might be able to find the natural antagonist to the foundry which of course is the lostwet demons dont dream of course kim agreed puns were serious business in xanth the lostwet would cancel out the founddry precisely then we would all be free of our founder kim decided to test the extent of this challenge on the other hand i might avoid the whole thing by going back the way i came and seeking another route south you would have to cut crosscountry through the impenetrable jungle he pointed out i suspect you would find that very tiring then you would encounter the big top the gnobody gnomes and com pewter i suspect you would rather accept a ride from one of us bypassing all those hazards kim saw the way of it i suspect i would she agreed where do you suppose i might find the lostwet there is a lost wax trail to the south which ought to lead there lost wax it was lost in the process of casting the foundry curse she should have known i shall follow that trail kim agreed they turned south bubbles soon sniffed out the smell of wax it looked as if a huge vat of melted wax had spilled and flowed and cooled and solidified forming the path this would be known as the lost wax process now it had hardened so that it was easy to walk on at the end of the trail of wax was a small lake the wax seemed to have flowed out across the surface of the lake cooling and finally formed a thin wax seal over it the seal was very strong so that they were able to walk out on it without falling in the lake it was transparent so that they could see right down to the bottom of the lake this seemed to be a flat expanse at the near end was a smooth slope while at the far end was a portal similar to the ones she had used to let the water into the naga tunnel in the center of the portal was a small keyhole kim brought out the key she had saved from the ogres work it was now cool and firm could this be the key to that lock this was the game it was bound to be the t piers anthony proper key so she would have to put the key in that lock and open that portal beneath it should be the lostwet but how was she going to get the key there she could see the keyhole but the transparent wax was so hard that she couldnt scratch it let alone poke a hole in it she was being tantalized by a goal so near yet so far do you know anything about this she asked nada i knew there was a challenge here but not its nature nada confessed i dont know anything about wax it figured the companions job was to get the player safely to the challenges but not to solve them so nada had braced anathe when it seemed that the woman was interfering with kim but was no help in fathoming this riddle do you have any idea bubbles kim asked the dog wagged her tail and started sniffing the waxed surface kim wasnt sure that bubbles had really understood her question but the dog obviously wanted to be helpful in a moment bubbles stopped she had found something kim checked and saw a tiny hole in the wax maybe she could get her finger into it and pull the wax up making an access to the water but her finger wouldnt fit the hole was too small and anyway the wax was so strong that she would need a keyhole saw to cut through it and of course xanth didnt have such machines so what good was the hole then she considered the key again it was just small enough to fit through that hole but if she put it through there she would just lose it in the lake being unable to retrieve it that seemed even more pointless than her other options but this was the game there had to be a way she just had to figure it out kim strained her brain but could not squeeze out any useful notion the key was here the lock was there and never the twain could meet it seemed unless the light of an idea flashed over her head again but demons dont dream dimly because she wasnt sure she had the right clue it was only half a flash really she had played with a puzzle in a book once in which a string passed through small holes and something had to be transferred from one loop to another when it was too big to fit through the holes the trick had been to manipulate the string passing it around the object and through the holes until the puzzle could be solved here she had a key and a keyhole and a small hole leading to the wrong place was there a way to get the key to the keyhole indirectly she didnt have any string and string wouldnt do the job anyway but maybe the principle applied she lay down on the wax and peered through it studying the situation now she saw that there were a number of bugs running around on the bottom of the lake they looked like ticks the kind that had to be kept off people and dogs but these had to be water bugs or at least capable of living in water there were letters of the alphabet on their backs identifying them they didnt seem to be doing anything just moving back and forth hi semicircular paths as if they were pendulums all of them faced the same way as if they had fled from the locked portal when they moved they didnt turn left or right they skittered sideways maintaining their orientation every time they reached the end of a semicircle they clicked clickclick that struck kim as odd behavior even for such odd creatures pendulums clicks as in big clocks making ticks and tocks so they were ticks xanthstyle kim had read how the good magician humfrey in his youthful days had lived on a tick farm growing ticks for clocks and had a real problem when the ticks mutated and made mischief she remembered how aggravating the critic had been could it be that some of tiiose errant ticks never had been run down and here they were just waiting to accomplish something the other half of her idea flashed maybe she could get piers anthony them to move the key for her to take it to the lock she couldnt reach if only she could figure out how to do it she held the key in her hand suppose she dropped it through the hole and simply asked the ticks to move it for her but why would they bother even if they understood what she wanted she had to have some way to encourage them and there had to be a way because this was the game if they were ticks where were the tocks all the bugs were the same there didnt seem to be any tocks where did the tocks come from she hadnt read of any lock farm actually in a clock a tock was just the other side of a tick so were tocks really ticks turned over if so there were really tocks as well as ticks this was crazy but maybe it made punnish sense ticks might not help her but tocks might if she could just get them to turn over the ticks were all facing away from the portal and its keyhole but tocks might face toward it so maybe they could take the key the right way what could she lose kim put the key to the hole in the wax it dropped through and plinked on the floor of the pool immediately the ticks changed their behavior they stopped swinging aimlessly and started advancing on the key but kim realized that they would push it the wrong way away from the lock she needed tocks to push it the right way ticklock she cried but the ticks ignored her she realized that nobody would respond to a general call if someone called peoplesmeople she would ignore him too but if someone called her by name or description she would react frantic she called no tick responded fantastic still nothing gigantic the ticks continued toward the key and the first one was beginning to push the key off toward a trench kim now saw some distance beyond if it fell in there it would never be recovered she was getting nowhere and she couldnt remember demons dont dream any more of the ticks she had read about then she realized that she had it backward humfrey had dealt with all those ticks she had to address those ticks that had escaped his notice she strained her brain she saw a tick that was somewhat dusky as if spoiled its letter was n necrotic she cried the tick paused she had identified it necrotoc she said and the tick turned around and faced the other way she had done it necrotoc push the key she called the tock skittered sideways and reached the key it made little clocks rather than clicks as it moved it braced its head against the key and pushed the key moved toward the lock kim had found out how to do it she would get a lick at the lock but other ticks were coming to push the other way one got placed squarely before the key and it came to a halt then a second tick lined up before the first and the key began to slide back kim saw that one of the ticks seemed a bit doubtful its letter was a agnostic she cried and it paused agnostoc push the other way the tick turned around and pushed from the other direction now it was two to one and the key resumed motion toward the lock it was getting close go go go kim whispered fervently urging her team on but another tick crowded into the space left by the agnostoc and pushed the other way so it was two to two and the key stopped moving again then a third tick arrived making it three to two and the key started moving away again the third tick was not very active itself but it seemed to stir the other two up and they pushed harder its letter was c suddenly kim recognized it catalytic she cried and it paused catalytoc it turned around push the key it pushed now the necro and agnos tocks were revitalized be piers anthony coming very active the key moved so rapidly that the other ticks could not catch it and at least it reached the keyhole of the lock they pushed it in and then pushed it around so that it turned there was a loud clock sound and the c fell away leaving the lock the lock opened the water swirled into it kirn realized that it was like the lock of a canal handling water the water would be held there until it was moved on to the next lock as the water drained from the pool the thin wax covering tt lost its support it collapsed and the three of them had to scramble to get off it before getting dunked the ticks and locks and fragments of wax swirled into the lock along with the water soon there was just a dry depression there they walked down into it it seemed to be nothing but a fairly level region where was the lostwet bubbles paused to sniff something kirn looked it was a blinking little square or oblong so small kim would not have seen it if the dog had not called her attention to it she picked it up it seemed to have no mass it was just a tiny manifestation she could balance on the tip of her finger what could it be then she understood its a cursor she cried we had to get rid of the waterto get the wet lostin order to get it its the cursor that made the foundry and then got lost in the wet with this we should be able to reverse the damage it did both nada and bubbles looked doubtful but neither argued kim marched out of the lost pool and back onto the lost wax trail balancing the blinking thing on her finger they followed she reached the place where the centaurs had foundered i got it i got it kim cried brandishing her blinking finger heads turned to look at her the male centaurs frowned the females blushed what was the matter with diem centaurs were notoriously unflappable then kim realized what was wrong she seemed to be demons dont dream making a signal with her finger it might not have the same meaning in xanth as it did in mundania but it could hardly be considered polite she straightened out her other fingers i have the cursor she explained the one to nullify the curse i think of course the nearest centaur replied put it on the foundry kim walked on to the foundry as she got closer her feet started to hurt her shoes felt too tight she wanted to get the weight off but she knew what it was she was foundering all she had to do was nullify the curse and it would go away so she gritted her teeth and walked on the pain got worse until it felt as if she were walking on acidsoaked pincushions she couldnt stand it any more she had to stop but now she was close to the foundry she held up her finger take this she cried jabbing it toward the building the cursor flew off and struck the foundry wall there was a flash kim blinked with the brightness of it as her eyes cleared she saw that the building had changed now it was the centaur vention center she had done it the centaurs got up and trotted in now we shall give you and your companion your ride to the good magicians castle thank you kim said gratified she knew she had managed to win another challenge talents dug ran after jenny who was running after sammy while sherlock followed them all jenny knew enough to hold on to sammy when telling him to find something but she kept forgetting she was after all a child dug remembered he had to make allowances certainly her little cats talent was useful the trouble was that the paths the little cat took were not necessarily suitable for people they soon got tangled in brambles burrs and thistles stop sammy jenny cried we cant keep up with you the cat stopped jenny picked him up she was about to ask him to pick out an easy and safe path for them to follow when she paused dug and sherlock were pausing too they had blundered into an odd section of the forest it wasnt that the trees were different just that their arrangement was odd instead of being randomly scattered they were growing in lines and curves as if part of some huge ornamental garden a garden cultivated by a giant perhaps demons dont dream i think we should quietly move away from here sherlock murmured dug agreed he did not like the look of this he turned back the way they had come but there was a commotion back there something was following them oops jenny said i think maybe were somewhere we shouldnt be my sentiment exactly dug said reversing course he led the way to the side trying to avoid the thing behind bygoing at right angles to its motion but he came up against a massive hedge of woven trees there was no way through it and the thorns on the trunks made it impossible to climb up and over in fact i think maybe were in another challenge it was the last thing he wanted he didnt care about the game at the moment he just wanted to intercept kim so he could warn her that she had a false companion who would betray her at the key moment the longer it took to catch up to her the greater the risk of her betrayal he walked beside the dread hedge seeking somewhere to hide but the hedge curved around herding him toward the center of the tree garden meanwhile the thing closed in from behind there seemed to be no escape all right already dug said ill face it it had not been fear of bodily harm that had driven him to hide but fear of delay he wanted to skip the game for now until he could warn kim and maybe exchange companions back so that the liability would be his instead of hers it was the right thing to do they stood and waited for the thing and dug was surprised again because it wasnt a monster it was a pair of horses with riders and a foal a halfway handsome man rode the stallion and a lovely woman rode the mare the man wore a sword but the oddest thing was the metal each horse had heavy chains wrapped around its body what was going on here the man spied them he waved hi there friends he piers anthony said in a friendly fashion what are you doing in the garden of talents i thought it was closed to the public appearances could be extremely deceptive in xanth but dug saw nothing to be gained by being too defensive this just possibly barely might be a chance encounter so he told the truth i am dug i am playing in a game this is jenny elf my companion and this is sherlock who is looking for a place for his black wave to settle in peace we strayed in here unintentionally and wish only to leave it behind the game the man asked his brow wrinkling the demons are running it jenny explained the woman took an interest then it must be fun she turned to the man lets learn more of this jordan the man was amenable okay he jumped down from his horse while the woman floated down he strode forward im jordan the barbarian my talent is to heal quickly this is my wife renee or threnody if you like mat better shes half demon these are our friends the ghost horses pook peek and puck the stallion mare and foal nodded their heads in turn when named showing that they understood human dialogue oh i know of you jenny said i learned about it in centaur school you came from more than four hundred years ago in xanths history and met threnody in the year threnody said we had a small misunderstanding but later we got together again in jordan said he counted on his fingers eighteen years ago weve been happily exploring the wilderness ever since and whatever he pinched threnodys wellrounded bottom theres a certain charming naturalness about barbarians threnody said smiling as she kicked his shin theyre so illmannered and a certain sexy mystery about demon women jordan agreed he tried to pinch her again but this time his hand seemed to pass through her body as if it were smoke it occurred to dug that the two were well matched jor demons dont dream dan liked a woman who was mysterious and sexy and had certain demonly qualities and threnodyrenee liked a man who had few human restraints she probably didnt give him any trouble about seeing her panties but she could prevent him from handling her flesh when she chose the demons are running the game jenny said its for two mundanes a girl who won a prize andwell im not sure how dug got in pirated copy probably dug said i shouldve asked my friend who wanted my girlfriend got it pirates eh jordan said interested theyre like barbarians im from mundania dug said im just visiting xanth playing the game but right now i dont want to play it i want to intercept the other player kim so i can wipe her out jordan said pleased not exactly i really dont care about the prize but but you like the girl threnody said so you want to catch her and make like a barbarian she pinched jordans bottom uh not exactly that either dug said privately intrigued by the byplay between the two i maybe did something thats going to wipe her out and i have to warn her before it happens so its fair fair jordan asked blankly threnody nudged him you know about fairness its in the barbarian handbook page footnote f he looked sheepish i guess i didnt read that far barbarians arent much for books i quote if all else fails try fairness fair women can be very appealing he brightened oh sure all i need now is a fair he broke off because she had just drawn a knife and cut off his mouth jordan looked surprised then he fetched out a big handkerchief mopped the blood and gave her a reproving glance already his mouth was heal piers anthony ing new lips were growing to replace the lost ones well he had said that his talent was fast healing he had meant it literally anyway dug continued refusing to act as shaken as he was by this incidental demonstration i just want to get on away from here and on my way but the big thorny hedge is stopping me do you know any way past it i could phase through it threnody said i can become demonically insubstantial when i choose but i dont suppose that will help you much that hedge usually doesnt bother us jordan said he lisped a bit because his mouth had not yet grown back to full size and flexibility but probably you cant get by it you see it grows only when it wants to catch someone and then it grows in a circle so they cant get out you have to find a magic talent to get out thats a game challenge dug said how could you have encountered it if youre not part of the game threnody told me we might have a bit part to play in a game jordan admitted i guess this is it maybe it will relieve the boredom of being stuck with one woman threnody lifted her knife but this time he caught her hand then kissed her with his newformed lips dug doubted that jordan was really bored well then can you tell me how i find a magic talent im mundane i dont have any magic of my own sure theres a box of talents in the center you cant miss it only theres a catch theres always a catch dug agreed wearily you have to pick out talents blindly you have to use a talent at least once before you can put it back and take another that didnt seem like much of a catch so dug knew it couldnt be the whole story whats the catch to the catch hey youre thinking like a barbarian jordan said with approval his mouth was now almost the way it had been before never trust any civilized person the catch demons dont dream is you dont know what talent youve got so youll have trouble using it but it will take forever to guess without a hint dug protested theres a hint threnody said its a list of fifty talents you can check them off as you identify them if you use up all fifty therell be a new list if you get one that will enable you to escape the garden early you wont need to return it it will fade out in a day or so anyway so that was it if he were lucky and quick to fathom his luck he could be on his way rapidly otherwise he might be stuck for hours or days dug turned and walked to the center of the glade sammy jumped down to show him the way the others followed may i pet juck jenny asked approaching the ghost foal hes so cute the chained foal approached her agreeing to be petted why are they wearing those chains sherlock asked thats the way ghost horses are jordan said without then chains theyd fade out its the chains that hold them in this realm wouldnt it be kinder to unwrap them and let them go jenny asked then what would we ride jordan asked sensibly sherlock and jenny didnt argue they evidently realized that there was not too much point in discussing gentle social concerns with a barbarian dug came into the central glade there was the spellbox it was circular with a flat top behind it was a billboard titled spells there did not seem to be any opening in the top but dug was getting used to the ways of magic he touched the top with his hand and sure enough his hand passed right through it disappearing beyond as if the top were a sheet of liquid paint his questing fingers caught something he drew his hand back hauling out the thingand his hand was empty but he felt subtly changed piers anthony the others were watching him do you have a talent jenny asked i have something he said i suppose its a talent but i dont know which one you can read the list and try them in order sherlock suggested dug read the list change color of anything change one food to another null taste alter smells make objects adhere the talents seemed straightforward and harmless okay how does a person make his magic work he asked i have to get injured before mine works jordan said then its automatic i just will myself smoky threnody said and solid again its slow but it happens its not really a talent i simply partake of some human and some demon nature i just hum jenny said anyone who isnt paying attention enters my dream dug hadnt realized that jenny had a magic talent of her own he had assumed that it tied in with her cat okay ill will something to change color he looked around that stone there turn pink he concentrated trying to turn the stone pink nothing happened no luck he said so its not that are you sure jenny asked maybe you have to call it anything okay he addressed the stone i dub thee anything now turn pink again nothing happened so ill try the next he fished in his pocket and found a few nuts left over from his last snack two ms one n one o and three ps he lifted the pnut change to a marshmallow he ordered it demons dont dream nothing happened maybe its a marshmallow in the shape of a pnut sherlock suggested dug tasted it no its still peanutflavored he glanced at the list so now ill null its taste he concentrated then tasted it again it remained pflavored so he tried the next make it smell like a rose with no success then make it adhere to my finger he touched his finger to it but there was no adhesion he sighed this is apt to be tedious he read the next five talents change water to vapor or ice and back make raw food cooked sense when someone is about to die call up small intense gusts of wind see through objects we have any water dug asked jordan had a flask he poured a bit out and dug tried to vaporize or freeze it but without success then he tried to cook the pnut with no luck brought him up short how do i tell when someones about to die if no one is about to die i can slay someone for you jordan offered cheerfully drawing his sword dug would have laughed but he had the eerie feeling that the man wasnt joking no thanks that talent wouldnt help me get out of here anyway so im just going to assume this isnt that ill try the next and see if i can call up a small intense gust of wind thats not magic sherlock said i can do it naturally he bent over that wont be necessary dug said quickly though he was strongly tempted to laugh jordan didnt worry about temptation he burst out with a rich hohoho thats another way of doing it sherlock agreed pook the ghost horse didnt bother to laugh he simply let fly with his own loud gust of wind piers anthony thanks folks dug said but im the one who has to break the uh make the wind he concentrated but no other wind stirred next he tried to see through objects he couldnt just as well jenny said you might have looked through threnodys or my clothing and seen our panties dug hadnt thought of that he bit his tongue so as not to laugh knowing that they took such things more seriously than he did right close call he addressed the next five talents make others mute extinguish fires heal cuts abrasions resist bad dreams reverse someones sex okay in order dug said do i have a volunteer to become mute sure try me sherlock said dug concentrated sherlock become mute he intoned did it work no dug went on to the next well have to set a fire to see if i can quench it magically jordan went to pook and fetched two small stones he squatted by some dry grass and knocked the stones together a fat spark flew out igniting the grass there was a little fire dug focused on the fire but he couldnt put it out so jordan brought out some marshmallows and began toasting them on the end of a stick now can i hea a cut dug asked i dont think we should cut anyone to test this anyway we have some healing elixir which would do the job lets skip this one for now no we can test it jordan said he took his knife and demons dont dream passed the tip across threnodys arm scratching it heal this dug focused on the scratch but nothing happened i think thats not it jenny brought out the healing elixir and dripped a drop on the scratch the scratch disappeared but the next one was worse how can i find out whether i can resist bad dreams if im not asleep and if i were asleep and dreaming suppose only good dreams came it could take a month before i had a bad dream to resist maybe you could try a bad daydream jenny suggested mare imbri would never deliver one of those threnody objected who is mare imbri dug asked shes the day mare who brings good daydreams jenny explained she brought kim the daydream of floating bubbles and kim got bubbles dog from one of them live and learn well ill try to imagine a bad daydream and see if i can resist it dug said he concentrated imagining falling into an endless hole that notion had always scared him and it still did i dont seem to have any special resistance he said but there was no easing the difficulty of the progression i dont want to change someones sex dug said you could change one of us then change him back threnody suggested who volunteers for that dug asked he glanced at sherlock you want to be a woman for a minute the man shook his head no he pointed to his tiiroat thats what i thought dug said it could be a oneway trip so ill just skip this one for now then something registered why did you point to your throat sherlock the man didnt answer he just pointed again he cant speak jenny cried the mute talent worked piers anthony no it didnt dug said he said it didnt sherlock pointed to jordan jordan said it threnody said well i thought it didnt jordan said threnody gave him a disgusted look dug looked at sherlock the magic really did make you mute sherlock nodded vehemently well at least that identifies it but its not the one i need lets see if i can unmute you he concentrated sherlock speak again there was no result it was a oneway talent it should wear off in a few hours threnody said sherlock grimaced not completely pleased gee im sorry dug said i guess id better not experiment on real people any more i can make you feel better threnody said ill give you a gourdstyle apology for your inconvenience she approached sherlock took hold of him and gave him a demonically passionate kiss dug could have sworn that the mans feet left the ground for a few seconds his eyes rolled back in his head and a dreamy smile washed across his face he looked as if he had been anesthetized certainly he felt better renee has that effect jordan remarked nonchalantly a demoness can make a man deliriously happy if she chooses i happen to know it was evidently true sherlock seemed to be beyond caring about any little inconvenience such as not being able to speak in fact he looked as if he would have been speechless even if he werent already mute dug returned to business so i dont need this talent because it wont get me by the thorntree hedge all it proves is that the magic does work and that i have a whole lot of talents to check through he looked around where do i ditch this mute magic demons dont dream you just reach back into the spellbox threnody said it will let go so you can take another but wont i risk getting the same talents back no new talents float to the surface used ones sink to the bottom just dont reach too deep dug reached in and he did feel something leave him he caught a new something and brought it out he read the next five talents can merge with others can recreate any sound heard can create heat can cause objects to levitate can adjust weight of things nuhuh im not trying to merge with anyone threnody sighed and i was so looking forward to it dug didnt comment because again he suspected that she wasnt joking she was opposite to nada naga in everything other than beauty he tried to recreate sound but couldnt he tried to heat something and couldnt he tried to make something float and couldnt he tried to make a stone become heavier and failed again so he tried the next five immunity to poison can ease pain in others can breathe anywhere can change the magic of water can make trees fall dug refused to try the first he wasnt sure how to test the second until threnody touched her knife to jordans arm making it bleed dug tried to make the barbarians pain stop but couldnt fortunately it soon stopped itself as jordan quickly healed dug couldnt test the breathing because he couldnt find a vacuum or a deep lake to try piers anthony similarly he had no magic water to change from hate to love or lethe he wasnt going to mess with the vial of healing elixir they had just in case it got spoiled and the trees ignored his attempt to fell them magically he ground on through the remaining talents of the list nothing matched but how can that be he asked plaintively its got to be one of them maybe one of the ones you skipped jenny said or one of the first fifteen threnody suggested you didnt test them this time you picked up where you left off after the first talent she was right of course he had to test all the talents each time which made the job even more tedious resigned he tried changing color and it worked he turned the rock pink two down he said only fortyeight to go he was coming to appreciate how long it could take to test fifty times for fifty different talents each time magic was becoming a lot more tedious than he would have thought maybe sammy can help jenny said i really dont see how dug started but the iittle cat was already bounding to the spellbox wait for me dug cried grabbing for sammy before he fell through the porous lid but the cat didnt fall through the lid for him it was solid he sniffed the surface looking for something then seemed to find it could it be dug reached into the box by the cats nose and caught the first spell he found there he brought it out was this the one he needed but what did he need he skimmed through the list attract animals mimic peoples appearance create light darkness communicate with anyone repel dragons slow time calm tangle trees reverse emotions make fire would that last one enable him to burn down the thorntree hedge he tried to make fire but didnt get as much as a curl of smoke make earth tremors blow hurricane force demons dont dream maybe one of those would shake down the hedge or blow it away but he was unable to evoke either create pain sniff danger control animals make others sleep make invisible shield make things invulnerable reverse peoples actions generate hatred mimic persons talent i just dont see how any of these can get me out of here really dug said frustrated sammy jumped off the spellbox and ran to threnody who picked him up dug was learning to pick up on insignificant details what did that cat have in mind suddenly it clicked mimic someones talents he cried threnody can become smoky if i can make things turn smokydiffuse we can get through he approached the woman give me your talent please i thought youd never ask she said with a dusky smile she held her hand out to him cupping it in the air he took whatever it was she held then he turned to face the thorntree hedge become diffuse he ordered it then he walked to it and tried to put his hand through it ouch he had skewered his extremity on a thorn but that wasnt the whole reason for his pain the magic hadnt worked then he reconsidered that thorn had gone right through his palm and out the other side it had hurt but not as much as it should have his hand was not bleeding he touched the hedge again more cautiously and this time his hand passed through it with faint resistance as if the hedge were made of thin gelatin or viscous fluid the magic was working threnodys ability to turn smoky was slow so his was slow too but in time it did get there he turned back to the others i have made the hedge pervious he said thanks to sammys hint and your talent threnody thank you both threnody stroked sammys back we were getting bored she said it figured they knew he would get the talent eventually piers anthony but they didnt want to wait three more days so they had helped him was this cheating at the moment he hardly cared he just wanted to get on with the journey hoping to intercept kim before her disaster struck lets go he said he walked through the hedge which was now fully smoky jenny and sherlock followed and sammy jumped down to join them jenny paused to wave goodbye to jordan and threnody then hurried on beyond was the thick jungle it was quickly evident that they were not about to make swift progress through it there was also the smell of dragon smoke which boded ill for their safety but dug had another notion if this talent of threnodys is safe to use on people i can make us smoky and we can move right on through the way a demon would he tried it on himself jenny watched while sherlock gathered small thin vines and began weaving them into some sort of pattern slowly dug diffused until he was able to walk through a tree good enough he said faintly let me do the rest of you and well be on our way then a breeze came up and blew him away he saved himself only by scrambling into another tree where the wind couldnt catch him im having a second thought he confessed maybe if you did sherlock and me jenny suggested and not sammy then he could scamper to intercept she paused realizing that the cat was about to take off to do something and haul us along by a rope because we wouldnt weigh much that should be pretty fast brilliant dug cried airily if you werent a child id kiss you im only a year younger than you she said looking hurt dug realized that the matter of age could be as sensitive to an elf as to a human jenny looked little because she was an elf but she wasnt she was a child by game definition only okay ill kiss you he said demons dont dream he pulled himself from the tree as the wind died down and walked over to her he leaned down to kiss her but his face passed right through hers wish there were a boy of my kind here then he drew back again tried again and did it right just barely brushing her lips with his own so that they didnt overlap then he wondered why he should have been wishing for a boy of his kind here there had been a romantic implication that was hardly his idea of romance in any event there were other human beings in xanth ohmat had been jennys thought not his own he had picked it up when his brain overlapped hers she was an elf of a different fantasy world unlike the elves of xanth her prospects for romance here were nil unless she wanted to cross species boundaries that sort of thing seemed to be more common in xanth than in mundania but still it was only natural to want the company of her own kind xanth seemed like a land of puns and silliness but under the surface there were the same real concerns that the people he knew back home felt this was a solid reminder but he couldnt stop now to think through the philosophical ramifications he had to move swiftly to intercept kim so he could warn her of the danger she was in let me change you he said to jenny who had not seemed to notice his pause for thought perhaps she had paused for her own thoughts then ill change sherlock and well be on our way he focused on her and she slowly turned diffuse he tested by touching her hand every so often when her hand seemed solid to him he knew she was as diffuse as he was dont let the wind get you he warned her then he addressed sherlock soon the black man was as smoky as the other two belatedly dug remembered something we should have made a bag or net or something to hold us so piers anthony sammy can haul us a solid framework not a phasedo one so sherlock pointed to his tangle of vines he had started work on that even before jenny made the suggestion anticipating the need because the vines were small the net was light it would be possible for the cat to pull it but there was a problem they were too diffuse to handle the vines their hands passed through the vines without contact dug pondered i wonder just how versatile this talent of threnodys is he asked if i can make just our hands more solid or part of the vine smoky the second idea seemed better he concentrated on the tail end of the net making that smoky he tested it by picking up the end while his hands passed through the lead harness then he worked his way forward changing it partway it was possible they put their legs through holes in the pattern and strung it around themselves it spread out enough so that all three of them could hang on without crowding then dug made the harness end smoky and jenny called sammy and dug put the harness on the cat once it was secure he made it solid again so that sammy would not simply walk through it when he got going but me vines connecting to the rest of them were phased out making them almost weightless as long as the phasing was in parts of the same vines they were tight it was when one thing was phased out and another wasnt that they passed through each other i think were ready dug said jenny spoke sammy go find kirn the cat took off the net followed hauling them abruptly forward they were on their way their separation ended they were jammed together the world might seem insubstantial but they were fully solid to each other dug lifted his arms to try to hold the other two off but it was impossible okay so we travel together he said putting his arms around jenny elf who demons dont dream was right in front of him sherlock beside them both put his arms around both of them now they made a compact stable mass sammy under no restraints chose his own route he scampered between two closegrowing trees the three of them passed through the trees he squeezed under a root they went through it he found a catsized tunnel through a mass of thorns they went through every thorn but without getting stuck there was indeed a dragon the thing loomed up belching clouds of smoke sammy zipped under its tail the dragon whipped around trying to catch the cat but was too slow instead its talons swiped through the netful of people without effect but dug flinched and jenny stifled a scream the dragon frustrated blew out a hot blast of turbulent smoke it surrounded them making the world dark but didnt make them choke in a moment they were out of it unscathed i could get to like this kind of traveling dug said making an effort at bravado jenny nodded she was looking a bit motionsick sherlock had done the sensible thing his eyes were closed dug seeing that closed his own then he just seemed to be floating through faintly rushing water as they moved along dug thought of something threnodys talentthat was making herself smoky he said but i was not only doing that i was making other people and things smoky can demons do that i dont think so jenny said surprised dug decided not to question this further because his conclusion might turn out to be dangerous to their progress possibly he had inadvertently wiggled through a small hole in the game program after a time they stopped dug opened his eyes they were on a trailand two centaurs were bearing down on them at a gallop what now i see kim jenny cried and nada now dug saw they were riding the centaurs he tried piers anthony to untangle himself from sherlock jenny and the net so he could signal them to stop and talk kim was looking one way nada the other nada saw them dug saw the shock of recognition in her eyes she turned her face away saying something the two centaurs galloped faster the cat perhaps concerned about getting trampled bolted into the brush the centaurs galloped on past their hooves throwing up divots of dirt wait dug cried i have to talk to you it was too late the centaurs were already well along the path and nobody was looking back shes false all right dug said she saw usand made them speed up so theyd be by before kim saw us well never catch them now but we know where theyre going jenny said the good magicians castle but the cats tired sherlock said going to be hard to catch them now dug looked at him your muteness has worn off the magics fading and that means that your ability to diffuse us is about to fade too sherlock said better make us solid while you still can or well be stuck in ghost form good point dug got to work changing them back to solidity but he did so with a heavy heart they were going to have to walk to the good magicians castle and chances were that by the time they got there kim and nada would be gone and with nada warned what he was up to she was likely to betray kim before he could catch her im afraid theres going to be trouble dug said heavily jenny and sherlock nodded agreement gourd kim was glad to be traveling so rapidly after the slow slogging she had done before but much as she liked horses and therefore also centaurs she would be glad when this ride was done she didnt have the hang of it she kept bouncing and her thighs were getting sore so she was annoyed when the two centaurs accelerated whats the matter she asked nada saw something and warned us to get past it swiftly the centaur replied turning his head it looked like a tangle of bodies kim didnt know what that could have been but was glad not to have encountered it still she would rather have made the decision herself nada was maybe just a little bit pushy forgetting that kim was the player maybe it came of being a princess kim had agreed to exchange companions only because dug had wanted to she really had preferred jenny elf well i guess were past it now she said so lets slow down again okay they slowed and her thighs took less of a pounding that was a relief she was able to focus on her own piers anthony thoughts again she was making good progress toward her game objective but she wished she could have associated longer with dug in the foolish hope that maybe by some ill chance she might have made a small impression on him she knew he was probably as shallow as the average boy was at that age and that she shouldnt take much note of the fact that he was handsome but there it was if she saw him again she would try to arrange to stay together longer somehow for what little it might be worth maybe another snowstorm would come and theyd be jammed together again in a tent maybe hed become aware of her as cyrus and merci had become aware of each other maybe they would kiss before they parted meanwhile it was nice having bubbles for company she was holding the dog before her which was sometimes tricky because bubbles weighed more man half as much as kirn the dog could not have enjoyed the bumping any more than kirn did but she did not complain in fact bubbles was a very quiet polite dog undemonstrative but kim was learning to read her little signs the angle of her halffloppy ears the curl of her tail her general manner and the dogs attitude was coming through with increasing clarity bubbles just wanted to be with kim and to help her in whatever she was doing nothing else it was straightforward and easy enough to accept at one point a shadow crossed the foliage moving toward them in a moment kim saw a small flying dragon it cocked its head eying them both centaurs unslung their bows and whipped arrows from their quivers nocking them and orienting on the dragon in smooth continuous synchronous motions the dragon veered away losing interest the two arrows went back into their quivers and the two bows were slung back across the centaurs shoulders again together nobody much it seemed fooled with a pair of male centaurs even if it wasnt an enchanted path kim wondered whether it was mostly bluff but later her centaur fetched his bow again nocked his arrow and loosed it without pause it transfixed a small ugly creature demons dont dream resembling a lizard with wings the other centaur never drew an arrow being unconcerned but that little thing couldnt have hurt us kim protested it is a basilisk the centaur explained it was about to look at us kim felt a chill a basilisk a winged lizard whose gaze could kill one swift arrow had stopped itand the other centaur had been so confident of his companions marksmanship that he hadnt bothered to react no there was no bluffing in centaurs they were simply competent and secure in that knowledge in due course the centaurs slowed this is the good magicians castle her mount said you will have to undertake three challenges to enter it after which the good magician will speak with you decent fortune thanks she said as she slid to the ground centaurs werent much for overstatement nada dismounted with a certain princessly flair then the centaurs were off not even resting they had done their job and were heading home taking no note of fatigue kim and nada and bubbles stood and gazed at the castle it had a moat and there was a water monster in it but the creature was yawning it didnt expect them to be so foolish as to try to swim across the drawbridge was down so that they could cross that way except that there was a giant plum before the bridge and the fruit had split apart to revea its huge pit and the pit had opened and in the pit was a small bull the bull looked aggressive they could not reach the bridge without crossing through the region of the pit and the bull made it evident that it was inclined to fold spindle or mutilate anyone who tried that thats a bull pit kim said catching on to a possible pun then she did a double take or a pit bull or maybe a bully pulpit or bull pen or something im getting myself confused but thats what we have to get past piers anthony i can assume large serpent form and hiss it off nada suggested i dont think thats fair when its a challenge as it obviously is kirn said i have to figure out a way to handle it myself that was true but it wasnt the whole story kirn didnt want to accept nadas help on it she wanted to prevail by herself as you wish nada said shrugging kim looked around there was always a way both in the game and in the normal castle challenges but all she saw was what looked like a big pillbox it was probably a military one because on the side was written fight bubbles walked over to sniff the box she was mildly curious about everything with her curiosity being satisfied by a sniff but this did show one thing the box wasnt dangerous kim followed lifted the lid and peered in there were hundreds of pills bouncing frantically around what did this mean after a moment she realized that the pills were fighting each one was trying to bash any other it encountered perhaps trying to crack it and pulverize it that must be why the box said fight on the outside it was full of fighting pills but how did this relate to what she had to accomplish well maybe she could find out she reached in and swooped out a fighting pill the thing was a handful it banged back and forth in her hand and expanded in size if not in ferocity it didnt hurt her because as it grew it became softer she hung on first to its body then to an end and finally to a corner as it got to be almost as big as the dog it was no longer a pill it was a pillow and it was still fighting buffeting her arm the side of the pillbox and anything else it could reach what a scrapper she didnt dare let it go because then it would surely be whamming her worse something percolated through her mind fighting pillow fighting pills pillow fight pill fight demons dont dream the familiar light flashed above her head she could indeed use these pills she swooped her free hand into the pillbox and caught as many fighting pills as she could it was a struggle to hang on to them she ran across to the pit bull take this she cried throwing the fighting pillow at him and this she direw the expanding handful of fighting pills the big pillow and small pillows attacked the pit bull with enthusiasm wham wham wham wham they needed no anchor they were able to do their whamming without support the bull confused tried to fight back he managed to gore the big pillow feathers started flying out adding confusion to the scene but as the large pillow lost its stuffing the smaller ones grew to size their buffeting becoming harder as they did the bull was entirely distracted lets go kim cried she and bubbles and nada ran across the plum pit region and the pit bull didnt even notice them they left the action behind and got on the drawbridge and stopped for there in the middle of the bridge was a stool and on the stool perched a pigeon the stool was covered with bird droppings in fact it was a bird droppingan amalgamation of droppings that had mounded into that shape it stank as soon as the pigeon saw them it flew up above the bridge and dropped another dropping and another in fact droppings fairly rained down around the stool nyaa nyaa it squawked ill bomb you with stools and your smell will make the castle shut you out you cant get by me it dropped another dropping in the shape of a small stool i cant pass under that dirty bird nada said wrinkling her nose it wouldnt be princessly it thinks its a harpy bubbles though no princess seemed no more eager a stool pigeon kim exclaimed disgusted she didnt want to get soiled either so what was the cleanest way to get past this obnoxious piers anthony creature she looked around but saw nothing but dung on the bridge she looked out across the moat but there was only the moat monster looking on with amusement she looked back the way they had come but saw only the pit bull still fighting pillows one pillow instead of whamming the bull seemed to be trying to press the bull down without much effect a pillow pressing down a down pillow kim ran back grabbed the pillow and zipped away before the bull could round on her she threw the pillow at the pigeon sure enough the pillow landed on the bird and held it down on the giant stool the pigeon couldnt fly up to bomb them yuck the stooled pigeon squawked they picked their way through the mess and to the far side of the moat but the end of the bridge was blocked by a pile of melons one large melon was bossing the others honey move over here she said and the addressed melon moved over displacing the other melons which rolled around before settling down honey get up on the bridge the other melon rolled up on the bridge kim stood and watched trying to fathom the pun those looked like a particular type of melon honeydew kim exclaimed telling the others what to do and theyre so busy doing it that we cant get by the pile of them now she knew the problem but what was the solution kim looked around again but this time saw nothing to help in fact mere was no longer a retreat across the bridge because the pigeon had succeeded in pecking the down pillow apart and the down was dropping into the moat the pit bull had succeeded in goring the remaining pillows and they too were expiring so whatever there was that could help had to be right here bubbles was cautiously sniffing the nearest melons that didnt necessarily mean anything but sometimes kim got notions from watching what the dog did could there be anything here for her demons dont dream she peered at the constantly shifting pile of melons they were of different types buried almost out of sight was one whose name she couldnt quite remember but it was suggestive so she cudgeled her brain and forced it out cantaloupe it was a ripe cantaloupe and that perhaps was her answer if she could manage to play it right it was an excruciating pun but of course she would never have entered this game if she had wanted to avoid that sort of thing honeydew theres a cantaloupe in your pile she said boldly the honeydew paused in her stream of directives yes i know im trying to get rid of it so i can elope with my honey you think it means cant elope kim said but it doesnt it means an incantation of elopement its in the pile a cantation of elope its been trying to help you all this time and youve been refusing to listen the honeydew was speechless for a moment but she recovered quickly then lets elope she cried honey do it now and she rolled away from the bridge and around the castle all the other melons followed her that may be quite a ceremony kim murmured appreciatively you might say a meloncholy occasion now the way was open kim had navigated the last of the three punny challenges she marched ahead and up to the main gate of the castle the door was closed she lifted a knuckle and knocked in a moment the door opened there stood a pretty young woman of about eighteen whose hair matched her brown shoes and whose eyes matched her pink dress kim was a bit startled by the eyes may i help you the girl asked softly um yes im kim im playing the game and ive come to see the good magician humfrey so i can find out where to find the prize of course the gir said smiling is anyone with you piers anthony kirn was slightly annoyed of course cant you see them no the girl looked apologetic im sorry i should have told you i am wira the good magicians son hugos girlfriend i am blind suddenly kim felt about two feet high she had made a pushy smart remark about sight she felt herself blushing i uh theyre uh nada naga who is my companion and bubbles my dog oh a real dog wira asked we dont see many of those here our castle dog canis major is away right now may i pet her i uh she doesnt like strangers much kim said feeling worse but bubbles was already stepping forward wagging her tail wira stooped to pet her on the head and the dog accepted the pet kim was amazed this was only the second time she had seen bubbles take to a stranger you must have a way with animals she said its my talent wira said i am sensitive to things and can tell how they are animals like me she straightened up but i must not delay you i will take you to ivy princess ivy id love to meet her but my business is with the good magician ivy has taken over his appointment book wira explained it is too hard for the several wives to keep track since theyre always in and out ivy will know when he is scheduled to see you oh once again kim had embarrassed herself with an ignorant remark she shut her mouth and followed wira and bubbles and nada followed her they came to a chamber with a desk and book there was a young woman marking items with a pencil she looked up yes youre princess ivy kim exclaimed forgetting herself again what are you doing as a clerk demons dont dream ivy smiled you must be a player she is nada said from behind her hello ivy nada naga ivy exclaimed delighted she jumped up with unprincessly haste and went to embrace nada i havent seen you in months im serving my time for sipping red whine in the gourd realm nada explained this is kim the player i am companioning she needs to see the good magician wira added oh of course let me see ivy went back to the book yes thats an hour from now that will give you time to clean up and have a bite to eat ill take them to mareann wira said mareann kim asked shes the good magicians wife of the month wira explained as she set off down the hall without hesitation she evidently knew her way around die castle so was not inhibited by her lack of sight she was his first love but his fifth and a halfth wife because she wouldnt marry him early she can summon equines oh yes kim said remembering she had read about that just as she had read about wira now she remembered that wira had been put to sleep by her family because she wasnt much use to them fortunately she had met the good magicians family in the dream realm and they had rescued her somehow what she had read didnt register readily here in realseeming life the people she was meeting were far more impressive than those she remembered from books mareann was in the kitchen baking animal cookies in the shape of horses cookies might grow on plants by the banks of the withacookee river but elsewhere it seemed easier just to bake them instead of making the long trip to fetch them from the river mareann was a pleasant older woman who seemed not at all out of the ordinary yet kim had a vision of her as she was in her youth with lovely brown hair and eyes matching the manes and tails of the unicorns she could summon then piers anthony with marvelously formed legs because of all the equineback riding she did she had met and loved humfrey when they both were in their teens in fact when they were even younger than kim was now sixteen but mareann had been determinedly innocent so the unicorns wouldnt leave her and refused to marry humfrey though she loved him it had been such sweet sorrow kim saw her riding her hair flung out behind a tear on her cheek as she left humfrey to be king of xanth humfrey had married a demoness instead but it was always mareann he loved kim snapped out of it aware that others were looking at her ohi guess i was daydreaming she said embarrassed again of course mareann said mare imbri is here she brought you a daydream she tells me she also brought you the dream of the disposal bubbles kim almost thought she saw the outline of a small black mare behind the woman yes it was the strangest thing turning real at the end thats how i got bubbles my dog she petted bubbles just now she showed me how it was when you were young you were so beautiful and nice then she realized that she had committed yet another gaffe i mean not that you arent now my dear i am happier now than i was then mareann said even though i can no longer summon unicorns the other equines still do come to me though she petted mare imbri who perked her ears forward the horse was there though invisible then mare imbri glanced elsewhere and abruptly bolted through the wall and away someone else had a daydream coming kim felt a twinge of envy for that person there was a garden behind the castle with toiletrees that helped them get cleaned up and back in order they returned to find the cookies on the table along with a coiled chain whats this kim asked doubtfully a food chain of course mareann said a ghost horse brought it in just break off any link you want demons dont dream she should have known she dimly remembered that ghost horses wore chains wrapped around their bodies which they could rattle to distract and frighten living folk it hadnt occurred to her that such chains might be edible they broke off links and chewed on them and the food was good each link was a different texture and flavor some were like vegetables some like breads and some like meat as a general rule the vegetables were at the lower end of the chain and the meats at the upper end kim broke off a link at the very top and gave it to bubbles who found it quite intriguing after the meal it was time for the appointment with the good magician wira showed them the way up the winding stone stairs to the gloomy cubbyhole the magician called his own kim realized that it made sense for the blind girl to do this because the lack of light did not concern her she could find the good magician in complete darkness and there he was almost hidden behind a monstrous tome what do you want he demanded grumpily evidently irritated about being disturbed this is kim the game player father humfrey wira said she has an appointment oh he glanced at wira and the barest hint of a flicker of the corner of a smile brushed by his glum mouth kim realized that he really liked the girl though he labored gnomefully not to show it i have a question kim said but i dont think i can pay for it i mean you require a years service for an answer but im mundane and cant stay in xanth that long it is part of your companions service humfrey said it has been factored in ask and be done with it just like that but suddenly kim realized that this too was a challenge the obvious question was where the game prize was to be found but she had lost much of her interest hi that about the time she met dug now she wished she could ask about something that didnt concern the game but of course that was out of bounds piers anthony or was it she didnt have to go for the win did she why not play the game her way and if she lost at least she had expressed herself she pondered a good twothirds of a moment then asked how can i get what i most desire humfrey turned the pages of his tome d he muttered as he did so demagogue demon depraved descent desire ardent bestial confused decayed foolish most ape baboon canary human player game female young kirn his forehead added a wrinkle now that is interesting he glanced up at kim your greatest desire changed recently that was one comprehensive reference tome i suppose it did sir she confessed meekly no matter go to the realm of the gourd you will find it there bubbles wagged her tail the gourd kim asked somewhat blankly that is the realm of dreams accessible by a certain variety of gourd nada said i can find one for you kim had known that her blankness was because she could not see how the realm of dreams could possibly help her do anything but dream when what she wanted was a better reality the book of answers must have slipped a cog or whatever it did maybe that was because this was a computer game and only so much could be programmed into it the game would naturally assume that her most ardent desire was for the game prize it was foolish to expect the game to know or care anything about her real life or feelings thank you sir she said trying not to show her disappointment i will visit the realm of the gourd humfreys nose was already buried in the tome he had tuned her out as they went back down the stone steps wira spoke the good magicians answers may seem cryptic or unsatisfactory at first but they are always correct i am sure is demons dont dream your greatest desire will be found in the realm of dreams mine was thank you kim said but her doubt remained magician grey murphy brought in three fresh gourds yesterday wira said we have them in the guest room you knew yesterday that someone would need gourds kim asked she was not impressed so much as resigned obviously the good magician had a standard answer lined up for game players and that was to direct them to the next stage of the game kim had now explored much of xanth except for the gourd it made sense that she explore that too how could the game know that though her body would continue going through the motions of the quest her heart had been foolishly diverted only an idiot would go to xanth for anything but laughs unfortunately she was that idiot wira showed them to the guest room sure enough there were three gourds lying on mattresses you must hold hands as you look into the gourds wira explained otherwise you will not find yourselves in the same region how did you get into the gourd world being blind kim asked there are other ways when i was put to sleep i was in a coffin and its magic let my soul drift from my body and join the souls of the others of that realm so when wira was put to sleep it had been a lot like dying kim could think of similar cases in mundania she looked at nada you really dont have to join us in this she said i know what the dream world is like i insist nada said with a peculiar expression had kim not been distracted by her own private concerns she might have wondered what was on the naga princess mind they lay down on the mattresses and held hands kim was in the middle her left hand held nadas right and her right hand held bubbles left forepaw then wira turned kirns gourd around so that the peephole was toward her piers anthony though she was blind she seemed to know exactly what she was doing kirn realized that it made sense to have wira here because it was impossible for her to be accidentally caught by the gourd kim looked into the peepholeand abruptly found herself standing in a gloomy field near an even gloomier cemetery oh no this must be the section of the dream realm reserved for the walking skeletons she could handle it but she would have preferred to be in a candy garden or the pasture of the night mares in a moment minus an instant bubbles appeared beside her oh bubbles kim cried gladly i never thought to ask whether you wanted to come here but im glad youre with me she petted the dog who licked her hand then nada naga appeared oh the graveyard shift she said that is not my favorite mine neither kim agreed but maybe we dont have to deal with the skeletons this is just our starting point the prize may be somewhere else defended by a challenge nada agreed the most rigorous one there was something about the way she said it that made kim a trace uneasy but she couldnt fathom why nada had been a proper companion throughout though somewhat reserved that was to be expected of a princess well then lets look elsewhere kim said it seemed to her that the good magicians answer allpurpose as it might be was not a great help because she knew that the realm of dreams was as big in its fashion as all the rest of xanth the prize could be anywhere at all but of course this was the game so there would surely be a hint for her to pick up on but as they started to walk away from the cemetery a skeleton spied them hiyo it called hailing them are you looking for something kim realized that if her route lay through the cemetery the game would not let her avoid it so she turned back demons dont dream with resignation i am a mundane playing the game i am looking for the prize the skeleton seemed somewhat taken aback its general configuration indicated that it was male oh i had understood you sought what you most desired he said kim was startled that is what i asked for she admitted but how did you know that oops i slipped he said i was not supposed to tell you what i knew only to guide you to the challenge i am painfully sorry the light flashed over kirns head you are marrow bones she exclaimed the skeleton was chagrined how did you know that kim had to smile i saw you as one of the prospective companions and i suspect you folk have to work at other chores if youre not chosen so you must be working here in your bailiwick as it were you are correct of course he agreed but i was supposed to assume another identity for the role i hope you will excuse this irregularity i am happy to kim said feeling better i feel as if i know you having read about you before that is nice marrow said uncertainly i do know princess nada naga of course ever since we met when she was a child of eight i was actually fourteen nada said i had to pretend to be eight prince dolph was really disappointed when he found out i think it worked out for the best marrow said electra seems a better match for him no offense no offense at all nada agreed i never was able to relate very well to younger men the skeleton turned to the dog but i do not believe i know this one this is bubbles kim said shes my dog but as she spoke she felt a wash of regret she really liked the dog and it was going to hurt to have to leave her behind when she finished the game and returned to mundania piers anthony she realized that the dog was just another game character who would revert to her normal life once this chore was done still she wished it could be otherwise she trusted bubbles in a way she did not quite trust nada well im afraid our show will not be very effective since you recognized me marrow said it is supposed to be a challenge of fear but fear does not work well when the basis of it is known i am not quite sure what to do no problem kirn said im not eager to rush on with it lets sit and chat for a while first but this is not game protocol nada protested to bleep with protocol kim said if i cant have my hearts desire i might as well enjoy the adventure she plumped down on the nearest gravestone bubbles lay down by her feet marrow just how did your kind come about im sure you did not evolve as skeletons from the outset marrow sat on another gravestone it is a somewhat degenerative story i am not sure you would relish it try me and see kim was enjoying the prospect of messing up the allknowing game a bit maybe she would even ferret out a hole in the program very well long ago before the night stallion tamed the magic of the gourd realm human beings who looked through the peepholes of the hypnogourds would be trapped not knowing the secret of breaking the spell which is simply to have a friend break the contact of the eye with the peephole thus many of them were forever trapped here they would remain alive in the dream realm no matter how wasted their physical bodies became so long as their eye socket oriented on the peephole but their dream bodies would waste away reflecting the condition of their physical bodies so in time the gourd realm became inhabited by zombielike figures and finally by walking skeletons each was horrified by his or her appearance and the appearance of others i have to say that they were somewhat enamored of their flesh especially those portions of it that distinguished their male and female attri demons dont dream butes that was not the worst of it the gourds are living vegetables and when a particular gourd sprouted and dissolved the person trapped by it would be released at this state however this meant death so the folk within the gourd faded out at that point this was all they had to look forward to captivity emaciation skeletonization and finally disappearance but one day a male skeleton and a female skeleton held a dialogue and fell in love despite their grotesque appearances their minds wene compatible and it was their minds they loved but when they came to love each other they found each others body less repulsive they experimented and discovered the skeleton key and made a skeleton child it was not easy because they had to borrow bones from their own bodies and this made it harder for them to function nevertheless their accomplishment was phenomenal because for the first time they were able to reproduce their kindas animated skeletons they had found love and familyhood within the gourd they hastened to tell other skeletons of this and others managed to make their own offspring they did not tell the little skels that they would soon fade out of existence that knowledge was too cruel instead they took pleasure in the innocence of the little ones making a facsimile of heaven within hell they adapted their histories to the gourd setting and developed new myths to replace the old they tried to explain everything in terms of the dream reality so as to spare their children knowledge of the terrible truth but they had accomplished more than they knew two things happened first the little skels did not fade out when their parents did they did not derive from xanth or fleshly creatures and so did not cease to exist when gourds rotted for the gourds are merely apertures they convey the minds of their captives to the dream realm much as an eye conveys the image to the mind the folk of the dream realm are not in the gourds themselves any more than the images are stored within the eyeballs so a new species had been created within the dream realm sec piers anthony ond the little skels grew they did not do it by eating for they lacked digestive systems and neither imbibed nor excreted if you will excuse the vulgar terms instead they found stray bones scattered around and added them to themselves becoming larger when the surviving parents realized this they were generous with their own bones knowing that these bones would only be lost when their possessors faded out so there was suddenly a large supply and the skels prospered and grew more rapidly in time there came the first generation of dream realm adults folk who had never known the outer realm and to whom it was merely a repulsive alternate world peopled by fleshclad parodies of skels they became proud of their own heritage and their own offspring believed that this was the way it had always been they were no longer limited to human skeletons there were now assorted animal skels existing the same way all of us learned how to disassemble and reassemble our bones so as to form strings of them or other shapes this was convenient when we needed to navigate high cliffs or other hazards we came to regard ourselves as the most versatile of creatures with some justice then the night stallion came and organized the dream realm and sent out the night mares with dreams crafted to punish those sleeping folk who deserved it it turned out to be a considerable market it was amazing how many living folk had guilty consciences which earned them bad dreams as the dream business prospered fancier dreams were crafted and the call went out for specialists to craft them some gourd folk became carpenters and some artists and some sculptors making the settings and scenery some became organizers and directors coordinating the efforts of others some became writers scripting the scenes and some became actors in the scenes the realm of the gourd had assumed meaning marrow bones paused he shook his skull so it remains for most of my kind but accidents of fate and magic caused me to get lost within the gourd until i was demons dont dream rescued by esk ogre from the dread outer realm i discovered that the fleshly folk though repulsive were not as horrible as we had believed and in time i came to accept them as they were flesh and all in fact i came to prefer existence outside of the gourd it was a different and often fascinating world later grace ossein was expelled from the gourd because she had interfered with a bad dream she believed was wrong and i came to know her and she came to know this realm now we are both satisfied to live externally and we have two offspring picka bone and joynt bone in whom we delight they are content to exist in this realm too thats fascinating kirn said but i understand that you skeletons dont have souls how can you exist out here without them this is a problem marrow agreed we are trying to acquire souls for ourselves and our children but souls do not grow on trees he tilted his head indicating that this was to be considered a humorous remark supposedly it is possible for mortal folk to share then souls giving half away and they then regenerate but so far we have found none willing to do this we fear that in time those of us who exist in the outer realm will fade much as our distant human ancestors did within the gourd he shrugged and his bones rattled however this is by no means your concern you must try to win your game and i must try to prevent you from doing this abiding by the rules of the game yes i suppose that is true kim said i wish there were a better way she sighed well lets get on with it whats next dug stared down the road he knew there was no chance to catch kirn now the centaurs were simply too fast but he was not about to give up guilt drove him on well just have to walk toward the good magicians castle and hope to catch her before anything happens he said nadas really a nice person jenny said im sure shes very unhappy about having to be false nevertheless she is now the enemy dug said what i want to do is catch up to kirn tell her the danger and trade back then you can help kim win her prize and illwell i dont know what ill do but at least i wont feel like such a heel but you didnt know about nada when you traded jenny said it isnt your fault shes false doesnt matter its not right to let kim get washed out when it was supposed to be me i feel guilty i like your attitude sheriock said so do i jenny said its just a routine attitude everyone should have what demons dont dream i need now is to find the fastest way to the castle which i guess is simply hotfooting it south dugs pack was sitting a bit uncomfortably after the wild ride in smoky condition he took it off and discovered to his surprise that it was a pretty golden color it wasnt gold just goldcolored as if it had been painted look at this he said surprised it changed color jenny said its pretty but how did it happen dug asked i was wearing it so i didnt see it happen did either of you they both shook their heads no it was a minor mystery however dug didnt trust mysteries not in this treacherous game little things could signal important developments he opened the pack and took out a somewhat squished sandwichand it too was painted gold yet he was sure it hadnt been a moment ago he touched a spare shirtand saw it change color im doing it he exclaimed everything i touch turns to gold uhoh sheriock said i heard about king midas thats one mean curse but the stuff isnt solid gold dug said just goldplated see this shirts still flexible its just changed color and the sandwichs still soft the wrappers golden is all it still does seem like a curse jenny said maybe you shouldnt touch anyone else until you know how to stop it id love to stop it dug said he concentrated on not changing color and touched another item in the pack but it turned golden anyway he walked to the side of the path and touched the leaf of a tree it too turned golden he realized that this could not be random he had not done anything special in the last few minutes so didnt think he had invoked any magic he hadnt picked up a stink horn for example so why should this spell be on him he stared at the golden pack goldplated pack actually it had been gilded it was gilt piers anthony gilt that sounded like guilt and one thing he was feeling now was guilt he had said so he groaned im being victimized by a pun he said gilt by association but we dont feel guilty jenny said gilt g i l t if you associate with me and i touch you youll be gilded goldcolored gilt gilty someones made it literal then you should be able to stop it jenny said maybe now i can dug stood and faced the forest i deny any gilt by association he declaimed then he touched another item in his pack it did not change ha i neutralized the pun curses someone muttered foiled again the three of them passed a glance around none of them had spoken there was a swirl of air like a small whirlwind it became smoky then solid taking the shape of a wellproportioned woman scantily clad metria jenny exclaimed what are you doing here dug remembered that there had been a lady demon among the choices available for companion this would be her two things the demoness said im investigating your chaos my what dug asked confusion disorder misapprehension ferment jumble litter foulupr dug asked whatever she agreed crossly what are you doing with the wrong companion we traded dug said i decided that jenny elf was better for me than nada naga but the challenges were pitched for nada dug wondered whether that was good or bad you mean that she could have helped me through betteror that she couldnt oh i dont know just that grossclout had it figured demons dont dream one way and you were playing it another using the cat to find your way through zilch only knows how the other players been doing with the serpent woman so is there a rule against it dug asked not exactly nobody thought anybodyd be fool enough to pull a stunt like that so whats the problem the demoness fidgeted its just not steak not what encounter converge intersect unite connect join meet dug could handle puns when he had to whatever its just not meet to change things around like that now i have to recomplicate things you mean im doing okay so youre going to mess me up dug was bemused he wasnt even trying for the prize he just wanted to undo the mischief he had inadvertently caused approximately the demoness agreed wait half a moment jenny said metria did professor grossclout tell you specifically to interfere with dugs progress whats it to you waif im dugs companion its my job to steer him past unnecessary confusions and complications so that he wont think hes in some other game where that sort of thing is supposed to be standard you strike me as exactly that kind of mischief what exactly did grossclout say to you the demoness fidgeted he said to investigate and use my judgment he meant to judge whether dug was in some unwarranted trouble because of the mixup jenny said hes not so all you have to do is go back and report that all swell all what bulge grow increase billow bloat inflate hey dug protested i mean surfs seas waters piers anthony wells metria offered yes only the other way around swell oh you mean that everything is satisfactory thats what i mean jenny said evenly in your own imitable fashion so you can now buzz off and tell him that no more turning his guilt literal or whatever else your demonly fancy conceives he is not for you to play with metria dug saw that jenny was trying to do her job obviously the demoness would only interfere with whatever he was trying to accomplish he liked the elfs attitude metria pondered she glanced at dug then at sherlock her garment flashed translucent not quite showing her panties assuming she was wearing any but these are such interesting men i think ill stay and investigate some more but you have to go back and report to grossclout jenny reminded her i have to use my judgment my judgment is that i should hang around a bit more for an instant she assumed the form of a woman being suspended by the neck until dead but you arent supposed to interfere with my legitimate companioning but nada nagas supposed to be his companion metria pointed out youre not his legitimate companion youre kirns jenny turned to dug this is likely to be trouble she said fortunately her attention span is not great if you ignore her shell go away after a while metria smiled yes ignore me dug mundane she stepped into him her clothing disappearing dug expected her to be smoky but she was completely solid he realized belatedly that she was not half demon the way threnody was but full demon she could change instantly metria squeezed against him not only was she nude she was voluptuous she reached up and drew his head ii f demons dont dream down for a kiss you should have chosen me to be your companion she murmured i could have made your life deliriously exciting he realized that it was true he had taken one look at beautiful nada and chosen her but now he saw that the demoness could make herself just as shapely and she had no princessly attitude to counter it he probably should have chosen her he might not have gotten far in the game but he would have enjoyed the distraction he was now appreciating firsthand what sherlock had when he had gotten kissed by a demoness still could she added sliding her bare front across his clothed front as she inhaled he realized that it was no bluff innocent was not a term anyone would ever apply to this creature however at the moment he had a different mission he had to catch up to kim and warn her about her false companion so he steeled himself to ward off the demoness allure forget it he said maybe some other time you infernal creature right away he realized that he had blundered metrias mouth curled into a frown and then on into a fanged tusked muzzle it snapped at his nose but was insubstantial as it closed dug was startled but unhurt then the demoness faded into air ill be back her words came oh mice jenny swore i told you to ignore her not to insult her now shell be seriously mischievous she was getting hard to ignore dug said defensively all she was doing was getting in your way she was hard to ignore sherlock said a child wouldnt understand jenny shrugged obviously not understanding what appeal there could be in a lusciously shaped bare demoness who wasnt wearing panties dug was glad for sherlocks support they set off south but soon they encountered a huge piers anthony gray donkey well now the creature said are you the three folk the demoness said are looking for trouble already the mischief of a demoness scorned was manifesting this was obviously no ordinary equine in fact he saw that it had a whole bundle of tails dug thought fast this was really just another kind of challenge how to turn mischief into something positive no we are the three folk who are in trouble he said were looking for a way out of trouble she must have misunderstood hee haw haw the donkey brayed thats for sure in fact what we need to get out of trouble is a ride dug said a fine animal like you could do us a big favor hee haw im the ass o nine tails i can give you a ride anywhere but youll have to listen to my tales dug glanced at the other two seems fair to me can you take us to the good magicians castle hee haw that i can hop on dug congratulated himself internally he had succeeded in converting a menace into an asset a genuine asset jenny looked doubtful but didnt protest that meant that she had concluded that the giant ass was not dangerous to ride so he helped her mount and then climbed on behind her and sherlock climbed on behind him there was generous room for all three as well as sammy cat in front of jenny the ass started off hee haw i have nine tales of course he said he flicked up the first of his tails first i will tell you about the deadly night shade and the kith of death it seemed that a certain shade of the night was lonely having no kithing kin so he decided that nobody else should have kithing cousins either he became the deadliest night shade of all at first dug found the tale interesting but after a while it palled because the ass was great on detail but not on plot he told how the shade killed one cousin after another using his deadly kiss until all the kith were dead there it ended there was no resolution and no justice demons dont dream just continuous killing dug realized that the asss memory was a good deal better than his originality yet he realized that he had seen many similar stories on tv back in mundania then there is the tale of rubella and the fool moon the ass continued as soon as the first story expired in dullness he told how rubella kept fooling the moon adding a measly pockmark on the moons face each time after an hour or so of the narration the moons whole face was pocked and cratered but the moon was too foolish to learn how to stop rubella again there was no point it was just one pock after another then there was the tale of the fait accompli and the deogreant fait set out to weaken the ogres by eliminating their powerful smell she used a special rollon gunk to deogreize each ogre in turn until no ogre had a strong smell unfortunately she accomplished nothing because the ogres remained horribly strong and still crunched bones at a great rate the bulk of the tale was concerned with a description of each of a hundred or so ogres fait dealt with then there was the tale of michael velli and the crow bar michael set out with devious cunning and no ethics to ruin the crows favorite hangout a bar where they could drink themselves silly on com squeezings he did this by informing each crow separately that the bar was closed when after another hour of narration he had told each of about three hundred crows this the bar was indeed closed for lack of patronage michael was very pleased with his connivance dug wasnt he was lulled to sleep by the dullness of the tales while the huge ass plodded on he woke amidst the tale of mother hen and her sons vim and vigor exactly what kind of a trial these cocky youngsters were to ms hen he was never to learn because he realized that they were approaching a castle the party had arrived thank goodness the good magicians castle he exclaimed waking piers anthony demons dont dream jenny sammy and sherlock who it seemed had been just as bored as he with the endless tales they slid down to the ground flexing the dullness out of their legs no this is castle roogna the ass said surprised flicking several tails so it is jenny said recognizing it theres the orchard and the zombie graveyard but we were supposed to go to the good magicians castle dug protested by no means the ass demurred i was going to casde roogna but you agreed to take us to the good magicians castle dug was adding annoyance to his confusion hee haw you asked could i take you mere and i agreed i could i did not say i would and you did not ask me to so i came here dug realized that he had been had by the ass there had been no definite commitment it had been as it were a handshake agreement not worth the paper it was written on and the ass had told them such continuously dull tales that all three of them had fallen asleep and been unable to correct the route when it went wrong jenny elf would have recognized the wrong direction and acted to correct it certainly sammy cat could have found the way to the right castle had he too not been lulled into sleep but nobody could have remained awake for he whole of that barrage of asinine tales dug felt like a fool moon and a real country rubella being the victim of this fait accompli the demoness metria appeared oh too bad she said silkily i see that your companion has let you down and allowed you to be delivered to the wrong castle how unfortunate when you could so readily have had a more competent companion she inhaled again allowing her full blouse to turn translucent not far from dugs face hee haw haw the ass brayed gustily jenny looked as if she were about to speak a word not properly in the juvenile lexicon dug saved her the trou ble by taking action he knew he would regret he swung a fist at the demoness face naturally his hand passed right through metrias head without resistance then she stepped into him and planted a too too solid kiss on his mouth then she faded into smoke and drifted away on the nearest vagrant breeze she had had her revenge dug realized that he had lost this challenge fortunately it had not been a game challenge just the mischief of a jealous fantasy female there was no point in belaboring it hed just have to get back on track and get where he was going and hope he wasnt too late whats the fastest way to the good magicians castle he asked be sensible man sherlock said shes there already you need to figure out where shes going from there hes right jenny said and the best place to ask is castle roogna you figure the king will know oh we shouldnt bother king dor about this jenny said i was thinkingwell i cant say right now but maybe it will work out dug looked at her curiously you cant say what you expect to happen she fidgeted its a special situation im doing my best really i am dug looked at sherlock who shrugged there was no question that jenny meant well but was she competent dug couldnt see how this could concern the dread adult conspiracy she was so concerned about and couldnt think of any other reason for her to be evasive but if she did have a worthwhile notion he needed it okay lead the way jenny gladly obliged she led them by assorted fruit trees to the moat where the huge horrendous moat monster eyed them souffle jenny exclaimed what are you doing here the monster hissed piers anthony oh youre here to babysit the twins wheres electra the monster hissed again oh she and dolph are off visiting the isle of view what would they be doing there you know he cant tell you that sherlock said jenny was abashed thats right he cant she faced the monster again this is dug who is a player in the game and this is sherlock of the black wave theyre friends souffle serpent nodded and swam back across the moat jenny led the way over the drawbridge dug wondered whether she had made up the dialogue with the monster who had perhaps recognized her by smell and accepted her then he saw two little children hardly more than babies in pink bassinets at the edge of the moat the monster was indeed watching them but is that safe he asked that monster could gulp them down in an instant as safe as anywhere jenny said nobody will bother them with souffle on guard they like him and he likes them he hasnt had much chance to play with royal children recently dug could appreciate why not i gather that electra is their mother who is she i seem to remember you saying something about blue jeans on a princess princess electra is prince dolphs wife she was caught by a curse meant for a princess and slept for much of a thousand years until prince doiph kissed her awake now she is a princess so maybe the curse knew what it was doing the twins are dawn and eve when they get old enough to talk dawn will be able to tell anything about any living thing and eve will be able to tell anything about any inanimate thing those are good talents dug said yes they are magicianclass talents such magic runs in the royal line i demons dont dream they came to the main door it was open dug wondered at this easy access to the leading castle of the land but with a moat monster on guard maybe it made sense a young woman appeared she had jadegreen hair and aquagreen eyes hi ivy jenny said im ida the woman said oh i keep confusing you two jenny turned to the others this is dug who is in the game im his companion this is sherlock who is a member of the black wave then after a pause this is princess ida ivys twin sister dug was taken aback he didnt know what to say to a princess fortunately sherlock did nice to meet you princess we met princess nada naga before dug realized that he hadnt thought of nada that way despite being frustrated by her princessly liabilities why should he be abashed here when he hadnt been with nada oh yes she and ivy are best friends ida said brightly i am here to learn the ways of princesses because i didnt know i was one until recently what are you here for sherlock im looking for a place for my people to settle i figure theres bound to be somewhere where were needed oh im sure there is ida agreed brightly she turned to dug i did not know that castle roogna was participating in the game why did you come here i was an ass dug said i mean i let an ass fool me into going to the wrong place now i just have to believe that there is some way to do what i have to do oh im sure there is ida said exactly as she had with sherlock she seemed to be a very positive person thats wonderful jenny exclaimed dug and sherlock looked at her its wonderful that the princess is being polite to us dug asked oh princesses are always polite ida said she means that shes glad that both of you will succeed in your quests piers anthony no offense princess but how can you know that sherlock inquired it is my talent ida explained the idea when i have an idea it comes true but it has to originate with someone who doesnt know my talent neither of you knew you mean that just our telling you our hopes will make them come true dug asked doubtfully thats the way i hoped it would be jenny said now well just have to see how these things happen sherlock glanced at dug this as weird to you as it is to me at least dug said i didnt even say what it is i have to do its not winning the game its warning kim in time and i still dont know how to reach her but i guess theres a way there is im sure of it ida said but come in i didnt mean to keep you standing here she turned and led the way into the interior dug wondered whether things were really as positive as others chose to believe but this was a magic land so maybe things were magically positive they came to a central chamber where a man was sitting he stood as they entered ah these must be the folk i am looking for he said smiling im sure they are princess ida agreed sherlock seized the moment if youre looking for neighbors as a matter of fact we are the man said we would like several hundred men women and children to colonize the fringe of lake ogrechobee and keep it civilized we are too busy with our plays to take proper time with it but most other xanthians are too busy with their own pursuits to tackle a chore like that he paused im curtis curse friend here on a recruiting mission the curse fiendsuh friends are all right jenny murmured they have a long history the man glanced at her so do the elves but i never before saw one your size demons dont dream do you care about the color of those men women and children sherlock inquired cautiously of course we prefer that they not be green because they would get lost in the vegetation as well as getting confused with the chobees swimming in the lake well we have several hundred black people up in the isthmus who are looking for a home but its quite a journey this far what with the gap chasm and all and i believe lake ogrechobee is farther south it could take some time for them to get there do you care about cursing sherlock looked at him sidelong do you curse without cause only to protect ourselves or to clear rubbish curtis paused i trust you realize that we are talking about explosive magical curses not harpy talk right no fowl language we feel about curses the way we do about arrows we dont want them hurled at us from ambush we just want to mind our business and get along with our neighbors we have a way for you to travel curtis said we have some magic bubble jars we traded for each bubble will hold one large person or two small ones and will float safely to the destination named for it it would take about one day for a string of bubbles to cross xanth sherlock stuck out his hand i think we got a deal curtis took it i was sure we would he brought out a little bottle oops this ones almost empty theres only enough for two bubbles left he fished in his pocket for another may i have that one jenny asked i know someone who could use it curtis shrugged and gave it to her he brought out another for sherlock this will make several hundred bubbles if used carefully simply blow a bubble with this bubblering and have a person step into it in the first minute before it sets then tell it where to go dont touch it from outside until it gets there well have a man waiting piers anthony at lake ogrechobee to pop the first one after that you can handle them yourselves sherlock turned to dug it seems that my quest is done ill be going back to the isthmus with this bottle as soon as i know you are okay i will blow a bubble to carry you to the isthmus as soon as you are ready curds said you might as well go now dug said you have been a great help to me and you dont owe me anything no i want to see it through if my solution was here yours must be too we just have to find it well we might ask a magic mirror jenny suggested i will fetch one ida said hurrying off thats one nice young woman even if she is a princess curtis said i came here to explain my mission hoping that the answer would be here and she was very positive i had this idea that maybe id find some colonists today and she agreed she must have known you were coming we didnt know we were coming here dug said it was an accident then he remembered how the demoness metria had tricked them i think ida returned with an ordinary mirror ask this she said to dug you dont have to rhyme but it helps dug pondered rhymes mirror mirror in my hand where is kim in this land a picture formed a green melon that was all shes in a melon dug asked perplexed thats a gourd jenny said shes gone to the hypnogourd oh thats an adventure ive heard references to some kind of gourd dug said but how can a person be in one its a whole nother realm jenny explained you just look in the peephole and youre there ill go with you and sammy will find kim but i warn you this will be a weird adventure weirder than what ive seen already dug asked dis demons dont dream believingly weirder than having a ninetailed ass make an ass of me much she looked at sherlock so i guess you dont need to wait any longer well get gourds here and that will be it you sure sherlock asked oh yes obviously the prize is in the gourd realm so shell either win it or lose it and her game will be over okay sherlock extended his hand and dug shook it its been great knowing you dug and if youre ever traveling around lake ogrechobee ill drop by dug said suddenly sorry to see the man go i just want to say i know sherlock wasnt any more for emotional display than dug was we do have gourds in a garden near the castle ida said we shall bring three in for you and jenny and sammy thanks dug said his mouth felt dry prize kirn looked around the place she least wanted to enter was the boneyard so this was surely where the prize was hidden so she nerved herself and marched forward bubbles stayed right with her nervously close the dog shared her apprehension about this place kirn knew that there really wasnt anything to fear from bones they were dead so were no more dangerous than stones or chips of wood even with magic they shouldnt be fearsome because they formed into characters like marrow in any event this was the dream realm where nothing was truly physical a dream in a fantasy land in the game which was all imaginary to begin with still she felt a superstitious chill she was glad she had bubbles and nada for company marrow had disappeared but she knew he would turn up again and in a guise intended to repel her she braced herself for the show meanwhile the landscape was bad enough it was dark and growing darker a monstrous gibbous moon emerged demons dont dream from behind a cloudand the moon was bone white with bony pocks in fact it looked like one big bone that very word gibbous had always made her flinch though she knew that all it meant was rounded more than half full it had nothing to do with gibbons which werent bad animals anyway but the moon was always gibbous when something awful was going to happen such as a poor girl getting murdered or a vampire striking careful nada murmured kim looked she had almost walked into a pool because she had been looking at the moon instead of where she was going the water was dark and looked almost slimy as if pus had oozed into it and turned it to jelly ugh where had she gotten a notion like that there was something under the water kinn peeredand saw bones and perhaps pieces of attached flesh as she looked they seemed to move double ugh she averted her gaze and walked on they crested a hill and saw a sinister valley in the most dismal depths of it squatted a truly ugly castle the moon by the alchemy of this region was now setting behind that edifice illuminating it so that every facet of its misshapen structure showed clearly there was of course a moat and high ramparts and a portcullis and turrets and embrasures but somehow instead of seeming delightfully medieval it seemed frightening as she got closer kim saw that it was worse than she had thought the castle was not made out of wood or stone it was made of bones big bones framed the front gate and little bones filled in the crevices and sharpened bones topped the walls a rotting flag hung from a spire showing a skull and crossbones the portcullis was actually a giant skull with pointed fangs maybe the prize is not in there kim whispered but the moment she tried to turn away she discovered that there were palisades encroaching from either side channeling her in toward the castle she looked directly back and saw a foul fog swirling up over the crest of the piers anthony hill rendering visibility zero and harboring who knew what if she tried to go back through that fog she would probably stumble into the corpsefilled water there was no place to go but forward of course the closer she got the larger the castle seemed until it loomed impossibly high the big bones seemed to have been carved by a cleaver to fit their assignments and the smaller ones seemed to have been chewed on some were split lengthwise this was the kind of castle a brute ogre would fashion when in an ill mood the fluid of the moat looked even worse than the pond water even bubbles shied away from it something stirred within its noisome depths but kim didnt care to see what it was instead she scrunched up most of her remaining nerve and set foot on the bone planks of the drawbridge one of them rolled under her foot causing her to lose her balance and almost pitch into the murky water she righted herself and took another stepand another bone rolled trying to send her off to the side so she got down on her hands and kneesand felt the slickness of the surface of the bones as if they had only recently been stripped of their flesh she gritted her teeth and moved forwardthis time feeling a string or something she looked and saw it was a tendon not quite separated from the joint triple ugh she made it across the moat with bubbles crawling along beside her she stood on the bone pavement which seemed to have been formed of hipbones embedded in bone fragments and gazed at the awful entry would that giant fanged upper portcullis jaw crash down on her as she tried to enter surely it would that was what it was for she heard something rumble behind her she jumped and looked back the drawbridge was lifting gross tendons were hauling it up until it was vertical leaving no escape from the castle now she really couldnt change her mind everything about the place seems to be oneway i demons dont dream nada noted the fog the fencing the bridge you arent allowed to change your mind its victory or defeat kim agreed and i guess victory is better of course it is nada said warmly what is the point in playing the game if not to win the prize what use to explain about human feelings to a princess i suppose so kim agreed but i sort of liked just being in xanth you will be able to return and with the magic talent you win as the prize youli be able to play longer and better kim realized that she was right since she couldnt have her true hearts desire she might as well have the prize yes lets get on with it she took a step toward the portcullis bubbles whined kim stopped as far as she knew the dog had no magic she wasnt like jennys cat sammy who could find anything that didnt mean that bubbles wasnt worthwhile just that her reactions to magic effects might not be wholly accurate still she generally had reason for her concerns what is it bubbles kim inquired putting a hand on the dogs back bubbles looked up at the deadly fangs of the portcullis and her tail dropped low ohnaturally the dog did not want to enter the mouth of a monster kim took another step bubbles yelped as if someone had trodden on her tail somethings wrong here kim said you think that big mouth is going to close on us as she said it she realized it was true that was what a portcullis was a gate that came crashing down to shut out intruders maybe down on them if they moved slow it is going to come down on us its one more way to be wiped out a wipeout here would be just as final as a wipeout in xanth proper even if this was the dream realm piers anthony it must be nada agreed maybe theres another way into the castle they walked to the side but the moat quickly closed in squeezing the ground out until there was no break between the water and the bonewall there was no other entry so it has to be the portcullis kirn said maybe we can put a block on it so the fangs cant come down on us but there was nothing to use as a block maybe we can climb the wall to a window nada suggested i can climb in serpent form kim tried to get a handhold on a projecting bone but it was slippery and there was no good bone to grab above it even if she could climb the wall kim knew she would grow faint before she reached any height and probably fall off and how could the dog ever climb it so that was out she sighed i think well just have to go through the main entrance ill bet it has to be fast and right together three abreast that portcullis has to take a moment to get started so it should crash down behind us it should nada agreed they lined up ready set go kim cried and they took off they crossed the line of the gatewayand the portcullis came crashing down wham the fangs plunged into the floor at their heels the retreat was closed but they had made it through unscathed only then did kim wonder what would have happened if they had not been in perfect alignment suppose the dog had lagged behind and gotten trapped outside or worse chomped suppose the dog had run ahead and triggered the drop too soon so that it crunched the two people this had been a very risky ploy kim resolved to be more careful from now on she looked ahead and saw a dark hall leading into the center of the castle its walls were polished bones tightly inter demons dont dream woven she wasnt sure how bones could be woven but these were there was barely enough light for them to see well the hall must lead somewhere kim started to walk down itand bubbles whined magic or no magic she was coming to trust the dogs judgment there was something fishy about this passage kim looked around there was a chink in a corner and a bone fragment on the floor beneath it in due course some skeleton crew would come by and use bone paste to fasten the chip back into place bubbles went over to sniff the fragment that didnt mean anything the dog sniffed everything it was her way of getting acquainted but it reminded kim that there was always a way through in the game and usually a hint about that way through that fallen chip of bone was the only unusual thing here was it a hint kim went to pick it up it seemed quite ordinary she tried to return it to its place in the wall but it wouldnt stay she didnt have any paste with which to fasten it there she couldnt make the repair then she thought of something else this was xanth and one of the commonest forms of magic here was illusion things could seem to be what they were not or could not seem to be what they were kim took the chip of bone and sent it sliding down the hall the floor was smooth because the bones were shored by plaster or cement it was like sending a puck down a shuffleboard alley then the chip disappeared kim smiled i think weve found whats wrong with this hall she said she got down on her hands and knees again and crawled carefully forward bubbles joined her when she came to the place where the chip had disappeared she reached forwardand felt nothing the floor was gone there was a pit there the floor looked continuous but it was illusion covering the trap kim nudged up to the edge and felt deeper there piers anthony seemed to be no bottom to die pit it would have been a bad fall probably a wipeout but how was she going to get across it kim pondered im going to gamble she said she fished in her pack and found a spare pair of socks she separated them and rolled each one up into a ball then she tossed one ahead about four feet it landed and rolled on along the hall finally fetching up at the entrance to the next chamber so there is a continuation she said satisfied no more invisible pits she tossed die second sock about three feet it too landed and rolled but kim couldnt reach across the pit her questing fingers found nothing so it couldnt be much under three feet still three feet was jumpable this is like the portcullis she said well have to jump but i think we can do it singly she removed her pack and set it at the edge of the pit this is where the jump starts ill go first she looked at the dog you wait she hoped bubbles would understand she walked to the front end of the hall then she ran down it reached die pack and leaped she landed cleanly and slowed to a stop now you bubbles she called the dog ran down the hall leaped at the pack and landed where kim had she was old and solid and barely made it but her spirit was there now mark the place and toss over the pack kim said to nada then jump over yourself in this manner they traversed the hall and came to the central chamber of the castle it was huge portals opened out around it in about nine directions and more opened out from the balcony levels in the center was a big ball of bright red string as they stepped into the chamber the door to the passage slammed shut with a bonerattling jar i think i have this figured kim said somewhere in tiiis castle is the prize i have to search to find it and any door i pass through will be closed after me so i cant go demons dont dream back but maybe some of those chambers have several doors so ill mark my trail with string so ill know if ive passed that way before if i find the prize before i lock myself into a deadend chamber ill win there must be dangers along the way too nada said judging by what weve seen so far yes so this will be dicey but winnable if im smart enough and lucky enough kim considered as she went carefully to fetch the string bubbles youre the most cautious about danger you lead the way she wasnt sure the dog would understand but it was worth a try bubbles sniffed around then headed for one of the portals she paused at die entrance to the chamber waiting for kim kim tied the end of the string to a projecting bone and strung the line out behind as she went to join the dog okay bubbles you lead but be careful the dog entered the chamber but did not proceed to the center she went to the side as she did so something came down from the high ceiling it swung back and forth it was a pendulum a big sharpedged bone on a long tendon and it crossed the full chamber but it shouldnt be hard to pass if diey timed it for when it was at one end of the chamber then a second pendulum came down with another knife bone it swung opposite to the first reaching the other end so that there was no chance to pass both ends were covered however when the two sharp bones were at the edges of their swings it should be possible to run through the center and a third pendulum descended timed to swing across the center while the other two were outside but maybe they could pass a bit to the side opposite that third while the first and second were still out and a fourth going opposite to the third now everything was covered the chamber was a crisscrossing pattern of swinging bones there was no clearance at the edges the blades almost touched the walls piers anthony nada shook her head i think we had better try another chamber kirn turned backand saw that the door had quietly closed behind them again they couldnt retreat maybe we could leap over them kim asked but then she realized that the swinging tendons were almost as dangerous as the sharp bones they could catch a person and tangle her so that one of the other knives would swing back and cut her apart the only safe course was to avoid the pendulums entirely already kirns eyes were glazing no matter where she looked a pendulum was passing or about to pass there just seemed to be no way to cross safely yet there had to be a way if she could just figure it out some way to get through without blindly gambling kim shut her eyes closing out the bewildering array there were only two sets of pendulums swinging oppositely while one set touched the edges the other passed the middle she judged that each single pendulum took two seconds to complete its swing from one side to the other and that a person needed one second to get safely across the covered zone with just two pendulums that second would be available in the center or at the edge but with the four only half a second not safe she opened her eyes and studied the pattern again this time she looked at one edge and counted seconds she discovered to her surprise that a blade came near one wall every second not every half second how could this be she sketched a diagram in the dust of the floor and realized that she had made an error each single pendulum did take two seconds to swing acrossand two more to swing back that was a foursecond cycle so four pendulums reduced it to onesecond cycles she could make it she had almost allowed herself to be dazzled by the crisscrossing blades so that she was ready to give up when she didnt need to okay she said well go through singly its going to be close but possible demons dont dream but those blades nada protested alarmed are passing any given spot at onesecond intervals i think so all we have to do is pick a spot like maybe the center and dash through there right after a pair of blades has passed in fact i mink the thing to do is aim for the crossing blades theyll be moving out of the way as we come and the other two will just be starting in so it should be clear for mat second nada still looked extremely doubtful ill go first kim said and this time ill carry bubbles but i dont know how to explain to her how to time it and i dont want to risk any confusion then you can pass carrying the ball of string come on bubbles she squatted put her arms around the dog heaved her up and stood herself oh bubbles was heavy and how did the game make her feel that weight when this was all just animation on a screen it didnt matter she just had to be sure not to lose her timing kim went up to the crisscrossing blades she felt the breeze of their passing she started counting timing them one two one two as the first and second sets of pendulums passed the center then she retreated a step nerved herself and lumbered across trying to time it to come just barely after two she made it she lowered the dog to the floor feeling faint she didnt like such nervous business nada timed it similarly and came across whereupon the four pendulums slowed stopped and withdrew into the ceiling just like the pit and the pendulum kim remarked no explanation no followup they just quit when they got outsmarted they went to the next chamber this one had a pit across its center too wide to jump there was a ladderbridge formed of bones on the far side that evidently could be lowered in the manner of a drawbridge on the near side was a length of cord hanging from a ceiling beam that was all kim pondered the situation she should be able to use piers anthony the cord to snag the ladder and pull it down across the pit so they could cross but the cord was firmly tied and would not come loose she might cut itbut she could not reach high enough to cut off enough to use for this purpose she might grab hold of it and try to swing across the pit but she was afraid it wasnt strong enough to hold her weight that also prevented her from trying to climb it to the beam it could break anywhere ruining it so what use was it then her lightbulb flashed she removed her pack which was not heavy enough to break the cord and tied it to the end then she swung the pack across the pit getting the feel of it it banged into the upright ladder she swung it again this time to one side and it swung around behind the ladder hooking it and snagged but the ladder did not fall now she was in trouble the cord was out of reach how could she get hold of it then she took her ball of string she lofted that up over the near end of the cord and caught it the string was not heavy but it was strong enough to pull the cord down just within reach of her hand then she pulled on the cord until the snagged pack brought it crashing down across the pit now they could cross the next chamber was worse the moment they tried to enter it the ceiling started descending and the floor ascended bom surfaces had knifepointed bones sticking out pity the poor person who tried to scramble through there when they backed off the floor and ceiling stopped moving then retreated ready to trap the next unwary person kim wondered why they didnt just keep going until they met halfway up and closed off the chamber could that be a clue could it be that the way wasnt closed until the person was actually caught between those jaws she took her pack and set it on the edge of the chamber demons dont dream floor the floor rose and the ceiling dropped just before they crunched the pack kim pulled it away she ducked down and peered under the floor it had been pushed up by a column of bones she could see right by that column to the next chamber there was her way throughunder the floor then the floor dropped because there was nothing on it the route disappeared she returned the pack to the floor nada take this off just before it gets crunched kim said then as the floor rose she ducked down and scrambled under it come on bubbles she cried nada seemed startled by the suddenness and daring of kirns action but she recovered in time to grab the pack now hurl it across to me kim said before the floor subsides ill use it from this end to raise the floor for you the next chamber had a bone stair whose steps moved down when stepped on so it was impossible to make progress kim finally managed to fool it by facing backward so that it thought she was trying to walk down and carried her back to what it thought was her starting place the top in similar manner they wended their way through one chamber after another avoiding any where the red string already crossed until they were high in the castle there seemed to be only one chamber remaining beyond it they could see a glowing golden chest that had to be the prize but the intervening chamber had a sharply sloping floor slippery slick anyone trying to cross it would be dumped into one of this castles patented bottomless pits what was the way through kim gazed out the bone window she saw that she was now three stories up overlooking the lifted drawbridge the landscape was just as gloomy as before so why was she staring at it she analyzed her motive she was foolishly hoping that the other player dug would show up because this was piers anthony really the last chance if she were to see him again she had no idea where he lived in mundania so would be unable to locate him there even if he had any slight interest in her then she saw something on the horizon someone was coming along the dreary path it was a small figure chasing a smaller animal that must be jenny dug is coming kim said excited i can assume serpent form nada said i can grab onto a post with my teeth and you can swing across on my tail sammy cat must have found the way kim said now theyll be here too you must act quickly before dug gets your prize nada said but kim dallied watching the approaching trio she saw the ugly fog roiling up behind them herding them and the palisades funneling them in toward the castle then she did something absolutely foolish she fished in her pack for a hankie and waved it out the window just as if she were a maiden in distress and dug saw it kim he cried faintly she thrilled to the sound dug she called back wait right there dont do anything what lovely words ill wait she cried gladly what are you doing nada demanded the prize is within your grasp and youre letting him catch up yes kim said dreamily i like him and i wont get a chance to see him once the game is over so if we can talk if hes interested all he wants is to get the prize nada said he can have it kim said i just want to exchange phone numbers before we leave the game i was afraid he wouldnt get here in time as she watched the little group below charged to the castle the drawbridge was up but that didnt stop them cat elf and young man plunged into the grimy moat and swam across apparently there wasnt a moat monster or demons dont dream else sammy knew that it was on the far side of the castle at the moment and couldnt get them what an act of reckless daring i was mistaken nada said grimly i believe he wants more than the prize he wants me now they were at the base of the wall the cat still led the way finding a section to climb digging his little claws into the softening bones there seemed to be handholds mere that werent closer to the drawbridge in fact it looked as if there were an inset ladder making it much easier for them to climb the wall avoiding all the hazards of the interior dug followed the other two hauling himself along he tilted back his head and saw her peering down kim dont move from that spot theres something i have to tell you he wanted to tell her something he was interested after all oh yes she breathed then something registered she turned back to face nada what he chose me as his companion because he liked my looks nada said grimly he wanted to see my body but he was too sneaky about it and almost got put out of me game yes so he lost interest kim agreed but im not a princess and by mis time he will have learned that the companions too are a challenge a player may do anything with a companion he desires if he is able to find the correct way it is a matter of approach if he treats his companion with proper respect he can earn her respect he can force her cooperation with the right words so if he has found the appropriate manner to approach me kim suffered a sudden flare of jealousy dug could get at this beautiful luscious princess what the hell would he want with a nothing girl like kim then the prizeand you she said appalled i have no way to prevent it nada said seriously if he gets you to trade back companions and if he knows piers anthony the key dialogue so you must act swiftly before he gets here i will not be able to advise you if you trade kim torn by doubt gazed down again from the window the cat was almost there with jenny not far behind and dug close behind her what do you want dug she asked nada he gasped i must trade her back from you because oh kim cried her lingering hope dashed he was just another selfish careless horny teenage boy she was tempted to throw her pack down on his head but it wasnt handy she turned away from the window lets go for the prize nada nada immediately assumed serpent form and slithered from her clothing she lunged at the bone beam above the tilting floor and caught it with her teeth her body slid down across the floor but in a moment she curled her tail up for kim to grab bubbles whined kim hesitated was something wrong here it occurred to her that she should have to solve the riddle of the chamber herself rather than letting her companion solve it for her yet she could appreciate why nada did not want dug to recover her as his companion she glanced back hearing something the cat appeared in the window and jumped to the floor jenny elfs head was next wait kim jenny cried of course jenny now served dug and would help him do whatever he wanted to do even if that meant getting herself traded back jenny could not be trusted while she was dugs companion kim caught hold of nadas tail bracing herself for the sliding swing across the slanted floor would she be able to catch hold of the far edge and haul herself up to the golden chest bubbles whined again her tail curled ail the way under her body the dog was really upset dont worry bubbles kim said im not leaving you im just crossing to demons dont dream the prize but now she wondered what would happen to the dog when kim won and left the game suddenly she was overwhelmed by realization oh bubbles i dont want to leave you she cried dropping nadas tail so that she could hug the dog but how can i take you with me what will become of you you can take her jenny said theres a way a way hope flared i have a jar of bubbles like die one you got her from i can give it to you if you take me back as your companion it was another ploy to make her trade furious kim caught nadas tail again and stepped into the slanting chamber she was starting to swing down then dug was there tackling her around the waist before the serpent could take her weight the elf had distracted her just long enough to get caught let me go kim cried struggling to twist out of his grasp so she could swing across half her body was hanging over the edge while dugs arms were wrapped around her thighs and waist if she could just wriggle free but he hauled her back and into him using his strength to make her captive kim he cried ive got to tell you i dont want to listen she cried letting go of the serpents tail so she could flail at him with her hands i was willing to let you have the prize but no you had to i dont care about the prize he said pinning her arms in any other circumstances she would have been glad to have him hugging her this close you can have it i know thats what you came for all i want is to tell you that you want princess nada naga for more than just guidance she finished for him oh i hate you he looked surprised no i only want to talk to you to save you from me foolish hope flared again its me you want yes to explain piers anthony oh she exclaimed overcome with opposite emotion her feelings were swinging like a pendulum really really i was afraid i wouldnt be able to catch you before oh yes she cried she lifted her head and kissed him hard on the mouth it was the most wonderful sensation i feel that way about you too dug my number is area code tee zero zero whats yours he looked confused ii mean i had to tell you that nadas a false companion she was about to drop you down the hole you can trade back and jenny will help you get the prize it wasnt right to let you get torpedoed by what was meant for me she was stunned youyou came to warn me he let her go yes i was afraid i wouldnt reach you in time id never forgive myself if you lost your prize because of me she realized that it was cue there had been little things about nada and the way bubbles had reactedof course she was a false companion dug had done the natural decent thing when he figured it out he could nullify nada knowing her nature but he wouldnt bother because he wasnt even trying for the prize maybe hed just experiment to see how far the princess would go before he got washed out of the game and kirn had assumed that it was something else she felt the greatgrandmother of all blushes washing over her face turning it glaring red she covered her face with her hands thank you she said in as controlled a voice as she could manage i willi will trade back companions good he said he caught nadas tail with one hand let go princess and ill haul you in unless you prefer to drop down the hole you meant for kirn the serpent let go of the beam and dug did haul it in then he turned his back change and get dressed i dont care if you shove me in the hole you are my companion now and you cant touch kim demons dont dream nada changed becoming a naked woman getting quickly into her doming kim suppressed a surge of jealousy for her splendid proportions and complexion now i will help you jenny said i have found a bubble maker that can make two bubbles you can use the first bubble to float safely across then youll be able to use the last bubble to go home she showed the jar why thats a regular bubble mix kim said children use them to blow soap bubbles no these are magic bubbles big enough to hold people sherlock is using them to carry the black wave to lake ogrechobee where they will settle as neighbors to the curse fiendsi mean curse friends im glad that worked out kim said those must be the same type of bubbles i found bubbles in she patted the dog yes they are used to carry people or things where they want to go so they are just what you need now no kim said firmly i must find my own way to the prize for one thing it gave her something to focus on so that she could try to forget her chagrin at her misunderstanding of dugs motive i thank you jenny but i want to do this myself thats good jenny agreed kim studied the situation the floor tilted so sharply that a fly would barely be able to cling to it the space was too wide for her to jump she saw a notch where the floor would fit if it were level evidently it was hinged maybe the last player had stepped on it and been dumped when it swung down she reached down and around finding the edge of the tilting floor sure enough her hand found its underside she pulledand the floor came up she was swinging it back to its proper position it was surprisingly light in a moment she had pulled it level and clicked it into place but she knew she couldnt trust it how could she make sure it would support her weight go across it dug nada said you can still win piers anthony you disgust me dug said first because you are false youre still trying to make me get dumped second because i wouldnt take that prize anyway its kirns to take she deserves to win that prize he really was a decent person kim knew if only she cut off the thought she felt around the notchand found a swinging bone that would lock the floor into place now it could be used she looked at dug i dont need that prize either she said if you would like it you can have it you can take it dug nada said she doesnt want it he shook his head you know we dont have the right attitude about this game were supposed to be scrambling madly for the prize kim had wanted the prize but that desire had faded after she met dug now that she had thoroughly embarrassed herself in that respect what else was there but the prize i suppose somebody should take it she said she stepped out on the chamber floor half expecting it to give way and drop her into the hole but it remained firm kim paused and looked back dug was standing there watching her nada was facing away her head hanging jenny was about to follow kim there was something wrong here but kim couldnt figure out what it was there was an expectancy a tension as if all hell were about to break loose what was going to happen and who knew it she started to turn back toward the prize then nada moved the woman flung herself toward the notch with its fastenerbone but sammy cat leaped there first covering it and dug tackled nada much the way he had tackled kim before the serpent princess was brought up short of the bone get on across dug cried before she kim jumped forward and picked up the prize box just as nada became a huge serpent kim opened the box as the serpent slithered out of dugs grasp and toward her demons dont dream kim reached in to take the little globe inside as the serpents head came up to knock the box from her hand her hand glowed painlessly the globe had disappeared the serpent saw the glow and fell as if struck am your talent a voice said in kirns head am the talent of erasure when you return to xanth you will be able to erase anything you choose try me now unsure how this applied kim reached out and stroked her hand across a section of the wall as if erasing chalk on a blackboard the wall disappeared behind her hand showing the sky beyond the castle wall she stared anything she asked anything living or inanimate use me wisely wisely she didnt want to use this at all this was a destructive talent no you may cancel my effect by reversing the stroke use the back of your hand kim stroked her hand back across the open section with her palm toward her and the wall reappeared except for one sliver her hand missed still this power frightened her she didnt want to be forever erasing innocent things then she got smart she willed the talent to turn off then stroked her hand back across the wall nothing happened she willed it on again and touched the wall with one finger a fingersized hole appeared she willed it off and stroked her backhand across the hole nothing happened she willed it on and made the same reverse stroke this time the hole filled in she had it under control this was a tool as well as a weapon a talent of phenomenal power when she learned to use it properly but for now she didnt want to use it at all she returned her attention to the others nada had reverted to her normal form that of a serpent with a human head and was sobbing i didnt want to do it nada said i didnt want to be false but i had no choice but why did you try to be false to me when you were dugs companion kim asked because he wanted you to win piers anthony kirn looked at dug who nodded but she wasnt satisfied theres got to be more of it than that what arent you telling us to her surprise nada answered it really doesnt matter now that the issue has been decided i dont have to be false any more i will tell you the whole truth whats gone before was a halftruth dug asked nada smiled becoming beautiful again not even a quartertruth dug the demon etar was trying to take over this land from the demon x th they made the decision in their normal fashion they gambled they set up the game and chose characters if xcan s player won the prize he won the wager if e th s player won he did but earth used a devious ploy he sabotaged his own player and arranged for him to have a false companion when he returned then he had the two players exchange companions in this manner he thought to ensure that x th s player lost even if e ths player did not reach the prize first it would be at least a tie requiring another game to settle the issue when that ploy failed because of the willfulness of earths player the false demon made me act kim was too surprised to speak but dug did what would have happened if the other demon had won if i had gotten the prize the magic of xanth would have been lost and it would have become just like mundania more tears squeezed from nadas eyes oh im glad i didnt succeed it was the most horrible thing but i had to do everything i could to make you lose kim im so mortified kim found her voice there was a whole lot more riding on this than i knew xanth without magic she couldnt finish more than i knew too dug agreed i just wanted to play fair he looked at kim well you better get on home with your prize i guess youll be a sorceress next time you play yes you must go jenny agreed the game is about demons dont dream to fade out and we companions will return to our normal pursuits but what will become of bubbles kim asked i cant just leave her here she sat down and hugged the dog then take her with you jenny said i can do that i can take her toto mundania shes a mundane dog but in mundania shell die in a year or so kim said shes old here in xanth she can live because of the magic i dont want to condemn her to death because of my own selfishness because she realized that that was the case she wanted bubbles with her save the second bubble in the bottle jenny said when you cant keep her in mundania any more send her back to xanth to one of the folk she likes like ma anathe nada said or wira kim felt a great relief oh ill do that oh bubbles i can keep you with me bubbles licked her face i hope you can forgive me nada said to dug i would much rather have been your fair companion as i was the first time if you will accept my apology what a gourdstyle apology he asked smiling yes she put her arms around him and kissed him passionately kim despairingly jealous could only busy herself with her own business she brought out the bottle she found the little blower and dipped it in the fluid she brought it out capped the bottle and blew a bubble formed it expanded until it became large enough for both girl and dog she and bubbles stepped into it take us home kim said the bubble lifted it floated to the castle wall and through it kim had only an instant to look back to see jenny elf waving goodbye then they were out floating over the landscape and leaving the bone castle behind the scene faded and the chamber in the good magicians castle appeared there lay bubbles nada and kim piers anthony herself looking into the peepholes of the gourds the bubble settled over the girl and dog and the two of them merged with their other forms when the bubble lifted only nada remained there they floated out the window and high into the air xanth spread out below them then was lost under a screen of clouds there was a shudder the scene changed again kirn blinked she was sitting in her room before her computer screen which had gone blank she was out of the game back in reality it had all been the game now she had to face the mundane grind of schoolwork and dullness who would believe the adventure she had had they would say it was just a game as if her feelings didnt count she felt an overwhelming grief something nuzzled her hand she looked down there was bubbles kim got down and hugged the dog again oh bubbles i asked for what i most desiredand i got it it was you to keep somehow the magic had reached out of the game and given her this yet that was not quite true there had been another thing she wanted but what was the point in brooding about that in or out of the game she remained just a plain girl the phone rang startled kim answered it now dont hang up on me kim a familiar voice said its dug i know i made a real ass of myself ive been good at that recently but i figured i might as well go wholehog or whatever pun fits im really sorry about what happenedi mean when you saidand i never picked up on kim felt the flush coming to her face again thats all right dug i shouldnt have i mean ive always been stupid about girls which is why im out a girlfriend now but i was really out to lunch on that one so i called to apologize and demons dont dream there is no need kim said i was the one who made the mistake her face was burning and when you kissed me i almost freaked out would he never give over ii kim said trying to find some way to get away from her shame but you know id be a fool to judge by one kiss dug continued relentlessly so if you can forgive me for being a blockhead id like to try for more like maybe a gourdstyle apology that is i meanwell how about a date so we can start really getting to know each other you know to be sure its not just a fluke i mean i dont know anything about you really except that you sure can kiss better than nada does and youre real andoh come on kim give me a chance i can be an okay guy once you get my attention and you sure did that is it a date yes kim breathed realizing that she had after all gotten all of what she most desired dog and boy the good magician had known
