emulate the rollo books sure a terrible time i was out o the way over the sea over the sea till i come to ireland one sunny day betther for me betther for me the first time me fut got the feel o the ground i was strollin along in an irish city that hasnt its aquil the world around for the air that is sweet an the girls that are pretty moira oneill dublin ocarolans private hotel it is the most absurd thing in the world that salemina francesca and i should be in ireland together that any three spinsters should be fellowtravellers is not in itself extraordinary and so our former journeyings in england and scotland could hardly be described as eccentric in any way but now that i am a matron and francesca is shortly to be married it is odd to say the least to see us cosily ensconced in a private sittingroom of a dublin hotel the table laid for three and not a vestige of a man anywhere to be seen where one might ask if he knew the antecedent circumstances are miss hamiltons american spouse and miss monroes scottish lover francesca had passed most of the winter in scotland her indulgent parent had given his consent to her marriage with a scotsman but insisted that she take a year to make up her mind as to which particular one memories of her past flirtations divagations plans for a life of single blessedness all conspired to make him incredulous and the loyal salemina feeling some responsibility in the matter had elected to remain by francescas side during the time when her affections were supposed to be crystallising into some permanent form it was natural enough that my husband and i should spend the first summer of our married life abroad for we had been accustomed to do this before we met a period that we always allude to as the dark ages but no sooner had we arrived in edinburgh and no sooner had my husband persuaded our two friends to join us in a long delicious irish holiday than he was compelled to return to america for a month or so i think you must number among your acquaintances such a man as mr william beresford whose wife i have the honour to be physically the type is vigorous or has the appearance and gives the impression of being vigorous because it has never the time to be otherwise since it is always engaged in nursing its ailing or decrepit relatives intellectually it is full of vitality any mind grows when it is exercised and the brain that has to settle all its own affairs and all the affairs of its friends and acquaintances could never lack energy spiritually it is almost too good for earth and any woman who lives in the house with it has moments of despondency and selfchastisement in which she fears that heaven may prove all too small to contain the perfect being and its unregenerate family as well financially it has at least a moderate bank account that is it is never penniless indeed it can never afford to be because it is peremptory that it should possess funds in order to disburse them to needier brothers there is never an hour when mr william beresford is not signing notes and bonds and drafts for less fortunate men giving small loans just to help a fellow over a hard place educating friends children starting them in business or securing appointments for them the widow and the fatherless have worn such an obvious path to his office and residence that no bereaved person could possibly lose his way and as a matter of fact no one of them ever does this special journey of his to america has been made necessary because first his cousins widow has been defrauded of a large sum by her man of business and second his college chum and dearest friend has just died in chicago after appointing him executor of his estate and guardian of his only child the wording of the will is as a sacred charge and with full power incidentally as it were one of his junior partners has been ordered a long sea voyage and another has to go somewhere for mud baths the junior partners were my idea and were suggested solely that their senior might be left more or less free from business care but it was impossible that willie should have selected sound robust partners his tastes do not incline him in the direction of selfish ease accordingly he chose two delightful estimable frail gentlemen who needed comfortable incomes in conjunction with light duties i am railing at my husband for all this but i love him for it just the same and it shows why the table is laid for three salemina i said extending my slipper toe to the glowing peat which by extraordinary effort had been brought up from the hotel kitchen as a bit of local colour it is ridiculous that we three women should be in ireland together its the sort of thing that happens in a book and of which we say that it could never occur in real life three persons do not spend successive seasons in england scotland and ireland unless they are writing an itinerary of the british isles the situation is possible certainly but it isnt simple or natural or probable we are behaving precisely like characters in fiction who having been popular in the first volume are exploited again and again until their popularity wanes we are like the trotty books or the elsie dinmore series england was our first volume scotland our second and here we are if you please about to live a third volume in ireland we fall in love we marry and are given in marriage we promote and take part in international alliances but when the curtain goes up again our accumulations acquisitions whatever you choose to call them have disappeared we are not to the superficial eye the spinsterphilanthropist the bride to be the wife of a year we are the same old salemina francesca and penelope it is so dramatic that my husband should be called to america as a woman i miss him and need him as a character i am much better single i dont suppose publishers like married heroines any more than managers like married leading ladies then how entirely proper it is that ronald macdonald cannot leave his new parish in the highlands the one my husband belongs to the first volume francescas lover to the second and good gracious salemina dont you see the inference i may be dull she replied but i confess i do not we are three who is three that is not good english but i repeat with different emphasis we are three i fell in love in england francesca fell in love in scotland and here i paused watching the blush mount rosily to saleminas grey hair pink is very becoming to grey and that we always say accounts more satisfactorily for saleminas frequent blushes than her modesty which is about of the usual sort your argument is interesting and even ingenious she replied but i fail to see my responsibility if you persist in thinking of me as a character in fiction i shall rebel i am not the stuff of which heroines are made besides i would never appear in anything so cheap and obvious as a series and the threevolume novel is as much out of fashion as the rollo books but we are unconscious heroines you understand i explained while we were experiencing our experiences we did not notice them but they have attained by degrees a sufficient bulk so that they are visible to the naked eye we can look back now and perceive the path we have travelled it isnt retrospect i object to but anticipation she retorted not history but prophecy it is one thing to gaze sentimentally at the road you have travelled quite another to conjure up impossible pictures of the future salemina calls herself a trifle over forty but i am not certain of her age and think perhaps that she is uncertain herself she has good reason to forget it and so have we of course she could consult the bible family record daily but if she consulted her lookingglass afterward the one impression would always nullify the other her hair is silvered it is true but that is so clearly a trick of nature that it makes her look younger rather than older francesca came into the room just here i said a moment ago that she was the same old francesca but i was wrong she is softening sweetening expanding in a word blooming not only this but ronald macdonalds likeness has been stamped upon her in some magical way so that although she has not lost her own personality she seems to have added a reflection of his in the glimpses of herself her views feelings opinions convictions which she gives us in a kind of solution as it were there are always traces of ronald macdonald or to be more poetical he seems to have bent over the crystal pool and his image is reflected there you remember in new england they allude to a bride as she that was a soandso in my private interviews with salemina i now habitually allude to francesca as she that was a monroe it is so significant of her present state of absorption several times this week i have been obliged to inquire was i by any chance as absentminded and dull in pettybaw as francesca is under the same circumstances in dublin quite duller if anything these candid replies being uttered in cheerful unison i change the subject but cannot resist telling them both casually that the building of the royal dublin society is in kildare street just three minutes from ocarolans and that i have noticed it is for the promotion of husbandry and other useful arts and sciences chapter ii irish itineraries and i will make my journey if life and health but stand unto that pleasant country that fresh and fragrant strand and leave your boasted braveries your wealth and high command for the fair hills of holy ireland sir samuel ferguson our mutual relations have changed little notwithstanding that betrothals and marriages have intervened and in spite of the fact that salemina has grown a year younger a mysterious feat that she has accomplished on each anniversary of her birth since the forming of our alliance it is many months since we travelled together in scotland but on entering this very room in dublin the other day we proceeded to show our several individualities as usual i going to the window to see the view francesca consulting the placard on the door for hours of table dhote and salemina walking to the grate and lifting the ugly little paper screen to say there is a fire laid how nice as the matron i have been promoted to a nominal charge of the travelling arrangements therefore while the others drive or sail read or write i am buried in murrays handbook or immersed in maps when i sleep my dreams are spotted starred notched and lined with hieroglyphics circles horizontal dashes long lines and black dots signifying hotels coach and rail routes and tramways all this would have been done by himself with the greatest ease in the world in the humbler walks of irish life the head of the house if he is of the proper sort is called himself and it is in the shadow of this stately title that my ulysses will appear in this chronicle i am quite sure i do not believe in the inferiority of woman but i have a feeling that a man is a trifle superior in practical affairs if i am in doubt and there is no husband brother or cousin near from whom to seek advice i instinctively ask the butler or the coachman rather than a female friend also when a female friend has consulted the bradshaw in my behalf i slip out and seek confirmation from the butchers boy or the milkman himself would have laid out all our journeyings for us and we should have gone placidly along in wellordered paths as it is we are already pledged to do the most absurd and unusual things and ireland bids fair to be seen in the most topsyturvy helterskelter fashion imaginable francescas propositions are especially nonsensical being provocative of fruitless discussion and adding absolutely nothing to the sum of human intelligence why not start without any special route in view and visit the towns with which we already have familiar associations she asked we should have all sorts of experiences by the way and be free from the blighting influences of a definite purpose who that has ever travelled fails to call to mind certain images when the names of cities come up in general conversation if bologna brussels or lima is mentioned i think at once of sausages sprouts and beans and it gives me a feeling of friendly intimacy i remember neufchatel and cheddar by their cheeses dorking and cochin china by their hens whitby by its jet or york by its hams so that i am never wholly ignorant of places and their subtle associations that method appeals strongly to the fancy said salemina drily what subtle associations have you already established in ireland let me see she responded thoughtfully the list is not a long one limerick and carrickmacross for lace shandon for the bells blarney and donnybrook for the stone and the fair kilkenny for the cats and balbriggan for the stockings you are sordid this morning reproved salemina it would be better if you remembered limerick by the famous siege and balbriggan as the place where king william encamped with his army after the battle of the boyne ive studied the songwriters more than the histories and geographies i said so i should like to go to bray and look up the vicar then to coleraine to see where kitty broke the famous pitcher or to tara where the harp that once or to athlone where dwelt widow malone ochone and so on just start with an armful of tom moores poems and lovers and fergusons and yes i added generously some of the nice moderns and visit the scenes theyve written about and be disappointed quoth francesca cynically poets see everything by the light that never was on sea or land still i wont deny that they help the blind and i should rather like to know if there are still any nora creinas and sweet peggies and pretty girls milking their cows i am very anxious to visit as many of the round towers as possible said salemina when i was a girl of seventeen i had a very dear friend a young irishman who has since become a wellknown antiquary and archaeologist he was a student and afterwards i think a professor here in trinity college but i have not heard from him for many years dont look him up darling pleaded francesca you are so much our superior now that we positively must protect you from all elevating influences i wont insist on the round towers smiled salemina and i think penelopes idea a delightful one we might add to it a sort of literary pilgrimage to the homes and haunts of irelands famous writers i didnt know that she had any interrupted francesca this is a favourite method of conversation with that spoiled young person it seems to appeal to her in three different ways she likes to belittle herself she likes to shock salemina and she likes to have information given her on the spot in some succinct portable convenient form oh she continued apologetically of course there are dean swift and thomas moore and charles lever and i added certain minor authors named goldsmith sterne steele and samuel lover and bishop berkeley and brinsley sheridan and maria edgeworth and father prout continued salemina and certain great speechmakers like burke and grattan and curran and how delightful to visit all the places connected with stella and vanessa and the spot where spenser wrote the faerie queene nor own a land on earth but one were paddies and no more sang francesca you will be telling me in a moment that thomas carlyle was born in skereenarinka and that shakespeare wrote romeo and juliet in coolagarranoe for she had drawn the guidebook toward her and made good use of it let us do the literary pilgrimage certainly before we leave ireland but suppose we begin with something less intellectual this is the most pugnacious map i ever gazed upon all the names seem to begin or end with kill bally whack shock or knock no wonder the irish make good soldiers suppose we start with a sanguinary trip to the kill places so that i can tell any timid americans i meet in travelling that i have been to kilmacow and to kilmacthomas and am going tomorrow to kilmore and the next day to kilumaule i think that must have been said before i objected it is so obvious that its not unlikely she rejoined then let us simply agree to go afterwards to see all the bally places from ballydehob on the south to ballycastle or ballymoney on the north and from ballynahinch or ballywilliam on the east to ballyvaughan or ballybunnion on the west and passing through in transit ballyragget ballysadare ballybrophy ballinasloe ballyhooley ballycumber ballyduff ballynashee ballywhack dont they all sound jolly and grotesque they do indeed we agreed and the plan is quite worthy of you we can say no more we had now developed so many more ideas than we could possibly use that the labour of deciding among them was the next thing to be done each of us stood out boldly for her own project even francesca clinging from sheer wilfulness to her worthless and absurd itineraries until in order to bring the matter to any sort of decision somebody suggested that we consult benella which reminds me that you have not yet the pleasure of benellas acquaintance chapter iii we sight a derelict o bay of dublin my heart youre troublin your beauty haunts me like a fever dream lady dufferin to perform the introduction properly i must go back a day or two we had elected to cross to dublin directly from scotland an easy night journey accordingly we embarked in a steamer called the prince or the king of something or other the name being many degrees more princely or kingly than the craft itself we had intended too to make our own comparison of the bay of dublin and the bay of naples because every traveller from charles levers jack hinton down to thackeray and mr alfred austin has always made it a point of honour to do so we were balked in our conscientious endeavour because we arrived at the north wall forty minutes earlier than the hour set by the steamship company it is quite impossible for anything in ireland to be done strictly on the minute and in struggling not to be hopelessly behind time a disthressful counthry will occasionally be ahead of it we had been told that we should arrive in a drizzling rain and that no one but lady dufferin had ever on approaching ireland seen the sweet faces of the wicklow mountains reflected in a smooth and silver sea the grumblers were right on this special occasion although we have proved them false more than once since i was in a fever of fear that ireland would not be as irish as we wished it to be it seemed probable that processions of prosperous aldermen school directors contractors mayors and ward politicians returning to their native land to see how herself was getting on the crathur might have deposited on the soil successive layers of irishamerican virtues such as punctuality thrift and cleanliness until they had quite obscured fair erins peculiar and pathetic charm we longed for the new ireland as fervently as any of her own patriots but we wished to see the old ireland before it passed there is plenty of it left alas the patriots would say and dublin was as dear and as dirty as when lady morgan first called it so long years ago the boat was met by a crowd of ragged gossoons most of them barefooted some of them stockingless and in mens shoes and several of them with flowers in their unspeakable hats and caps there were no cabs or jaunting cars because we had not been expected so early and the jarveys were in attendance on the holyhead steamer it was while i was searching for a piece of lost luggage that i saw the stewardess assisting a young woman off the gang plank and leading her toward a pile of wool bags on the dock she sank helplessly on one of them and leaned her head on another as the night had been one calculated to disturb the physical equilibrium of a poor sailor and the breakfast of a character to discourage the stoutest stomach i gave her a careless thought of pity and speedily forgot her two trunks a holdall a hatbox in which reposed in solitary grandeur francescas picture hat intended for the further undoing of the irish gentry a guitar case two bags three umbrellas all were safe but saleminas large vuitton trunk and my valise which had been last seen at edinburgh station salemina returned to the boat while francesca and i wended our way among the heaps of luggage followed by crowds of ragamuffins who offered to run for a car run for a cab run for a porter carry our luggage up the street to the cabstand carry our wraps carry us do any mortial thing for a penny melady an there is no cars here melady god bless me sowl and that he be good to us all if im tellin you a word of a lie entirely unused to this flow of conversation we were obliged to stop every few seconds to recount our luggage and try to remember what we were looking for we all met finally and i rescued salemina from the voluble thanks of an old woman to whom she had thoughtlessly given a threepenny bit this mother of a long wake family was wishing that salemina might live to ate the hin that scratched over her grave and invoking many other uncommon and picturesque blessings but we were obliged to ask her to desist and let us attend to our own business will i clane the whole of thim off for you for a penny your ladyships honour maam asked the oldest of the ragamuffins and i gladly assented to the novel proposition he did it too and there seemed to be no hurt feelings in the company just then there was a rattle of cabs and sidecars and our selfconstituted majordomo engaged two of them to await our pleasure at the same moment our eyes lighted upon saleminas huge vuitton which had been dragged behind the pile of wool sacks it was no wonder it had escaped our notice for it was mostly covered by the person of the seasick maiden whom i had seen on the arm of the stewardess she was seated on it exhaustion in every line of her figure her head upon my travelling bag her feet dangling over the edge until they just touched the s p salem mass usa painted in large red letters on the end she was too ill to respond to our questions but there was no mistaking her nationality her dress hat shoes gloves face figure were american we sent for the stewardess who told us that she had arrived in glasgow on the day previous and had been very ill all the way coming from boston boston exclaimed salemina do you say she is from boston poor thing i didnt know that a person living in boston could ever under any circumstances be a poor thing whispered francesca to me she was not fit to be crossing last night and the doctor on the american ship told her so and advised her to stay in bed for three days before coming to ireland but it seems as if she were determined to get to her journeys end we must have our trunk i interposed cant we move her carefully over to the wool sacks and wont you stay with her until her friends come she has no friends in this country maam shes just travelling for pleasure like good gracious what a position for her to be in said salemina cant you take her back to the steamer and put her to bed i could ask the captain certainly miss though of course its something we never do and besides we have to set the ship to rights and go across again this evening ask her what hotel she is going to salemina we suggested and let us drop her there and put her in charge of the housekeeper of course if it is only seasickness she will be all right in the morning the girls eyes were closed but she opened them languidly as salemina chafed her cold hands and asked gently if we could not drive her to an hotel is this your baggage she whispered it is salemina answered somewhat puzzled then dont leave me here i am from salem myself whereupon without any more warning she promptly fainted away on the trunk the situation was becoming embarrassing the assemblage grew larger and a more interesting and sympathetic audience i never saw to an irish crowd always warmhearted and kindly willing to take any trouble for friend or stranger and with a positive terror of loneliness or separation from kith and kin the helpless creature appealed in every way one and another joined the group with a holy biddy whats this at all the saints presarve us is it dyin she is look at the iligant duds she do be wearin call the docthor is it god give you sinse sure the docthors is only a flock of omadhauns is it your daughter she is maam this to salemina shes from ameriky the poor mischancy crathur give her a toothful of whisky your ladyship sure its nayther bite nor sup shes had the morn and belike shes as impty as a quarryhole when this last expression from the mother of the long weak family fell upon saleminas cultured ears she looked desperate we could not leave a fellowcountrywoman least of all could salemina forsake a fellowcitizen in such a hapless plight take one cab with francesca and the luggage penelope she whispered i will bring the girl with me put her to bed find her friends and see that she starts on her journey safely its very awkward but theres nothing else to be done so we departed in a chorus of popular approval sure its you that have the good hearts may the heavens be your bed may the journey thrive wid her the crathur francesca and i arrived first at the hotel where our rooms were already engaged and there proved to be a comfortable little dressing or maids room just off saleminas here the derelict was presently ensconced and there she lay in a sort of profound exhaustion all day without once absolutely regaining her consciousness instead of visiting the national gallery as i had intended i returned to the dock to see if i could find the girls luggage or get any further information from the stewardess before she left dublin ill send the doctor at once but we must learn all possible particulars now i said maliciously to poor salemina it would be so awkward you know if you should be arrested for abduction the doctor thought it was probably nothing more than the complete prostration that might follow eight days of seasickness but the patients heart was certainly a little weak and she needed the utmost quiet his fee was a guinea for the first visit and he would drop in again in the course of the afternoon to relieve our anxiety we took turns in watching by her bedside but the two unemployed ones lingered forlornly near and had no heart for sightseeing francesca did however purchase opera tickets for the evening and secretly engaged the housemaid to act as head nurse in our absence as we were dining at seven we heard a faint voice in the little room beyond salemina left her dinner and went in to find her charge slightly better we had been able thus far only to take off her dress shoes and such garments as made her uncomfortable salemina now managed to slip on a nightdress and put her under the bedcovers returning then to her cold mutton cutlet shes an extraordinary person she said absently playing with her knife and fork she didnt ask me where she was or show any interest in her surroundings perhaps she is still too weak she said she was better and when i had made her ready for bed she whispered ive got to say my prayers say them by all means i replied but i must get up and kneel down she said i told her she must do nothing of the sort that she was far too ill but i must she urged i never go to bed without saying my prayers on my knees i forbade her doing it she closed her eyes and i came away isnt she quaint at this juncture we heard the thud of a soft falling body and rushing in we found that the derelict had crept from her bed to her knees and had probably not prayed more than two minutes before she fainted for the fifth or sixth time in twentyfour hours salemina was vexed angel and philanthropist though she is francesca and i were so helpless with laughter that we could hardly lift the too conscientious maiden into bed the situation may have been pathetic to the truly pious mind it would indeed have been indescribably touching but for the moment the humorous side of it was too much for our selfcontrol salemina in rushing for stimulants and smelling salts broke her only comfortable eyeglasses and this accident coupled with her other anxieties and responsibilities caused her to shed tears an occurrence so unprecedented that francesca and i kissed and comforted her and tucked her up on the sofa then we sent for the doctor gave our opera tickets to the head waiter and chambermaid and settled down to a cheerful home evening our first in ireland if himself were here we should not be in this plight i sighed i dont know how you can say that responded salemina with considerable spirit you know perfectly well that if your husband had found a mother and seven children helpless and deserted on that dock he would have brought them all to this hotel and then tried to find the father and grandfather and its not saleminas fault argued francesca she couldnt help the girl being born in salem not that i believe that she ever heard of the place before she saw it printed on saleminas trunk i told you it was too big and red dear but you wouldnt listen i am the strongest american of the party but i confess that usa in letters five inches long is too much for my patriotism it would not be if you ever had charge of the luggage retorted salemina and whatever you do francesca i added beseechingly dont impugn the veracity of our derelict while we think of ourselves as ministering angels i can endure anything but if we are the dupes of an adventuress there is nothing pretty about it by the way i have consulted the english manageress of this hotel who was not particularly sympathetic perhaps you shouldnt have assumed charge of her madam she said but having done so hadnt you better see if you can get her into a hospital it isnt a bad suggestion and after a day or two we will consider it or i will get a trained nurse to take full charge of her i would be at any reasonable expense rather than have our pleasure interfered with any further it still seems odd to make a proposition of this kind in former times francesca was the croesus of the party salemina came second and i last with a most precarious income now i am the wealthy one francesca is reduced to the second place and salemina to the third but it makes no difference whatever either in our relations our arrangements or for that matter in our expenditures chapter iv enter benella dusenberry a fair maiden wanderd all wearied and lone sighing im a poor stranger and far from my own we invited her in we offered her share of our humble cottage and our humble fare we bade her take comfort no longer to moan and made the poor stranger be one of our own old irish song the next morning dawned as lovely as if it had slipped out of paradise and as for freshness and emerald sheen the world from our windows was like a lettuce leaf just washed in dew the windows of my bedroom looked out pleasantly on st stephens green commonly called stephens green or by citizens of the baser sort stephenss green it is a good english mile in circumference and many are the changes in it from the time it was first laid out in to the present day when it was made into a public park by lord ardilaun when the celebrated mrs delany then mrs pendarves first saw it the centre was a swamp where in winter a quantity of snipe congregated and harris in his history of dublin alludes to the presence of snipe and swamp as an agreeable and uncommon circumstance not to be met with perhaps in any other great city in the world a double row of spreading limetrees bordered its four sides one of which known as beaux walk was a favourite lounge for fashionable idlers here stood bishop claytons residence a large building with a front like devonshire house in piccadilly so writes mrs delany it was splendidly furnished and the bishop lived in a style which proves that irish prelates of the day were not all given to selfabnegation and mortification of the flesh a long line of vehicles outsidecars and cabs some of them battered and shaky others sufficiently welllooking was gathering on two sides of the green for dublin you know is the cardrivingest city in the world francesca and i had our first experience yesterday in the intervals of nursing driving to dublin castle trinity college the four courts and grafton street the regent street of dublin it is easy to tell the stranger stiff decorous terrified clutching the rail with one or both hands but we took for our model a pretty irish girl who looked like nothing so much as a bird on a swaying bough it is no longer called the jaunting but the outside car and there is another charming word lost to the world there was formerly an insidecar too but it is almost unknown in dublin though still found in some of the smaller towns an outsidecar has its wheels practically inside the body of the vehicle but an inside car carries its wheels outside this definition was given us by an irish driver but lucid definition is not perhaps an irishmans strong point it is clearer to say that the passenger sits outside of the wheels on the one inside on the other there are seats for two persons over each of the two wheels and a dickey for the driver in front should he need to use it ordinarily he sits on one side driving while you perch on the other and thus you jog along each seeing your own side of the road and discussing the topics of the day across the well as the coveredin centre of the car is called there are those who do not agree with its champions who call it cupids own conveyance they find the seat too small for two yet feel it a bit unsociable when the companion occupies the opposite side to me a modern dublin car with rubber tires and a good irish horse is the jolliest vehicle in the universe there is a liveliness an irresponsible gaiety in the spring and sway of it an ease in the halflounging position against the cushions a unique charm in travelling edgeways with your feet planted on the step you must not be afraid of a car if you want to enjoy it hold the rail if you must at first though its just as bad form as clinging to your horses mane while riding in the row your driver will take all the chances that a crowded thoroughfare gives him he would scorn to leave more than an inch between your feet and a guinness beer dray he will shake your flounces and furbelows in the very windows of the passing trams but he is beloved by the gods and nothing ever happens to him the morning was enchanting as i said and above all the derelict was better its a grand nights slape i had wid her intirely said the housemaid an sure its not today shell be dyin on you at all at all shes had the white drink in the bowl twyst and a grand cup o tay on the top o that salemina fortified herself with breakfast before she went in to an interview which we all felt to be important and decisive the time seemed endless to us and endless were our suppositions perhaps she has had morning prayers and fainted again perhaps she has turned out to be saleminas longlost cousin perhaps she is upbraiding salemina for kidnapping her when she was insensible perhaps she is relating her life history if it is a sad one salemina is adopting her legally at this moment perhaps she is one of mr beresfords wards and has come over to complain of somebodys ill treatment here salemina entered looking flushed and embarrassed we thought it a bad sign that she could not meet our eyes without confusion but i made room for her on the sofa and francesca drew her chair closer she is from salem began the poor dear she has never been out of massachusetts in her life unfortunate girl exclaimed francesca adding prudently as she saw saleminas rising colour though of course if one has to reside in a single state massachusetts offers more compensations than any other she knows every nook and corner in the place continued salemina she has even seen the house where i was born and her name is benella dusenberry impossible cried francesca dusenberry is unlikely enough but who ever heard of such a name as benella it sounds like a flavouring extract she came over to see the world she says oh then she has money no or at least yes or at least she had enough when she left america to last for two or three months or until she could earn something of course she left her little all in a chamoisskin bag under her pillow on the steamer suggested francesca that is precisely what she did salemina replied with a pale smile however she was so ill in the steerage that she had to pay twentyfive or thirty dollars extra to go into the second cabin and this naturally reduced the amount of her savings though it makes no difference since she left them all behind her save a few dollars in her purse she says she is usually perfectly well but that she was very tired when she started that it was her first seavoyage and the passage was unusually rough where is she going i dont know i mean she doesnt know her maternal grandmother was born in trim near tara in meath but she does not think she has any relations over here she is entirely alone in the world and that gives her a certain sentiment in regard to ireland which she heard a great deal about when she was a child the maternal grandmother must have gone to salem at a very early age as benella herself savours only of new england soil has she any trade or is she trained to do anything whatsoever asked francesca no she hoped to take some position of trust she does not care at all what it is so long as the occupation is interestin work she says that is rather vague of course but she speaks and appears like a nice conscientious person tell us the rest conceal nothing i said sternly she she thinks that we have saved her life and she feels that she belongs to us faltered salemina belongs to us we cried in a duet was there ever such a base reward given to virtue ever such an unwelcome expression of gratitude belong to us indeed we cant have her we wont have her were you perfectly frank with her i tried to be but she almost insisted she has set her heart upon being our maid does she know how to be a maid no but she is extremely teachable she says i have my doubts remarked francesca a liking for personal service is not a distinguishing characteristic of new englanders they are not the stuff of which maids are made if she were french or german or senegambian in fact anything but a saleminian we might use her we have always said we needed some one salemina brightened i thought myself it might be rather nice that is i thought it might be a way out of the difficulty penelope had thought at one time of bringing a maid and it would save us a great deal of trouble the doctor thinks she could travel a short distance in a few days perhaps it is a providence in disguise the disguise is perfect murmured francesca you see salemina continued when the poor thing tottered along the wharf the stewardess laid her on the pile of wool sacks like a dying chancellor again interpolated the irrepressible and ran off to help another passenger when she opened her eyes she saw straight in front of her in huge letters salem mass usa it loomed before her despairing vision i suppose like a great ark of refuge and seemed to her in her halfdazed condition not only a reminder but almost a message from home she had then no thought of ever seeing the owner she says she felt only that she should like to die quietly on anything marked salem mass go in to see her presently penelope and make up your own mind about her see if you can persuade her to to well to give us up try to get her out of the notion of being our maid she is so firm i never saw so feeble a person who could be so firm and what in the world shall we do with her if she keeps on insisting in her nervous state my idea would be i suggested to engage her provisionally if we must not because we want her but because her heart is weak i shall tell her that we do not feel like leaving her behind and yet we ourselves cannot be detained in dublin indefinitely that we will try the arrangement for a month and that she can consider herself free to leave us at any time on a weeks notice i approve of that agreed francesca because it makes it easier to dismiss her in case she turns out to be a massachusetts borgia you remember however that we bore with the vapours and vagaries the sighs and moans of jane grieve in pettybaw all those weeks and not one of us had the courage to throw off her yoke never shall i forget her at your wedding penelope the teardrop glistened in her eye as usual i think it is glued there ronald was sympathetic because he fancied she was weeping for the loss of you but on inquiry it transpired that she was thinking of a marriage in that wonerfu fine family in glasgy with whose charms she had made us all too familiar she asked to be remembered when i began my own housekeeping and i told her truthfully that she was not a person who could be forgotten i repressed my feeling that she is too tearful for a highland village where it rains most of the year also my conviction that ronalds parish would chasten me sufficiently without her aid i did as salemina wished and had a conference with miss dusenberry i hope i was quite clear in my stipulations as to the perfect freedom of the four contracting parties i know i intended to be and i was embarrassed to see francesca and salemina exchange glances next day when benella said she would show us what a good sailor she could be on the return voyage to america adding that she thought a person would be much less liable to seasickness when travelling in the first cabin chapter v the wearing of the green sir knight i feel not the least alarm no son of erin will offer me harmfor tho they love woman and golden store sir knight they love honour and virtue more thomas moore this is an anniversary said salemina coming into the sittingroom at breakfasttime with a book under her arm having given up all hope of any ones waking in this hotel which before nine in the morning is precisely like the sleeping beautys castle i dressed and determined to look up brian boru from all that i can recall of him he was not a person to meet before breakfast yawned francesca still i shall be glad of a little fresh light for my mind is in a most chaotic state induced by the intellectual preparation that you have made me undergo during the past month i dreamed last night that i was conducting a mothers meeting in ronalds new parish and the subject for discussion was the small livings scheme the object of which is to augment the stipends of the ministers of the church of scotland to a minimum of pounds per annum i tried to keep the members to the point but was distracted by the sudden appearance in all corners of the church of people who hadnt been asked to the party there was brian boru tony lumpkin finn mccool felicia hemans ossian mrs delany sitric of the silken beard st columba mickey free strongbow maria edgeworth and the venerable bede imagine leading a mothers meeting with those people in the pews it was impossible st columbkille and the venerable bede seemed to know about parochial charges and livings and stipends and glebes and maria edgeworth was rather helpful but brian and sitric glared at each other and brandished their hymnbooks threateningly while ossian refused to sit in the same pew with mickey free who behaved in an odious manner and interrupted each of the speakers in turn incidentally a group of persons huddled together in a far corner rose out of the dim light and flapping huge wings flew over my head and out of the window above the altar this i took to be the flight of the earls and the terror of it awoke me whatever my parish duties may be in the future at least they cannot be any more dreadful and disorderly than the dream i dont know which is more to blame the seed that i sowed or the soil on which it fell said salemina laughing heartily at francescas whimsical nightmares but as i said this is an anniversary the famous battle of clontarf was fought here in dublin on this very day eight hundred years ago and brian boru routed the danes in what was the last struggle between christianity and heathenism the greatest slaughter took place on the streets along which we drove yesterday from ballybough bridge to the four courts brian boru was king of munster you remember salemina always says this for courtesys sake or at least you have read of that time in irelands history when a fair lady dressed in fine silk and gold and jewels could walk unmolested the length of the land because of the love the people bore king brian and the respect they cherished for his wise laws well mailmora the king of leinster had quarrelled with him and joined forces with the danish leaders against him broder and amlaff two vikings from the isle of man brought with them a fleet of two thousand denmarkians and a thousand men covered with mail from head to foot to meet the irish who always fought in tunics joyce says that broder wore a coat of mail that no steel would bite that he was both tall and strong and that his black locks were so long that he tucked them under his belt theres a portrait for your gallery penelope brians army was encamped on the green of ahaclee which is now phoenix park and when he set fire to the danish districts the fierce norsemen within the city could see a blazing smoking pathway that reached from dublin to howth the quarrel must have been all the more virulent in that mailmora was brians brotherinlaw and brians daughter was the wife of sitric of the silken beard danish king of dublin i refuse to remember their relationships or alliances said francesca they were always intermarrying with their foes in order to gain strength but it generally seems to have made things worse rather than better still i dont mind hearing what became of brian after his victory let us quite finish with him before the eggs come up i suppose it will be eggs broder the viking rushed upon him in his tent where he was praying cleft his head from his body and he is buried in armagh cathedral said salemina closing the book penelope do ring again for breakfast and just to keep us from realising our hunger read remember the glories of brian the brave we had brought letters of introduction to a dean a bishop and a rt hon lord justice so there were a few delightful invitations when the morning post came up not so many as there might have been perhaps had not the irish capital been in a state of complete dementia over the presence of the greatest queen in the world privately i think that those nations in the habit of having kings and queens at all should have four like those in a pack of cards then they could manage to give all their colonies and dependencies a frequent sight of royalty and prevent much excitement and heartburning penelopes experiences in scotland given in a former volume ended the meticulous proofreader will remember with her marriage in the year of the queens jubilee it is apparent in the opening chapters of this story that penelope came to ireland the following spring which though the matter is hardly important was not that of the queens memorable visit the irish experiences are probably the fruit of several expeditions and penelope has chosen to include this vivid impression of her majestys welcome to ireland even though it might convict her of an anachronism perhaps as this is not an historical novel but a chronicle of small beer the trifling inaccuracy may be pardonedk d w it was worth something to be one of the lunatic populace when the little lady in black with her parasol bordered in silver shamrocks drove along the gaily decorated streets for the irish it seems to me desire nothing better than to be loyal if any persons to whom they can be loyal are presented to them irish disaffection is after all but skindeep said our friend the dean it is a cutaneous malady produced by external irritants below the surface there is a deep spring of personal loyalty which needs only a touch like that of the prophets wand to enable it to gush forth in healing floods her majesty might drive through these crowded streets in her donkey chaise unguarded as secure as the lady in that poem of moores which portrayed the safety of women in brian borus time the old song has taken on a new meaning it begins you know lady dost thou not fear to stray so lone and lonely through this dark way and the queen might answer as did the heroine sir knight i feel not the least alarm no son of erin will offer me harm it was small use for the parliamentary misrepresentatives to advise treating victoria of the good deeds with the courtesy due to a foreign sovereign visiting the country under the miles of flags she drove red white and blue tossing themselves in the sweet spring air and up from the warm hearts of the surging masses of people men and women alike crimean soldiers and old crones in rags gentry and peasants went a greeting i never before heard given to any sovereign for it was a sigh of infinite content that trembled on the lips and then broke into a deep sob as a knot of trinity college students in a spontaneous burst of song flung out the last verse of the new wearing of the green and so upon st patricks day victoria she has said each irish regiment shall wear the green beside the red and shes coming to ould ireland who away so long has been and dear knows but into dublin shell ride wearing of the green alfred perceval graves the first cheers were faint and broken and the emotion that quivered on every face and the tears that gleamed in a thousand eyes made it the most touching spectacle in the world foreign sovereign indeed she was the queen of ireland and the nation of courtiers and hero worshippers was at her feet there was the history of five hundred years in that greeting and to me it spoke volumes plenty of people there were in the crowd too who were heartily agin the government but daniel oconnell is not the only irishman who could combine a detestation of the imperial parliament with a passionate loyalty to the sovereign there was a woman near us who remimbered the last time her noble highness come thirtynine years back glory be to god thim was the times and who kept ejaculating shes the best woman in the wurrld bar none and the most varchous faymale as her husband made no reply she was obliged in her excitement to thump him with her umbrella and repeat the most varchous faymale do you hear at which he retorted have conduct woman sure ive nothin agin it look at the size of her now she went on sittin in that grand carriage no bigger than me own kitty and always in the black the darlin look at her a widdy woman raring that large and heavy family of children and how well shes married off her daughters more luck to her though to be sure they must have been well fortuned they do be sayin shes come over because shes plazed with seein estated gintlemen lave iverything and go out and be shot by thim bloody boers bad scran to thim sure if i had the sons sorra a wan but id lave go whos the iligant sojers in the silver stays thady is it the life guards youre callin thim there were two soldiers wives standing on the pavement near us and one of them showed a halfsovereign to the other saying tis the last days airnin iver i seen by him mrs muldoon maam ah theres thim says for this war an theres thim says agin this war but heaven lave himself where he is i says for of all the ragin turcomaniacs iver a misfortunate woman was curst with pat brady my full private he bates em all here the band played come back to erin and the scene was indescribable nothing could have induced me to witness it had i realised what it was to be for i wept at holyrood when i heard the plaintive strains of bonnie charlies noo awa floating up to the gallery of kings from the palace courtyard and i did not wish francesca to see me shedding national political and historical tears so soon again francesca herself is so ardent a republican that she weeps only for presidents and cabinet officers for my part although i am thoroughly loyal i cannot become sufficiently attached to a president in four years to shed tears when i see him driving at the head of a procession chapter vi dublin then and now i found in innisfail the fair in ireland while in exile there women of worth both grave and gay men many clerics and many laymen james clarence mangan mrs delany writing from dublin in says as for the generality of people that i meet with here they are much the same as in england a mixture of good and bad all that i have met with behave themselves very decently according to their rank now and then an oddity breaks out but never so extraordinary but that i can match it in england there is a heartiness among them that is more like cornwall than any i have known and great sociableness this picturesque figure in the life of her day gives charming pictures in her memoirs of the irish society of the time descriptions which are confirmed by contemporary writers she was the wife of dr delany dean of down the companion of duchesses and queens and the friend of swift hannah more in a poem called sensibility published in gives this quaint and stilted picture of her delany shines in worth serenely bright wisdoms strong ray and virtues milder light and she who blessed the friend and graced the page of swift still lends her lustre to our age long long protract thy light o star benign whose setting beams with added brightness shine the irish ladies of delanys day who scarcely ever appeared on foot in the streets were famous for their grace in dancing it seems as the men were for their skill in swimming the hospitality of the upper classes was profuse and by no means lacking in brilliancy or in grace the humorous and satirical poetry found in the fugitive literature of the period shows conclusively that there were plenty of bright spirits and keen wits at the banquets routs and balls the curse of absenteeism was little felt in dublin where the parliament secured the presence of most of the aristocracy and of much of the talent of the country and during the residence of the viceroy there was the influence of the court to contribute to the sparkling character of dublin society how they managed to sparkle when discussing some of the heavy dinner menus of the time i cannot think here is one of the dean of downs bills of fare turkeys endove boyled leg of mutton greens etc soup plum pudding roast loin of veal venison pasty partridge sweetbreads collared pig creamed apple tart crabs fricassee of eggs pigeons no dessert to be had although there is no mention of beverages we may be sure that this array of viands was not eaten dry but was washed down with a plentiful variety of wines and liquors the hosts either in dublin or london who numbered among their dinner guests such irishmen as sheridan or lysaght mangan or lever curran or lover father prout or dean swift had as great a feast of wit and repartee as one will be apt soon to hear again although it must have been lever or lover who furnished the cream of irish humour and father prout and swift the curds if you are fortunate enough to be bidden to the right houses in ireland today you will have as much good talk as you are likely to listen to anywhere else in this degenerate age which has mostly forgotten how to converse in learning to chat and any one who goes to the spring show at balls bridge or to the punchestown or leopardstown races or to the dublin horse show will have to confess that the irishwomen can dispute the palm with any nation light on their feet now they passed me and sped give you me word give you me word every girl wid a turn o the head just like a bird just like a bird and the lashes so thick round their beautiful eyes shinin to tell you its fair time o day wid them back in me heart wid a kind of surprise i think how the irish girls has the way wid them their charm is made up of beautiful eyes and lashes lustre of hair poise of head shapeliness of form vivacity and coquetry and there is a matchless grace in the way they wear the whatever be it the chiffons of the fashionable dame or the shawl of the country colleen who can draw the two corners of that faded article of apparel shyly over her lips and look out from under it with a pair of luminous grey eyes in a manner that is fairly disthractin yesterday was a redletter day for i dined in the evening at dublin castle and francesca was bidden to the concert in the throne room afterwards it was a brilliant scene when the assembled guests awaited their host and hostess the shaded lights bringing out the satins and velvets pearls and diamonds uniforms orders and medals suddenly the hum of voices ceased as one of the aidesdecamp who preceded the viceregal party announced their excellencies we made a sort of passage as these dignitaries advanced to shake hands with a few of those they knew best the lord lieutenant then gave his arm to the lady of highest rank alas it was not i her excellency chose her proper squire and we passed through the beautifully decorated rooms to st patricks hall in a nicely graded procession magnificence at the head humility at the tail a string band was discoursing sweet music the while and i fitted to its measures certain wellknown lines descriptive of the entrance of the beasts into the ark the animals went in two by two the elephant and the kangaroo as my escort was a certain brilliant lord justice and as the wittiest dean in leinster was my other neighbour i almost forgot to eat in my pleasure and excitement i told the dean that we had chosen scottish ancestors before going to our first great dinner in edinburgh feeling that we should be more in sympathy with the festivities and more acceptable to our hostess but that i had forgotten to provide myself for this occasion my first function in dublin whereupon the good dean promptly remembered that there was a penelope oconnor daughter of the king of connaught i could not quite give up tam o the cowgate thomas hamilton or jenny geddes of fauldstule fame also a hamilton but i added the king of connaught to the list of my chosen forebears with much delight in spite of the polite protests of the rev father ohogan who sat opposite and who remarked that man for his glory to ancestry flies but womans bright story is told in her eyes while the monarch but traces through mortal his line beauty born of the graces ranks next to divine i asked the reverend father if he were descended from galloping ohogan who helped patrick sarsfield to spike the guns of the williamites at limerick by me sowl maam its not discinded at all i am i am one o the common sort just he answered broadening his brogue to make me smile a delightful man he was exactly such an one as might have sprung full grown from a lever novel one who could talk equally well with his flock about pigs or penances purgatory or potatoes and quote tom moore and lover when occasion demanded story after story fell from his genial lips and at last he said apologetically one more and i have done when a pretty woman sitting near him interpolated slyly we might say to you your reverence what the old woman said to the eloquent priest who finished his sermon with one word and i have done an what is that maam asked father ohogan och me darlin pracher may ye niver be done we all agreed that we should like to reconstruct the scene for a moment and look at a drawingroom of two hundred years ago when the lady lieutenant after the minuets at eleven oclock went to her basset table while her pages attended behind her chair and when on ball nights the ladies scrambled for sweetmeats on the dancingfloor as to their probable toilets one could not give purer pleasure than by quoting mrs delanys description of one of them the duchesss dress was of white satin embroidered the bottom of the petticoat brown hills covered with all sorts of weeds and every breadth had an old stump of a tree that ran up almost to the top of the petticoat broken and ragged and worked with brown chenille round which twined nasturtiums ivy honeysuckles periwinkles and all sorts of running flowers which spread and covered the petticoat the robings and facings were little green banks covered with all sorts of weeds and the sleeves and the rest of the gown loose twining branches of the same sort as those on the petticoat many of the leaves were finished with gold and part of the stumps of the trees looked like the gilding of the sun i never saw a piece of work so prettily fancied she adds a few other details for the instruction of her sister anne heads are variously adorned pompons with some accompaniment of feathers ribbons or flowers lappets in all sorts of curlimurlis long hoods are worn close under the chin the earrings go round the neck and tie with bows and ends behind nightgowns are worn without hoops part second munster chapter vii a tour and a detour an there sez i to meself were goin wherever we go but where well be whin we git there its never a know ill know jane barlow we had planned to go direct from dublin to valencia island where there is not i am told one dhry step twixt your fut an the states but we thought it too tiring a journey for benella and arranged for a little visit to cork first we nearly missed the train owing to the late arrival of salemina at the kingsbridge station she had been buying malted milk mellins food an alcohol lamp a tin cup and getting all the doctors prescriptions renewed we intended too to go second or third class now an then in order to study the humours of the natives but of course we went first on this occasion on account of benella i told her that we could not follow british usage and call her by her surname dusenberry was too long and too well too extraordinary for daily use abroad praps it is she assented meekly and still mis beresford when a mans name is dusenberry you cant hardly blame him for wanting his child to be called by it can you this was incontrovertible and i asked her middle name it was frances and that was too like francesca you dont like the sound o benella she inquired ive always set great store by my name it is so unlikely my fathers name was benjamin and my mothers ella and mine is made from both of em but you can call me any kind of a name you please after what youve done for me and she closed her eyes patiently call me daphne call me chloris call me lalage or doris only only call me thine which is exactly what we are not ready to do i thought in a poetic parenthesis benella looks frail and yet hardy she has an unusual and perhaps unnecessary amount of imagination for her station some native commonsense but limited experience she is somewhat vague and inconsistent in her theories of life but i am sure there is vitality and energy too in her composition although it has been temporarily drowned in the atlantic ocean if she were a clock i should think that some experimenter had taken out her original works and substituted others to see how they would run the clock has a new england case and strikes with a new england tone but the works do not match it altogether of course i know that one does not ordinarily engage a ladysmaid because of these piquant peculiarities but in our case the circumstances were extraordinary i have explained them fully to himself in my letters and francesca too has written pages of illuminating detail to ronald macdonald the similarity in the minds of men must sometimes come across them with a shock unless indeed it appeals to their sense of humour himself in america and the rev mr macdonald in the north of scotland both answered in course of time that a ladysmaid should be engaged because is a ladysmaid and for no other reason was ever anything duller than this more conventional more commonplace or didactic less imaginative himself added you are a romantic idiot and i love you more than tongue can tell francesca did not say what ronald added probably a part of this same sentence owing to the aforesaid similarity of mens minds reserving the rest for the frank intimacy of the connubial state everything looked beautiful in the uncertain glory of the april day the thistledown clouds opened now and then to shake out a delicate brilliant little shower that ceased in a trice and the sun smiled through the light veil of rain turning every falling drop to a jewel it was as if the fairies were busy at aerial wateringpots without any more serious purpose than to amuse themselves and make the earth beautiful and we realised that irish rain is as warm as an irish welcome and soft as an irish smile everything was bursting into new life everything but the primroses and their glory was departing the yellow carpet seemed as bright as ever on the sunny hedgerow banks and on the fringe of the woods but when we plucked some at a wayside station we saw that they were just past their golden prime there was a greygreen hint of verdure in the sallows that stood against a dark background of firs and the branches of the fruittrees were tipped with pink rosyhued promises of may just threatening to break through their silvery april sheaths raindrops were still glistening on the fronds of the tender young ferns and on the great clumps of pale delicately scented bog violets that we found in a marshy spot and brought in to salemina who was not in her usual spirits who indeed seemed distinctly anxious she was enchanted with the changeful charm of the landscape and found mrs delanys memoirs a book after her own heart but ever and anon her eyes rested on benellas pale face nothing could have been more doggedly conscientious and assiduous than our attentions to the derelict she had beef juice at kildare malted milk at ballybrophy tea at dundrum nevertheless as we approached limerick junction we were obliged to hold a consultation salemina wished to alight from the train at the next station take a three hours rest then jog on to any comfortable place for the night and to cork in the morning i shall feel much more comfortable she said if you go on and amuse yourselves as you like leaving benella to me for a day or even for two or three days i cant help feeling that the chief fault or at least the chief responsibility is mine if i hadnt been born in salem or hadnt had the word painted on my trunk in such red letters she wouldnt have fainted on it and i neednt have saved her life it is too late to turn back now it is saved or partly saved and i must persevere in saving it at least until i find that its not worth saving poor darling said francesca sympathisingly ill look in murray and find a nice interesting place you can put benella to bed in the southern hotel at limerick junction and perhaps you can then drive within sight of the round tower of cashel then you can take up the afternoon train and go to let me see how would you like buttevant boutez en avant you know the push forward motto of the barrymores its delightful penelope she continued wed better get off too it is a garrison town and there is a military hotel then in the vicinity is kilcolman where spenser wrote the faerie queene so there is the beginning of your literary pilgrimage the very first day without any plotting or planning the little river aubeg which flows by kilcolman castle spenser called the mulla and referred to it as mulla mine whose waves i whilom taught to weep that by the way is no more than our jane grieve could have done for the rivers of scotland what do you say and wont you be a prood woman the day when you sign the hotel register miss peabody and maid salem mass usa i thought most favourably of buttevant but on prudently inquiring the guards opinion he said it was not a comfortable place for an invalid lady and that mallow was much more the thing at limerick junction then we all alighted and in the ten minutes wait saw benella escorted up the hotel stairway by a sympathetic head waiter detached from saleminas fostering care and prudent espionage separated above all from the depressing miss dusenberry we planned every conceivable folly in the way of guidebook expeditions the exhilarating sense of being married and therefore properly equipped to undertake any sort of excursion with perfect propriety gave added zest to the affair in my eyes sleeping at cork in an imperial hotel was far too usual a proceeding we scorned it as the very apex of boldness and reckless defiance of commonsense we let our heavy luggage go on to the capital of munster and taking our handbags entered a railway carriage standing on a side track and were speedily on our way we knew not whither and cared less we discovered all too soon that we were going to waterford the star of the suir the gentle shure that making way by sweet clonmell adorns rich waterford and we were charmed at first sight with its quaint bridge spanning the silvery river it was only five oclock and we walked about the fine old ninthcentury town called by the cavaliers the urbs intacta because it was the one place in ireland which successfully resisted the allconquering cromwell francesca sent a telegram at once to miss peabody and maid great southern hotel limerick junction came to waterford instead cork strongbow landed here defeating danes and irish youghal tomorrow pronounced yawl address green park miss murphys hows derelict franelope it was absurd of course but an absurdity that can be achieved at the cost of eighteenpence is well worth the money nobody but a baedeker or a murray could write an account of our doings the next two days feeling that we might at any hour be recalled to benellas bedside we took a childlike pleasure in crowding as much as possible into the time this zeal was responsible for our leaving the urbs intacta and pushing on to pass the night in something smaller and more idyllic i dissuaded francesca from seeking a lodging in ballybricken by informing her that it was the heart of the bacon industry and the home of the bestknown body of pigbuyers in ireland but her mind was fixed upon kills and ballies on asking our jarvey the meaning of bally as a prefix he answered reflectively i dont think theres annything onderhanded in the manin melady i think it means bally jist the name of the place where we did go shall never be divulged lest a curious public follow in our footsteps and if perchance it have not our youth vigour and appetite for adventure it might die there in the principal hotel unwept unhonoured and unsung the house is said to be three hundred and seventyfive years old but we are convinced that this is a wicked understatement of its antiquity it must have been built since the deluge else it would at least have had one general spring cleaning in the course of its existence cromwell had been there too and in the confusion of his departure they must have forgotten to sweep under the beds we entered our rooms at ten in the evening having dismissed our car knowing well that there was no other place to stop the night we gave the jarvey twice his fare to avoid altercation but divil a penny less would he take although it was he who had recommended the place as a cosy hotel it looks like a small little house melady but tis large inside and it has a power o beds in it we each generously insisted on taking the dirtiest bedroom they had both been last occupied by the cromwellian soldiers we agreed but relinquished the idea because the more we compared them the more impossible it was to decide which was the dirtiest there were no locks on the doors and sure what matther for that miss nobody has a right ie business to be comin in here but meself said the aged woman who showed us to our rooms chapter viii romance and reality but he lay like a warrior taking his rest with his martial cloak around him charles wolfe at midnight i heard a faint tap at my door and francesca walked in her eyes wide and bright her cheeks flushed her long dark braid of hair hanging over her black travelling cloak i laughed as i saw her she looked so like sir patrick spens in the ballad play at pettybaw a memorable occasion when ronald macdonald caught her acting that tragic role in his ministerial gown the very day that himself came from paris to marry me in pettybaw dear little pettybaw i came in to find out if your bed is as bad as mine but i see you have not slept in it she whispered i was just coming in to see if yours could be any worse i replied do you mean to say that you have tried it courageous girl i blew out my candle and then after an interval in which to forget sat down on the outside as a preliminary but the moon rose just then and i could get no further i had not unpacked my bag i had simply slipped on my macintosh selected a wooden chair and putting a cromwellian towel over it seated myself shudderingly on it and put my feet on the rounds quoting moore meantime and the best of all ways to lengthen our days is to steal a few hours from the night my dear francesca followed my example and we passed the night in reading celtic romances to each other we could see the faint outline of sweet slievenamann from our windows the mountain of the fair women of feimheann celebrated as the huntingground of the finnian chiefs one day finn and oscar followed the chase in sliabhnambanfeimheann with three thousand finnian chiefs ere the sun looked out from his circle in the finnian legend the great finn mccool when much puzzled in the choice of a wife seated himself on its summit at last he decided to make himself a prize in a competition of all the fair women in ireland they should start at the foot of the mountain and the one who first reached the summit should be the great finns bride it was grainne oge the gallic helen and daughter of cormac the king of ireland who won the chieftain being fleetest of foot and longest of wind we almost forgot our discomforts in this enthralling story and slept on each others nice clean shoulders a little just before the dawn and such a dawn such infinite softness of air such dewdrenched verdure it is a backward spring they say but to me the woods are even lovelier than in their summer wealth of foliage when one can hardly distinguish the beauty of the single tree from that of its neighbours since the colours are blended in one universal green now we see the feathery tassels of the beech bursting out of their brown husks the russet hues of the young oak leaves and the countless emerald gleams that break from the rubybudded lime the greenest trees are the larch the horsechestnut and the sycamore three naturalised citizens who apparently still keep to their native fashions and put out their foliage as they used to do in their own homes the young alders and the hawthorn hedges are greening but it will be a fortnight before we can realise the beauty of that snowwhite bloom with its bittersweet fragrance the cuckooflower came this year before instead of after the bird they tell us showing that even nature in these days of anarchy and misrule is capable of taking liberties with her own laws there is a fragrance of freshly turned earth in the air and the rooks are streaming out from the elms by the little church and resting for a bit in a group of plumelike yews the last few days of warmth and sunshine have inspired the birds and as francesca and i sit at our windows breathing in the sweetness and freshness of the morning there is a concert of thrushes and blackbirds in the shrubberies the little birds furnish the chorus or the undertone of song the hedgesparrows redbreasts and chaffinches but the meistersingers call the tune and lead the feathered orchestra with clear and certain notes it is a golden time for the minstrels for nestbuilding is finished and the feeding of the younglings a good time yet in the future we can see one little brown lady hovering warm eggs under her breast her bright eyes peeping through a screen of leaves as she glances up at her singing lord pouring out his thanks for the morning sun there is only a hint of breeze it might almost be the whisper of uncurling fern fronds but soft as it is it stirs the branches here and there and i know that it is rocking hundreds of tiny cradles in the forest when i was always painting in those other days before i met himself one might think my eyes would have been even keener to see beauty than now when my brushes are more seldom used but it is not so there is something deep hidden in my consciousness that makes all loveliness lovelier that helps me to interpret it in a different and in a larger sense i have a feeling that i have been lifted out of the individual and given my true place in the general scheme of the universe and in some subtle way that i can hardly explain i am more nearly related to all things good beautiful and true than i was when i was wholly an artist and therefore less a woman the bursting of the leafbuds brings me a tender thought of the one dear heart that gives me all its spring and whenever i see the smile of a child a generous look the flash of sympathy in an eye it makes me warm with swift remembrance of the one i love the best of all just as a lamplight will set a linnet singing for the sun love is doing the same thing for francesca for the smaller feelings merge themselves in the larger ones as little streams lose themselves in oceans whenever we talk quietly together of that strange new difficult life that she is going so bravely and so joyously to meet i know by her expression that ronalds noble face a little shy a little proud but altogether adoring serves her for courage and for inspiration and she feels that his hand is holding hers across the distance in a clasp that promises strength at five oclock we longed to ring for hot water but did not dare even at six there was no sound of life in the cosy inn which we have named the cromwell arms mrs duddy manageress comfort cleanliness courtesy night porter cycling shed from seven to halfpast we read pages and pages of delicious history and legend and decided to go from cappoquin to youghal by steamer if we could possibly reach the place of departure in time at halfpast seven we pulled the bell energetically nothing happened and we pulled again and again discovering at last that the connection between the bellrope and the bellwire had long since disappeared though it had been more than once established with bits of twine fishingline and shoe laces francesca then went across the hall to examine her methods of communication and presently i heard a welcome tinkle and another and another followed in due season by a cheerful voice saying dont desthroy it intirely maam ill be coming direckly we ordered jugs of hot water and were told that it would be some time before it could be had as ladies were not in the habit of calling for it before nine in the morning and as the damper of the kitchenrange was out of order did we wish it in a little canteen with whisky and a bit of lemonpeel or were we afther wantin it in a jug we replied promptly that it was not the hour for toddy but the hour for baths with us and the decrepit and very sleepy night porter departed to wake the cook and build the fire advising me first in a friendly way to take the hearth brush that was kapin the windy up and rap on the wall if i needed annything more at eight oclock we heard the porters shuffling step in the hall followed by a howl and a polite objurgation a strange dog had passed the night under francescas bed and the porter was giving him what he called a good hand and fut downstairs he had put down the hot water for this operation and on taking up the burden again we heard him exclaim arrah look at that now may the divil fly away with the excommunicated ould jug it was past saving the jug and leaked so freely that one had to be exceedingly nimble to put to use any of the smoky water in it thim fools o turf do nothing but smoke on me apologised the venerable servitor who then asked would we be pleased to order breakquist we were wise in our generation and asked for nothing but bacon eggs and tea and after a smoky bath and a change of raiment we seated at our repast in the coffeeroom feeling wonderfully fresh and cheerful by looking directly at each other most of the time and making experimental journeys from plate to mouth thus barring out any intimate knowledge of the tablecloth and the waiters linen we managed to make a breakfast francesca is enough to give any one a good appetite ronald macdonald will be a lucky fellow i think to begin his day by sitting opposite her for her eyes shine like those of a child and ones gaze lingers fondly on the cool freshness of her cheek breakfast over and the bill settled we speedily shook off as much of the dust of mrs duddys hotel as could be shaken off and departed on the most decrepit sidecar that ever rolled on two wheels being wished a safe journey by a slatternly maid who stood in the doorway by the wide mrs duddy herself who realised in her capacious person the picturesque irish phrase the fullofthedoor of a woman and by our friend the head waiter who leaned against mrs duddys ancestral pillars in such a way that the morning sun shone full upon his costume and revealed its weaknesses to our reluctant gaze the driver said it was eleven miles to cappoquin the guidebook fourteen but this difference of opinion we find is only the difference between irish and english miles for which our driver had an unspeakable contempt as of a vastly inferior quality he had on the other hand a great respect for mrs duddy and her comfortable cleanly and courteous establishment as per advertisement and the warmest admiration for the village in which she had appropriately located herself a village which he alluded to as wan of the natest towns in the ring of ireland for if ye made a slip in the street of it be the help of god ye were always sure to fall into a publichouse we had better not tell the full particulars of this journey to salemina said francesca prudently as we rumbled along though oddly enough if you remember whenever any one speaks disparagingly of ireland she always takes up cudgels in its behalf francesca now that you are within three or four months of being married can you manage to keep a secret yes she whispered eagerly squeezing my hand and inclining her shoulder cosily to mine yes oh yes and how it would raise my spirits after a sleepless night when salemina was eighteen she had a romance and the hero of it was the son of an irish gentleman an mp who was travelling in america or living there for a few years i cant remember which he was nothing more than a lad less than twentyone years old but he was very much in love with salemina how far her feelings were involved i never knew but she felt that she could not promise to marry him her mother was an invalid and her father a delightful scholarly autocratic selfish old gentleman who ruled his household with a rod of iron salemina coddled and nursed them both during all her young life indeed little as she realised it she never had any separate existence or individuality until they both died when she was thirtyone or two years old and what became of the young irishman was he faithful to his first love or did he marry he married many years afterward and that was the time i first heard the story his marriage took place in dublin on the very day i believe that saleminas father was buried for fate has the most relentless way of arranging these coincidences i dont remember his name and i dont know where he lives or what has become of him i imagine the romance has been dead and buried in roseleaves for years salemina never has spoken of it to me but it would account for her sentimental championship of ireland chapter ix the light of other days oft in the stilly night ere slumbers chain has bound me fond memory brings the light of other days around me thomas moore if you want to fall head over ears in love with ireland at the very first sight of her charms take as we did the steamer from cappoquin to youghal and float down the vale of the blackwater swift awniduff which of the englishman is cal de blackwater the shores of this irish rhine are so lovely that the sail on a sunny day is one of unequalled charm behind us the mountains ranged themselves in a mysterious melancholy background ahead the river wended its way southward in and out in and out through rocky cliffs and wellwooded shores the first tributary stream that we met was the little finisk on the higher banks of which is affane house the lands of affane are said to have been given by one of the fitzgeralds to sir walter raleigh for a breakfast a very high price to pay for bacon and eggs and it was here that he planted the first cherrytree in ireland bringing it from the canary islands to the isle of weeping looking back just below here we saw the tower and cloisters of mount melleray the trappist monastery very beautiful and very lonely looked the little town of god in the shadows of the gloomy hills we wished we had known the day before how near we were to it for we could have claimed a nights lodging at the ladies guesthouse where all creeds classes and nationalities are received with a ceadmilefailte and where any offering for food or shelter is given only at the visitors pleasure the celtic proverb melodious is the closed mouth might be written over the cloisters for it is a village of silence and only the monks who teach in the schools or who attend visitors are absolved from the vow a hundred thousand welcomes next came dromana castle where the extraordinary old countess of desmond was born the wonderful old lady whose supposed one hundred and forty years so astonished posterity she must have married thomas twelfth earl of desmond after as his first wife is known to have been alive in that year raleigh saw her in and she died in so it would seem that she must have been at least one hundred and ten or one hundred and twelve when she met her untimely death a death brought about entirely by her own youthful impetuosity and her fondness for athletic sports robert sydney second earl of leicester makes the following reference to her in his tablebook written when he was ambassador at paris about the old countess of desmond was a marryed woman in edward iv time in england and lived till towards the end of queen elizabeth so she must needes be neare one hundred and forty yeares old she had a new sett of teeth not long afore her death and might have lived much longer had she not mett with a kinde of violent death for she would needes climbe a nuttree to gather nuts so falling down she hurt her thigh which brought a fever and that fever brought death this my cousin walter fitzwilliam told me it is true that the aforesaid cousin walter may have been a better raconteur than historian still local tradition vigorously opposes any lessening of the number of the countesss years pinning its faith rather on one hayman who says that she presented herself at the english court at the age of one hundred and forty years to petition for her jointure which she lost by the attainder of the last earl and it also prefers to have her fall from the historic cherrytree that sir walter planted rather than from a casual nuttree down the lovely river we went lazily lying back in the sun almost the only passengers on the little craft as it was still far too early for tourists down past villierstown cooneen ferry strancally castle with its murdering hole made famous by the lords of desmond through the broads of clashmore then past temple michael an old castle of the geraldines which cromwell battered down for dire insolence until we steamed slowly into the harbour of youghal and to use our drivers expression there is no more onderhanded manin in youghal than the town of the yew wood which is much prettier to the eye and sweeter to the ear here we found a letter from salemina and expended another eighteenpence in telegraphing to her peabody coolkilla house near mardyke walk cork we are under yew tree at myrtle grove where raleigh and spenser smoked read manuscript faerie queene and planted first potato delighted benella better join you tomorrow dont encourage archaeologist penesca we had a charming hour at myrtle grove house an unpretentious gabled dwelling for a time the residence of the illfated soldier captain sir walter raleigh you remember perhaps that he was mayor of youghal in after the suppression of the geraldine rebellion the vast estates of the earl of desmond and those of one hundred and forty of the leading gentlemen of munster his adherents were confiscated and proclamation was made all through england inviting gentlemen to undertake the plantation of this rich territory estates were offered at two or three pence an acre and no rent was to be paid for the first five years many of these great undertakers as they were called were english noblemen who never saw ireland but among them were raleigh and spenser who received fortytwo thousand and twelve thousand acres respectively and in consideration of certain patronage undertook to carry the business of the crown through parliament francesca was greatly pleased with this information culled mostly from joyces childs history of ireland the volume had been bought in dublin by salemina and presented to us as a piece of genial humour but it became our daily companion i made a rhyme for her which she sent miss peabody to show her that we were growing in wisdom notwithstanding our separation from her you have thought of sir walter as soldier and knight edmund spenser youve heard was well able to write but raleigh the planter and spenser versemaker each oddly enough was by trade undertaker it was in that the shepherd of the ocean as spenser calls him sailed to england to superintend the publishing of the faerie queene so from what i know of authors habits it is probable that spenser did read him the poem under the yew tree in myrtle grove garden it seems long ago does it not when the faerie queene was a manuscript tobacco just discovered the potato a novelty and the first irish cherrytree just a wee thing newly transplanted from the canary islands were our own cherrytrees already in america when columbus discovered us or did the pilgrim fathers bring over slips or grafts knowing that they would be needed for george washington later on so that he might furnish an untruthful world with a sublime sentiment we reread saleminas letter under the yew tree coolkilla house cork my dearest girls it seems years instead of days since we parted and i miss the two madcaps more than i can say in your absence my life is always so quiet discreet dignified and yes i confess it so monotonous i go to none but the best hotels meet none but the best people and my timidity and conservatism for ever keep me in conventional paths dazzled and terrified as i still am when you precipitate adventures upon me i always find afterwards that i have enjoyed them in spite of my fears life without you is like a stenographic report of a dull sermon with you it is by turns a dramatic story a poem and a romance sometimes it is a pennydreadful as when you deliberately leave your luggage on an express train going south enter another standing upon a side track and embark for an unknown destination i watched you from an upper window of the junction hotel but could not leave benella to argue with you when your respected husband and lover have charge of you you will not be allowed such pranks i warrant you benella has improved wonderfully in the last twentyfour hours and i am trying to give her some training for her future duties we can never forget our native land so long as we have her with us for she is a perfect specimen of the puritan spinster though too young in years perhaps for determined celibacy do you know we none of us mentioned wages in our conversations with her fortunately she seems more alive to the advantages of foreign travel than to the filling of her empty coffers by the way i have written to the purser of the ship that she crossed in to see if i can recover the sixty or seventy dollars she left behind her her principal idea in life seems to be that of finding some kind of work that will be interestin whether it is lucrative or not i dont think she will be able to dress hair or anything of that sort save in the way of plain sewing she is very unskilful with her hands and she will be of no use as courier she is so provincial and inexperienced she has no head for business whatever and cannot help francesca with the accounts she recites to herself again and again four farthings make one penny twelvepence make one shilling twenty shillings make one pound but when i give her a handful of money and ask her for six shillings and sixpence five and three one pound two or two pound ten she cannot manage the operation she is docile well mannered grateful and really likable but her present philosophy of life is a thing of shreds and patches she calls it the science as if there were but one and she became a convert to its teachings this past winter while living in the house of a woman lecturer in salem a lecturer not a curist she explains she attended to the door ushered in the members of classes kept the lectureroom in order and so forth imbibing by the way various doctrines or parts of doctrines which she is not the sort of person to assimilate but with which she is experimenting holding meantime a grim intuition of their foolishness or so it seems to me the science made it easier for her to seek her ancestors in a foreign country with only a hundred dollars in her purse for the salem priestess proclaims the glad tidings that all the wealth of the world is ours if we will but assert our heirship benella believed this more or less until a weeks seasickness undermined all her new convictions of every sort when she woke in the little bedroom at ocarolans she says her heart was quite at rest for she knew that we were the kind of people one could rely on i mustered courage to say i hope so and i hope also that we shall be able to rely upon you benella this idea evidently had not occurred to her but she accepted it and i could see that she turned it over in her mind you can imagine that this vague philosophy of a salem woman scientist superimposed on a foundation of orthodoxy makes a curious combination and one which will only be temporary we shall expect you tomorrow evening and we shall be quite ready to go on to the lakes of killarney or wherever you wish by the way i met an old acquaintance the morning i arrived here i went to see queens college and as i was walking under the archway which has carved upon it where finbarr taught let munster learn i saw two gentlemen they looked like professors and i asked if i might see the college they said certainly and offered to take my card into some one who would do the honours properly i passed it to one of them we looked at each other and recognition was mutual he dr la touche is giving a course of lectures here on irish antiquities it has been a great privilege to see this city and its environs with so learned a man i wish you could have shared it yesterday he made up a party and we went to passage which you may remember in father prouts verses the town of passage is both large and spacious and situated upon the say tis nate and dacent and quite adjacent to come from cork on a summers day there you may slip in and take a dippin fornent the shippin that at anchor ride or in a wherry cross oer the ferry to carrigaloe on the other side dr la touche calls father prout an irish potato seasoned with attic salt is not that a good characterisation goodbye for the moment as i must see about benellas luncheon yours affectionately sp chapter x the belles of shandon the spreading lee that like an island fayre encloseth corke with his divided floode edmund spenser we had seen all that youghal could offer to the tourist we were yearning for salemina we wanted to hear benella talk about the science we were eager to inspect the archaeologist to see if he would do for salemina instead of the canon or even the minor canon of the english church for whom we had always privately destined her accordingly we decided to go by an earlier train and give our family a pleasant surprise it was five oclock in the afternoon when our car trundled across st patricks bridge past father mathews statue and within view of the church and bells of shandon that sound so grand on the pleasant waters of the river lee away to the west is the twoarmed river along its banks rise hills green and well wooded with beautiful gardens and verdant pastures reaching to the very brink of the shining stream it was saturday afternoon and i never drove through a livelier quainter more easygoing town the streets were full of people selling various things and plying various trades and among them we saw many a girl pretty enough to recall thackerays admiration of the corkagian beauties of his day there was one in particular driving a donkey in a strawcoloured governess cart to whose graceful charm we succumbed on the instant there was an exquisite deluderin wildness about her a vivacity a length of eyelash with a gleam of irish grey eye the greyest of all things blue the bluest of all things grey that might well have inspired the english poet to write of her as he did of his own irish wife for spenser when he was not writing the faerie queene or smoking raleighs fragrant weed wooed and wedded a fair colleen of county cork tell me ye merchant daughters did ye see so fayre a creature in your town before her goodlie eyes like sapphyres shining bright her forehead ivory white her lips like cherries charming men to byte now we turned into the old mardyke walk a rus in urbe an avenue a mile long lined with noble elmtrees forsaken now as a fashionable promenade for the marina but still beautiful and still beloved though frequented chiefly by nursemaids and children such babies and such children of all classes and conditions so jolly smiling dimpled curlyheaded such joyous disregard of rags and dirt such kindness one to the other in the little groups where a child of ten would be giving an anxious eye to four or five brothers and sisters and mothering a contented baby in arms as well our driver though very loquacious was not quite intelligible he pronounced the simple phrase st patricks street in a way to astonish the traveller it would seem impossible to crowd as many hs into three words and to wrap each in flannel as he succeeded in doing he seemed pleased with our admiration of the babies and said that irish children did be very fat and strong and hearty that they were the very best soldiers the queen had god kape her they could stand anny hardship and anny climate for they were not brought up soft like the english he also said that fine as all irish children undoubtedly were cork produced the flower of them all and the finest women and the finest men backing his opinion with an homeric vaunt which francesca took down on the spot id back one man from corkshire to bate ten more from yorkshire kerrymen agin derrymen and munster agin creation wirrasthrue tis a pity we arent a nation here he slackened his pace as we passed a small bosthoon driving a donkey to call out facetiously be good to your little brother achree we must be very near coolkilla house by this time said francesca that isnt salemina sitting on the bench under the trees is it there is a gentleman with her and she never wears a wide hat but it looks like her red umbrella no of course it isnt for whoever it is belongs to that maid with the two children penelope it is borne in upon me that we shouldnt have come here unannounced three hours ahead of the time arranged perhaps whenever we had chosen to come it would have been too soon wouldnt it be exciting to have to keep out of saleminas way as she has always done for us i couldnt endure it it would make me homesick for ronald go slowly driver please nevertheless as we drew nearer we saw that it was salemina or at least it was seveneighths of her and oneeighth of a new person with whom we were not acquainted she rose to meet us with an exclamation of astonishment and after a hasty and affectionate greeting presented dr la touche he said a few courteous words and to our relief made no allusions to round towers duns raths or other antiquities and bade us adieu saying that he should have the honour of waiting upon us that evening with our permission a person in a neat black dress and little black bonnet with white lawn strings now brought up the two children to say goodbye to salemina it was the derelict benella dusenberry clothed in maids apparel and looking notwithstanding that disguise like a new england schoolmaam she was delighted to see us scanned every detail of francescas travelling costume with the frankest admiration and would have allowed us to carry our wraps and umbrellas upstairs if she had not been reminded by salemina we had a cosy cup of tea together and told our various adventures but salemina was not especially communicative about hers oddly enough she had met the la touche children at the hotel in mallow they were travelling with a very raw irish nurse who had no control of them whatever they shrieked and kicked when taken to their rooms at night until salemina was obliged to speak to them in order that benellas rest should not be disturbed i felt so sorry for them she said the dear little girl put to bed with tangled hair and unwashed face the boy in a rumpled untidy nightgown the bedclothes in confusion i didnt know who they were nor where they came from but while the nurse was getting her supper i made them comfortable and broona went to sleep with my strange hand in hers perhaps it was only the warm irish heart the easy friendliness of the irish temperament but i felt as if the poor little things must be neglected indeed or they would not have clung to a woman whom they had never seen before this is a mistake anybody who has the opportunity always clings to salemina the next morning they were up at daylight romping in the hall stamping thumping clattering with a tin cart on wheels rattling behind them i know it was not my affair and i was guilty of unpardonable rudeness but i called the nurse into my room and spoke to her severely no you neednt smile i was severe will you kindly do your duty and keep the children quiet as they pass through the halls i said it is never too soon to teach them to obey the rules of a public place and to be considerate of older people she seemed awestruck but when she found her tongue she stammered sure maam ive tould thim three times this day already that when their father comes hell bate thim with a blackthorn stick naturally i was horrified this i thought would explain everything no mother and an irritable cruel father will he really do such a thing i asked feeling as if i must know the truth sure he will not maam she answered cheerfully he wouldnt lift a feather to thim not if they murdthered the whole counthryside maam well they travelled third class to cork and we came first so we did not meet and i did not ask their surnames but it seems that they were being brought to their father whom i met many years ago in america as she did not volunteer any further information we did not like to ask her where how many years ago or under what circumstances teasing of this sort does not appeal to the sophisticated at any time but it seems unspeakably vulgar to touch on matters of sentiment with a woman of middle age if she has memories they are sure to be sad and sacred ones if she has not that perhaps is still sadder we agreed however when the evening was over that dr la touche was probably the love of her youth unless indeed he was simply an old friend and the degree of saleminas attachment had been exaggerated something that is very likely to happen in the gossip of a new england town where they always incline to underestimate the feeling of the man and overrate that of the woman in any love affair i guess shed take him if she could get him is the spoken or unspoken attitude of the public in rural or provincial new england the professor is grave but very genial when he fully recalls the fact that he is in company and has not like the trappist monks taken vows of silence francesca behaved beautifully on the whole and made no embarrassing speeches although she was in her gayest humour salemina blushed a little when the young sinner dragged into the conversation the remark that undoubtedly from the beginning of the sixth century to the end of the eighth ireland was the university of europe just as greece was in the late days of the roman republic and asked our guest when ireland ceased to be known as insula sanctorum et doctorum the island of saints and scholars we had seen her go into saleminas bedroom and knew perfectly well that she had consulted the peabody notebook lying open on the desk but the professor looked as surprised as if he had heard a pretty paroquet quote gibbon i dont like to see grave and reverend scholars stare at pretty paroquets but i wont belittle saleminas exquisite and peculiar charm by worrying over the matter wirra wirra ologone cant ye lave a lad alone till hes proved theres no tradition left of any other girl not even trojan helen in beauty all excellin whos been up to half the divilment of fan fitzgerl of course francescas heart is fixed upon ronald macdonald but that fact has not altered the glance of her eyes they no longer say wouldnt you like to fall in love with me if you dared but they still have a gleam that means dont fall in love with me it is no use and of the two one is about as dangerous as the other and each has something of fan fitzgerls divilment wid her brows of silky black arched above for the attack her eyes they dart such azure death on poor admiring man masther cupid point your arrows from this out agin the sparrows for youre bested at loves archery by young miss fan of course himself never fell a prey to francescas fascinations but then he is not susceptible you could send him off for a tenmile drive in the moonlight with venus herself and not be in the least anxious dr la touche is grey for his years tall and spare in frame and there are many lines of anxiety or thought in his forehead but a wonderful smile occasionally smooths them all out and gives his face a rare though transient radiance he looks to me as if he had loved too many books and too few people as if he had tried vainly to fill his heart and life with antiquities which of all things perhaps are the most bloodless the least warming and nourishing when taken in excess or as a steady diet himself god bless him shall never have that patient look if i can help it but how it will appeal to salemina there are women who are born to be petted and served and there are those who seem born to serve others saleminas first idea is always to make tangled things smooth like little broonas curly hair to bring sweet and discreet order out of chaos to prune and graft and water and weed and tend things until they blossom for very shame under her healing touch her mind is catholic well ordered and broad for ever full of other peoples interests never of her own and her heart always seems to me like some dim sweetscented guestchamber in an old new england mansion cool and clean and quiet and fragrant of lavender it has been a lovely generous life lived for the most part in the shadow of other peoples wishes and plans and desires i am an impatient person i confess and heaven seems so far away when certain things are in question the righting of a childs wrong or the demolition of a barrier between two hearts above all for certain surgical operations more or less spiritual such as removing scales from eyes that refuse to see and stops from ears too dull to hear nobody shall have our salemina unless he is worthy but how i should like to see her life enriched and crowned how i should enjoy having her dear little overworn second fiddle taken from her by main force and a beautiful first violin or even the baton for leading an orchestra put into her unselfish hands and so goodbye and good luck to ye cork and your pepperbox steeple for we leave you tomorrow chapter xi the rale thing her ancestors were kings before moses was born her mother descended from great grana uaile charles lever knockarney house lough lein we are in the province of munster the kingdom of kerry the town of ballyfuchsia and the house of mrs mullarkey knockarney house is not her name for it i made it myself killarney is church of the sloetrees and as kill is church the onderhanded manin of arney must be something about sloes then since knock means hill knockarney should be hill of the sloetrees i have not lost the memory of jenny geddes and tam o the cowgate but penelope oconnor daughter of the king of connaught is more frequently present in my dreams i have by no means forgotten that there was a time when i was not irish but for the moment i am of the turf turfy francesca is really as much in love with ireland as i only since she has in her heart a certain tender string pulling her all the while to the land of the heather she naturally avoids comparisons salemina too endeavours to appear neutral lest she should betray an inexplicable interest in dr la touches country benella and i alone are really free to speak the brogue and carry our wild harps slung behind us like moores minstrel boy nothing but the ignorance of her national dishes keeps benella from entire allegiance to this island but she thinks a people who have grown up without a knowledge of doughnuts baked beans and blueberrypie must be lacking in moral foundations there is nothing extraordinary in all this for the irish like the celtic tribes everywhere have always had a sort of fascinating power over people of other races settling among them so that they become completely fused with the native population and grow to be more irish than the irish themselves we stayed for a few days in the best hotel it really was quite good and not a bit irish there was a swiss manager an english housekeeper a french head waiter and a german office clerk even salemina who loves comforts saw that we should not be getting what is known as the real thing under these circumstances and we came here to this what shall i call knockarney house it was built originally for a fishing lodge by a sporting gentleman who brought parties of friends to stop for a week on his death is passed somehow into mrs mullarkeys fair hands and in a fatal moment she determined to open it occasionally to paying guests who might wish a quiet home far from the madding crowd of the summer tourist this was exactly what we did want and here we encamped on the halfhearted advice of some irish friends in the town who knew nothing else more comfortable to recommend with us small quiet or outoftheway places are never clean or if they are then they are not irish they said you had better see ireland from the tourists point of view for a few years yet until we have learned the art of living but if you are determined to know the humours of the people cast all thought of comfort behind you so we did and we afterward thought that this would be a good motto for mrs mullarkey to carve over the door of knockarney house my name for it is adopted more or less by the family though francesca persists in dating her letters to ronald from the rale thing which it undoubtedly is we take almost all the rooms in the house but there are a few other guests mrs waterford an old lady of ninetythree from mullinavat is here primarily for her health and secondarily to dispose of threepenny shares in an antique necklace which is to be raffled for the benefit of a roman catholic chapel then we have a fishing gentleman and his bride from glasgow and occasional bicyclers who come in for a dinner a tea or a lodging these three comforts of a home are sometimes quite indistinguishable with us the tea is frequently made up of fragments of dinner and the beds are always sprinkled with crumbs their source is a mystery unless they fall from the clothing of the chambermaids who frequently drop hairpins and brooches and buttons between the sheets and strew whisk brooms and scissors under the blankets we have two general servants who are supposed to do all the work of the house and who are as amiable and obliging and incapable as they well can be oonah generally waits upon the table and molly cooks at least she cooks now and then when she is not engaged with peter in the vegetable garden or the stable but whatever happens mrs mullarkey as a descendant of one of the irish kings is to be looked upon only as an inspiring ideal inciting one to high and ever higher flights of happy incapacity benella ostensibly oversees the care of our rooms but she is comparatively helpless in such a kingdom of misrule why demand clean linen when there is none why seek for a towel at midday when it is never ironed until evening how sweep when a broom is all inadequate to the task saleminas usual remark on entering a humble hostelry anywhere is if the hall is as dirty as this what must the kitchen be order me two hardboiled eggs please use your science benella i say to that discouraged new england maiden who has never looked at her philosophy from its practical or humorous side if the universe is pure mind and there is no matter then this dirt is not a real thing after all it seems of course as if it were thicker under the beds and bureaus than elsewhere but i suppose our evil thoughts focus themselves there rather than in the centre of the room similarly if the broom handle is broken deny the dirt away denial is much less laborious than sweeping bring the science down to these simple details of everyday life and you will make converts by dozens only pray dont remove either by suggestion or any cruder method the large key that lies near the table leg for it is a landmark and there is another a crochet needle by the washstand devoted to the same purpose i wish to show them to the mullarkey when we leave under our educational regime the metaphysical veneer badly applied in the first place and wholly unsuited to the foundation material is slowly disappearing and our benella is gradually returning to her normal self perhaps nothing has been more useful to her development than the confusion of knockarney house our windows are supported on decrepit tennis rackets and wornout hearth brushes the blinds refuse to go up or down the chairs have weak backs or legs the door knobs are disassociated from their handles as for our food we have bacon and eggs with coffee made i should think of brown beans and liquorice for breakfast a bit of sloppy chicken or fish and potato with custard pudding or stewed rhubarb for dinner and a cold supper of oh anything that occurs to molly at the last moment nothing ever occurs either to molly or oonah at any previous moment and in that they are merely conforming to the universal habit last week when we were starting for valencia island the ballyfuchsia stationmaster was absent at a funeral meantime the engine had gone cold on the engineer and the train could not leave till twelve minutes after the usual time we thought we must have consulted a wrong timetable and asked confirmation of a man who seemed to have some connection with the railway goaded by his ignorance i exclaimed is it possible you dont know the time the trains are going begorra how should i he answered faix the thrains dont always be knowin thimselves the starting of the daily mail express from ballyfuchsia is a time of great excitement and confusion which on some occasions increases to positive panic the stationmaster armed with a large dinnerbell stands on the platform wearing an expression of anxiety ludicrously unsuited to the situation the supreme moment had really arrived some time before but he is waiting for farmer brodigan with his daughter kathleen and the widdy sullivan and a few other local worthies who are a thrifle late on him finally they come down the hill and he paces up and down the station ringing the bell and uttering the warning cry this thrain never shtops this thrain never shtops this thrain never shtops giving one the idea that eternity instead of killarney must be the final destination of the passengers the clock in the ballyfuchsia telegraph and post office ceases to go for twentyfour hours at a time and nobody heeds it while the postman always has a few moments leisure to lay down his knapsack of letters and pitch quoits with the royal irish constabulary however punctuality is perhaps an individual virtue more than an exclusively national one i am not sure that we americans would not be more agreeable if we spent a month in ireland every year and perhaps ireland would profit from a month in america at the brodigans mr brodigan is a large farmer and our nearest neighbour all the clocks are from ten to twenty minutes fast or slow and what a peaceful place it is the family doesnt care when it has its dinner and mirabile dictu the cook doesnt care either if you have no exact time to depend upon how do you catch trains i asked mr brodigan sure thats not an everyday matter and why be foostherin over it but we do four times out o five maam how do you like it that fifth time when you miss it sure its no more throuble to you to miss it the wan time than to hurry five times a clock is an overrated piece of furniture to my mind mrs beresford maam a man can ate whin hes hungry go to bed whin hes sleepy and get up whin hes slept long enough for faith and its thim clocks he has inside of himself that dont need anny winding what if you had a business appointment with a man in the town and missed the train i persevered trains is like misfortunes they never come singly maam wherever theres a station the trains do be dhroppin in now and again and whats the differ which of thim you take the man who is waiting for you at the other end of the line may not agree with you i suggested sure a man can always amuse himself in a town maam if its your own business youre coming on he knows youll find him and if its his business then begorra let him find you which quite reminded me of what the irish elf says to the english elf in moira oneills fairy story a waste of time why youve come to a country where theres no such thing as a waste of time we have no value for time here there is lashings of it more than anybody knows what to do with i suppose there is somewhere a golden mean between this complete oblivion of time and our feverish american hurry there is a tedious haste in all people who make wheels and pistons and engines and live within sound of their everlasting buzz and whir and revolution and there is ever a disposition to pause rest and consider on the part of that man whose daily tasks are done in serene collaboration with dew and rain and sun one cannot hurry mother nature very much after all and one who has much to do with her falls into a peaceful habit of mind the mottoes of the two nations are as well rendered in the vernacular as by any formal or stilted phrases in ireland the spoken or unspoken slogan is take it aisy in america keep up with the procession and between them lie all the thousand differences of race climate temperament religion and government i dont suppose there is a nation on the earth better developed on what might be called the traincatching side than we of the big country and it is well for us that there is born every now and again among us a dreamer who is blessedly oblivious of timetables and market reports who has been thinking of the rustling of the corn not of its price it is he if we do not hurry him out of his dream who will sound the ideal note in our hurlyburly and bustle of affairs he may never discover a town site but he will create new worlds for us to live in and in the course of a century the coming matthew arnold will not be minded to call us an unimaginative and uninteresting people chapter xii life at knockarney house see where mononias heroes lie proud owen mores descendants tis they that won the glorious name and had the grand attendants james clarence mangan it was a charming thing for us when dr la touche gave us introductions to the colquhouns of ardnagreena and when they in turn took us to tea with lord and lady killbally at balkilly castle i dont know what there is about us we try to live a sequestered life but there are certain kind forces in the universe that are always bringing us in contact with the good the great and the powerful francesca enjoys it but secretly fears to have her democracy undermined salemina wonders modestly at her good fortune i accept it as the graceful tribute of an old civilisation to a younger one the older men grow the better they like girls of sixteen and why shouldnt the same thing be true of countries as long ago as one of the english undertakers who obtained some of the confiscated desmond lands in munster wrote of the better sorte of irish although they did never see you before they will make you the best cheare their country yieldeth for two or three days and take not anything therefor they have a common saying which i am persuaded they speake unfeinedly which is defend me and spend me yet many doe utterly mislike this or any good thing that the poor irishman dothe this certificate of character from an undertaker of the sixteenth century certainly speaks volumes for irish amiability and hospitality since it was given at a time when grievances were as real as plenty when unutterable resentment must have been rankling in many minds and when those traditions were growing which have coloured the whole texture of irish thought until with the poor and unlettered to be agin the government is an inherited instinct to be obliterated only by time we supplement mrs mullarkeys helterskelter meals with frequent luncheons and dinners with our new friends who send us home on our jauntingcar laden with flowers fruit even with jellies and jams lady killbally forces us to take three cups of tea and a halfdozen marmalade sandwiches whenever we go to the castle for i apologised for our appetites one day by confessing that we had lunched somewhat frugally the meal being sweetened however by mollys explanation that there was a fresh sole in the house but she thought she would not inthrude on it before dinner we asked on our arrival at knockarney house if we might breakfast at a regular hour say eight thirty mrs mullarkey agreed with that suavity which is after her untidiness her distinguishing characteristic but notwithstanding this arrangement we break our fast sometimes at nine forty sometimes at nine twenty sometimes at nine but never earlier in order to achieve this much we are obliged to rise early and make a combined attack on the executive and culinary departments one morning i opened the door leading from the hall into the back part of the establishment but closed it hastily having interrupted the toilets of three young children whose existence i had never suspected and of mr mullarkey whom i had thought dead for many years each child had donned one article of clothing and was apparently searching for the mate to it whatever it chanced to be mrs mullarkey was fully clothed and was about to administer correction to one of the children who unhappily for him was not i retired to my apartment to report progress but did not describe the scene minutely nor mention the fact that i had seen saleminas ivorybacked hairbrush put to excellent if somewhat unusual and unaccustomed service each party in the house eats in solitary splendour like the macdermott prince of coolavin that royal personage of county sligo did not i believe allow his wife or his children who must have had the macdermott blood in their veins even if somewhat diluted to sit at table with him this method introduces the last element of confusion into the household arrangements and on two occasions we have had our custard pudding or stewed fruit served in our bedrooms a full hour after we had finished dinner we have reasons for wishing to be first to enter the diningroom and we walk in with eyes fixed on the ceiling by far the cleanest part of the place having wended our way through an underbrush of corks with an empty bottle here and there and stumbled over the holes in the carpet we arrive at our table in the window it is as beautiful as heaven outside and the tablecloth is at least cleaner than it will be later for mrs waterford of mullinavat has an unsteady hand when oonah brings in the toast rack now she balances it carefully remembering the morning when she dropped it on the floor but picked up the slices and offered them to salemina never shall i forget that dear martyrs expression which was as if she had made up her mind to renounce ireland and leave her to her fate i know she often must wonder if dr la touches servants like mrs mullarkeys feel of the potatoes to see whether they are warm or cold at ten thirty there is great confusion and laughter and excitement for the sportsmen are setting out for the day and the car has been waiting at the door for an hour oonah is carolling up and down the long passage laden with dishes her cheerfulness not in the least impaired by having served seven or eight separate breakfasts molly has spilled a jug of milk and is wiping it up with a childs undershirt the glasgy man is telling them that yesterday they forgot the corkscrew the salt the cup and the jam from the luncheon basket facts so mirthprovoking that molly wipes tears of pleasure from her eyes with the milky undershirt and oonah sets the hotwater jug and the coffeepot on the stairs to have her laugh out comfortably when once the car departs comparative quiet reigns in and about the house until the passing bicyclers appear for luncheon or tea when oonah picks up the napkins that we have rolled into wads and flung under the diningtable and spreads them on teatrays as appetising details for the weary traveller there would naturally be more time for housework if so large a portion of the day were not spent in pleasant interchange of thought and speech i can well understand mrs colquhouns objections to the housing of the dublin poor in tenements even in those of a better kind than the present horrible examples for wherever they are huddled together in any numbers they will devote most of their time to conversation to them talking is more attractive than eating it even adds a new joy to drinking and if i may judge from the groups i have seen gossiping over a turf fire till midnight it is preferable to sleeping but do not suppose they will bubble over with joke and repartee with racy anecdote to every casual newcomer the tourist who looks upon the irishman as the merryandrew of the englishspeaking world and who expects every jarvey he meets to be as whimsical as mickey free will be disappointed i have strong suspicions that ragged jovial mickey free himself delicious as he is was created by lever to satisfy the anglosaxon idea of the lowcomedy irishman you will live in the emerald isle for many a month and not meet the clown or the villain so familiar to you in modern irish plays dramatists have made a stage irishman to suit themselves and the public and the gallery are disappointed if anything more reasonable is substituted for him you will find too that you do not easily gain paddys confidence misled by his careless reckless impetuosity of demeanour you might expect to be the confidant of his joys and sorrows his hopes and expectations his faiths and beliefs his aspirations fears longings at the first interview not at all you will sooner be admitted to a glimpse of the travelling scotsmans or the englishmans inner life family history personal ambition glacial enough at first and far less voluble he melts soon enough if he likes you meantime your impulsive irish friend gives himself as freely at the first interview as at the twentieth and you know him as well at the end of a week as you are likely to at the end of a year he is a product of the past be he gentleman or peasant a few hundred years of necessary reserve concerning articles of political and religious belief have bred caution and prudence in stronger natures cunning and hypocrisy in weaker ones our days are very varied we have been several times into the town and spent an hour in the petty sessions court with mr colquhoun who sits on the bench each time we have come home laden with stories as good as any in the books so says francesca have we not with our own eyes seen the settlement of an assault and battery case between two of the most notorious brawlers in that alley of the town which we have dubbed the pass of the plumes each barrister in the case had a handful of hair which he introduced on behalf of his client both ladies apparently having pulled with equal energy these most unattractive exhibits were shown to the women themselves each recognising her own hair but denying the validity of the other exhibit firmly and vehemently prisoner number one kneeled at the rail and insisted on exposing the place in her head from which the hair had been plucked upon which prisoner number two promptly tore off her hat scattered hairpins to the four winds and exposed her own wounds to the judicial eye both prisoners had a dhrop taken just before the affair that soft impeachment they could not deny one of them explained however that she had taken it to help her over a hard job of work and through a little miscalculation of quantity it had overaided her the other termagant was asked flatly by the magistrate if she had ever seen the inside of a jail before but evaded the point with much grace and ingenuity by telling his honour that he couldnt expect to meet a woman anywhere who had not suffered a misforchin somewhere betwixt the cradle and the grave the original pass of the plumes is near maryborough and was so called from the number of english helmet plumes that were strewn about after omoores fight with five hundred of the earl of essexs men even the all too common drunkanddisorderly cases had a flavour of their own for one man being dismissed with a small fine under condition that he would sign the pledge assented willingly but on being asked for how long he would take it replied i mostly take it for life your worship we also heard the testimony of a girl who had run away from her employer before the completion of her six months contract her plea being that the fairies pulled her great toe at night so that she could not sleep whereupon she finally became so lame that she was unable to work she left her employers house one evening therefore and went home and curiously enough the fairies shtopped pulling the toe on her as soon as iver she got there not the least enlivening of the prisoners was a decently educated person who had been arrested for disturbing the peace the constable asserted that he was intoxicated but the gentleman himself insisted that he was merely a poet in a more than usually inspired state i am in the poetical advertising line your worship it is true i was surrounded by a crowd but i was merely practising my trade i dont mind telling your worship that this holidaytime makes things a little lively and the tradesmen drink my health a trifle oftener than usual poetry is dry work your worship and a poet needs a good deal of liquid refreshment i do not disturb the peace your worship at least not more than any other poet i go to a grocers and standing outside i make up some rhymes about his nice sweet sugar or his ale if i want to please a butcher well ill give you a specimen heres to the butcher who sells good meat in this world its hard to beat its the very best thats to be had and makes the human heart feel glad theres no necessity to purloin so step in and buy a good sirloin i can go on in this style like tennysons brook for ever your worship his worship was afraid that he might make the offer good and the poet was released after promising to imbibe less frequently when he felt the divine afflatus about to descend upon him these disagreements between lighthearted and bibulous persons who haunt the courts week after week have nothing especially pathetic about them but there are many that make ones heart ache many that seem absolutely beyond any solution and beyond reach of any justice chapter xiii o the sound of the kerry dancing the lighthearted daughters of erin like the wild mountain deer they can bound their feet never touch the green island but music is struck from the ground and oft in the glens and green meadows the ould jig they dance with such grace that even the daisies they tread on look up with delight in their face james mkowen one of our favourite diversions is an occasional glimpse of a crossroads dance on a pleasant sunday afternoon when all the young people of the district are gathered together their religious duties are over with their confessions and their masses and the priests encourage these decorous sabbath gaieties a place is generally chosen where two or four roads meet and the dancers come from the scattered farmhouses in every direction in ballyfuchsia they dance on a flat piece of road under some firtrees and larches with stretches of mountain covered with yellow gorse or purple heather and the quiet lakes lying in the distance a message comes down to us at ardnagreena where we commonly spend our sunday afternoons that they expect a good dance and the blind boy is coming to fiddle and so if you will be coming up its welcome youll be we join them about five oclock passing on our way groups of boys of all ages from sixteen upwards walking in twos and threes and parties of three or four girls by themselves for it would not be etiquette for the boys and girls to walk together such strictness is observed in these matters about here when we reach the rendezvous we find quite a crowd of young men and maidens assembled the girls all at one side of the road neatly dressed in dark skirts and light blouses with the national woollen shawl over their heads two wide stone walls or dykes with turf on top make capital seats and the boys are at the opposite side as custom demands when a young man wants a partner he steps across the road and asks a colleen who lays aside her shawl generally giving it to a younger sister to keep until the dance is over when the girls go back to their own side of the road and put on their shawls again upon our arrival we find the sets are already in progress a set being a dance like a very intricate and very long quadrille we are greeted with many friendly words and the young boatmen and farmers sons ask the ladies will you be pleased to dance miss some of them are shy and say they are not familiar with the steps but their wouldbe partners remark encouragingly sure and what matter ill see you through soon all are dancing and the state of the road is being discussed with as much interest as the floor of a ballroom eager directions are given to the more ignorant newcomers such as twirl your girl captain or turn your back to your face rather a difficult direction to carry out but one which conveys its meaning salemina confided to her partner that she feared she was getting a bit old to dance he looked at her grey hair carefully for a moment and then said chivalrously id not say that that was old age maam id say it was eddication when the sets which are very long and very decorous are finished sometimes a jig is danced for our benefit the spectators make a ring and the chosen dancers go into the middle where their steps are watched by a most critical and discriminating audience with the most minute and intense interest our molly is one of the best jig dancers among the girls here would that she were half as clever at cooking but if you want to see an artist of the first rank you must watch kitty orourke from the neighbouring village of dooclone the half door of the barn is carried into the ring by one or two of her admirers whom she numbers by the score and on this she dances her famous jig polthogue sometimes alone and sometimes with art rooney the only worthy partner for her in the kingdom of kerry arts mother bid rooney is a keen matchmaker and we heard her the other day advising her son who was going to dooclone to have a weeny court with his colleen to put a clane shirt on him in the middle of the week and disthract kitty intirely by showin her he had three of thim annyway kitty is a beauty and doesnt need to be made purty wid cows a feat that the old irishman proposed to do when he was consummating a match for his plain daughter but the gifts of the gods seldom come singly and kitty is well fortuned as well as beautiful fifty pounds her own bedstead and its fittings a cow a pig and a web of linen are supposed to be the dazzling total so that it is small wonder her deluderin ways are maddening half the boys in ballyfuchsia and dooclone she has the prettiest pair of feet in the county kerry and when they are encased in a smart pair of shoes bought for her by arts rival the big constable from ballyfuchsia barracks how they do twinkle and caper over that half barn door to be sure even murty the blind fiddler seems intoxicated by the plaudits of the bystanders and he certainly never plays so well for anybody as for kitty of the meadow blindness is still common in ireland owing to the smoke in these wretched cabins where sometimes a hole in the roof is the only chimney and although the scores of blind fiddlers no longer traverse the land finding a welcome at all firesides they are still to be found in every community blind murty is a favourite guest at the rooneys cabin which is never so full that there is not room for one more there is a small wooden bed in the main room a settle that opens out at night with hens in the straw underneath where a board keeps them safely within until they have finished laying there are six children besides art and my ambition is to photograph or still better to sketch the family circle together the hens cackling under the settle the pig him as pays the rint snoring in the doorway as a proprietor should while the children are picturesquely grouped about i never succeed because mrs rooney sees us as we turn into the lane and calls to the family to make itself ready as qualitys comin in sight the older children can scramble under the bed slip shoes over their bare feet and be out in front of the cabin without the loss of a single minute mickey jewl the baby who is only four but who can handle a stick as bould as a man is generally clad in a ragged skirt slit every few inches from waist to hem so that it resembles a cotton fringe the little coateen that tops this costume is sometimes by way of diversion transferred to the dog who runs off with it but if we appear at this unlucky moment there is a stylish yoke of pink ribbon and soiled lace which one of the girls pins over mickey jewls naked shoulders moya who has this eye for picturesque propriety is a great friend of mine and has many questions about the big country when we take our walks she longs to emigrate but the time is not ripe yet the girls that come back has a lovely style to thim she says wistfully but theyre so polite they cant live in the cabins anny more and be contint the boys are not always so improved she thinks youd niver find a boy in ballyfuchsia that would say annything rude to a girl but when they come back from ameriky its too free theyve grown intirely it is a dull life for them she says when they have once been away though to be sure ballyfuchsia is a pleasanter place than dooclone where the priest does not approve of dancing and however secretly you may do it the curate hears of it and will speak your name in church it was moya who told me of kittys fortune shes not the match that farmer brodigans daughter kathleen is to be sure for hes a rich man and has given her an iligant eddication in cork so that she can look high for a husband she wont be takin up wid anny of our boys wid her two hundred pounds and her twenty cows and her pianya och its a thriminjus player she is maam shes that quick and that strong that youd say she wouldnt lave a string on it some of the young men and girls never see each other before the marriage moya says but sure she adds shyly id niver be contint with that though some love matches doesnt turn out anny better than the others i hope it will be a love match with you and that i shall dance at your wedding moya i say to her smilingly faith im thinkin my husbands intinded mother died an old maid in dublin she answers merrily its a small fortune ill be havin and few lovers but youll be soon dancing at kathleen brodigans wedding or kitty orourkes maybe i do not pretend to understand these humble romances with their foundations of cows and linen which are after all no more sordid than bank stock and trousseaux from paris the sentiment of the irish peasant lover seems to be frankly and truly expressed in the verses oh moyas wise and beautiful has wealth in plenteous store and fortune fine in calves and kine and lovers half a score her faintest smile would saints beguile or sinners captivate oh i think a dale of moya but ill surely marry kate now to let you know the raison why i cannot have my way nor bid my heart decide the part the lover must obeythe calves and kine of kate are nine while moya owns but eight so with all my love for moya im compelled to marry kate i gave moya a lace neckerchief the other day and she was rarely pleased running into the cabin with it and showing it to her mother with great pride after we had walked a bit down the boreen she excused herself for an instant and returning to my side explained that she had gone back to ask her mother to mind the kerchief and not let the cow knock it lady kilbally tells us that some of the girls who work in the mills deny themselves proper food and live on bread and tea for a month to save the price of a gay ribbon this is trying no doubt to a philanthropist but is it not partly a starved sense of beauty asserting itself if it has none of the usual outlets where can imagination express itself if not in some paltry thing like a ribbon chapter xiv mrs mullarkeys iligant locks where spreads the beautiful water to gay or cloudy skies and the purple peaks of killarney from ancient woods arise william allingham mrs mullarkey cannot spoil this paradise for us when i wake in the morning the fuchsiatree outside my window is such a glorious mass of colour that it distracts my eyes from the unwashed glass the air is still the mountains in the far distance are clear purple everything is fresh washed and purified for the new day francesca and i leave the house sleeping and make our way to the bogs we love to sit under a blossoming sloebush and see the silver pools glistening here and there in the turf cuttings and watch the transparent vapour rising from the redbrown of the purpleshadowed bog fields dinnis rooney half awake leisurely silent is moving among the stacks with his creel how the missel thrushes sing in the woods and the plaintive note of the curlew gives the last touch of mysterious tenderness to the scene there is a moist rich fragrance of meadowsweet and bog myrtle in the air and how fresh and wild and verdant it is for theres plenty to mind sure if ony ye look to the grass at your feet for tis thick wid the tussocks of heather an blossoms and herbs that smell sweet if ye tread thim an maybe the white o the bogcotton waves in the win like the wool ye might shear off a nightmoth an set an ould fairy to spin or wee frauns each wan stuck twixt two leaves on a grand little stem of its own lettin on twas a plum on a tree jane barlow as for lough lein itself who could speak its loveliness lying like a crystal mirror beneath the black reeks of the mcgillicuddy where in the mountain fastnesses lie spellbound the sleeping warriors who with their bridles and broadswords in hand await but the word to give erin her own when we glide along the surface of the lakes on some bright day after a heavy rain when we look down through the clear water on tiny submerged islets with their grasses and drowned daisies glancing up at us from the blue when we moor the boat and climb the hillsides we are dazzled by the luxuriant beauty of it all it hardly seems real it is too green too perfect to be believed and one thinks of some fairy dropscene painted by cunningfingered elves and sprites who might have a wee folks way of mixing roses and rainbows dewdrenched greens and sunwarmed yellows showing the picture to you first all burnished glittering and radiant then veiled in mist and diamonded with showers we climb climb up up into the heart of the leafy loveliness peering down into dewy dingles stopping now and again to watch one of the countless streams as it tinkles and gurgles down an emerald ravine to join the lakes the way is strewn with lichens and mosses rich green hollies and arbutus surround us on every side the ivy hangs in sweet disorder from the rocks and when we reach the innermost recess of the glen we can find moist green jungles of ferns and bracken a very bending curling forest of fronds the fairys tall palmtree the heath birds fresh nest and the couch the red deer deems the sweetest and best carrantual rears its crested head high above the other mountains and on its summit shon the outlaw footsore weary slept sighing for once thank god i am above all my enemies you must go to sweet innisfallen too and you must not be prosaic or incredulous at the boatmans stories or turn the bodthered ear to them these are no ordinary hillsides not only do the wee folk troop through the frond forests nightly but great heroic figures of romance have stalked majestically along these mountain summits every waterfall foaming and dashing from its rocky bed in the glen has a legend in the toss and swirl of the water cant you see the osullivan famous for fleetness of foot and prowess in the chase starting forth in the cool o the morn to hunt the red deer his dogs sniff the heather a splendid stag bounds across the path swift as lightning the dogs follow the scent across moors and glens throughout the long day the chieftain chases the stag until at nightfall weary and thirsty he loses the scent and blows a blast on his horn to call the dogs homeward and then he hears a voice osullivan turn back he looks over his shoulder to behold the great finn mccool central figure in centuries of romance why do you dare chase my stag he asks because it is the finest man ever saw answers the chieftain composedly you are a valiant man says the hero pleased with the reply and as you thirst from the long chase i will give you to drink so he crunches his giant heel into the rock and forth burst the waters seething and roaring as they do to this day and may the divil fly away wid me if ive spoke an unthrue word maam come to lough lein as did we too early for the crowd of sightseers but when the long light shakes across the lakes the blackest arts of the tourist and they are as black as they are many cannot break the spell sitting on one of these hillsides we heard a buglecall taken up and repeated in delicate ethereal echoes sweet enough indeed to be worthy of the fairy buglers who are supposed to pass the sound along their lines from crag to crag until it faints and dies in silence and then came the lament for owen roe oneil we were thrilled to the very heart with the sorrowful strains and when we issued from our leafy covert and rounded the point of rocks from which the sound came we found a fat man in uniform playing the bugle blanks tours was embroidered on his cap and i have no doubt that he is a good husband and father even a good citizen but he is a blight upon the landscape and fancy cannot breathe in his presence the typical tourist should be encouraged within bounds both because he is of some benefit to ireland and because ireland is of inestimable benefit to him but he should not be allowed to jeer and laugh at the legends the gentle smile of sophisticated unbelief with its twinkle of amusement is unknown to and for ever beyond him and above all he should never be allowed to carry or to play on a concertina for this is the unpardonable sin we had an adventure yesterday we were to dine at eight oclock at balkilly castle where dr la touche is staying the weekend with lord and lady killbally we had been spending an hour or two after tea in writing an irish letter and were a bit late in dressing these letters written in the vernacular are a favourite diversion of ours when visiting in foreign lands and they are very easily done when once you have caught the idioms for you can always supplement your slender store of words and expressions with choice selections from native authors what francesca and i wore to the castle dinner is alas no longer of any consequence to the community at large in the mysterious purposes of that third volume which we seem to be living in ireland francescas beauty and mine her hats and frocks as well as mine are all reduced to the background but saleminas toilet had cost us some thought when she first issued from the discreet and decorous fastnesses of salem society she had never donned any dinner dress that was not as high at the throat and as long in the sleeves as the puritan mothers ever wore to meeting in england she lapsed sufficiently from the rigid salem standard to adopt a timid compromise in scotland we coaxed her into still further modernities until now she is completely enfranchised we achieved this at considerable trouble but do not grudge the time spent in persuasion when we see her en grande toilette in day dress she has always been inclined ever so little to a primness and severity that suggest oldmaidishness in her low gown of pale grey with all her silver hair waved softly she is unexpectedly lovely her face softened transformed and magically brought out by the whiteness of her shoulders and slender throat not an ornament not a jewel will she wear and she is right to keep the nunlike simplicity of style which suits her so well and which holds its own even in the vicinity of francescas proud and glowing young beauty on this particular evening francesca who wished her to look her best had prudently hidden her eyeglasses for which we are now trying to substitute a silverhandled lorgnette two years ago we deliberately smashed her spectacles which she had adopted at fiveandtwenty but they are more convenient than eyeglasses she urged obtusely that argument is beneath you dear we replied if your hair were not prematurely grey we might permit the spectacles hideous as they are but a combination of the two is impossible the world shall not convict you of failing sight when you are guilty only of petty astigmatism the grey satin had been chosen for this dinner and salemina was dressed with the exception of the pretty pearlembroidered waist that has to be laced at the last moment and had slipped on a dressing jacket to come down from her room in the second story to be advised in some trifling detail she looked unusually well i thought her eyes were bright and her cheeks flushed as she rustled in holding her satin skirts daintily away from the dusty carpets now from the morning of our arrival we have had trouble with the mullarkey doorknobs which come off continually and lie on the floors at one side of the door or the other benella followed salemina from her room and being in haste closed the door with unwonted energy she heard the wellknown rattle and clang but little suspected that as one knob dropped outside in the hall the other fell inside carrying the rod of connection with it it was not long before we heard a cry of despair from above and we responded to it promptly its fell in on the inside knob and all as i always knew it would some day and now we cant get back into the room said benella oh nonsense we can open it with something or other i answered encouragingly as i drew on my gloves only you must hasten for the car is at the door the curling iron was too large the shoe hook too short a lead pencil too smooth a crochet needle too slender we tried them all and the door resisted all our insinuations must you necessarily get in before we go i asked salemina thoughtlessly she gave me a glance that almost froze my blood as she replied the waist of my dress is in the room francesca and i spent a moment in irrepressible mirth and then summoned mrs mullarkey whether the irish kings could be relied upon in an emergency i do not know but their descendants cannot mrs mullarkey had gone to the convent to see the mother superior about something mr mullarkey was at the dooclone market peter was not to be found but oonah and molly came and also the old lady from mullinavat with a package of raffle tickets in her hand we left this small army under benellas charge and went down to my room for a hasty consultation could you wear any evening bodice of francescas i asked of course not francescas waist measure is three inches smaller than mine could you manage my black lace dress penelope you know it would only reach to my ankles no you must go without me and go at once we are too new acquaintances to keep lady killballys dinner waiting why did i come to this place like a pauper with only one evening gown when i should have known that if there is a castle anywhere within forty miles you always spend half your time in it this slur was totally unjustified but i pardoned it because saleminas temper is ordinarily perfect and the circumstances were somewhat tragic if you had brought a dozen costumes they would all be in your room at this moment i replied but we must think of something it is impossible for you to remain behind we were invited more on your account than our own for you are dr la touches friend and the dinner is especially in his honour molly have you a ladder sorra a wan maam could we borrow one we could not mrs beresford maam then see if you can break down the door try hard and if you succeed i will buy you a nice new one part of miss peabodys dress is inside the room and we shall be late to the castle dinner the entire corps with mrs waterford of mullinavat on top cast itself on the door which withstood the shock to perfection then in a moment we heard wearys on it it will not come down for us maam its the iligant locks we do be havin in the house theyre mortial shtrong maam strong indeed exclaimed the incensed benella in a burst of new england wrath theres nothing strong about the place but the impidence of the people in it if you had told peter to get a carpenter or a locksmith as ive been asking you these two weeks it would have been all right but you never do anything till a month after its too late ive no patience with such a set of doshies dawdling around and leaving everything to go to rack and ruin sure it was yourself that ruinated the thing responded molly with spirit for the unaccustomed word doshy had kindled her quick irish temper its aisy handlin the knob is used to and faith it would a stuck there for you a twelvemonth they will be quarrelling soon said salemina nervously do not wait another instant you are late enough now and i insist on your going make any excuse you see fit say i am ill say i am dead if you like but dont tell the real excuse it is too shiftless and wretched and embarrassing dont cry benella molly oonah go downstairs to your work mrs waterford i think perhaps you have forgotten that we have already purchased raffle tickets and well not take any more for fear that we may draw the necklace goodbye dears tell lady killbally i shall see her tomorrow chapter xv penelope weaves a web why the shovel and tongs to each other belongs and the kettle sings songs full of family glee while alone with your cup like a hermit you sup och hone widow machree samuel lover francesca and i were gloomy enough as we drove along facing each other in ballyfuchsias one insidecar a strange and fearsome vehicle partaking of the nature of a brokendown omnibus a hearse and an overgrown black beetle it holds four or at a squeeze six the seats being placed from stem to stern lengthwise and the balance being so delicate that the passengers when going uphill are shaken into a heap at the door which is represented by a ragged leather flap i have often seen it strew the hard highroad with passengers as it jolts up the steep incline that leads to ardnagreena and the fares who succeed in staying in always sit in one anothers laps a good part of the way a method pleasing only to relatives or intimate friends francesca and i agreed to tell the real reason of saleminas absence it is irelands fault and i will not have america blamed for it she insisted but it is so embarrassing to be going to the dinner ourselves and leaving behind the most important personage think of dr la touches disappointment think of saleminas and theyll never understand why she couldnt have come in a dressing jacket i shall advise her to discharge benella after this episode for no one can tell the effect it may have upon all our future lives even those of the doctors two poor motherless children it is a fourmile drive to balkilly castle and when we arrived there we were so shaken that we had to retire to a dressingroom for repairs then came the dreaded moment when we entered the great hall and advanced to meet lady killbally who looked over our heads to greet the missing salemina francescas beauty my supposed genius both fell flat it was salemina whose presence was especially desired the company was assembled save for one guest still more tardy than ourselves and we had a moment or two to tell our story as sympathetically as possible it had an uncommonly good reception and coupled with the irish letter i read at dessert carried the dinner along on a basis of such laughter and goodfellowship that finally there was no place for regret save in the hearts of those who knew and loved salemina poor salemina spending her dull lonely evening in our rooms and later on in her own uneventful bed if indeed she had been lucky enough to gain access to that bed i had hoped lady killbally would put one of us beside dr la touche so that we might at least keep saleminas memory green by tactful conversation but it was too large a company to rearrange and he had to sit by an empty chair which perhaps was just as salutary after all the dinner was very smart and the company interesting and clever but my thoughts were elsewhere as there were fewer squires than dames at the feast lady killbally kindly took me on her left with a view to better acquaintance and i was heartily glad of a possible chance to hear something of dr la touches earlier life in our previous interviews saleminas presence had always precluded the possibility of leading the conversation in the wishedfor direction when i first saw gerald la touche i felt that he required explanation usually speaking a human being ought to be able in an evenings conversation to explain himself without any adventitious aid if he is a man alive vigorous well poised conscious of his own individuality he shows you without any effort as much of his past as you need to form your impression and as much of his future as you have intuition to read as opposed to the vigorous personality there is the colourless flavourless insubstantial sort forgotten as soon as learned and for ever confused with that of the previous or the next comer when i was a beginner in portraitpainting i remember that after i had succeeded in making my background stay back where it belonged my figure sometimes had a way of clinging to it in a kind of smudgy weakness as if it were afraid to come out like a man and stand the inspection of my eye how often have i squandered paint upon the ungrateful object without adding a cubit to its stature it refused to look like flesh and blood but resembled rather some halfmade creature flung on the passive canvas in a liquid state with its edges running over into the background there are a good many of these people in literature too heroes who like homemade paper dolls do not stand up well or if they manage to perform that feat one unexpectedly discovers when they are placed in a strong light that they have no vital organs whatever and can be seen through without the slightest difficulty dr la touche does not belong to either of these two classes he is not warm magnetic powerful impressive neither is he by any means destitute of vital organs but his personality is blurred in some way he seems a bit remote absentminded and a trifle just a trifle overresigned privately i think a man can afford to be resigned only to one thing and that is the will of god against all other odds i prefer to see him fight till the last armed foe expires dr la touche is devotedly attached to his children but quite helpless in their hands so that he never looks at them with pleasure or comfort or pride but always with an anxiety as to what they may do next i understand him better now that i know the circumstances of which he has been the product of course one is always a product of circumstances unless one can manage to be superior to them his wife the daughter of an american consul in ireland was a charming but somewhat featherbrained person rather given to whims and caprices very pretty very young very much spoiled very attractive very undisciplined all went well enough with them until her father was recalled to america because of some change in political administration the young mrs la touche seemed to have no resources apart from her family and even her baby jackeen failed to absorb her as might have been expected we thought her a most trying woman at this time said lady killbally she seemed to have no thought of her husbands interests and none of the responsibilities that she had assumed in marrying him her only idea of life appeared to be amusement and variety and gaiety gerald was a student and always very grave and serious the kind of man who invariably marries a butterfly if he can find one to make him miserable he was exceedingly patient but after the birth of little broona adeline became so homesick and depressed and discontented that although the journey was almost an impossibility at the time gerald took her back to her people and left her with them while he returned to his duties at trinity college their life i suppose had been very unhappy for a year or two before this and when he came home to dublin without his children he looked a sad and broken man he was absolutely faithful to his ideals i am glad to say and never wavered in his allegiance to his wife however disappointed he may have been in her going over regularly to spend his long vacations in america although she never seemed to wish to see him at last she fell into a state of hopeless melancholia and it was rather a relief to us all to feel that we had judged her too severely and that her unreasonableness and her extraordinary caprices had been born of mental disorder more than of moral obliquity gerald gave up everything to nurse her and rouse her from her apathy but she faded away without ever once coming back to a more normal self and that was the end of it all geralds father had died meanwhile and he had fallen heir to the property and the estates they were very much encumbered but he is gradually getting affairs into a less chaotic state and while his fortune would seem a small one to you extravagant americans he is what we irish paupers would call well to do lady killbally was suspiciously willing to give me all this information so much so that i ventured to ask about the children they are captivating neglected little things she said madame la touche an aged aunt has the ostensible charge of them and she is a most easygoing person the servants are of the old family sort the reckless improvident untidy devoted quarrelsome creatures that always stand by the ruined irish gentry in all their misfortunes and generally make their life a burden to them at the same time gerald is a saint and therefore never complains it never seems to me that saints are altogether adapted to positions like these i sighed sinners would do ever so much better i should like to see dr la touche take off his halo lay it carefully on the bureau and wield a battleaxe the world will never acknowledge his merit it will even forget him presently and his life will have been given up to the evolution of the passive virtues do you suppose he will recognise the tender passion if it ever does bud in his breast or will he think it a weed instead of a flower and let it wither for want of attention i think his friends will have to enhance his selfrespect or he will for ever be too modest to declare himself said lady killbally perhaps you can help us he is probably going to america this winter to lecture at some of your universities and he may stay there for a year or two so he says at any rate if the right woman ever appears on the scene i hope she will have the instinct to admire and love and reverence him as we do and here she smiled directly into my eyes and slipping her pretty hand under the tablecloth squeezed mine in a manner that spoke volumes it is not easy to explain ones desire to marry off all the unmarried persons in ones vicinity when i look steadfastly at any group of people large or small they usually segregate themselves into twos under my prophetic eye it they are nice and attractive i am pleased to see them mated if they are horrid and disagreeable i like to think of them as improving under the discipline of matrimony it is joy to see beauty meet a kindling eye but i am more delighted still to watch a man fall under the glamour of a plain dull girl and it is ecstasy for me to see a perfectly unattractive stupid woman snapped up at last when i have given up hopes of settling her in life sometimes there are men so uninspiring that i cannot converse with them a single moment without yawning but though failures in all other relations one can conceive of their being tolerably useful as husbands and fathers not for ones self you understand but for ones neighbours dr la touches life now to any understanding eye is as incomplete as the unfinished window in aladdins tower he is too wrinkled too studious too quiet too patient for his years his children need a mother his old family servants need discipline his baronial halls need sweeping and cleaning i havent seen them but i know they do and his aged aunt needs advice and guidance on the other hand there are those i speak guardedly who have walked in shady sequestered paths all their lives looking at hundreds of happy lovers on the sunny highroad but never joining them those who adore erudition who love children who have a genius for unselfish devotion who are sweet and refined and clever and who look perfectly lovely when they put on grey satin and leave off eyeglasses they say they are over forty and although this probably is exaggeration they may be thirtynine and threequarters and if so the time is limited in which to find for them a worthy mate since half of the masculine population is looking for itself and always in the wrong quarter needing no assistance to discover rosecheeked idiots of nineteen whose obvious charms draw thousands to a dull and uneventful fate these thoughts were running idly through my mind while the honourable michael mcgillicuddy was discoursing to me of mr gladstones misunderstanding of irish questions a misunderstanding he said so colossal so temperamental and so allembracing that it amounted to genius i was so anxious to return to salemina that i wished i had ordered the car at ten thirty instead of eleven but i made up my mind as we ladies went to the drawingroom for coffee that i would seize the first favourable opportunity to explore the secret chambers of dr la touches being i love to rummage in outoftheway corners of peoples brains and hearts if they will let me i like to follow a courteous host through the public corridors of his house and come upon a little chamber closed to the casual visitor if i have known him long enough i put my hand on the latch and smile inquiringly he looks confused and conscious but unlocks the door then i peep in and often i see something that pleases and charms and touches me so much that it shows in my eyes when i lift them to his to say thank you sometimes after that my host gives me the key and says gravely pray come in whenever you like when dr la touche offers me this hospitality i shall find out whether he knows anything of that lavenderscented guestroom in saleminas heart first has he ever seen it second has he ever stopped in it for any length of time third was he sufficiently enamoured of it to occupy it on a long lease chapter xvi salemina has her chance and what use is ones life widout chances yeve always a chance wid the tide jane barlow i was walking with lady fincoss and francesca with miss clondalkin a very learned personage who has deciphered more undecipherable inscriptions than any lady in ireland when our eyes fell upon an unexpected tableau seated on a divan in the centre of the drawingroom in a most distinguished attitude in unexceptionable attire and with the rosecoloured lights making all her soft greys opalescent was miss salemina peabody our exclamations of astonishment were so audible that they must have reached the diningroom for lord killbally did not keep the gentlemen long at their wine salemina cannot tell a story quite as it ought to be told to produce an effect she is too reserved too concise too rigidly conscientious she does not like to be the centre of interest even in a modest contretemps like being locked out of a room which contains part of her dress but from her brief explanation to lady killbally her more complete and confidential account on the way home and benellas graphic story when we arrived there we were able to get all the details when the insidecar passed out of view with us it appears that benella wept tears of rage at the sight of which oonah and molly trembled in that moment of despair and remorse her mind worked as it must always have done before the salem priestess befogged it with hazy philosophies understood neither by teacher nor by pupil peter had come back but could suggest nothing benella forgot her science which prohibits rage and recrimination and called him a great hulking lazy vagabone and told him shed like to have him in salem for five minutes just to show him a man with head on his shoulders you call this a christian country she said and you havent got a screwdriver nor a bradawl nor a monkeywrench nor a rattail file nor no kind of a useful tool to bless yourselves with and my miss peabody thats worth ten dozen of you put together has got to stay home from the castle and eat warmedup scraps served in courses with twenty minutes wait between em now you do as i say take the diningtable and set it out under the window and the carvingtable on top o that and see how fur up itll reach i guess you cant stump a salem woman by telling her there aint no ladder the two tables were finally in position but there still remained nine feet of distance to that key of the situation saleminas window and mrs waterfords dressingtable went on top of this pile now peter were the next orders if youve got sprawl enough and want to rest yourself by doin something useful for once in your life you just hold down the diningtable and you and oonah molly keep the next two tables stiddy while i climb up the intrepid benella could barely reach the sill even from this ingeniously dizzy elevation and mrs waterford and salemina were called on to stiddy the tables while molly was bidden to help by giving an heroic boost when the word of command came the device was completely successful and in a trice the conqueror disappeared to reappear at the window holding the precious pearlembroidered bodice wrapped in a towel i wouldnt stop to fool with the doorknob till i dropped you this she said oonah you go and wash your hands clean and help miss peabody into it and mind you start the lacing right at the top and you peter run down to rooneys and get the donkey and the cart and bring em back with you and dont you let the grass grow under your feet neither there was literally no other mode of conveyance within miles and time was precious salemina wrapped herself in francescas long black cloak and climbed into the cart dinnis hauls turf in it takes a sack of potatoes or a pig to market in it and the stubborn little ass blind of one eye has never in his wholly elective course of existence taken up the subject of speed it was eight oclock when benella mounted the seat beside salemina and gave the donkey a preliminary touch of the stick be aisy wid him cautioned peter hes a very arch donkey for a lady to be dhrivin and mebbe hed lay down and not get up for you arrah shut yer mouth pether give him a couple of belts anondher the hind leg melady and thatll put the fear o god in him said dinnis id rather not go at all urged salemina timidly its too late and too extraordinary im not going to have it on my conscience to make you lose this dinnerparty not if i have to carry you on my back the whole way said benella doggedly and this donkey wont lay down with me moren once i can tell him that right at the start sure melady hell go to galway for you when oncet hes started wid himself and its only a couple o fingers to the castle annyways the fourmile drive especially through the village of ballyfuchsia was an eventful one but by dint of prodding poking and belting benella had accomplished half the distance in threequarters of an hour when the donkey suddenly lay down on her according to peters prediction this was luckily at the town cross where a group of idlers rendered hearty assistance willing as they were to succour a lady in disthress they did not know of any car which could be secured in time to be of service but one of them offered to walk and run by the side of the donkey so as to kape him on his legs it was in this wise that miss peabody approached balkilly castle and when a gilded gentlemaninwaiting lifted her from rooneys plain cart she was just on the verge of hysterics fortunately his magnificence was english and betrayed no surprise at the arrival in this humble fashion of a dinner guest but simply summoned the irish housekeeper who revived her with wine and called on all the saints to witness that shed never heard of such a shameful thing and such a disgrace to ballyfuchsia the idea of not keeping a ladder in a house where the doorknobs were apt to come off struck her as being the worst feature of the accident though this unexpected and truly milesian view of the matter had never occurred to us well i got miss peabody to the dinnerparty said benella triumphantly when she was laboriously unlacing my frock later on or at least i got her there before it broke up i had to walk every step o the way home and the donkey laid down four times but i was so nerved up i didnt care a mite i was bound miss peabody shouldnt lose her chance after all shes done for me her chance i asked somewhat puzzled for dinners even castle dinners are not rare in saleminas experience yes her chance repeated benella mysteriously youd know well enough what i mean if youd ben born and brought up in salem massachusetts copy of a letter read by penelope oconnor descendant of the king of connaught at the dinner of lord and lady killbally at balkilly castle it needed no apology then but in sending it to our american friends we were obliged to explain that though the irish peasants interlard their conversation with saints angels and devils and use the name of the virgin mary and even the almighty with to our ears undue familiarity and frequency there is no profane or irreverent intent they are instinctively religious and it is only because they feel on terms of such friendly intimacy with the powers above that they speak of them so often at the widdy mullarkeys knockarney house ballyfuchsia county kerry och musha bedad man alive but its a fine counthry over here and it bangs all the jewel of a view we do be havin from the windys begorra knockarney

penelope oconnor beresford part third ulster chapter xvii the glens of antrim silent o moyle be the roar of thy water break not ye breezes your chain of repose while murmuring mournfully lirs lovely daughter tells to the nightstar her tale of woes thomas moore the sea between erin and alban ireland and scotland was called in the olden time the sea of moyle from the moyle or mull of cantire sorley boy hotel glens of antrim we are here for a week in the neighbourhood of cushendun just to see a bit of the northeastern corner of erin where at the end of the nineteenth century as at the beginning of the seventeenth the population is almost exclusively catholic and celtic the gaelic sorley boy is in irish state papers carolus flavus yellowhaired charles the most famous of the macdonnell fighters the one who when recognised by elizabeth as lord of the route and given a patent for his estates burned the document before his retainers swearing that what had been won by the sword should never be held by the sheepskin cushendun was one of the places in our literary pilgrimage because of its association with that charming irish poetess and good glenswoman who calls herself moira oneill this country of the glens east of the river bann escaped plantation and that accounts for its celtic character when the grand ulster chieftains the odonnells and the oneills of donegal went under the third great house of ulster the macdonnells of the isles was more fortunate and thanks to its scots blood found favour with james i it was a macdonnell who was created first earl of antrim and given a grant of the glens and the route from the curran of larne to the cutts of coleraine ballycastle is our nearest large town and its great days were all under the macdonnells where in the franciscan abbey across the bay it is said the ground literally heaves with clandonnell dust here are buried those of the clan who perished at the hands of shane oneillshane the proud who signed himself myself oneill and who has been called the shaker of ulster here too are those who fell in the great fight at slieveanaura up in glen shesk when the macdonnells finally routed the older lords the mquillans a clansman once went to the countess of antrim to ask the lease of a farm another macdonnell asked the countess why you must all be macdonnells in the low glens ay said the man too many macdonnells now but not one too many on the day of aura from the cliffs of antrim we can see on any clear day the sea of moyle and the bonnie blue hills of scotland divided from ulster at this point by only twenty miles of sea path the irish or gaels or scots of uladh often crossed in their curraghs to this lovely coast of alba then inhabited by the picts here when the tide drains out wid itself beyant the rocks we sit for many an hour perhaps on the very spot from which they pushed off their boats the mull of cantire runs out sharply toward you south of it are ailsa craig and the soft ayrshire coast north of the mull are blue blue mountains in a semicircle and just beyond them somewhere francesca knows are the argyleshire highlands and oh the pearl and opal tints that the irish atmosphere flings over the scene shifting them ever at will in misty sun or radiant shower and how lovely are the too rare bits of woodland the ground is sometimes white with wild garlic sometimes blue with hyacinths the primroses still linger in moist hidden places and there are violets and marsh marigolds everything wears the colour of hope if there are buds that will never bloom and birds that will never fly the great motherheart does not know it yet i wonder said salemina if that is why we think of autumn as sad because the story of the year is known and told long long before the clandonnell ruled these hills and glens and cliffs they were the home of celtic legend over the waters of the wee river margy with its halfmile course often sailed the four white swans those enchanted children of lir king of the isle of man who had been transformed into this guise by their cruel stepmother with a stroke of her druidical fairy wand after turning them into four beautiful white swans she pronounced their doom which was to sail three hundred years on smooth lough derryvara three hundred on the sea of erris sail and sail until the union of largnen the prince from the north with decca the princess from the south until the taillkenn should come to erinn bringing the light of a pure faith and until they should hear the voice of a christian bell they were allowed to keep their own gaelic speech and to sing sweet plaintive fairy music which should excel all the music of the world and which should lull to sleep all who listened to it we could hear it we three for we loved the story and love opens the ear as well as the heart to all sorts of sounds not heard by the dull and incredulous you may hear it too any fine soft day if you will sit there looking out on fair head and rathlin island and read the old fairy tale when you put down the book you will see finola lirs lovely daughter in any whitebreasted bird and while she covers her brothers with her wings she will chant to you her old song in the gaelic tongue a name given by the druids to st patrick ah happy is lirs bright home today with mirth and music and poets lay but gloomy and cold his childrens home for ever tossed on the briny foam our wreathed feathers are thin and light when the wind blows keen through the wintry night yet oft we were robed long long ago in purple mantles and robes of snow on moyles bleak current our food and wine are sandy seaweed and bitter brine yet oft we feasted in days of old and hazelmead drank from cups of gold our beds are rocks in the dripping caves our lullaby song the roar of the waves but soft rich couches once we pressed and harpers lulled us each night to rest lonely we swim on the billowy main through frost and snow through storm and rain alas for the days when round us moved the chiefs and princes and friends we loved joyces translation the fate of the children of lir is the second of erins three sorrows of story and the third and greatest is the fate of the sons of usnach which has to do with a sloping rock on the north side of fair head five miles from us here the three sons of usnach landed when they returned from alba to erin with deirdre deirdre who was beautiful as helen and gifted like cassandra with unavailing prophecy and by reason of her beauty many sorrows fell upon the ultonians naisi son of conor king of uladh had fled with deirdre daughter of phelim the kings storyteller to a seagirt islet on lough etive where they lived happily by the chase naisis two brothers went with them and thus the three sons of usnach were all in alba then the story goes on to say that fergus one of conors nobles goes to seek the exiles and naisi and deirdre while playing at the chess hear from the shore the cry of a man of erin it is against deirdres will that they finally leave alba with fergus who says birthright is first for ill it goes with a man although he be great and prosperous if he does not see daily his native earth so they sailed away over the sea and deirdre sang this lay as the shores of alba faded from her sight my love to thee o land in the east and tis ill for me to leave thee for delightful are thy coves and havens thy kind soft flowery fields thy pleasant greensided hills and little was our need of departing then in her song she went over the glens of their lordship naming them all and calling to mind how here they hunted the stag here they fished here they slept with the swaying fern for pillows and here the cuckoo called to them and never she sang would i quit alba were it not that naisi sailed thence in his ship they landed first under fair head and then later at rathlin island where their fate met them at last as deirdre had prophesied it is a sad story and we can easily weep at the thrilling moment when there being no man among the ultonians to do the kings bidding a norse captive takes naisis magic sword and strikes off the heads of the three sons of usnach with one swift blow and deirdre falling prone upon the dead bodies chants a lament and when she has finished singing she puts her pale cheek against naisis and dies and a great cairn is piled over them and an inscription in ogam set upon it we were full of legendary lore these days for we were fresh from a sight of glen ariff who that has ever chanced to be there in a pelting rain but will remember its innumerable little waterfalls and the great falls of essnacrubh and essnacraoibhe and who can ever forget the atmosphere of romance that broods over these irish glens we have had many advantages here as elsewhere for kind dr la touche lady killbally and mrs colquhoun follow us with letters and wherever there is an unusual personage in a district we are commended to his or her care sometimes it is one of the grand quality and often it is an ossianic sort of person like shaun ogrady who lives in a little whitewashed cabin and who has like mr yeatss gleeman the whole middle ages under his frieze coat the longer and more intimately we know these peasants the more we realise how much in imagination or in the clouds if you will they live the ragged man of leisure you meet on the road may be a philosopher and is still more likely to be a poet but unless you have something of each in yourself you may mistake him for a mere beggar the practical ones have all emigrated a dublin novelist told us and the dreamers are left the heads of the older ones are filled with poetry and legends they see nothing as it is but always through some iridescenttinted medium their waking moments when not tormented by hunger are spent in heaven and they all live in a dream whether it be of the next world or of a revolution effort is to them useless submission to everybody and everything the only safe course in a word fatalism expresses their attitude to life much of this submission to the inevitable is a product of past poverty misfortune and famine and the rest is undoubtedly a trace of the same spirit that we find in the lives and writings of the saints and which is an integral part of the mystery and the traditions of romanism we who live in the bright and sometimes staring sunlight of commonsense can hardly hope to penetrate the dim mysterious world of the catholic peasant with his unworldliness and sense of failure dr douglas hyde an irish scholar and staunch protestant says a pious race is the gaelic race the irish gael is pious by nature there is not an irishman in a hundred in whom is the making of an unbeliever the spirit and the things of the spirit affect him more powerfully than the body and the things of the body what is invisible for other people is visible for him he feels invisible powers before him and by his side and at his back throughout the day and throughout the night his mind on the subject may be summed up in the two sayings that of the early church let ancient things prevail and that of st augustine credo quia impossibile nature did not form him to be an unbeliever unbelief is alien to his mind and contrary to his feelings here only a few miles away is the slemish mountain where st patrick then a captive of the rich cattleowner milcho herded his sheep and swine here when his flocks were sleeping he poured out his prayers a christian voice in pagan darkness it was the memory of that darkness you remember that brought him back years after to convert milcho here too they say lies the great bard ossian for they love to think that finns son oisin the hero poet survived to the time of st patrick three hundred years after the other fianna had vanished from the earth the three centuries being passed in tirnanog the land of youth where the great oisin married the kings daughter niam of the golden hair ossian after the fianna is a phrase which has become the synonym of all survivors sorrow blinded by tears broken by age the hero bard when he returns to earth has no fellowship but with grief and thus he sings no hero now where heroes hurled long this night the clouds delay no man like me in all the world alone with grief and grey long this night the clouds delay i raise their grave carn stone on stone for finn and fianna passed away i ossian left alone pronounced isheen in munster oshin in ulster in more senses than one irish folklore is irish history at least the traditions that have been handed down from one generation to another contain not only the sometimes authentic record of events but a revelation of the milesian temperament with its mirth and its melancholy its exuberant fancy and its passion so in these weird tales there is plenty of history and plenty of poetry to one who will listen to it but the high and tragic story of ireland has been cherished mainly in the sorrowful traditions of a defeated race and the legends have not yet been wrought into undying verse erins songs of battle could only recount weary successions of flodden fields with never a bannockburn and its nimbus of victory for as ossian says of his countrymen they went forth to the war but they always fell but somewhere in the green isle is an unborn poet who will put all this mystery beauty passion romance and sadness these tragic memories these beliefs these visions of unfulfilled desire into verse that will glow on the page and live for ever somewhere is a mother who has kept all these things in her heart and who will bear a son to write them meantime who shall say that they have not been imbedded in the language as flower petals might be in amber that language which as an english scholar says has been blossoming there unseen like a hidden garland of roses and whenever the wind has blown from the west english poetry has felt the vague perfume of it chapter xviii limavady loveletters as beautiful kitty one morning was tripping with a pitcher of milk from the fair of coleraine when she saw me she stumbled the pitcher it tumbled and all the sweet buttermilk watered the plain anonymous we wanted to cross to rathlin island which is like an irish stockinge the toe of which pointeth to the main lande that would bring francesca six miles nearer to scotland and her scottish lover and we wished to see the castle of robert the bruce where according to the legend he learned his lesson from the six times baffled spider we delayed too long however and the sea of moyle looked as bleak and stormy as it did to the children of lir we had no mind to be swallowed up in brecains caldron where the grandson of niall and the nine hostages sank with his fifty curraghs so we took a day of golf at the ballycastle links salemina who is a neophyte found a forlorn lady driving and putting about by herself and they made a match just to increase the interest of the game there was but one boy in evidence and the versatile benella offered to caddie for them leaving the more experienced gossoon to francesca and me the irish caddie does not on the whole perhaps manifest so keen an interest in the fine points of the game as his scottish brother he is somewhat languid in his search for a ball and will occasionally when serving amiable ladies sit under a tree in the sun and speculate as to its whereabouts as for staying by you while you hole out on your last green he has no possible interest in that proceeding and is off and away giving his perfunctory and halfhearted polish to your clubs while you are passing through this thrilling crisis salemina wishing to know what was considered a good score by local players on these links asked our young friend what they got round in here and was answered they tries to go round in as few as possible maam but they mostly takes more we all came together again at luncheon and salemina returned flushed with victory she had made the nine hole course in one hundred and sixty and had beaten her adversary five up and four to play the next morning bright and early we left for coleraine a great presbyterian stronghold in what is called by the roman catholics the black north if we liked it and saw anything of kittys descendants or any nice pitchers to break or any reason for breaking them we intended to stop if not then to push on to the walled town of derry where foyle his swelling waters rolls northward to the main we thought it francescas duty as she was to be the wife of a scottish minister of the established church to look up presbyterianism in ireland whenever and wherever possible with a view to discoursing learnedly about it in her letters though as she confesses ingenuously ronald in his never so much as mentions presbyterianism as for ourselves we determined to observe all theological differences between protestants and roman catholics but leave presbyterianism to gang its ain gait we had devoted hours yes days in edinburgh to the understanding of the subtle and technical barriers which separated the free kirkers and the united presbyterians and the first thing they did after we had completely mastered the subject was to unite it is all very well for salemina who condenses her information and stows it away neatly but we who have small storage room and inferior methods of packing must be as economical as possible in amassing facts if we had been touring properly of course we should have been going to the giants causeway and the swinging bridge at carrickarede but propriety is the last thing we aim at in our itineraries we were within worshipping distance of two rather important shrines in our literary pilgrimage for we had met a very knowledgeable traveller at the sorley boy and after a little chat with him had planned a day of surprises for the academic miss peabody we proposed to halt at port stewart lunch at coleraine sleep at limavady and meantime salemina was to read all the books at her command and guess we hoped vainly the why and wherefore of these stops on the appointed day the lady in question drove in state on a car with benella but francesca and i hired a couple of very wheezy bicycles for the journey we had a thrilling start for it chanced to be a fair day in ballycastle and we wheeled through a sea of squealing bolting pigs stupid sheep and unruly cows all pursued on every side by their drivers to alight from a bicycle in such a whirl of beasts always seems certain death to remain seated diminishes i believe the number of ones days of life to an appreciable extent francesca chose the first course and standing still in the middle of the street called upon everybody within hearing to save her and that right speedily a crowd of jibbing heifers encircled her on all sides while a fat porker who his driver said might be a prize pig by his impidence and a donkey that was feelin bluemouldy for want of a batin tried to poke their noses into the group saleminas only weapon was her scarlet parasol and standing on the step of her sidecar she brandished this with such terrible effect that the only bull in the cavalcade put up his head and roared have conduct woman dear cried his owner to salemina sure if you kape on moidherin him wid that ombrelly youll have him ugly on me immajently and the divil a bit o me can stop him dont be cryin that way asthore he went on going to francescas side and piloting her tenderly to the hedge sure ill nourish him wid the whip whin i get him to a more remoted place we had no more adventures but francesca was so unhinged by her unfortunate exit from ballycastle that after a few miles she announced her intention of putting her machine and herself on the car whereupon benella proclaimed herself a competent cyclist and climbed down blithely to mount the discarded wheel her ideas of propriety were by this time so developed that she rode ten or twelve feet behind me where she looked quaint enough in her black dress and little black bonnet with its white lawn strings sure its a quare footman ye have me lady said a genial and friendly person who was sitting by the roadside smoking his old dudeen an irishman somehow is always going to his work jist or coming from it or thinking how it shall presently be done or meditating on the next step in the process or resting a bit before taking it up again or reflecting whether the weather is on the whole favourable to its proper performance but however poor and needy he may be it is somewhat difficult to catch him at the precise working moment mr alfred austin says of the irish peasants that idleness and poverty seem natural to them life to the scotsman or englishman is a business to conduct to extend to render profitable to the irishman it is a dream a little bit of passing consciousness on a rather hard pillow the hard part of it being the occasional necessity for work which spoils the tenderness and continuity of the dream presently we passed the castle rode along a neat quay with a row of houses advertising lodgings to let and here is lever cottage where harry lorrequer was written for lever was dispensary doctor in port stewart when his first book was appearing in the dublin university magazine we did not fancy coleraine it looked like anything but cuilrathain a ferny corner kittys sweet buttermilk may have watered but it had not fertilised the plain though the town itself seemed painfully prosperous neither the clothworkers inn nor the corporation arms looked a pleasant stoppingplace and the humble inn we finally selected for a brief rest proved to be about as gay as a family vault with a landlady who had all the characteristics of a poker except its occasional warmth as the liberator said of another stiff and formal person whether she was scot or saxon i know not she was certainly not celt and certainly no barney mccrea of her day would have kissed her if she had spilled ever so many pitchers of sweet buttermilk over the plain so we took the railway and departed with delight for limavady where thackeray fresh from his visit to charles lever laid his poetical tribute at the stockingless feet of miss margaret of that town ocahan whose chief seat was at limavady was the principal urraght of oneill and when one of the great clan was proclaimed at tullaghogue it was the magnificent privilege of the ocahan to toss a shoe over his head we slept at ocahans hotel and well one must sleep and wherever we attend to that necessary function without due preparation we generally make a mistake in the selection of the particular spot protestantism does not necessarily mean cleanliness although it may have natural tendencies in that direction and we find to our surprise a surprise rooted probably in bigotry that catholicism can be as clean as a penny whistle now and again there were no special privileges at ocahans for maids and benella therefore had a delightful evening in the coffeeroom with a stormbound commercial traveller as for francesca and me there was plenty to occupy us in our regular letters to ronald and himself and salemina wrote several sheets of thin paper to somebody no one in america either for we saw her put on a penny stamp our pleasant duties over we looked into the cheerful glow of the turf sods while i read aloud thackerays peg of limavady he spells the town with two ds by the way to insure its being rhymed properly with paddy and daddy riding from coleraine famed for lovely kitty came a cockney bound unto derry city weary was his soul shivering and sad he bumped along the road leads to limavaddy limavaddy inns but a humble baithouse where you may procure whisky and potatoes landlord at the door gives a smiling welcome to the shivering wights who to his hotel come landlady within sits and knits a stocking with a wary foot babys cradle rocking presently a maid enters with the liquor half a pint of ale frothing in a beaker gads i didnt know what my beating heart meant hebes self i thought entered the apartment as she came she smiled and the smile bewitching on my word and honour lighted all the kitchen this i do declare happy is the laddy who the heart can share of peg of limavaddy married if she were blest would be the daddy of the children fair of peg of limavaddy beauty is not rare in the land of paddy fair beyond compare is peg of limavaddy this cheered us a bit but the wind sighed in the trees the rain dripped on the window panes and we felt for the first time a consciousness of homelonging francesca sat on a low stool looking into the fire ronalds last letter in her lap and it was easy indeed to see that her heart was in the highlands she has been giving us a few extracts from the communication an unusual proceeding as ronald in his ordinary correspondence is evidently not a quotable person we smiled over his account of a visit to his old parish of inchcaldy in fifeshire there is a certain large orphanage in the vicinity in which we had all taken an interest chiefly because our friends the macraes of pettybaw house were among its guardians it seems that lady rowardennan of the castle had promised the orphans en bloc that those who passed through an entire year without once falling into falsehood should have a treat or festival of their own choosing on the eventful day of decision those orphans male and female who had not for a twelvemonth deviated from the truth by a hairsbreadth raised their little white hands emblematic of their pure hearts and lips and were solemnly counted then came the unhappy moment when a scattering of small grimy paws was timidly put up and their falsifying owners confessed that they had fibbed more than once during the year these tearful fibbers were also counted and sent from the room while the nonfibbers chose their reward which was to sail around the bass rock and the isle of may in a steam tug on the festival day the matron of the orphanage chanced on the happy thought that it might have a moral effect on the said fibbers to see the nonfibbers depart in a blaze of glory so they were taken to the beach to watch the tug start on its voyage the confessed criminals looked wretched enough ronald wrote when forsaken by their virtuous playmates who stepped jauntily on board holding their sailor hats on their heads and carrying nice little luncheon baskets so miserably unhappy indeed did they seem that certain sympathetic and illbalanced persons sprang to their relief providing them with sandwiches sweeties and pennies it was a lovely day and when the fibbers tears were dried they played merrily on the sand their games directed and shared by the aforesaid misguided persons meantime a high wind had sprung up at sea and the tug was tossed to and fro upon the foamy deep so many and so varied were the ills of the righteous orphans that the matron could not attend to all of them properly and they were laid on benches or on the deck where they languidly declined luncheon and wept for a sight of the land at five the tug steamed up to the home landing a few of the voyagers were able to walk ashore some were assisted others were carried and as the pale haggard truthful company gathered on the beach they were met by a boisterous happy crowd of ananiases and sapphiras sunburned warm full of tea and cakes and high spirits and with the moral law already so uncertain in their minds that at the sight of the suffering nonliars it tottered to its fall ronald hopes that lady rowardennan and the matron may perhaps have gained some useful experience by the incident though the orphans truthful and untruthful are hopelessly mixed in their views of rightdoing he is staying now at the great house of the neighbourhood while his new manse is being put in order roderick the piper he says has a grand collection of pipe tunes given him by an officer of the black watch francesca when she and ronald visit the castle on their wedding journey is to have johnnie cope to wake her in the morning brose and butter just before dinner is served a reel a strathspey and a march while the meal is going on and last of all the highland wedding ronald does not know whether there are any lowland scots or english words to this pipe tune but it is always played in the highlands after the actual marriage and the words in gaelic are alas for me if the wife i have married is not a good one for she will eat the food and not do the work you dont think ronald meant anything personal in quoting that i asked francesca teasingly but she shot me such a reproachful look that i hadnt the heart to persist her face was so full of selfdistrust and love and longing what creatures of sense we are after all and in certain moods of what avail is it if the beloved object is alive safe loyal so long as he is absent he may write letters like horace walpole or chesterfield better still like alfred de musset or george sand or the brownings but one clasp of the hand that moved the pen is worth an ocean of words you believe only in the etherealised the spiritualised passion of love you know that it can exist through years of separation can live and grow where a coarser feeling would die for lack of nourishment still though your spirit should be strong enough to meet its spirit mate somewhere in the realms of imagination and the bodily presence ought not really to be necessary your stubborn heart of flesh craves sight and sound and touch that is the only pitiless part of death it seems to me we have had the friendship the love the sympathy and these are things that can never die they have made us what we are and they are by their very nature immortal yet we would come near to bartering all these spiritual possessions for the touch of a vanished hand and the sound of a voice that is still how could i ever think life easy enough to be ventured on alone it is so beautiful to feel oneself of infinite value to one other human creature to hear beside ones own step the tread of a chosen companion on the same road and if the way be dusty or the hills difficult to climb each can say to the other i love you dear lean on me and walk in confidence i can always be counted on whatever happens chapter xix in ould donegal heres a health to you father oflynn slainte and slainte and slainte agin powrfulest preacher and tenderest teacher and kindliest creature in ould donegal alfred perceval graves coomnageeha hotel in ould donegal it is a far cry from the kingdom of kerry to ould donegal where we have been travelling for a week chiefly in the hope of meeting father oflynn we miss our careless genial ragged southern paddy just a bit for he was a picturesque likable figure on the whole and easier to know than this ulster irishman the product of a mixed descent we did not stop long in belfast for if there is anything we detest when on our journeys it is to mix too much with people of industry thrift and business sagacity sturdy prosperous calculating welltodo protestants are well enough in their way and undoubtedly they make a very good backbone for ireland but we crave something more romantic than the citizen virtues or we should have remained in our own country where they are tolerably common although we have not as yet anything approaching overproduction belfast it seems is and has always been a centre of presbyterianism the members of the presbytery protested against the execution of charles i and received an irate reply from milton who said that the blockish presbyters of clandeboy were egregious liars and impostors who meant to stir up rebellion from their unchristian synagogue at belfast in a barbarous nook of ireland dr la touche writes to salemina that we need not try to understand all the religious and political complications which surround us they are by no means as violent or as many as in thackerays day when the great english author found nine shades of politicoreligious differences in the irish liverpool as the impartial observer must in such a case necessarily displease eight parties and probably the whole nine thackeray advised a rigid abstinence from all intellectual curiosity dr la touche says if we wish to know the north better it will do us no harm to study the plantation of ulster the united irish movement orangeism irish jacobitism the effect of french and swiss republicanism in the evolution of public sentiment and the close relation and affection that formerly existed between the north of ireland and new england this last topic seems to appeal to salemina particularly he also alludes to tories and rapparees rousseau and thomas paine and owen roe oneill but i have entirely forgotten their connection with the subject francesca and i are thoroughly enjoying ourselves as only those people can who never take notes and never try when pandoras box is opened in their neighbourhood to seize the heterogeneous contents and put them back properly with nice little labels on them ireland is no longer a battlefield of english parties neither is it wholly a laboratory for political experiment but from having been both the one and the other its features are a bit knocked out of shape and proportion as it were we have bought two hideous engravings of the battle of the boyne and the secret of englands greatness and whenever we stay for a night in any inn where perchance these are not we pin them on the wall and are received into the landladys heart at once i dont know which is the finer study the picture of his majesty william iii crossing the boyne or the plump little queen presenting a huge family bible to an apparently uninterested black youth in the latter work of art the eye is confused at first as the three principal features approach each other very nearly in size and francesca asked innocently which is the secret of englands greatness the bible the queen or the black man this is a thriving town and we are at a smart hotel which had for two years an english manager the scent of the roses hangs round it still but it is gradually growing fainter under the stress of small patronage and other adverse circumstances the table linen is a trifle ragged though clean but the circle of red and green wineglasses by each plate an array not borne out by the number of vintages on the winelist the tiny ferns scattered everywhere in innumerable pots and the dozens of minute glass vases each holding a few blue hyacinths give an air of urban elegance to the diningroom the guests are requested in printed placards to be punctual at meals especially at the seventhirty table dhote dinner and the management itself is punctual at this function about seven fortyfive this is much better than in the south where we and sixty other travellers were once kept waiting fifteen minutes between the soup and the fish course when we were finally served with halfcooked turbot a pleasantspoken waitress went about to each table explaining to the irate guests that the cook was not at her best we caught a glimpse of her as she was being borne aloft struggling and eloquent and were able to understand the reason of her unachieved ideals there is nothing sacred about dinner to the average irishman he is willing to take anything that comes as a rule and cooking is not regarded as a fine art here perhaps occasional flashes of starvation and seasons of famine have rendered the irish palate easier to please at all events wherever the national god may be its pedestal is not in the stomach our breakfast day after day week after week has been bacon and eggs one morning we had tomatoes on bacon and concluded that the cook had experienced religion or fallen in love since both these operations send a flush of blood to the brain and stimulate the mental processes but no we found simply that the eggs had not been brought in time for breakfast there is no consciousness of monotony far from it the nobility and gentry can at least eat what they choose and they choose bacon and eggs there is no running of the family gamut either from plain boiled to omelet poached or fried eggs on bacon it is weekdays and sundays the luncheon too is rarely inspired they eat cold joint of beef with pickled beetroot or mutton and boiled potatoes with unfailing regularity finishing off at most hotels with semolina pudding a concoction intended for and appealing solely to the taste of the toothless infant who having just graduated from rubber rings has not a jaded palate how the long breakfast bill at an uptodate belfast hostelry awed us after weeks of bacon and eggs the viands on the menu swam together before our dazed eyes porridge fillets of plaice whiting fried sole savoury omelet kidneys and bacon cold meats i looked at this array like one in a dream realising that i had lost the power of selection and remembering the scientific fact that unused faculties perish for want of exercise the man who was serving us rattled his tray shifted his weight wearily from one foot to the other and cleared his throat suggestively until at last i said hastily bacon and eggs please and salemina the most critical person in the party murmured the same it is odd to see how soon if one has a strong sense of humanity one feels at home in a foreign country i at least am never impressed by the differences but only by the similarities between englishspeaking peoples we take part in the life about us here living each experience as fully as we can whether it be a hiring fair in donegal or a pilgrimage to the doon well of healing not the least part of the pleasure is to watch its effect upon the derelict where or in what way could three persons hope to gain as much return from a monthly expenditure of twenty dollars added to her living and travelling expenses as we have had in miss benella dusenberry we sometimes ask ourselves what we found to do with our time before she came into the family and yet she is as busy as possible herself having twice singed francescas beautiful locks she no longer attempts hairdressing while she never accomplishes the lacing of an evening dress without putting her knee in the centre of your back once at least during the operation she can button shoes and she can mend and patch and darn to perfection she has a frenzy for small laundry operations and after washing the windows of her room she adorns every pane of glass with a fine cambric handkerchief and stretching a line between the bedpost and the bureau knob she hangs out her white neckties and her bonnet strings to dry she has learned to pack reasonably well too but if she has another passion beside those of washing and mending it is for making bags she buys scraps of gingham and print and makes cases of every possible size and for every possible purpose so that all our personal property roughly speaking hairbrushes shoes writing materials pincushions photographs underclothing gloves medicines is bagged the strings in the bags pull both ways and nothing is commoner than to see benella open and close seventeen or eighteen of them when she is searching for francescas rubbers or my gold thimble but what other ladysmaid or travelling companion ever had half the derelicts unique charm and interest half her conversational power her unusual and original defects and virtues put her in a thirdclass carriage when we go first and she makes friends with all her fellowtravellers discussing home rule or free silver with the utmost prejudice and vehemence and freeing her mind on any point to the delight of the natives occasionally when borne along by the joy of argument she forgets to change at the point of junction and has to be found and dragged out of the railway carriage occasionally too she is left behind when taking a cheerful cup of tea at a way station but this is comparatively seldom her stories of life belowstairs in the various inns and hotels her altercations with housemaid or boots or landlady in our behalf all add a zest to the days doings benellas father was an itinerant preacher her mother the daughter of a vermont farmer and although she was left an orphan at ten years educating and supporting herself as best she could after that she is as truly a combination of both parents as her name is a union of their two names im so fraid i shant run across any of grandmothers folks over here after all she said yesterday though i ask every niceappearin person i meet anywheres if he or shes any kin to mary boyce of trim and then again im scared to death for fear i shall find im own cousin to one of these here critters that aint brushed their hair nor washed their apurns for a month o sundays i declare it keeps me real nerved up i think its partly the climate that makes em so slack she philosophised pinning a new bag on her knee and preparing to backstitch the seam theres nothin like a massachusetts winter for puttin the gitupangit into you land youve got to move round smart or youd freeze in your tracks these warm moist places always makes folks lazy and when theyre hot enough if you take notice it makes heathen of em it always seems so queer to me that real hot weather and the christian religion dont seem to git along together praps its just as well that the idolworshippers should get used to heat in this world for theyll have it considable hot in the next one i guess and see here mrs beresford will you get me ten cents i mean sixpence worth o red gingham to make miss monroe a bag for mr macdonalds letters they go sprawlin all over her trunk and theres so many of em i wish to the land shed send em to the bank while shes travellin chapter xx we evict a tenant soon as you lift the latch little ones are meeting you soon as youre neath the thatch kindly looks are greeting you scarcely have you time to be holding out the fist to them down by the fireside youre sitting in the midst of them francis fahy roothythanthrum cottage knockcool county tyrone of course we have always intended sooner or later to forsake this life of hotels and lodgings and become either irish landlords or tenants or both with a view to the better understanding of one burning irish question we heard of a charming house in county down which could be secured by renting it the first of may for the season but as we could occupy it only for a month at most we were obliged to forego the opportunity we have been told from time immemorial that absenteeism has been one of the curses of ireland i remarked to salemina so whatever the charms of the cottage in rostrevor do not let us take it and in so doing become absentee landlords it was you two who hired the wee theekit hoosie in pettybaw said francesca i am going to be in the vanguard of the next househunting expedition in fact i have almost made up my mind to take my third of benella and be an independent householder for a time if i am ever to learn the management of an establishment before beginning to experiment on ronalds now is the proper moment ronald must have looked the future in the face when he asked you to marry him i replied although it is possible that he looked only at you and therefore it is his duty to endure your maiden incapacities but why should salemina and i suffer you to experiment upon us pray it was benella after all who inveigled us into making our first political misstep for after avoiding the sin of absenteeism we fell into one almost as black inasmuch as we evicted a tenant it is part of benellas heterogeneous and unusual duty to take a bicycle and scour the country in search of information for us to find out where shops are postoffice lodgings places for good sketches ruins pretty roads for walks and drives and many other things too numerous to mention she came home from one of these expeditions flushed with triumph ive got you a house she exclaimed proudly theres a lady in it now but shell move out tomorrow when we move in and we are to pay seventeen dollars fifty i mean three pound ten a week for the house with privilege of renewal and she throws in the hired girl benella is hopelessly provincial in the matter of language butler chef boots footman scullerymaid all come under the generic term of help i knew our week at this hotel was out tomorrow she continued and weve about used up this place anyway and the new village that ive ben to is the prettiest place weve seen yet its got an upanddown hill to it just like home and the house ive partly rented is opposite a fair green where theres a market every week and wednesdays the day and well save money for i shant cost you so much when we can housekeep would you mind explaining a little more in detail asked salemina quietly and telling me whether you have hired the house for yourself or for us for us all she replied genially you dont suppose id leave you i liked the looks of this cottage the first time i passed it and i got acquainted with the hired girl by going in the side yard and asking for a drink the next time i went i got acquainted with the lady whos got the most outlandish name that ever was wrote down and here it is on a paper and today i asked her if she didnt want to rent her house for a week to three quiet ladies without children and only one of them married and him away she said it want her own and i asked her if she couldnt sublet to desirable parties i knew she was as poor as jobs turkey by her looks and she said it would suit her well enough if she had any place to go i asked her if she wouldnt like to travel and she said no then i says wouldnt you like to go to visit some of your folks and she said she sposed she could stop a week with her sons wife just to oblige us so i engaged a car to drive you down this afternoon just to look at the place and if you like it we can easy move over tomorrow the suns so hot i asked the stableman if he hadnt got a top buggy or a surrey or a carryall but he never heard tell of any of em he didnt even know a shay i forgot to tell you the lady is a protestant and the hired girls name is bridget thunder and shes a roman catholic but she seems extra smart and neat i was kind of in hopes she wouldnt be for i thought i should enjoy trainin her and doin that much for the country and so we drove over to this village of knockcool knockcool by the way means hill of sleep as much to make amends for benellas eccentricities as with any idea of falling in with her proposal the house proved everything she said and in mrs wogan odevaine benella had found a person every whit as remarkable as herself she is evidently an irish gentlewoman of very small means very flexible in her views and convictions very talkative and amusing and very much impressed with benella as a product of new england institutions we all took a fancy to one another at first sight and we heard with real pleasure that her sons wife lived only a few miles away we insisted on paying the evicted lady the three pounds ten in advance for the first week she seemed surprised and we remembered that irish tenants though often capable of shedding blood for a good landlord are generally averse to paying him rent mrs wogan odevaine then drove away in high good humour taking some personal belongings with her and promising to drink tea with us some time during the week she kissed francesca goodbye told her she was the prettiest creature she had ever seen and asked if she might have a peep at all her hats and frocks when she came to visit us salemina says that rhododendron cottage pronounced by bridget thunder roothythanthrum being the property of one landlord and the residence of four tenants at the same time makes us in a sense participators in the old system of rundale tenure long since abolished the goodwill or tenantright was infinitely subdivided and the tiniest holdings sometimes existed in thirtytwo pieces the result of this joint tenure was an extraordinary tangle particularly when it went so far as the subdivision of one cows grass or even of a horse which being owned jointly by three men ultimately went lame because none of them would pay for shoeing the fourth foot we have been here five days and instead of reproving benella as we intended for gross assumption of authority in the matter we are more than ever her bondslaves the place is altogether charming and here it is for you knockcool street is knockcool village itself as with almost all irish towns but the line of little thatched cabins is brightened at the far end by the neat house of mrs wogan odevaine set a trifle back in its own garden by the pillared porch of a modest hotel and by the barracks of the royal irish constabulary the sign of the provincial bank of ireland almost faces our windows and although it is used as a mealshop the rest of the week they tell us that two thousand pounds in money is needed there on fairdays next to it is a little house the upper part of which is used as a methodist chapel and old nancy the caretaker is already a good friend of ours it is a humble house of prayer but nancy takes much pride in it and showed us the melodeon worked by a young lady from rossantach the sundayschool rooms and even the cupboard where she keeps the jugs for the lovefeast and the linen and wine for the sacrament which is administered once in three years next comes the hoeys cabin where we have always a cordial welcome but where we never go all together for fear of embarrassing the family which is a large one three generations under one roof and plenty of children in the last old mrs hoey does not rightly know her age she says but her daughter ellen was born the year of the big wind and she herself was twentytwo when she was married and you might allow a year between that and when ellen was born and make your own calculation she tells many stories of the big wind which we learn was in making ellens age about sixtyone and her mothers eightyfour the fury of the storm was such that it forced the water of the lough far ashore stranding the fish among the rocks where they were found dead by hundreds when next morning dawned there was confusion and ruin on every side the cross had tumbled from the chapel the tombstones were overturned in the graveyard trees and branches blocked the roadways cabins were stripped of their thatches and cattle found dead in the fields so it is small wonder old mrs hoey remembers the day of ellens birth weak as she is on all other dates ellens husband miles mgillan is the carpenter on an estate in the neighbourhood his shop opens out of the cabin and i love to sit by the hoey fireside where the fan bellows turned by a crank brings in an instant a fresh flame to the sods of smouldering turf and watch a wee colleen bawn playing among her daddys shavings tying them about her waist and fat wrists hanging them on her ears and in among her brown curls mother hoey says that i do not speak like an american that i have not so many caperins in my language whatever they may be and so we have long delightful chats together when i go in for a taste of ellens griddle bread cooked over the peat coals francesca meantime is calling on mrs orourke whose son has taken more than fifty bicycle prizes and no stranger can come to knockcool without inspecting the brave show of silver medals and china that adorn the bedroom and make the orourkes the proudest couple in ould donegal phelim orourke smokes his dudeen on a bench by the door and invites the passerby to enter and examine the trophies his trousers are held up with bits of rope arranged as suspenders indeed his toilet is so much a matter of strings that it must be a work of time to tie on his clothing in the morning in case he takes it off at night which is open to doubt nevertheless it is he thats the satisfied man and the luck would be on him as well as on eer a man alive were he not kilt wid the cough intirely mrs phelims skirt shows a triangle of red flannel behind where the two ends of the waistband fail to meet by about six inches but are held together by a piece of white ball fringe any informality in this part of her costume is however more than atoned for by the presence of a dingy bonnet of magenta velvet which she always dons for visitors the orourke family is the essence of hospitality so their kitchen is generally full of children and visitors and on the occasion when salemina issued from the prize bedroom the guests were so busy with conversation that to use their own language divil a wan of thim clapt eyes on the orourke puppy and they did not notice that the baste was floundering in a tub of soft newly made butter standing on the floor he was indeed desperately involved being so completely wound up in the waxy mass that he could not climb over the tubs edge he looked comical and miserable enough in his plight the children and the visitors thought so and so did francesca and i but salemina went directly home and kept her room for an hour she is so sensitive och thin its herself thats the marthyr intirely we cannot see that the incident affects us so long as we avoid the orourkes butter but she says covering her eyes with her handkerchief and shuddering suppose there are other tubs and other pup oh i cannot bear the thought of it dears please change the subject and order me two hardboiled eggs for dinner leaving knockcool behind us we walk along the country road between high thick hedges here a clump of weatherbeaten trees there a stretch of bog with silver pools and piles of black turf then a sudden view of hazy hills a grove of beeches a great house with a splendid gateway and sometimes riding through it a figure new to our eyes a lady master of the hounds handsome in her habit with red facings we pass many an evicted farm the ruined house with the rushes growing all about it and a lonely goat browsing near and on we walk until we can see the roofs of lisdaras solitary cabin row huddled under the shadow of a gloomy hill topped by the ruins of an old fort all is silent and the blue haze of the peat smoke curls up from the thatch lisdaras young people have mostly gone to the big country and how many tears have dropped on the path we are treading as peggy and mary cormac and miles with a wooden box in the donkey cart behind them or perhaps with only a bundle hanging from a blackthorn stick have come down the hill to seek their fortune perhaps peggy is barefooted perhaps mary has little luggage beyond a pot of shamrock or a mountain thrush in a wicker cage but what matter for that they are used to poverty and hardship and hunger and although they are going quite penniless to a new country sure it can be no worse than the old this is the happygolucky irish philosophy and there is mixed with it a deal of simple trust in god how many exiles and wanderers both those who have no fortune and those who have failed to win it dream of these cabin rows these sweetscented boreens with their banks of furze unprofitably gay these leaking thatches with the purple loosestrife growing in their ragged seams and looking backward across the distance of time and space give the humble spot a tender thought because after all it was in their dear native isle pearly are the skies in the country of my fathers purple are thy mountains home of my heart mother of my yearning love of all my longings keep me in remembrance long leagues apart i have been thinking in this strain because of an old dame in the first cabin in lisdara row whose daughter is in america and who can talk of nothing else she shows us the last letter with its postal order for sixteen shillings that mida sent from new york with little presents for blind timsy dark since he were three years old and for lame dan or the bocca as he is called in lisdara mida was named for the virgin saint of killeedy in limerick and its she thats good enough to bear a saints name glory be to god exclaims the old mother returning midas photograph to a hole in the wall where the pig cannot possibly molest it saint mide the brigit of munster at the far end of the row lives omadhaun pat he is a little sthrange you understand not because he was born with too small a share of wit but because he fell asleep one evening when he was lying on the grass up by the old fort and well he was niver the same thing since there are places in ireland you must know where if you lie down upon the green earth and sink into untimely slumber you will wake silly or for that matter although it is doubtless a risk you may escape the fate of waking silly and wake a poet carolan fell asleep upon a faery rath and it was the faeries who filled his ears with music so that he was haunted by the tunes ever afterward and perhaps all poets whether they are conscious of it or not fall asleep on faery raths before they write sweet songs little omadhaun pat is pale holloweyed and thin but that his mother says is because he is overstudyin for his confirmation the great day is many weeks away but to me it seems likely that when the examination comes pat will be where he will know more than the priests next door lives old biddy tuke she is too aged to work and she sits in her doorway always a pleasant figure in her short woollen petticoat her little shawl and her neat white cap she has pitaties for food with stirabout of indian meal once a day oatmeal is too dear tea occasionally when there is sixpence left from the rent and she has more than once tasted bacon in her eighty years of life more than once she tells me proudly for its she thats had the good sons to help her a bit now and then four to carry her and one to walk after which is the irish notion of an ideal family its no chuckens i do be havin now maam she says but its a darlin flock i had ten year ago whin dinnis was harvestin in scotland sure it was twoandtwinty chuckens i had on the floore wid meself that year maam oh its a conthrary world thats a mortial fact as phelim orourke is wont to say when his cough is bad and for my life i can frame no better wish for ould biddy tuke and omadhaun pat dark timsy and the bocca than that they might wake one of these summer mornings in the harvestfield of the seventh heaven that place is reserved for the saints and surely these unfortunates acquainted with grief like another might without difficulty find entrance there i am not wise enough to say how much of all this squalor and wretchedness and hunger is the fault of the people themselves how much of it belongs to circumstances and environment how much is the result of past errors of government how much is race how much is religion i only know that children should never be hungry that there are ignorant human creatures to be taught how to live and if it is a hard task the sooner it is begun the better both for teachers and pupils it is comparatively easy to form opinions and devise remedies when one knows the absolute truth of things but it is so difficult to find the truth here or at least there are so many and such different truths to weigh in the balance the protestant and the roman catholic truth the landlords and the tenants the nationalists and the unionists truth i am sadly befogged and so pushing the vexing questions all aside i take dark timsy bocca lynch and omadhaun pat up on the green hillside near the ruined fort to tell them stories and teach them some of the thousand things that happier luckier children know this is an island of anomalies the irish peasants will puzzle you perplex you disappoint you with their inconsistencies but keep from liking them if you can there are a few cleaner and more comfortable homes in lisdara and knockcool than when we came and benella has been invaluable although her reforms as might be expected are of an unusual character and with her the wheels of progress never move silently as they should but always squeak with the two golden sovereigns given her to spend she has bought scissors knives hammers boards sewing materials knitting needles and yarn everything to work with and nothing to eat drink or wear though heaven knows there is little enough of such things in lisdara the quicker you wear em out the better youll suit me she says to the awestricken lisdarians im a workin woman myself an its my ladies money ive spent this time but ill make out to keep you in brooms and scrubbin brushes if only youll use em you mustnt take offence at anything i say to you for im part irish my grandmother was mary boyce of trim and if she hadnt come away and settled in salem massachusetts mebbe i wouldnt have known a scrubbin brush by sight myself chapter xxi lachrymae hibernicae what ails you sister erin that your face is like your mountains still bedewed with tears forgive forget lest harsher lips should say like your turf fire your rancour smoulders long and let oblivion strew times ashes oer your wrong alfred austin at teatime and again after our simple dinner for bridget thunders repertory is not large and benellas is quite unsuited to the knockcool markets we wend our way to a certain house that stands by itself on the road to lisdara it is only a whitewashed cabin with green window trimmings but it is a larger and more comfortable one than we commonly see and it is the perfection of neatness within and without the stone wall that encloses it is whitewashed too and the iron picket railing at the top is painted bright green the stones on the posts are green also and there is the prettiest possible garden with nicely cut borders of box in fine if ever there was a cheery place to look at sarsfield cottage is that one and if ever there was a cheerless gentleman it is mr jordan who dwells there mrs wogan odevaine commended him to us as the man of all others with whom to discuss irish questions if we wanted for once in a way to hear a thoroughly disaffected outraged wrongheaded and rancorous view of things he is an encyclopaedia and he is perfectly delightful on any topic in the universe but the wrongs of ireland said she not entirely sane and yet a good father and a good neighbour and a good talker faith he can abuse the english government with any man alive he has a smaller grudge against you americans perhaps than against most of the other nations so possibly he may elect to discuss something more cheerful than our national grievances if he does and you want a livelier topic just mention let me see you might speak of wentworth who destroyed irelands woollen industry though it is true he laid the foundation of the linen trade so he wouldnt do though mr jordan is likely to remember the former point and forget the latter well just breathe the words catholic disqualification or ulster confiscation and you will have as pretty a burst of oratory as youd care to hear you remember that exasperated englishman who asked in the house why irishmen were always laying bare their grievances and major ogorman bawled across the floor because they want them redressed salemina and i went to call on mr jordan the very next day after our arrival at knockcool over the sittingroom or library door at sarsfield cottage is a coat of arms with the motto of the jordans percussus surgam and as our friend is descended from richard jordan of knock who died on the scaffold at claremorris in the memorable year i find that he is related to me for one of the de exeter jordans married penelope oconnor daughter of the king of connaught he took her to wife too when the espousal of anything irish names language apparel customs or daughters was high treason and meant instant confiscation of estates i never thought of mentioning the relationship for obviously a family cannot hold grievances for hundreds of years and bequeath a sense of humour at the same time the name jordan is derived it appears from a noble ancestor who was bannerbearer in the crusades and who distinguished himself in many battles but particularly in one fought against the infidels on the banks of the river jordan in the holy land in this conflict he was felled to the ground three times during the day but owing to his gigantic strength his great valour and the number of the saracens prostrated by his sword he succeeded in escaping death and keeping the banner of the cross hoisted hence by way of eminence he was called jordan and the motto of this illustrious family ever since has been though i fall i rise mr jordans wife has been long dead but he has four sons only one of them napper tandy living at home theobald wolfe tone is practising law in dublin hamilton rowan is a physician in cork and daniel oconnell commonly called lib a delicate reference to the liberator is still a lad at trinity it is a great pity that mr jordan could not have had a larger family that he might have kept fresh in the national heart the names of a few more patriots for his library walls where memory sits by the altar she has raised to woe are hung with engravings and prints of celebrated insurgents rebels agitators demagogues denunciators conspirators pictures of anybody in a word who ever struck a blow right or wrong well or ill judged for the green isle that gallant jacobite patrick sarsfield burke grattan flood and robert emmet stand shoulder to shoulder with three fenian gentlemen names allan larkin and obrien known in ultranationalist circles as the manchester martyrs for some years after this trio was hanged in salford jail it appears that the infant mind was sadly mixed in its attempt to separate knowledge in the concrete from the more or less abstract information contained in the catechism and many a bishop was shocked when asking in the confirmation service who are the martyrs to be told allan larkin and obrien me lord francesca says she longs to smuggle into mr jordans library a picture of tom steele one of daniel oconnells henchmen to whom he gave the title of head pacificator of ireland many amusing stories are told of this official of his gaudy uniform his strut and swagger and his pompous language at a political meeting on one occasion he attacked it seems one peter purcell a dublin tradesman who had fallen out with the liberator on some minor question say no more on the subject tom cried oconnell who was in the chair i forgive peter from the bottom of my heart you may forgive him liberator and saviour of my country rejoined steele in a characteristic burst of his amazingly fervent rhetoric yes you in the discharge of your ethereal functions as the moral regenerator of ireland may forgive him but revered leader i also have functions of my own to perform and i tell you that as head pacificator of ireland i can never forgive the diabolical villain that dared to dispute your august will the doughty steele who appears to have been but poorly fitted by nature for his office was considered at the time to be half a madman but as sir james oconnell daniels candid brother said and who the divil else would take such a job at any rate when we gaze at mr jordans gallery imagining the scene that would ensue were the breath of life breathed into the patriots quivering nostrils we feel sure that the head pacificator would be kept busy dear old whitehaired mr jordan known in select circles as grievance jordan sitting in his library surrounded by his denunciators conspirators and martyrs with incendiary documents piled mountains high on his desk what a pathetic anachronism he is after all the shillelagh is hung on the wall now for the most part and faction fighting is at an end but in the very last moments of it there were still ructions between the fitzgeralds and the moriartys and the ageold reason of the quarrel was according to the fitzgeralds the betrayal of the cause of ireland the particular instance occurred in the sixteenth century but no fitzgerald could ever afterward meet any moriarty at a fair without crying who dare tread on the tail of me coat and inviting him to join in the dishcussion with shticks this practically is mr jordans position and if an irishman desires to live entirely in the past he can be as unhappy as any man alive he is writing a book which mrs wogan odevaine insists is to be called the groans of ireland but after a glance at a page of memoranda pencilled in a collection of swifts irish tracts that he lent to me the volume containing that ghastly piece of irony the modest proposal for preventing the poor of ireland from being a burden to their parents and country i have concluded that he is editing a catalogue of irish wrongs alphabetically arranged this idea pleased mrs wogan odevaine extremely and when she drove over to tea bringing several cheerful young people to call upon us she proposed in the most lighthearted way in the world to play what she termed the grievance game an intellectual diversion which she had invented on the instant she proposed it apparently with a view of showing us how small a knowledge of irelands ancient wrongs is the property of the modern irish girl and how slight a hold on her memory and imagination have the unspeakably bitter days of the long ago we were each given pencil and paper and two or three letters of the alphabet and bidden to arrange the wrongs of ireland neatly under them as we supposed mr jordan to be doing for the instruction and the depression of posterity the result proved that mrs odevaine was a true prophet for the youngest members of the coterie came off badly enough and read their brief list of grievances with much chagrin at their lack of knowledge the only piece of information they possessed in common being the inherited idea that england never had understood ireland never would never could never should never might understand her rosetta odevaine succeeded in remembering for a f and h absenteeism flight of the earls famine and hunger her elder sister eileen fresh from college was rather triumphant with o and p giving us oppression of the irish tenantry penal laws protestant supremacy poynings law potato rot and plantations their friend rhona burke had v w x y z and succeeded only in finding wentworth and woollen trade destroyed until miss odevaine helped her with woods halfpence about which everybody else had to be enlightened and there was plenty of laughter when francesca suggested for v vipers expelled by st patrick salemina carried off the first prize but we insisted c and d were the easiest letters at any rate her list showed great erudition and would certainly have pleased mr jordan c church cess catholic disqualification crimes act of confiscations cromwell carrying away of lia fail stone of destiny from tara d destruction of trees on confiscated lands discoverers of flaws in irish titles debasing of the coinage by james i mrs odevaine came next with r and s r recall of lord fitzwilliams by pitt rundale land tenure rackrents ribbonism s schism act supremacy act sixth act of george i i followed with t and u having unearthed tithes and the test act for the first and undertakers the acts of union and uniformity for the second while francesca who had been given i j k l and m disgraced herself by failing on all the letters but the last under which she finally catalogued one particularly obnoxious wrong in middlemen this ignorance of the past may have its bright side after all though to speak truthfully it did show a too scanty knowledge of national history but if one must forget it is as well to begin with the wrongs of faroff years those done to your ancient name or wreaked upon your race part fourth connaught chapter xxii the weeping west veiled in your mist and diamonded with showers alfred austin shan van vocht hotel heart of connemara shan van vocht means in english the poor little old woman one of the many endearing names given to ireland in the gaelic there is too a wellknown rebel song called by this title one which was not only written in irish and english but which was translated into french for the soldiers at brest who were to invade ireland under hoche we had come from knockcool donegal to westport in county mayo and the day was enlivened by two purely irish touches one at the beginning and one at the end we alighted at a certain railway junction to await our train and were interested in a large detachment of soldiers leaving for a long journey we judged by the number of railway carriages and the amount of luggage and stores in every crowded compartment there were two or three men leaning out over the locked doors for the guard was making ready to start all were chatting gaily with their sweethearts wives and daughters save one gloomy fellow sitting alone in a corner searching the crowd with sad eyes for a wishedfor face or a last greeting the bell rang the engine stirred suddenly a pretty rosy girl flew breathlessly down the platform pushing her way through the groups of onlookers the mans eyes lighted he rose to his feet but the other fellows blocked the way the door was locked and he had but one precious moment still he was equal to the emergency for he raised his fist and with one blow shattered the window got his kiss and the train rumbled away with his victorious smile set in a frame of broken glass i liked that man better than any one ive seen since himself deserted me for his duty how i hope the pretty girl will be faithful and how i hope that an ideal lover will not be shot in south africa and if he was truly irish so was the porter at a little way station where we stopped in the dark after being delayed interminably at claremorris by some trifling accident we were eight persons packed into a secondclass carriage and totally ignorant of our whereabouts but the porter opening the door hastily shouted is there anny one there for here a question so vague and illogical that none of us said anything in reply but simply gazed at one another and then laughed as the train went on we are on a heretodayandgonetomorrow journey determined to avoid the railways and travel by private conveyance and the public long cars just for a glimpse of the weeping west before we settle down quietly in county meath for our last few weeks of irish life thus far it has been a pursuit of the picturesque under umbrellas in fact were desthroyed wid the dint of the damp moist and agreeable thats the irish notion both for climate and company if the barometer bore any relation to the weather we could plan our drives with more discretion but it sometimes remains as steady as a rock during two days of sea mist and francesca finding it wholly regardless of gentle tapping lost her temper on one occasion and rapped it so severely as to crack the glass that this peculiarity of irish barometers has been noted before we are sure because of this verse written by a native bard when the glass is up to thirty be sure the weather will be dirty when the glass is high o very therell be rain in cork and kerry when the glass is low o lork therell be rain in kerry and cork i might add and when the glass has climbed its best the sky is weeping in the west the national rainbow is as deceitful as the barometer and it is no uncommon thing for us to have half a dozen of them in a day between heavy showers like the smiles and tears of irish character though to be sure one does not need to be an irish patriot to declare that a fine day in this country is worth three fine days anywhere else the present weather is accounted for partially by the fact that as horace walpole said summer has set in with its usual severity and the tourist is abroad in the land i am not sure but that we belong to the hated class for the moment though at least we try to emulate tourist virtues if there are any and avoid tourist vices which is next to impossible as they are the fruit of the tour itself it is the circular tour which in its effect upon the great middle class is the most virulent and contagious and which breeds the most offensive habits of thought and speech the circular tour is a magnificent idea a praiseworthy business scheme it has educated the minds of millions and why it should have ruined their manners is a mystery unless indeed they had none when they were at home some of our fellowtravellers with whom we originally started disappear every day or two to join us again we lose them temporarily when we take a private conveyance or when they stop at a cheap hotel but we come altogether again on coach or long car and although they have torn off many coupons in the interval their remaining stock seems to assure us of their society for days to come we have a protestant clergyman who is travelling for his health but beguiling his time by observations for a volume to be called the relation between priests and pauperism it seems at first thought as if the circular coupon system were ill fitted to furnish him with corroborative detail but inasmuch as every traveller finds in a country only so to speak what he brings to it he will gather statistics enough those persons who start with a certain bias of mind in one direction seldom notice any facts that would throw out of joint those previously amassed they instinctively collect the ones that match all others having a tendency to disturb the harmony of the original scheme the clergymans travelling companion is a person who possesses not a single opinion conviction or trait in common with him so we conclude that they joined forces for economys sake this comrade we call the man with the evergreen heart for we can hardly tell by his appearance whether he is an old young man or a young old one with his hat on he is juvenile when he removes it he is so distinctly elderly that we do not know whether to regard him as damaged youth or wellpreserved old age but he transfers his solicitous attentions to lady after lady rebuffs not having the slightest effect upon his warm susceptible ardent nature we suppose that he is single but we know that he can be married at a moments notice by anybody who is willing to accept the risks of the situation then we have a nice schoolmaster so agreeable that salemina francesca and i draw lots every evening as to who shall sit beside him next day he has just had seventy boys down with measles at the same time giving prizes to those who could show the best rash salemina is no friend to the competitive system in education but this appealed to her as being as wise as it was whimsical we have also in our company an indiscreet and inflammable irishman from wexford and a cutler from birmingham who lose no opportunity to have a conversational scrimmage when the car stops to change or water the horses and as for this last operation our steeds might always manage it without loss of time by keeping their mouths open we generally hear something like this for although the two gentlemen have never met before they fight as if they had known each other all their lives mr shamrock faith then if you dont like the hotels and the railroads go to paris or london weve done widout you up to now and we can kape on doing widout you wed have more money to spind in entertainin you if the government hadnt taken three million of pounds out of us to build fortifications in china mr rose thats all bosh and nonsense you wouldnt know how to manage an hotel if you had the money mr shamrock if we cant make hotelkapers its soldiers we can make and be the same token you cant manage india or canada widout our help faith england owes ireland more than she can pay and its not her business to be thravelin round criticisin the throubles shes helped to projuce mr rose william ewart gladstone did enough for your island to make up for all the harm that the other statesmen may or may not have done mr shamrock touched in his most vulnerable point shrieks above the rattle of the wheels the wurrst statesman that iver put his name to paper was william ewart gladstone mr rose the best i say mr shamrock i say the wurrst mr rose the best mr shamrock the wurrst mr rose after a pause its your absentee landlords that have done the mischief id hang every one of them if i had my way mr shamrock faith theyd be absent thin sure enough and at this everybody laughs and the trouble is over for a brief space much to the relief of mrs shamrock until her husband finds himself after a little sufficiently calm to repeat a cockney anecdote which is received by mr rose in resentful silence it being merely a description of the common bat an unfortunate animal that according to mr shamrock as no ole to ide in no ands to old by no orns to urt with though nature as given im ooks beind to itch imself up by the last two noteworthy personages in our party are a dapper frenchman who is in business at manchester and a portly londoner both of whom are seeing ireland for the first time the frenchman does not grumble at the weather for he says that in manchester it rains twice a day all the year round save during the winter when it commonly rains all day sir james paget in an address on recreation defined its chief element to be surprise if that is true the portly londoner must be exhilarated beyond words but with him the sensation does not stop with surprise it speedily becomes amazement and then horror for he is of the comparative type and therefore sees things done and hears things said on every hand that are not said and done at all in the same way in london he sees people ay and policemen bicycling on footpaths and riding without lamps and is horrified to learn that they are seldom if ever prosecuted he is shocked at the cabins and the rocks and the beggar children and the lack of trees at the lack of logic also and the lack of shoes at the prevalence of the brogue above all at the presence of the pig in the parlour he is outraged at the weather and he minds getting wet the more because he hates irish whisky he keeps a little notebook and he can hardly wait for dinner to be over he is so anxious to send a communication probably signed veritas to the london times the multiplicity of rocks and the absence of trees are indeed the two most striking features of the landscape and yet boate says in ancient times as long as the land was in full possession of the irish themselves all ireland was very full of woods on every side as evidently appeareth by the writings of giraldus cambrensis but this was long ago ere the emerald gem of the western world was set in the brow of a stranger in the long wars with the english these forests were the favourite refuge of the natives and it was a common saying that the irish could never be tamed while the leaves were upon the trees then passages were cut through the woods and the policy of felling them as a military measure was begun and carried forward on a gigantic scale in elizabeths reign at one of the cabins along the road they were making great preparations which we understood from having seen the same thing in lisdara there are wee villages and solitary cabins so far from chapel that the priests establish stations for confession a certain house is selected and all the old infirm and feeble ones come there to confess and hear mass the priest afterwards eats breakfast with the family and there is great pride in this function and great rivalry in the humble arrangements mrs odevaine often lends a linen cloth and flowers to one of her neighbours she tells us to another a knife and fork or a silver teapot and so on this cabin was at the foot of a long hill and the driver gave me permission to walk so francesca and i slipped down i with a parcel which chanced to have in it some small purchases made at the last hotel we asked if we might help a bit and give a little teapot of belleek ware and a linen doily trimmed with irish lace both the articles were trumpery bits of souvenirs but the old dame was inclined to think that the angels and saints had taken her in charge and nothing could exceed her gratitude she offered us a potato from the pot a cup of tea or goats milk and a bunch of wildflowers from a cracked cup and this last we accepted as we departed in a shower of blessings the most interesting of them being may the blessed virgin twine your brow with roses when ye sit in the sates of glory and the lord be good to ye and sind ye a duke for a husband we felt more than repaid for our impulsive interest and as we disappeared from sight a last bannact dea leat gods blessing be on your way was wafted to our ears i seem to have known all these people before and indeed i have met them between the covers of a book for connemara has one prophet and her name is jane barlow in how many of these wild boglands of connaught have we seen a huddle of desolate cabins on a rocky hillside turf stacks looking darkly at the doors and empty black pots sitting on the thresholds and fancied we have found lisconnel i should recognise ody rafferty the widow mgurk mad bell old mrs kilfoyle or stacey doyne if i met them face to face just as i should know other real human creatures of a higher type beatrix esmond becky sharp meg merrilies or di vernon chapter xxiii beams and motes mud cabins swarm in this place so charming with sailor garments hung out to dry and each abode is snug and commodious with pigs melodious in their strawbuilt sty father prout did the irish elves ever explain themselves to you red rose i cant say that they did said the english elf you cant call it an explanation to say that a thing has always been that way just or that a thing would be a heap more bother any other way the west of ireland is depressing but it is very beautiful at least if your taste includes an appreciation of what is wild magnificent and sombre oppressed you must be even if you are an artist by its bleakness and its dreariness its lonely lakes reflecting a dull grey sky its desolate boglands its solitary chapels its wretched cabins perched on hillsides that are very wildernesses of rocks but for cloud effects for wonderful shadows for fantastic and unbelievable sunsets when the mountains are violet the lakes silver with red flashes the islets gold and crimson and purple and the whole cloudy west in a flame it is unsurpassed only your standard of beauty must not be a velvet lawn studded with copper beeches or a primaryhued landscape bathed in american sunshine connemara is austere and gloomy under a dull sky but it has the poetic charm that belongs to all mystery and its bare cliffs and ridges are delicately pencilled on a violet background in a way peculiar to itself and enchantingly lovely the waste of all gods gifts the incredible poverty the miserable huts often without window or chimney the sadeyed women sometimes nothing but skins bones and grief the wild beautiful children springing up like startled deer from behind piles of rocks or growths of underbrush the stony little bits of earth which the peasants cling to with such passion while good grasslands lie unused yet seem for ever out of reach all this makes one dream and wonder and speculate and hope against hope that the worst is over and a better day dawning we passed within sight of a hill village without a single road to connect it with the outer world the only supply of turf was on the mountaintop and from thence it had to be brought basket by basket even in the snow the only manure for such land is seaweed and that must be carried from the shore to the tiny plats of sterile earth on the hillside i remember it all for i refused to buy a pair of stockings of a woman along the road we had taken so many that my courage failed but i saw her climbing the slopes patiently wearily a shawl over her white hair knitting knitting knitting as she walked in the rain to her cabin somewhere behind the high hills we never give to beggars in any case but we buy whatever we can as we are able and why did i draw the line at that particular pair of stockings only to be haunted by that pathetic figure for the rest of my life beggars there are by the score chiefly in the tourist districts but it is only fair to add that there are hundreds of huts where it would be a dire insult to offer a penny for a glass of water a sup of milk or the shelter of a turf fire as we drive along the road we see if the umbrellas can be closed for a halfhour flocks of sheep grazing on the tops of the hills where it is sunnier where food is better and flies less numerous crystal streams and waterfalls are pouring down the hillsides to lose themselves in one of connemaras many bays and we have a glimpse of osmunda fern golden green and beautiful it was under a branch of this osmunda regalis that the irish princess lay hidden they say till she had evaded her pursuers the blue turf smoke rises here and there now from a cabin with houseleek growing on the crumbling thatch now from one whose roof is held on by ropes and stones and there is always a turf bog stacks and stacks of the cut blocks a woman in a gown of darkred flannel resting for a moment with the empty creel beside her and a man cutting in the distance after climbing the long hill beyond the station we are rewarded by a glimpse of more fertile fields the clumps of ragwort and purple loosestrife are reinforced with kingcups and lilies growing near the wayside and the rare sight first of a pot of geraniums in the window and then of a garden all aglow with red fuchsias torch plants and huge dahlias so cheers veritas that he takes heart again this is something like home he exclaims breezily whereupon mr shamrock murmurs that if people find nothing to admire in a foreign country save what resembles their own he wonders that they take the trouble to be travelling it is a darlin year for the pitaties the drivers says and there are plenty of them planted hereabouts even in stony spots not worth a keenogue for anything else for pitaties doesnt require anny inthricket farmin you see maam the clergyman remarks that only three things are required to make ireland the most attractive country in the world protestantism cleanliness and gardens and mr shamrock who is of course a roman catholic answers this tactful speech in a way that surprises the speaker and keeps him silent for hours the birmingham cutler who has a copy of ismays children in his pocket triumphantly reads aloud at this moment a remark put into the mouth of an irish character the low irish are quite destitute of all notion of beauty have not the remotest particle of artistic sentiment or taste their cabins are exactly as they were six hundred years ago for they never want to improve themselves then mr shamrock asserts that any show of prosperity on a tenants part would only mean an advance of rent on the landlords and mr rose retorts that while that might have been true in former times it is utterly false today mrs shamrock who is a natural apologist pleads that the irish gentry have the most beautiful gardens in the world and the greatest natural taste in gardening and there must be some reason why the lower classes are so different in this respect may it not be due partly to lack of ground lack of money to spend on seeds and fertilisers lack of all refining civilising and educating influences mr shamrock adds that the dwellers in cabins cannot successfully train creepers against the walls or flowers in the dooryard because of the goat pig donkey ducks hens and chickens and veritas asks triumphantly why dont you keep the pig in a sty then the man with the evergreen heart who has already been told this morning that i am happily married francesca engaged salemina a determined celibate but benella quite at liberty peeps under saleminas umbrella at this juncture and says tenderly and what do you think about these vexed questions dear madam which gives her a chance to reply with some distinctness i shall not know what i think for several months to come and at any rate there are various things more needed on this coach than opinions at this the frenchman murmurs ah she has right and the birmingham cutler says ear ear on another day the parson began to tell the man with the evergreen heart some interesting things about america he had never been there himself but he had a cousin who had travelled extensively in that country and had brought back much unusual information the americans are an extraordinary people on the practical side he remarked but having said that you have said all for they are sordid and absolutely devoid of ideality take an american at his rollertop desk a telephone at one side and a typewriter at the other talk to him of pork and dollars and you have him at his very best he always keeps on his panama hat at business and sits in a rockingchair smoking a long cigar the american woman wears a blue dress with a red lining or a black dress with orange trimmings showing a survival of african taste while another exhibits the americanindian type sallow with high cheekbones the manners of the servant classes are extraordinary i believe they are called the help and they commonly sit in the drawingroom after the work is finished you surprise me said mrs shamrock it is indeed amazing he continued and there are other extraordinary customs among them the habit of mixing ices with all beverages they plunge ices into mugs of ale beer porter lemonade or apollinaris and sip the mixture with a long ladle at the chemists counter where it is usually served you surprise me exclaimed the cutler you surprise me too i echoed in my inmost heart francesca would not have confined herself to that blameless mode of expression you may be sure and i was glad that she was on the back seat of the car i did not know it at the time but veritas who is a man of intelligence had identified her as an american and wishing to inform himself on all possible points had asked her frankly why it was that the people of her nation gave him the impression of never being restful or quiet but always so excessively and abnormally quick in motion and speech and thought casual impressions are not worth anything she replied nonchalantly as a nation you might sometimes give us the impression of being phlegmatic and slowwitted both ideas may have some basis of fact yet not be absolutely true we are not all abnormally quick in america look at our messenger boys for example we phlegmatic and slowwitted exclaimed veritas you surprise me and why do you not reward these government messengers for speed and stimulate them in that way we do francesca answered that is the only way in which we ever get them to arrive anywhere by rewarding and stimulating them at both ends of the journey and sometimes in extreme cases at a halfway station this is most interesting said veritas as he took out his damp notebook and perhaps you can tell me why your newspapers are so poorly edited so cheap so sensational i confess i cant explain it she sighed as if sorely puzzled can it be that we have expended our strength on magazines where you are so lamentably weak at this moment the rain began as if there had been a long drought and the sky had just determined to make up the deficiency it fell in sheets and the wind blew i know not how many irish miles an hour the frenchman put on a silk macintosh with a cape and was berated by everybody in the same seat because he stood up a moment and let the water in under the lap covers his umbrella was a dainty entoutcas with a motherofpearl handle that had answered well enough in heavy mist or soft drizzle his hat of fine straw was tied with a neat cord to his buttonhole but although that precaution insured its ultimate safety it did not prevent its soaring from his head and descending on mrs shamrocks bonnet he conscientiously tried holding it on with one hand but was then reproved by both neighbours because his macintosh dripped over them how are your spirits frenchy asked the cutler jocosely i am not too greatly sad said the poor gentleman but i will be glad it should be finished far more joyfully would i be at manchester triste as it may be just then a gust of wind blew his cape over his head and snapped his parasol it is evidently it has been made in ireland he sighed with a desperate attempt at gaiety it should have had a grosser stem and helas it must not be easy to have it mended in these barbarous veelages we stopped at four oclock at a wayside hostelry and i had quietly made up my mind to descend from the car and take rooms for the night whatever the place might be unfortunately the same idea occurred to three or four of the soaked travellers and as men could leap down while ladies must wait for the steps the chivalrous sex their manners obscured by the circular tour system secured the rooms and i was obliged to ascend again wetter than ever to my perch beside the driver can i get the box seat do you think if i pay extra for it i had asked one of the stablemen before breakfast you dont need to be payin miss just confront the driver and youll get it aisy if by the way i had confronted him at the end instead of at the beginning of the journey my charms certainly would not have been allpowerful for my coat had been leaked upon by red and green umbrellas my hat was a shapeless jelly and my face imprinted with the spots from a drenched blue veil after two hours more of this we reached the shan van vocht hotel where we had engaged apartments but we found to our consternation that it was full and that we had been put in lodgings a halfmile away salemina whose patience was quite exhausted by the discomforts of the day groaned aloud when we were deposited at the door of a village shop and ushered upstairs to our tiny quarters but she ceased abruptly when she really took note of our surroundings everything was humble but clean and shining glass crockery bedding floor on the which we were dripping pools of water while our landladys daughter tried to make us more comfortable its a soft night were havin she said in a doves voice but well do right enough if the win doesnt rise up on us left to ourselves we walked about the wee rooms on ever new and more joyful voyages of discovery the curtains rolled up and down easily the windows were propped upon nice clean sticks instead of tennis rackets and hearth brushes there was a wellwashed stone to keep the curtain down on the sill and just outside were tiny window gardens in each of which grew three marigolds and three asters in a box fenced about with little green pickets there were welldusted books on the tables and francesca wanted to sit down immediately to the charming cora reprinted from the girls own paper salemina meantime had tempted fate by looking under the bed where she found the floor so exquisitely neat that she patted it affectionately with her hand we had scarcely donned our dry clothing when the hotel proprietor sent a jauntingcar for our drive to the sevenoclock table dhote dinner we carefully avoided our travelling companions that night but learned the next morning that the frenchman had slept on four chairs and rejected the hotel coffee with the remark that it was not veritable a criticism in which he was quite justified our comparative englishman had occupied a cot in a room where the tin bathtubs were kept he was writing to the times at the moment of telling me his woes and without seeing the letter i could divine his impassioned advice never to travel in the west of ireland in rainy weather he remarked as if quoting from his own communication that the scenery was magnificent but that there was an entirely insufficient supply of hot water that the waiters had the appearance of being low comedians and their service was of the character one might expect from that description that he had been talking before breakfast with a german gentleman who had sat on a wall opposite the village of dugort in the island of achill from six oclock in the morning until nine and in that time he had seen coming out of an irish hut three geese eight goslings six hens fifteen chickens two pigs two cows two barefooted girls the master of the house leading a horse three small children carrying cloth bags filled with schoolbooks and finally a strapping mother leading a donkey loaded with peatbaskets that all this poverty and ignorance and indolence and filth was spoiling his holiday and finally that if he should be as greatly disappointed in the fishing as he had been in the hotel accommodations here we almost fainted from suspense he should be obliged to go home and not only that but he should feel it his duty to warn others of what they might expect perhaps you are justified said francesca sympathetically people who are used to the dry sunny climate and the clear atmosphere of london ought not to expose themselves to irish rain without due consideration he agreed with her glancing over his spectacles to see if she by any possibility could be amusing herself at his expense good old fussy faultfinding veritas but indeed francescas eyes were so soft and lovely and honest that the more he looked at her the less he could do her the injustice of suspecting her sincerity but mind you although i would never confess it to veritas because he sees nothing but flaws on every side the irish pig is to my taste a trifle too much in the foreground he pays the rent no doubt but this magnificent achievement could be managed from a sty in the rear ungrateful as it might seem to immure so useful a personage behind a door or conceal his virtues from the public at large chapter xxiv humours of the road cheerful at morn he wakes from short repose breasts the keen air and carols as he goes oliver goldsmith if you drive from clifden to oughterard by way of maam cross and then on to galway you will pass through the oflahertys country one of whom murrough oflaherty was governor of this country of iar western connaught you will like to see the last of the oflaherty yews a thousand years old at least and the ruins of the castle and banquetinghall the family glories are enumerated in ancient irish manuscript and instead of the butler footman chef coachman and gardener of today we read of the oflaherty physician standardbearer brehon or judge master of the revels and keeper of the bees and the moment himself is rich enough i intend to add some of these picturesque personages to our staff we afterwards learned that there was formerly an inscription over the west gate of galway from the fury of the oflaherties good lord deliver us after richard de burgo took the town in it became a flourishing english colony and the citizens must have guarded themselves from any intercourse with the native irish at least an old bylaw of enacts that neither o nor mac shalle strutte ne swaggere thro the streetes of galway we did not go to galway straight because we never do anything straight we seldom get any reliable information and never any inspiring suggestions from the natives themselves they are all patriotically sure that ireland is the finest counthry in the world god bless her but in the matter of seeing that finest counthry in the easiest or best fashion they are all very vague indirectly our own lack of geography coupled with the ignorance of the people themselves has been of the greatest service in enlivening our journeys francesca says that in looking back she finds that our errors of judgment have always resulted in our most charming and unforgettable experiences but let no one who is travelling with a wellbalanced and logicalminded man attempt to follow in our footsteps being as free as air on this occasion if i except the dread of benellas scorn which descends upon us now and then and moves us to repentance sometimes even to better behaviour we passed porridgetown and cloomore and ferried across to the opposite side of lough corrib salemina of course had fixed upon cong as our objective point because of its caverns and archaeological remains which dr la touche tells her not on any account to miss francesca and i said nothing but we had a very definite idea of avoiding cong and going nearer tuam to climb knockma the hill of the fairies and explore their ancient haunts and archaeological remains which are more in our line than the caverns of cong speaking of dr la touche reminds me that we have not the smallest notion as to how our middleaged romance is progressing absence may at this juncture be just as helpful a force in its development as daily intercourse would be for when one is past thirty i fancy there is a deal of thinkingitover to do precious little there is when we are younger heart does it all then and never asks heads advice but in too much delay there lies no plenty and theres the danger actually francesca and i could be no more anxious to settle salemina in life if she were lame halt blind and homeless instead of being attractive charming absurdly young for her age and not without means the difficulty is that she is one of those continent persisting immovable persons whom emerson describes as marked out for the blessing of the world that quality always makes a man anxious he fears that he may only get his rightful share of blessing and he craves the whole output so to speak we naturally mention dr la touche very often since he is always writing to salemina or to me offering counsel and suggestion madame la touche the venerable aunt has written also asking us to visit them in meath but this invitation we have declined principally because the colquhouns will be with them and they would surely be burdened by the addition of three ladies and a maid to their family partly because we shall be freer in our own house which will be as near the la touche mansion as possible you may be sure if francesca and i have anything to do with choosing it the la touche name then is often on our lips but salemina offers no intimation that it is indelibly imprinted on her heart of hearts it is a good name to be written anywhere and we fancied there was the slightest possible hint of pride and possession in saleminas voice when she read to us tonight from her third volume of leckys history of ireland in the eighteenth century a paragraph concerning one david la touche from whom dr gerald is descended in the last of the irish parliaments no less than five members of the name sat together in the house of commons and his family may claim what is in truth the highest honour of which an irish family can boast that during many successive governments and in a period of most lavish corruption it possessed great parliamentary influence and yet passed through political life untitled and unstained there is just the faintest gleam of hope by the way that himself may join us at the very end of june and he is sure to be helpful on this sentimental journey he aided ronald and francesca more than once in their tempestuous loveaffair and if his wits are not dulled by marriage as so often happens he will be invaluable it will not be long then probably before i assume my natural my secondary position in the landscape of events the junior partners are now so to speak on their legs although it is idle to suppose that such brittle appendages will support them for any length of time as soon as we return in the autumn i should like to advertise if himself will permit me for a perfectly sound and kind junior partner one who has been well broken to harness and who will neither shy nor balk no matter what the provocation the next step being to urge himself to relinquish altogether the bondage of business care there is no need of his continuing in it since other peoples business will always give him ample scope for his energies he has since his return to america dispensed justice and mercy chiefly mercy to one embezzler one honest fellow tempted beyond his strength one widow one unfortunate friend of his youth and two orphans and it was in no sense an extraordinary season to return to notes of travel our method of progression since we deserted the highroad and the public car has been strangely varied i think there is no manner of steed or vehicle which has not been used by us at one time or another even to the arch donkey and the lowbacked car with its truss of hay like that of the immortal peggy i thought at first that arch was an unusual adjective to apply to a donkey but i find after all that it is abundantly expressive benella who disapproves entirely of this casual sort of travelling far from answerable roads and in backwards places irish for behind the times is yet wonderfully successful in discovering equipages of some sort in unlikely spots in towns of any size or pretensions we find by the town cross or near the inn a motley collection of things on wheels with drivers sometimes as sober as father mathew sometimes not yesterday we had a mare which the driver confessed he bought without overcircumspectin it and although you couldnt as he said extinguish her at first sight from a grand throtter she hadnt rightly the speed you could wish its not so powerful young she is melady he confessed youd be afther lookin at a chicken a long time and niver be reminded of her but sure ye might thry her for belike ye wouldnt fancy a horse that would be leppin stone walls wid ye like dan ryans there my little bastell get ye to rossan before night and she wont hurt man nor mortial in doin it begorra youre right nor herself nayther said dan ryan and if its leppin ye mane sure she couldnt lep a sod o turf that mare couldnt god pardon ye melady for thrustin yerself to that paiceable brindlycoloured ould hin whin ye might be gettin a dacint highsteppin horse for a shillin or two more an belike i might contint meself to take less for i wouldnt be extortin ye like barney omara there our chosen driver replied to this by saying that he wouldnt be caught dead at a pig fair with dan ryans horse but in the midst of all the distracting discussions and arguments that followed we held to our original bargain for we did not like the look of dan ryans highstepper who was a thrifle mountainy as they say in these parts and had a wild eye to boot we started and in a halfhour we could still see the chapel spire of the little village we had just left it was for once a beautiful day but we felt that we must reach a railway station some time or other in order to find a place to sleep cant you make her go a bit faster do you want to keep us on the road all night inquired francesca i do not your ladyships honour maam is she tired or doesnt she ever go any better urged salemina she does its gods truth im tellin ye melady shes that flippant sometimes that i scarcely can hould her and the car jumps undher her like a spring bed then what on earth is the matter with her i inquired with some fire in my eye sure i believe shes takin time to think of the iligant load shes carryin melady and small blame to her said mr barney omara and after that we let him drive as best he could although it did take us four hours to do nine irish miles he came did mr barney from county armagh and he beguiled the way with interesting tales from that section of ireland one of which the old crow and the young crow particularly took our fancies an old crow was teaching a young crow one day and says to him now my son says he listen to the advice im going to give you says he if you see a person coming near you and stooping mind yourself and be on your keeping hes stooping for a stone to throw at you says he but tell me says the young crow what should i do if he had a stone already down in his pocket says he musha go long out of that says the old crow youve learned enough the divil another learning im able to give you he was a perfect honeypot of useless and unreliable information was barney omara and most learned in fairy lore but for that matter all the people walking along the road the drivers the boatman and guides the men and women in the cottages where we stop in a shower or to inquire the way relate stories of phookas leprehauns and sprites banshees and all the various classes of elves and fays as simply and seriously as they would speak of any other occurrences barney told us gravely of the old woman who was in the habit of laying pishogues charms to break the legs of his neighbours cattle because of an ancient grudge she bore him and also how necessary it is to put a bit of burning turf under the churn to prevent the phookas or mischievous fairies from abstracting the butter or spoiling the churning in any way irish fays seem to be much interested in dairy matters for besides the sprites who delight in distracting the cream and keeping back the butter i wonder if a lazy upanddown movement of the dasher invites them at all at all it is well known that many a milkmaid on a may morning has seen fairy cows browsing along the banks of lakes cows that vanish into thin mist at the sound of human footfall when we were quite cross at missing the noon train from rossan quite tired of the cars jolting somewhat vexed even at the mares continued enjoyment of her iligant load barney appeased us all by singing in a delightful mellow voice a fairy song called the leprehaun this personage you must know if you havent a large acquaintance among irish fairies is a tricksy fellow in a green coat and scarlet cap with brave shoe buckles on his wee brogues you will catch him sometimes if the glamour is on you under a burdock leaf or a thorn bush and he is always making or mending a shoe he commonly has a little purse about him which if you are quick enough you can snatch and a wonderful purse it is for whatever you spend there is always money to be found in it truth to tell nobody has yet succeeded in being quicker than master leprehaun though many have offered to fill his cruiskeen with mountain dew of which irish fairies are passionately fond by patrick w joyce in a shady nook one moonlight night a leprehaun i spied with scarlet cap and coat of green a cruiskeen by his side twas tick tack tick his hammer went upon a weeny shoe and i laughed to think of his purse of gold but the fairy was laughing too with tiptoe step and beating heart quite softly i drew nigh there was mischief in his merry face a twinkle in his eye he hammered and sang with tiny voice and drank his mountain dew and i laughed to think he was caught at last but the fairy was laughing too as quick as thought i seized the elf your fairy purse i cried the purse he said tis in her hand that lady at your side i turned to look the elf was off then what was i to do o i laughed to think what a fool id been and the fairy was laughing too i cannot communicate any idea of the rollicking gaiety and quaint charm barney gave to the tune nor the lighthearted irresistible chuckle with which he rendered the last two lines giving a snap of his whip as accent to the long o o i laughed to think what a fool id been and the fairy was laughing too after he had sung it twice through benella took my guitar from its case for me and we sang it after him again and again so it was in happy fashion that we at least approached ballyrossan where we bade barney omara a cordial farewell paying him four shillings over his fare which was cheap indeed for the song as we saw him vanish slowly up the road ragged himself the car and harness almost ready to drop to pieces the mare i am sure in the last week of her existence we were glad that he had his celtic fancy to enliven his life a bit that fancy which seems a providential reaction against the cruel despotisms of fact chapter xxv the wee folk there sings a bonnie linnet up the heather glen the voice has magic in it too sweet for mortal men sing o the blooming heather o the heather glen where fairest fairies gather to lure in mortal men carrigafooka inn near knockma on the shores of lough corrib a modern irish poet says something that francesca has quoted to ronald in her letter today and we await from scotland his confirmation or denial he accuses the scots of having discovered the fairies to be pagan and wicked and of denouncing them from the pulpits whereas irish priests discuss with them the state of their souls or at least they did until it was decided that they had none but would dry up like so much bright vapour at the last day it was more in sadness than in anger that the priests announced this fiat for irish sprites and goblins do gay graceful and humorous things for the most part tricksy sins not deserving annihilation whereas scottish fays are sometimes malevolent or so says the irish poet w b yeats this is very sad no doubt but it does not begin to be as sad as having no fairies at all there must have been a few in england in shakespeares time or he could never have written the tempest or the midsummer nights dream but where have they vanished as for us in america i fear that we never have had any wee folk the indians had their woodland spirits spirits of rocks trees mountains star and moon maidens the negroes had their enchanted animals and conjure men but as for real wee folk either they were not indigenous to the soil or else we unconsciously drove them away yet we had facilities to offer the columbines harebells and fringed gentians would have been just as cosy and secluded places to live in as the irish foxgloves which are simply running over with fairies perhaps they wouldnt have liked our cold winters still it must have been something more than climate and i am afraid i know the reason well we are too sensible and if there is anything a fairy detests it is commonsense we are too rich also and a second thing that a fairy abhors is the chink of dollars perhaps when i am again enjoying the advantages brought about by sound money commercial prosperity and a magnificent system of public education i shall feel differently about it but for the moment i am just a bit embarrassed and crestfallen to belong to a nation absolutely shunned by the fairies if they had only settled among us like other colonists shaped us to their ends as far as they could and when they couldnt conformed themselves to ours there might have been by this time fairy trusts stretching out benign arms all over the continent of course it is an age of incredulity but salemina francesca and i have not come to ireland to scoff and whatever we do we shall not go to the length of doubting the fairies for as barney omara says they stand to raison glen ailna is a gentle place near carrigafooka inn that is one beloved by the sheehogues and though you may be never so much interested i may not tell you its exact whereabouts since no one can ever find it unless he is himself under the glamour perhaps you might be a doubter with no eyes for the dim kingdom perhaps you might gaze for ever and never be able to see a redcapped fiddler fiddling under a blossoming sloe bush you might even see him and then indulge yourself in a fit of commonsense or doubt of your own eyes in which case the wee dancers would never flock to the sound of the fiddle or gather on the fairy ring this is the reason that i shall never take you to knockma to glen ailna or especially to the hyacinth wood which is a little plantation near the ruin of a fort just why the fairies are so fond of an old rath or lis i cannot imagine for you would never suppose that antiquaries archaeologists and wee folk would care for the same places i have no intention of interviewing the grander personages among the irish fairies for they are known to be haughty unapproachable and severe as befits the descendants of the great nature gods and the underdeities of flood and fell and angry sea it is the lesser folk the gay gracious little men that i wish to meet those who pipe and dance on the fairy ring the ring is made you know by the tiny feet that have tripped for ages and ages flying dancing circling over the tender young grass rain cannot wash it away you may walk over it you may even plough up the soil and replant it ever so many times the next season the fairy ring shines in the grass just the same it seems strange that i am blind to it when an ignorant dirty spalpeen who lives near the foot of knockma has seen it and heard the fairy music again and again he took me to the very place where last lammas eve he saw plainly for there was a beautiful white moon overhead the arch king and queen of the fairies who appear only on state occasions together with a crowd of dancers and more than a dozen pipers piping melodious music not only that but lucky little beggar he heard distinctly the fulparnee and the folpornee the raplayhoota and the roolyaboolya noises indicative of the very jolliest and wildest and most uncommon form of fairy conviviality failing a glimpse of these midsummer revels my next choice would be to see the elf horseman galloping round the shores of the fairy lough in the cool of the morn loughareema loughareema stars come out and stars are hidin the wather whispers on the stones the flittherin moths are free onest before the mornin light the horseman will come ridin roun an roun the fairy lough an no one there to see but there will be some one there and that is the aforesaid jamesy flanigan sometimes i think he is fibbing but a glance at his soft dark farseeing eyes under their fringe of thick lashes convinces me to the contrary his field of vision is different from mine that is all and he fears that if i accompany him to the shores of the fairy lough the horseman will not ride for him so i am even taunted with undue commonsense by a little irish gossoon i tried to coax benella to go with me to the hyacinth wood by moonlight fairies detest a crowd and i ought to have gone alone but to tell the truth i hardly dared for they have a way of kidnapping attractive ladies and keeping them for years in the dim kingdom i would not trust himself at glen ailna for worlds for gentlemen are not exempt from danger connla of the golden hair was lured away by a fairy maiden and taken in a gleaming straightgliding strong crystal canoe to her domain in the hills and oisin you remember was transported to the land of the ever youthful by the beautiful niam if one could only be sure of coming back but oisin for instance was detained three hundred years so one might not be allowed to return and still worse one might not wish to three hundred years of youth would tempt a woman my opinion after reading the elf errant is that one of us has been there moira oneill i should suspect her of being able to wear a fairy cap herself were it not for the human heartthrob in her verses but i am sure she has the glamour whenever she desires it and hears the fairy pipes at will benella is of different stuff she not only distrusts fairies but like the scotch presbyterians she fears that they are wicked still you say they havent got immortal souls to save and i dont suppose theyre responsible for their actions she allows but as for traipsing up to those heathenish haunted woods when all christian folks are in bed i dont believe in it and neither would mr beresford but if youre set on it i shall go with you you wouldnt be of the slightest use i answered severely indeed youd be worse than nobody the fairies cannot endure doubters it makes them fold their wings over their heads and shrink away into their flowercups i should be mortified beyond words if a fairy should meet me in your company benella seemed hurt and a trifle resentful as she replied that about doubters is just what mrs kimberly used to say mrs kimberly is the salem priestess the originator of the science she couldnt talk a mite if there was doubters in the hall and its so with spiritualists and clairvoyants too theyre all of em scarecats i guess likely that those thats so afraid of being doubted has some good reason for it well i never went to the hyacinth wood by moonlight since so many objections were raised but i did go once at noonday the very most unlikely hour of all the twentyfour and yet as i sat there beneath a gnarled thorn weary and warm with my climb i looked into the heart of a bluebell forest growing under a circle of gleaming silver birches and suddenly i heard fairy musicat least it was not mortal and many sounds were mingled in it the sighing of birches the carol of a lark the leap and laugh of a silvery runnel tumbling down the hillside the soft whir of butterflies wings and a sweet little over or under tone from the over or under world that i took to be the opening of a million hyacinth buds in the sunshine then i heard the delicious sound of a fairy laugh and looking under a swaying branch of meadowsweet i saw yes i really saw you must know that first a wee green door swung open in the stem of the meadowsweet and out of that land where you can buy joy for a penny came a fairy in the usual red and green i had the elf errant in my lap and i think that in itself made him feel more at home with me as well as the fact perhaps that for the moment i wasnt a bit sensible and had no money about me i was all ready with an irish salutation for the purposes of further disarming his aversion i intended to say as prettily as possible though alas i cannot manage the brogue and what way do i see you now or goodmornin to yer honours honour but i was struck dumb by my good fortune at seeing him at all he looked at me once and then flinging up his arms he gave a weeny weeny yawn this was disconcerting for people almost never yawn in my company and to make it worse he kept on yawning until for very sympathy and not at all in the way of revenge i yawned too then the green door swung open again and a gay rabble of wideawake fairies came trooping out and some of them kissed the hyacinth bells to open them and some of them flew to the thorntree until every little brancheen was white with flowers where but a moment ago had been tightlyclosed buds the yawning fairy slept meanwhile under the swaying meadowsweet and the butterflies fanned him with their soft wings but alas it could not have been the hour for dancing on the fairy ring nor the proper time for the fairy pipers and long long as i looked i saw and heard nothing more than what i have told you indeed i presently lost even that for a bee buzzed a white petal dropped from the thorntree on my face there was a scraping of tiny claws and the sound of two squirrels barking love to each other in the high branches and in that moment the glamour that was upon me vanished in a twinkling but i really did see the fairies i exclaimed triumphantly to benella the doubter when i returned carrigafooka inn much too late for luncheon i want to know she exclaimed in her new england vernacular i guess by the looks o your eyes they didnt turn out to be very lively compny part fifth royal meath chapter xxvi irelands gold i sat upon the rustic seatthe seat an aged baytree crownsand saw outspreading from our feet the golden glory of the downs the furzecrowned heights the glorious glen the whitewalled chapel glistening near the house of god the homes of men the fragrant hay the ripening ear denis florence mcarthy the old hall devorgilla vale of the boyne we have now lived in each of irelands four provinces leinster munster ulster and connaught but the confines of these provinces and their number have changed several times since the beginning of history in ad the milesian monarchy was restored in the person of tuathal toohal the legitimate over each of the irish provinces was a ri or king and there was also over all ireland an ardri or supreme monarch who lived at tara up to the time of its abandonment in the sixth century before tuathals day the ardri had for his land allowance only a small tract around tara but tuathal cut off a portion from each of the four older provinces at the great stone of divisions in the centre of ireland making the fifth province of royal meath which has since disappeared but which was much larger than the present two counties of meath and westmeath in this once famous and now most lovely and fertile spot with the good republicans love of royalty and royal institutions we have settled ourselves in the midst of verdant plains watered by the boyne and the blackwater here rippling over shallows there meandering in slow deep reaches between reedy banks the old hall from which i write is somewhere in the vale of the boyne somewhere near yellow steeple not so far from treadagh only a few miles from ballybilly i hope to be forgiven this irreverence to the glorious memory of his majesty william prince of orange and within driving distance of killkienan croaghpatrick domteagh and tara hill itself if you know your royal meath these geographical suggestions will give you some idea of our location if not take your map of ireland please a thing nobody has near him and find the town of tuam where you left us a little time ago you will see a railway line from tuam to athenry athlone and mullingar anybody can visit mullingar it is for the million but only the elect may go to devorgilla it is the captive of our bow and spear or to change the figure it is a violet by a mossy stone which we refuse to have plucked from its poetic solitude and worn in the bosom or in the buttonhole of the tourist at mullingar then we slip on enchanted garments which conceal us from the casual eye and disappear into what is in midsummer a bower of beauty there you will find when you find us devorgilla lovely enough to be tirnanog that land of the ever youthful well know to the celts of long ago here we have rested our weary bodies and purified our travelstained minds fresh from the povertyridden hillsides of connaught these rich grazinglands comfortable houses magnificent demesnes and castles are unspeakably grateful to the eye and healing to the spirit we have not forgotten shall never forget our connemara folk nor yet omadhaun pat and dark timsy of lisdara in the north but it is good for a change to breathe in this sense of general comfort good cheer and abundance benella is radiant for she is near enough to trim to go there occasionally to seek for traces of her ancestress mary boyce and as for salemina this bit of country is a mecca for antiquaries and scholars and we are fairly surrounded by towers tumuli and cairns its mostly ruins they do be wantin these days said a wayside acquaintance i built a stone house for my donkey on the knockaun beyant my cabin just and bedad theres a crowd round it every saturday callin it the risidence of wan of the danish kings an they are diggin at tara now maam looking for the ark of the covenant they do be sayin the prophet jeremiah come over from england and brought it wid him begorra its a lucky man he was to get away wid it added to these advantages of position we are within a few miles of rosnaree dr la touches demesne to which he comes home from dublin tomorrow bringing with him our dear mr and mrs colquhoun of ardnagreena we have been here ourselves for ten days and are flattered to think that we have used the time as unconventionally as we could well have done we made a literary pilgrimage first but that is another story and i will only say that we had a day in edgeworthstown and a drive through goldsmiths country where we saw the deserted village with its mill and brook the church that tops the neighbouring hill and even rested under the hawthorn bush with seats beneath the shade for talking age and whispering lovers made there are many parts of ireland where one could not find a habitable house to rent but in this locality they are numerous enough to make it possible to choose we had driven over perhaps twenty square miles of country with the view of selecting the most delectable spot that could be found without going too far from rosnaree the chief trouble was that we always desired every dwelling that we saw i tell you this with a view of lessening the shock when i confess that before we came to the old hall where we are now settled for a month and which was saleminas choice francesca and i took two different houses and lived in them for seven days each in solitary splendour like the prince of coolavin it was not difficult to agree upon the district we were of one mind there the moment that we passed the town and drove along the flowery way that leads to devorgilla we knew that it was the road of destiny the whitethorn is very late this year and we found ourselves in the full glory of it it is beautiful in all its stages from the time when it first opens its buds to the season when every spray is white with may and blooms the eglantine there is no hint of green leaf visible then and every tree is as white as snow of one night this is the gaelic comparison and the first snow seems especially white and dazzling i suppose when one sees it in the morning where were green fields the night before the sloe which is the blackthorn comes still earlier and has fewer leaves that is the tree of the old english song from the whiteblossomed sloe my dear chloe requested a sprig her fair breast to adorn no by heavns i exclaimed may i perish if ever i plant in that bosom a thorn and it is not only trees but hedges and bushes and groves of hawthorn for a white thorn bush is seldom if ever cut down here lest a grieved and displeased fairy look up from the cloven trunk and no irishman could bear to meet the reproach of her eyes do not imagine however that we are all in white like a bride there is the pink hawthorn and there are pink and white horsechestnuts laden with flowers yellow laburnums hanging over whitewashed farmbuildings lilacs and most wonderful of all the blaze of the yellow gorse there will be a thorn hedge struggling with and conquering a grey stone wall then a golden gorse bush struggling with and conquering the thorn seeking the sun it knows no restraints and creeping through the barriers of green and white and grey it fairly hurls its yellow splendours in great blazing patches along the wayside in dazzling glory in richness of colour there is nothing in nature that we can compare with this loveliest and commonest of all wayside weeds the gleaming wealth of the klondike would make a poor showing beside a single irish hedgerow one would think that mother earth had stored in her bosom all the sunniest gleams of bygone summers and was now giving them back to the sun king from whom she borrowed them it was at twilight when we first swam this fragrant golden sea twilight and the birds were singing in every bush the thrushes and blackbirds in the blossoming cherry and chestnuttrees were so many and so tuneful that the chorus was sweet and strong beyond anything i ever heard there had been a shower or two of course showers that looked like shimmering curtains of silver gauze and whether they lifted or fell the birds went on singing i did not believe such a thing possible but it is lovelier than pettybaw said francesca and just here we came in sight of a pink cottage cuddling on the breast of a hill pink the cottage was as if it had been hewed out of a coral branch or the heart of a salmon pinkwashed were the stone walls and posts pink even were the chimneys a green lattice over the front was the only leaf in the bouquet wallflowers grew against the pink stone walls and there is no beautiful word in any beautiful language that can describe the effect of that modest rosehued dwelling blushing against a background of heatherbrown hills covered solidly with golden gorse bushes in full bloom himself and i have always agreed to spend our anniversaries with mrs bobby at comfort cottage in england or at bideawee the wee theekit hoosie in the loaning at pettybaw for our little lovestory was begun in the one and carried on in the other but this this i thought instantly must somehow be crowded into the scheme of redletter days and now we suddenly discovered something at once interesting and disconcerting an american flag floating from a tree in the background the place is rented then said francesca to some enterprising american or some starspangled irishman who has succeeded in discovering devorgilla before us i well understand how the shade of columbus must feel whenever amerigo vespuccis name is mentioned we sent the driver off to await our pleasure and held a consultation by the wayside i shall call at any rate i announced any excuse will serve which brings me nearer to that adorable dwelling i intend to be standing in that pink doorway with that green lattice over my head when himself arrives in devorgilla i intend to end my days within those rosy walls and to begin the process at the earliest possible moment salemina disapproved of course her method is always to stand well in the rear trembling beforehand lest i should do something unconventional then later on when things romantic begin to transpire she says delightedly wasnt that clever of us an american flag i urged is a proclamation indeed it is in a sense an invitation besides it is my duty to salute it in a foreign land patriotism how many sins are practised in thy name said salemina satirically cant you salute your flag from the highroad not properly sally dear nor satisfactorily so you and francesca sit down timidly and respectably under the safe shadow of the hedge while i call upon the blooming family in the darling blooming house i am an american artist lured to their door alike by devotion to my countrys flag and love of the picturesque and so saying i ascended the path with some dignity and a false show of assurance the circumstances did not chance to be precisely what i had expected there was a nice girl tidying the kitchen and i found no difficulty in making friends with her her mother owned the cottage and rented it every season to a belfast lady who was coming in a week to take possession as usual the american flag had been floating in honour of her mothers brother who had come over from milwaukee to make them a little visit and had just left that afternoon to sail from liverpool the rest of the family lived during the three summer months in a smaller house down the road but she herself always stayed at the cottage to mind the belfast ladys children when i looked at the pink floor of the kitchen and the view from the windows i would have given anything in the world to outbid yes even to obliterate the belfast lady but this unfortunately was not only illegal and immoral but it was impossible so calling the mother in from the stables i succeeded after fifteen minutes persuasion in getting permission to occupy the house for one week beginning with the next morning and returned in triumph to my weary constituents who thought it an insane idea of course it is i responded cheerfully that is why it is going to be so altogether charming dont be envious i will find something mad for you to do too one of us is always submitting to the will of the majority now let us be as individually silly as we like for a week and then take a long farewell of freakishness and freedom let the third volume die in lurid splendour since there is never to be a fourth there is still wales suggested francesca too small fanny dear and we could never pronounce the names besides what sort of adventures would be possible to three i mean of course two persons tied down by marital responsibilities and family cares is it the sunset or the reflection of the pink house that is shining on your pink face salemina i am extremely warm she replied haughtily i dont wonder sitting on the damp grass under a hedge is so stimulating to the circulation observed young miss fan chapter xxvii the three chatelaines of devorgilla have you been at devorgilla have you seen at devorgilla beautys train trip oer the plain the lovely maids of devorgilla adapted from edward lysaght the next morning the old hall dropped like a ripe rowan berry into our very laps the landlord of the shamrock inn directed us thither and within the hour it belonged to us for the rest of the summer miss peabody inclined to be severe with me for my desertion took up her residence at once it had never been rented before but miss llewellynjoyce the owner had suddenly determined to visit her sister in london and was glad to find appreciative and careful tenants she was taking her own maid with her and thus only one servant remained to be rented with the premises as is frequently the irish fashion the old hall has not always been managed thus economically it is easy to see and miss llewellynjoyce speaks with the utmost candour of her poverty as indeed the ruined irish gentry always do i well remember taking tea with a family in west clare where in default of a spoon the old squire stirred his cup with the poker a proceeding apparently so usual that he never thought of apologising for it as an oddity the hall has a lodge which is a sort of miniature round tower at the entrance gate and we see nothing for it but to import a brassbuttoned boy from the nearest metropolis where we must also send for a second maid thatll do when you get him objected benella though boys need a lot of overseeing but as nobody can get in or come out o that gate without help i shall have to go to the lodge every day now and set down there with my sewin from four to six in the afternoon or whenever the callin hours is when i engaged with you it wasnt for any particular kind of work it was to make myself useful ive been errandboy and courier golfcaddie and footman beau cook land agent and mother to you all and i guess i can be a lodgekeeper as well as not francesca had her choice of residing either with salemina or with me during our week of separation and drove in my company to rosaleen cottage to make up her mind while she was standing at my gate engaged in reflection she espied a small cabin not far away and walked toward it on a tour of investigation it proved to have three tiny rooms a bedroom sittingroom and kitchen the rent was only two pounds a month it is true but it was in all respects the most unattractive povertystricken undesirable dwelling i ever saw it was the small stove in the kitchen that kindled francescas imagination and she made up her mind instantly to become a householder on her own account i tried to dissuade her but she is as firm as the rock of cashel when once she has set her heart upon anything i shall be almost your nextdoor neighbour penelope she coaxed and of course you will give me benella she will sleep in the sittingroom and i will do the cooking the landlady says there is no trouble about food what to ate she inquired leaning out sociably over the halfdoor sure itll drive up to your very doore just and here is the wee grass as she calls it where yous can take your tay under the japanese umbrella left by the last tenant think how unusual it will be for us to live in three different houses for a week and theres luck in odd numbers says rory omore we shall have the advantages of good society too when we are living apart for i foresee entertainment after entertainment we will give breakfasts luncheons teas and dinners to one another and meanwhile i shall have learned all the housewifely arts think too how much better you can paint with me out of your way does no thought of your eccentricity blight your young spirit dear why should it when i have simply shaped my course by yours but i am married my child and im going to be married aha mamma as the song says and what about salemina you havent scolded her she is living her very last days of single blessedness i rejoined she does not know it but she is and i want to give her all the freedom possible very well dear innocent live in your wee hut then if you can persuade benella to stay with you but i think there would best be no public visiting between you and those who live in rosaleen cottage and the old hall as it might ruin their social position benella confessed that she had not the heart to refuse francesca anything shes too handsome she said and too winnin i spose shell cook up some dreadful messes but im willin to eat em to oblige her and perhaps itll save her husband a few spells of dyspepsy at the start though as far as my experience goes ministersll always eat anything thats set before em and look over their shoulders for more we had a heavenly week of silliness and by dint of concealing our real relations from the general public i fancy we escaped harsh criticism there is a very large percentage of lunacy anyway in ireland as well as great leniency of public opinion and i fancy there is scarcely a country on the map in which one could be more foolish without being found out visit each other we did constantly and candour obliges me to state that though each of us secretly prided herself on the perfection of her cuisine miss monroe gave the most successful afternoon tea of all on the wee grass under the japanese umbrella how unexpectedly good were her scones her teacakes and her cress sandwiches and how pretty and graceful and womanly she was all flushed with pride at our envy and approbation i did a watercolour sketch of her and sent it to ronald receiving in return a letter bubbling over with fond admiration and gratitude she seems always in tone with the season and the landscape does francesca and she arrives at it unconsciously too she glances out of her window at the yellow laburnumtree when she is putting on her white frock and it suggests to her all her amber trinkets and her drooping hat with the wreath of buttercups when she came to my hawthorn luncheon at rosaleen cottage she did not make the mistake of heaping pink on pink but wore a cotton gown of palest green with a bunch of rosy blossoms at her belt i painted her just as she stood under the hawthorn with its fluttering petals and singing birds calling the picture grainne mael a vision of erinn writing under it the verse the thrushes seen in bushes green are singing loudbid sadness go and gladness glow give welcome proud the rover comes the lover whom you long bewail oer sunny seas with honey breeze to grainne mael pronounced graunia wael the m being modified it is one of the endearing names given to ireland in the penal times benella i fancy never had so varied a week in her life and she was in her element we were obliged to hire a sidecar by the day as two of our residences were over a mile apart and the driver of that vehicle was the only person i think who had any suspicion of our sanity in the intervals of teaching francesca cooking and eating the results while the cook herself prudently lunched or dined with her friends benella springcleaned the lodge at the old hall scrubbed the gateposts mended stone walls weeded garden beds made bags for the brooms and dusters and mattresses burned coffee and camphor and other illsmelling things in all the rooms and devoted considerable time to superintending my little maid that i might not feel neglected we were naturally obliged meanwhile to wait upon ourselves and keep our frocks in order but as long as the derelict was so busy and happy and so devoted to the universal good it would have been churlish and ungrateful to complain on leaving the wee hut as francesca had with ostentatious modesty named her residence she paid her landlady two pounds and was discomfited when the exuberant and impetuous woman embraced her in a paroxysm of weeping gratitude i cannot understand penelope why she was so disproportionately grateful for i only gave her five shillings over the two pounds rent yes dear i responded drily but you remember that the rent was for the month and you paid her two pounds five shillings for the week all the rest of that day francesca was angelic she brought footstools for salemina wound wool for her insisted upon washing my paint brushes read aloud to us while we were working and offered to be the one to discharge benella if the awful moment for that surgical operation should ever come finally just as we were about to separate for the night she said with insinuating sweetness you wont tell ronald about my mistake with the rentmoney will you dearest and darlingest girls we are now quite ready to join in all the gaieties that may ensue when rosnaree welcomes its master and his guests our page in buttons at the lodge gives benella full scope for her administrative ability which seems to have sprung into being since she entered our service at least if i except that evidence of it which she displayed in managing us when first we met she calls our page the button boy and makes his life a burden to him by taking him away from his easy duties at the gate covering his livery with baggy overalls and setting him to weed the garden it can never in the nature of things be made free from weeds during our brief term of tenancy but benella cleverly keeps her slave at work on the beds and the walks that are the most conspicuous to visitors the old hall used simply to be called aunt davids house by the welsh joyces and it was aunt david herself who made the garden she who traced the lines of the flowerbeds with the ivory tip of her parasol she who planned the quaint stone gateways and arbours and hedge seats she who devised the interminable stretches of paths the labyrinthine walks the mazes and the hidden flowerplots you walk on and on between high hedges until if you have not missed your way you presently find a little pansy or rose or lily garden it is quite the most unexpected and piquant method of laying out a place i have ever seen and the only difficulty about it is that any gardener unless he were possessed of unusual sense of direction would be continually astray in it the button boy obeying the laws of human nature is lost in two minutes but requires two hours in which to find himself benella suspects that he prefers this wandering to and fro to the more monotonous task of weeding and it is no uncommon thing for her to pursue the recalcitrant page through the mazes and labyrinths for an hour at a time and perhaps lose herself in the end salemina and i were sitting this morning in the peacock walk where two trees clipped into the shape of longtailed birds mount guard over the box hedge and put their beaks together to form an arch in the dim distance we could see benella bagging the button boy and after putting the trowel and rake in his reluctant hands tying the free end of a ball of string to his leg and sending him to find and weed the pansy garden we laughed until the echoes rang to see him depart dragging his lengthening chain or his ariadne thread behind him while benella grimly held the ball determined that no excuses or apologies should interfere with his work on this occasion chapter xxviii round towers and reflections on lough neaghs banks as the fisherman strays when the cool calm eves declining he sees the round towers of other days beneath the waters shining thomas moore a dublin cardriver told me one day that he had just taken a picnicparty to the borders of a lake where they had had tea in a tramcar which had been placed there for such purposes francesca and i were amused at the idea but did not think of it again until we drove through the la touche estate on one of the first days after our arrival at devorgilla we left salemina at rosnaree house with aunt la touche and the children and proceeded to explore the grounds with the view of deciding on certain improvements to be made when the property passes so to speak into our hands truth to say nature has done more for it than we could have done and if it is a trifle overgrown and rough and rank it could hardly be more beautiful at the very furthest confines of the demesne there is a brook large enough indeed to be called a river here where they have no mississippi to dwarf all other streams and serve as an impossible standard of comparison tall trees droop over the calm water and on its margins grow spearwort opening its big yellow cups to the sunshine meadow rue purple and yellow loosestrife bog bean and sweet flag here and there float upon the surface the round leaves and delicate white blossoms of the frogbit together with lilies pondweeds and water starworts what an idyllic place to sit and read or sew or have tea exclaimed francesca what a place for a tram teahouse i added do you suppose we could manage it as a surprise to dr la touche in return for all his kindness it would cost a pretty penny i fear said francesca prudently though it isnt as if it were going out of the family now that there is no longer any need for you to sell pictures i suppose you could dash off one in an hour or two that would buy a tram and papa cabled me yesterday you know to draw on him freely i used to think whenever he said that that he would marry again within the week but i did him injustice a tram teahouse by the river wouldnt it be unique do let us see what we can do about it through some of our dublin acquaintances the plan proved unexpectedly easy to carry out and not ruinously extravagant either for our friend the american consul knew the principal director in a tram company and a dilapidated and discarded car was sent to us in a few days there were certain moments once when we saw that it had not been painted for twenty years once when the freight bill was handed us and again when we contracted for the removal of our gift from the station to the riverbank when we regretted the fertility of imagination that had led us to these lengths but when we finally saw the car by the waterside there was no room left for regret benella said that with the assistance of the button boy she could paint it easily herself but we engaged an expert who put on a coat of dark green very speedily and we consoled the derelict with the suggestion that she could cover the cushions and make the interior cosy and pretty all this happened some little time ago dr la touche has been at home for a fortnight and we have had to use the greatest ingenuity to keep people away from that particular spot which fortunately for us is a secluded one all is ready now however and the following cards of invitation have been issued the honour of your presence is requested at the opening of the new tea tram on the river bank rosnaree demesne wednesday june th at pm the ceremony will be performed by hrh salemina peabody the bishop of ossory in the chair i have just learned that a certain william beresford was bishop of ossory once on a time and i intend to personate this dignitary clad in dr la touches cap and gown we spend this sunny morning by the riverbank francesca hemming the last of the yellow window curtains and i making souvenir programmes for the great occasion salemina had gone for the day with the colquhouns and dr la touche to lunch with some people near kavan and see donaghmore round tower and the moat is she in love with dr gerald asked francesca suddenly looking up from her work was she ever in love with him she must have been mustnt she i cannot and will not entertain any other conviction i dont know my dear i answered thoughtfully pausing over an initial letter i was illuminating but i cant imagine what we shall do if we have to tear down our sweet little romance bit by bit and leave the stupid couple sitting in the ruins they enjoy ruins far too well already and it would be just like their obstinacy to go on sitting in them and they are so incredibly slow about it all francesca commented it took me about two minutes at lady bairds dinner where i first met ronald to decide that i would marry him as soon as possible when a month had gone by and he hadnt asked me i thought like rosalind that id as lief be wooed of a snail i was not quite so expeditious as you i confessed though i believe himself says that his feeling was instantaneous i never cared for anything but painting before i met him so i never chanced to suffer any of those pangs that lovelorn maidens are said to feel when the beloved delays his avowals perhaps that is the reason i suffer so much now vicariously the lack of positive information makes one so impatient francesca went on i am sure he is as fond of her as ever but if she refused him when he was young and handsome with every prospect of a brilliant career before him perhaps he thinks he has even less chance now he was the first to forget their romance and the one to marry his estates have been wasted by his fathers legal warfares and he has been an unhappy and a disappointed man now he has to beg her to heal his wounds as it were and to accept the care and responsibility of his children it is very easy to see that we are not the only ones who suspect his sentiments i said smiling at my thoughts mrs colquhoun told me that she and salemina stopped at one of the tenants cabins the other day to leave some small comforts that dr la touche had sent to a sick child the woman thanked salemina and mrs colquhoun heard her say when a man will stop coming in the doore an stoop down to give a sthroke and a scratch to the pigs back depend on it maam him thats so friendly with a poor fellowcrathur will make ye a good husband i have given him every opportunity to confide in me i continued after a pause but he accepts none of them and yet i like him a thousand times better now that i have seen him as the master of his own house he is so courtly and in these latter days so genial and sunny saleminas life would not at first be any too easy i fear the aunt is very feeble and the establishment is so neglected i went into dr geralds study the other day to see an old print and there was a buzzbuzzzzzz when the butler pulled up the blinds do you mind bees maam he asked blandly theres been a swarm of them in one corner of the ceiling for manny years an we dont like to disturb them benella said yesterday of course when you three separate i shall stay with the one that needs me most but if miss peabody should settle over here anywhere id like to take a scrubbing brush an go through the castle or whatever shes going to live in with soap and sand and ammonia and make it watersweet before she sets foot in it as for the children however no one could regard them as a drawback for they are altogether charming not well disciplined of course but lovable to the last degree broona was planning her future life when we were walking together yesterday jackeen is to be an engineer by the sea so it seems and broona is to be a farmers wife with a tiny red billbook like mrs colquhouns her little boys and girls will sell the milk and when jackeen has his engineering holidays he will come and eat fresh butter and scones and cream and jam at the farm and when her children have their holidays they will go and play on jackeens beach it is the little people i rely upon chiefly after all i wish you could have seen them cataract down the staircase to greet her this morning i notice that she tries to make me divert their attention when dr gerald is present for it is a bit suggestive to a widower to see his children pursue hang about and caress a lovely unmarried lady broona especially can hardly keep away from salemina and she is such a fascinating midget i should think anybody would be glad to have her included in a marriage contract you have a weeny weeny line between your eyebrows just like my daddys she said to salemina the other day its such a little one perhaps i can kiss it away but daddy has too many and they are cutted too deep sometimes he whispers daddy is sad broona and then i say play up play up and play the game and that makes him smile she is a darling said francesca with the suspicion of a tear in her eye were you ever in love miss fancy she asked me once i was it was long long ago before i belonged to daddy and another time when i had been reading to her she said i often think that when i get into the kingdom of heaven the person ill be gladdest to see will be marjorie fleming yes the children are sure to help they always do in whatever circumstances they chance to be placed did you notice salemina with them at teatime yesterday it was such a charming scene the heavy rain had kept them in and things had gone wrong in the nursery salemina had glued the hair on broonas dolly and knit up a heartbreaking wound in her side then she mended the legs of all the animals in the noahs ark so that they stood firm erect and proud and when to draw the childrens eyes from the wet windowpanes she proposed a story it was pretty to see the grateful youngsters snuggle in her lap and by her side when does an artist ever fail to see pictures i have loved salemina always even when she used to part her hair in the middle and wear spectacles but that is the first time i ever wanted to paint her with the firelight shining on the soft restful greys and violets of her dress and broona in her arms of course if a woman is ever to be lovely at all it will be when she is holding a child it is the oldest of all old pictures and the most beautiful i believe in a mans eyes and do you notice that she and the doctor are beginning to speak more freely of their past acquaintance i went on looking up at francesca who had dropped her work in her interest it is too amusing every hour or two it is do you remember the day we went to bunker hill or do you recall that charming mrs andrews with whom we used to dine occasionally or what has become of your cousin samuel and is your uncle thomas yet living the other day at tea she asked do you still take three lumps dr la touche you had always a sweet tooth i remember then they ring the changes in this way you were always fond of grey miss peabody you had a great fancy for moore in the old days miss peabody have you outgrown him or does the anacreontic little chap as father prout called him still appeal to you you used to admire boyle oreilly dr la touche would you like to see some of his letters arent these magnificent rhododendrons dr la touche even though they are magenta the colour you specially dislike and so on did you chance to look at either of them last evening francesca when i sang let erin remember the days of old no i was thinking of something else i dont know what there is about your singing penny love that always makes me think of the past and dream of the future which verse do you mean and still painting i hummed on lough neaghs banks as the fisherman strays when the cool calm eves declining he sees the round towers of other days beneath the waters shining thus shall memory oft in dreams sublime catch a glimpse of the days that are over and sighing look thro the waves of time for the longfaded glories they cover that is what our two dear middleaged lovers are constantly doing now looking at the round towers of other days as they bend over memorys crystal pool and see them reflected there it is because he fears that the glories are over and gone that dr gerald is troubled some day he will realise that he need not live on reflections and he will seek realities i hope so said francesca philosophically as she folded her work but sometimes these people who go mooning about and looking through the waves of time tumble in and are drowned chapter xxix aunt davids garden o wind o mighty melancholy wind blow through me blow thou blowest forgotten things into my mind from long ago john todhunter no one ever had a better opportunity than we of breathing in so far as a stranger and a foreigner may the old celtic atmosphere and of reliving the misty years of legend before the dawn of history when long long ago beyond the space of twice two hundred years in erin old there lived a race taller than roman spears mr colquhoun is one of the best gaelic scholars in ireland and dr gerald though not his equal in knowledge of the language has the full of a sack of stories in his head according to the book of leinster a professional storyteller was required to know seven times fifty tales and i believe the doctor could easily pass this test it is not easy to make a good translation from irish to english for they tell us there are no two aryan languages more opposed to each other in spirit and idiom we have heard little of the marvellous old tongue until now but we are reading it a bit under the tutelage of these two inspiring masters and i fancy it has helped me as much in my understanding of ireland as my tedious and perplexing worriments over political problems after all how can we know anything of a nations present or future without some attempt to revivify its past just as without some slender knowledge of its former culture we must be for ever ignorant of its inherited powers and aptitudes the harp that once through taras halls the soul of music shed now indeed hangs mute on taras walls but for all that its echoes still reverberate in the listening ear when we sit together by the river brink on sunny days or on the greensward under the yews in our old garden we are always telling ancient celtic romances and planning even acting new ones francescas mind and mine are poorly furnished with facts of any sort but when the kind scholars in our immediate neighbourhood furnish necessary information and inspiration we promptly turn it into dramatic form and serve it up before their wondering and admiring gaze it is ever our habit to make believe with the children and just as we played ballads in scotland and plotted revels in the glen at rowardennan so we instinctively fall into the habit of thought and speech that surrounds us here this delights our grave and reverend signiors and they give themselves up to our whimsicalities with the most wholehearted zeal it is days since we have spoken of one another by those names which were given to us in baptism francesca is finola the festive eveleen colquhoun is ethnea i am the harper pearla the melodious miss peabody is sheela the skilful scribe who keeps for posterity a record of all our antics in the speckled book of salemina dr gerald is borba the proud the ardri or overking mr colquhoun is really called dermod but he would have been far too modest to choose dermot odyna for his celtic name had we not insisted for this historic personage was not only nobleminded generous of untarnished honour and the bravest of the brave but he was as handsome as he was gallant and so much the idol of the ladies that he was sometimes called dermatnaman or dermot of the women of course we have a corps of shanachies or storytellers gleemen gossipreds leeches druids gallowglasses bards ollaves urraghts and brehons but the children can always be shifted from one role to another and benella and the button boy although they are quite unaware of the honours conferred upon them are often alluded to in our romances and theatrical productions aunt davids garden is not a half bad substitute for the old moymell the plain

westminster abbey carried away from scotland by edward i is thought by many scholars to be unauthentic and we hope that ours may prove to have some historical value the only test of a stone of destiny as i understand it is that it shall roar when an irish monarch is inaugurated and that our lia fail was silent when we celebrated this impressive ceremony reflects less upon its own powers perhaps than upon the pedigree of our chosen ardri the arbour under the mountain ash is the fairy palace of the quicken tree and on its walls is suspended the horn of foreknowledge which if any one looks on it in the morning fasting he will know in a moment all things that are to happen during that day the clump of willows is the wood of the many sallows a willowtree is familiarly known as a sally in

land and sea an may the divil fly away wid me if that sames not true we no longer find any difficulty in remembering all this nomenclature for we are under gesa to use no other when you are put under gesa to reveal or to conceal to defend or to avenge it is a sort of charm or spell also an obligation of honour finola is under gesa not to write to alba more than six times a week and twice on sundays sheela is bound by the same charm to give us muffins for afternoon tea i am vowed to forget my husband when i am relating romances and allude to myself for dramatic purposes as a maiden princess or a maiden of enchanting and allconquering beauty and if we fail to abide by all these laws of the modern dedannans of devorgilla which are written in the speckled book of salemina we are to pay ericfine these fines are collected with all possible solemnity and the children delight in them to such an extent that occasionally they break the law for the joy of the penalty if you have ever read the fate of the children of turenn you remember that they were to pay to luga the following ericfine for the slaying of their father kian two steeds and a chariot seven pigs a hound whelp a cookingspit and three shouts on a hill this does not at first seem excessive if kian were a good father and sincerely mourned but when luga began to explain the hidden snares that lay in the pathway it is small wonder that the sons of turenn felt doubt of ever being able to pay it and that when after surmounting all the previous obstacles they at last raised three feeble shouts on midkenas hill they immediately gave up the ghost the story told yesterday by sheela the scribe was the magic threadclue or the pursuit of the gilla dacker benella and the button boy being the chief characters finolas was the voyage of the children of corr the swiftfooted the ardris pseudonym for american travellers while mine to be told tomorrow is called the quest of the fair strangers or the fairy quicken tree of devorgilla chapter xxx the quest of the fair strangers or the fairy quickentree of devorgilla before the king the bards will sing and there recall the stories all that give renown to ireland eighteenth century song englished by george sigerson it seems probable that this tale records a real incident which took place in aunt davids garden penelope has apparently listened with such attention to the old celtic romances as told by the ardri and dermot odyna that she has consciously or unconsciously reproduced something of their atmosphere and phraseology the delightful surprise at the end must have been contrived by salemina when she in her character of sheela the scribe gazed into the horn of foreknowledge and learned the events that were to happen that day kdw pearlas story three maidens once dwelt in a castle in that part of the isle of weeping known as the cantred of devorgilla devorgilla of the green hill slopes and they were baptized according to druidical rites as sheela the scribe finola the festive and pearla the melodious though by the dwellers in that land they were called the fair strangers or the children of corr the swiftfooted this cantred of devorgilla they acquired by paying rent and tribute to the wise woman of wales who granted them to fish in its crystal streams and to hunt over the greensided hills to roam through the woods of yewtrees and to pluck the flowers of every hue that were laughing all over the plains thus were they circumstanced their palace of abode was never without three shouts in it the shout of the maidens brewing tea the shout of the guests drinking it and the shout of the assembled multitude playing at their games the same house was never without three measures a measure of magic malt for raising the spirits a measure of attic salt for the seasoning of tales and a measure of poppy leaves to induce sleep when the tales were dull and the manner of their lives was this in the cool of the morning they gathered nuts and arbutus apples and scarlet quicken berries to take back with them to tirthartoinn the country beyond the wave for this was the land of their birth when the sun was high in the east they went forth to the chase sometimes it was to hunt the ardri and at others it was in pursuit of dermot of the bright face then after resting awhile on their couches of soft rushes they would perform champion feats or play on their harps or fish in their clearflowing streams that were swimming with salmon the manner of their fishing was this to cut a long straight sallowtree rod and having fastened a hook and one of finolas hairs upon it to put a quickentree berry upon the hook and stand on the brink of the swiftflowing river whence they drew out the shiningskinned silversided salmon these they would straightway broil over a little fire of birch boughs and they needed with them no other food but the magical loaf made by toma one of their houseservants the witch hag that dwelt on that hillside of rosnaree called fannacarpat or the slope of the chariots had cast a druidical spell over toma by which she was able to knead a loaf that would last twenty days and twenty nights and one mouthful of which would satisfy hunger for that length of time fact not far from the mayden castle was a certain royal palace with a glittering roof and the name of the palace was rosnaree and upon the level green in front of the regal abode or in the banquetinghalls might always be seen noble companies of knights and ladies bright some feasting some playing at the chess some giving ear to the music of their own harps some continually shaking the chain of silence and some listening to the poems and tales of heroes of the olden time that were told by the kings bards and shanachies now all went happily with the fair strangers until the crimson berries were ripening on the quickentree near the fairy palace for the berries possessed secret virtues known only to a man of the dedannans and learned from him by sheela the scribe who put him under gesa not to reveal the charm to any one else whosoever ate of the honeysweet scarletglowing fruit felt a cheerful flow of spirits as if he had tasted wine or mead and whosoever ate a sufficient number of them was almost certain to grow younger these things were written in the speckled book of salemina but in druidical ink undecipherable to all eyes but those of the scribe herself so wishing that none should possess the secret but themselves the fair strangers set the gilla dacker to watch the fruit putting him first under gesa to eat none of the berries himself since he was already too cheerful and too young to be of much service and thus in their absence the magical tree was never left alone could be freely translated as the slothful button boy nevertheless when finola the festive went forth to the chase one day she found a quicken berry glowing like a ruby in the highroad and sheela plucked a second from under a gnarled thorn on the slope of the chariots and pearla discovered a third in the curiouslycompounded swiftlysatisfying loaf of toma then the fair strangers became very angry and sent out their trusty fleetfooted couriers to scour the land for the invaders for they knew that none of the dedannans would take the berries being under gesa not to do so but the couriers returned and though they were men able to trace the trail of a fox through nine glens and nine rivers they could discover no proof of the presence of a foreign foe in the mayden cantred of devorgilla then the hearts of the fair strangers were filled with grief and gall for they distrusted the couriers and having consulted the ardri they set forth themselves to find and conquer the invader for the king told them that there was one other quickentree more beautiful and more magical than that growing by the fairy palace and that it was set in another part of the brightblooming sweetscented old garden namely in the heart of the labyrinthine maze of the wise woman of wales but as no one of them neither the gilla dacker nor those who pursued him had ever even with the aid of the magic threadclue reached the heart of the maze there was no knowledge among them of the second quickentree the king also told sheela the scribe secretly that one of his knights had found a moneypiece and a breviary in the forest of rosnaree and the silver was unlike any ever used in the country of the dedannans and the breviary could belong only to a pious gael known as loskenn of the bare knees now sheela the scribe having fasted from midnight until dawn gazed upon the horn of foreknowledge and read there that it was wiser for her to remain on guard at the fairy palace while her sisters explored the secret fastnesses of the labyrinth when finola was apparelled to set forth upon her quest pearla thought her the loveliest maiden upon the ridge of the world and wondered whether she meant to conquer the invader by force of arms or by the power of beauty the rose and the lily were fighting together in her face and one could not tell which of them got the victory her arms and hands were like the lime her mouth was as red as a ripe strawberry her foot as small and as light as another ones hand her form smooth and slender and her hair falling down from her head under combs of gold one could not look at her without being all over in love with her as oisin said at his first meeting with niam of the golden hair and as for pearla the rose on her cheeks was heightened by her rage against the invader the delicate blossom of the sloe was not whiter than her neck and her glossy chestnut ringlets fell to her waist description of the princess in guleesh na guss dhu then the gilla dacker unleashed bran the keenscented terrier hound and put a pearlembroidered pillion on enbarr of the flowing mane and the two dauntless maidens leaped upon her back each bearing a broad shield and a long polished deathdealing spear when enbarr had been given a free rein she set out for the labyrinth trailing the magic threadclue behind her cleaving the air with long active strides and if you know what the speed of a swallow is flying across a mountainside or the dry wind of a march day sweeping over the plains then you can understand nothing of the swiftness of this steed of the flowing mane acquired by the day by the maydens of devorgilla many were the dangers that beset the path of these two noble champions on their quest for the fairy quicken tree here they met an enormous white stoat but this was slain by the intrepid bran and they buried its bleeding corse and raised a cairn over it with the name stoat graven on it in ogam there a druidical fairy mist sprang up in their path to hide the way but they pierced it with a note of their farreaching clariontoned voices an art learned in their native land beyond the wave now the dog bran being unhungered and refusing to eat of tomas loaf as all did who were ignorant of its druidical purpose fell upon the magic threadclue and tore it in twain this so greatly affrighted the champions that they sounded the dordfian slowly and plaintively hoping that the warcry might bring sheela to their rescue this availing nothing finola was forced to slay bran with her straightsided silvershining spear but this she felt he would not mind if he could know that he would share the splendid fate of the stoat and speedily have a cairn raised over him with the word bran graven upon it in ogam since this is the consolation offered by the victorious living to all dead celtic heroes and if it be a poor substitute for life it is at least better than nothing it was now many hours after noon and though to the fair strangers it seemed they had travelled more than forty or a hundred miles they were apparently no nearer than ever to the heart of the labyrinth and this from the first had been the pestiferous peculiarity of that malignantly meandering maze so they dismounted and tied enbarr to the branch of a tree while they refreshed themselves with a mouthful of tomas loaf and finola now put her thumb under her tooth of knowledge for she wished new guidance and inspiration and being more than common modest she said inasmuch as we are fairer than all the other maydens in this labyrinth why since we cannot find the heart of the maze do we not entice the invaders from their hidingplace by the quickentree and when we see from what direction they advance fall upon and slay them and after raising the usual cairn to their memory and carving their names over it in the customary ogam run to the enchanted tree and gather all the berries that are left for this is the hour when sheela brews the tea and the knights and the ladies quaff it from our golden cups and truly i am weary of this quest and far rather would i be there than here so pearla the melodious took her timpan and chanted a gaelic song that she had learned in the country of the dedannans and presently a roundpolished redgleaming quicken berry dropped into her lap and another into finolas and looking up they saw nought save only a cloud of quicken berries falling through the air one after the other and this caused them to wonder for it seemed like unto a snare set for them but pearla said there is nought remaining for us but to meet the danger it is well replied finola shaking down the mantle of her ebon locks and setting the golden combs more firmly in them only if i perish i prithee let there be no cairns or ogams let me fall as a beauty should face upward and if it be but a swoon and the invader be a handsome prince see that he wakens me in his own good way to arms then cried pearla and taking up their spears and shields the fair strangers dashed blindly in the direction whence the berries fell to arms indeed but to yours or ours called two voices from the heart of the labyrinth and there in an instant the two brave champions finola and pearla found the fairy tree hanging thick with scarlet berries and under its branches fit fruit indeed to raise the spirits or bring eternal youth were in the language of the dedannans loskenn of the bare knees and the bishop of ossory known to the children of corr the swiftfooted as ronald macdonald and himself and the hours ran on and sheela the scribe brewed and brewed and brewed and brewed the tea at her table in the peacock walk and the knights and ladies quaffed it from the golden cups belonging to the wise woman of wales but finola the festive and pearla the melodious lingered in the labyrinth with loskenn of the bare knees and the bishop of ossory and they said to one another surely if it were so great a task to find the heart of this maze we should be mad to stir from the spot lest we lose it again and pearla murmured that plan were wise indeed save that the place seemeth all too small for so many then finola drew herself up proudly and replied it is no smaller for one than for another but come loskenn let us see if haply we can lose ourselves in some path of our own finding and this they did and the content of them that departed was no greater than the content of them that were left behind and the sun hid himself for very shame because the brightness of their joy was so much more dazzling than the glory of his own face and nothing more is told of what befell them till they reached the threshold of the old hall and it was not the sun but the moon that shone upon their meeting with sheela the scribe chapter xxxi goodbye dark rosaleen when the poor exiles every pleasure past hung round the bowers and fondly looked their last and took a long farewell and wished in vain for seats like these beyond the western main and shuddering still to face the distant deep returned and wept and still returned to weep oliver goldsmith it is almost over our irish holiday so full of delicious fruitful experiences of pleasures we have made and shared and of other peoples miseries and hardships we could not relieve almost over soon we shall be in dublin and then on to london to meet francescas father soon be deciding whether she will be married at the house of their friend the american ambassador or in her own country where she has really had no home since the death of her mother the ceremony over mr monroe will start again for cairo or constantinople stockholm or st petersburg for he is of late years a determined wanderer whose fatherly affection is chiefly shown in liberal allowances in pride of his daughters beauty and many conquests in conscientious letterwriting and in frequent calls upon her between his long journeys it is because of these paternal predilections that we are so glad francescas heart has resisted all the shot and shell directed against it from the batteries of a dozen gay worldlings and yielded so quietly and so completely to ronald macdonalds loyal and tender affection at teatime day before yesterday salemina suggested that francesca and i find the heart of aunt davids labyrinth the which she had discovered in a less than ten minutes search that morning leaving her gaelic primer behind her that we might bring it back as a proof of our success you have heard in pearlas celtic fairy tale the outcome of this little expedition and now know that ronald macdonald and himself planned the joyful surprise for us and by means of saleminas aid carried it out triumphantly ronald crossing to ireland from glasgow and himself from liverpool had met in dublin and travelled posthaste to the shamrock inn in devorgilla where they communicated with salemina and begged her assistance in their plot i was looking forward to my husbands arrival within a week but ronald had said not a word of his intended visit so that salemina was properly nervous lest some one of us should collapse out of sheer joy at the unexpected meeting i have been both quietly and wildly happy many times in my life but i think yesterday was the most perfect day in all my chain of years not that in this long separation i have been dull or sad or lonely how could i be dull with two dear bright sunny letters every week letters throbbing with manly tenderness letters breathing the sure steadfast protecting care that a strong man gives to the woman he has chosen sad with my heart brimming over with sweet memories and sweeter prophecies and all its tiny crevices so filled with love that discontent can find no entrance there lonely when the vision of the beloved is so poignantly real in absence that his bodily presence adds only a final touch to joy dull or sad when in these soft days of spring and early summer i have harboured a new feeling of companionship and oneness with nature a fresh joy in all her bounteous resource and plenitude of life a renewed sense of kinship with her mysterious awakenings the heavenly greenness and promise of the outer world seem but a reflection of the hopes and dreams that irradiate my own inner consciousness my art dearly as i loved it dearly as i love it still never gave me these strange unspeakable joys with their delicate margin of pain where are my ambitions my visions of lonely triumphs my imperative need of selfexpression my ennobling glimpses of the unattainable my companionship with the shadows in which an artists life is so rich are they vanished altogether i think not only changed in the twinkling of an eye merged in something higher still carried over linked on transformed transmuted by love the alchemist who not content with joys already bestowed whispers secret promises of raptures yet to come the green isle looked its fairest for our wanderers just as a woman adorns herself with all her jewels when she wishes to startle or enthrall wishes to make a lover of a friend so devorgilla arrayed herself to conquer these two pairs of fresh eyes and command their instant allegiance it was a tender silvery day fair mild pensive with light shadows and a capricious sun there had been a storm of rain the night before and it was as if nature had repented of her wildness and sought forgiveness by all sorts of winsome arts insinuating invitations soft caresses and melting coquetries of demeanour broona and jackeen had lunched with us at the old hall and inebriated by broiled chicken green peas and a half holiday flitted like fireflies through aunt davids garden showing all its treasures to the two new friends already in high favour benella it is unnecessary to say had confided her entire past life to himself after a few hours acquaintance while both he and ronald concealing in the most craven manner their original objections to the part she proposed to play in our triangular alliance thanked her with tears in their eyes for her devotion to their sovereign ladies we had tea in the italian garden at rosnaree and dr gerald arm in arm with himself walked between its formal flower borders along its paths of golden gravel and among its spirelike cypresses and fountains where balustrades and statues yellowed and stained with age stains which benella longs to scrub away make the brilliant turf even greener by contrast tea was to have been followed in due course by dinner but we all agreed that nothing should induce us to go indoors on such a beautiful evening so baskets were packed and we went in rowboats to a picnic supper on illanroe a wee island in lough beg i can close my eyes today and see the picture the lonely little lake as blue in the sunshine as the sky above it but in the twilight first brown and cool then flushed with the sunset the distant hills the rocks the heather wore tints i never saw them wear before the singing wavelets spilled their crowns of white upon the beach across the lake and the wildflowers in the clear shallows near us grew so close to the brink that they threw their delicate reflections in the water looking up at us again framed in redbrown grasses by and by the moon rose out of the pearlgreys and ambers in the east bevies of black rooks flew homeward and stillness settled over the face of the brown lake darkness shut us out from devorgilla and though we could still see the glimmer of the village lights it seemed as if we were in a little world of our own it was useless for salemina to deny herself to the children for was she not going to leave them on the morrow she sat under the shadow of a thorn bush and the two mites tired with play cuddled themselves by her side unreproved she looked tenderly delectably feminine the moon shone full upon her face but there are no ugly lines to hide for there are no parched and arid places in her nature dews of sympathy sweet spring floods of love and compassion have kept all fresh serene and young we had been gay but silence fell upon us as it had fallen upon the lake there would be only a day or two in dublin whither dr gerald was going with us that he might have the last word and handclasp before we sailed away from irish shores and so near was the parting that we were all in our hearts bidding farewell to the emerald isle goodbye silk of the kine i was saying to myself calling the friendly spot by one of the endearing names given her by her lovers in the sad old days goodbye little black rose growing on the stern atlantic shore goodbye rose of the world with your jewels of emerald and amethyst the green of your fields and the misty purple of your hills goodbye shan van vocht poor little old woman we are going back himself and i to the oilean ur as you used to call our new island going back to the hurlyburly of affairs to prosperity and opportunity but we shall not forget the lovely lady of sorrows looking out to the west with the pain of a thousand years in her ever youthful eyes goodbye my dark rosaleen goodbye chapter xxxii as the sunflower turns no the heart that has truly loved never forgets but as truly loves on to the close as the sunflower turns on her god when he sets the same look which she turned when he rose thomas moore here we all are at ocarolans hotel in dublin all but the colquhouns who bade us adieu at the station and the dear children whose tears are probably dried by now although they flowed freely enough at parting broona flung her arms tempestuously around saleminas neck exclaiming between her sobs goodbye my thousand thousand blessings an expression so irish that we laughed and cried in one breath at the sound of it here we are in the midst of life once more though to be sure it is irish life which moves less dizzily than our own we ourselves feel thoroughly at home nor are we wholly forgotten by the public for on beckoning to a driver on the cabstand to approach with his sidecar he responded with alacrity calling to his neighbour heres me sixpenny darlin again and i recognised him immediately as a man who had once remonstrated with me eloquently on the subject of a fee making such a fire of hibernian jokes over my sixpence that i heartily wished it had been a halfsovereign cables and telegrams are arriving every hour and a rich american lady writes to salemina asking her if she can purchase the book of kells for her as she wishes to give it to a favourite nephew who is a bibliomaniac i am begging the shocked miss peabody to explain that the volume in question is not for sale and to ask at the same time if her correspondent wishes to purchase the lakes of killarney or the giants causeway in its stead francesca in a whirl of excitement is buying cobweb linens harp brooches creamy poplins with golden shamrocks woven into their lustrous surfaces and as for laces we spend hours in the shops when our respective squires wish us to show them the sights of dublin benella is in her element nursing salemina who sprained her ankle just as we were leaving devorgilla at the last moment our sidecars were so crowded with passengers and packages that she accepted a seat in dr geralds carriage and drove to the station with him she had a few last farewells to say in the village and a few modest remembrances to leave with some of the poor old women and i afterward learned that the drive was not without its embarrassments the butchers wife said fervently may you long be spared to each other the old weaver exclaimed twould be an ojus pity to spoil two houses wid ye while the woman who sells apples at the station capped all by wishing the couple a long life and a happy death together no wonder poor salemina slipped and twisted her ankle as she alighted from the carriage though walking without help is still an impossibility twentyfour hours of rubbing and bathing and bandaging have made it possible for her to limp discreetly and we all went to st patricks cathedral together this morning we had been in the quiet churchyard where a soft misty rain was falling on the yellow acacias and the pink hawthorns we had stood under the willowtree in the deanery garden the tree that marks the site of the house from which dean swift watched the movements of the torches in the cathedral at the midnight burial of stella they are lying side by side at the foot of a column in the south side of the nave and a brass plate in the pavement announces here lies mrs hester johnson better known to the world by the name of stella under which she is celebrated in the writings of dr jonathan swift dean of this cathedral poor stella at rest for a century and a half beside the man who caused her such pangs of love and grief who does not mourn her the nave of the cathedral was dim and empty of all sightseers save our own group there was a caretaker who went about in sloppy rubber shoes scrubbing marbles and polishing brasses and behind a high screen or temporary partition some one was playing softly on an organ we stood in a quiet circle by stellas restingplace and dr gerald who never forgets anything apparently was reminding us of thackerays gracious and pathetic tribute fair and tender creature pure and affectionate heart boots it to you now that the whole world loves you and deplores you scarce any man ever thought of your grave that did not cast a flower of pity on it and write over it a sweet epitaph gentle lady so lovely so loving so unhappy you have had countless champions millions of manly hearts mourning for you from generation to generation we take up the fond tradition of your beauty we watch and follow your story your bright morning love and purity your constancy your grief your sweet martyrdom we know your legend by heart you are one of the saints of english story as dr geralds voice died away the strains of loves young dream floated out from the distant end of the building the organist must be practising for a wedding said francesca very much alive to anything of that sort oh theres nothing half so sweet in life she hummed isnt it charming you ought to know dr gerald answered looking at her affectionately though somewhat too sadly for my taste but an old fellow like me must take refuge in the days of milder calmer beam of which the poet speaks ronald and himself guidebooks in hand walked away to talk about the burial of sir john moore and look for wolfes tablet and i stole behind the great screen which had been thrown up while repairs of some sort were being made or a new organ built a young man was evidently taking a lesson for the old organist was sitting on the bench beside him pulling out the stops and indicating the time with his hand there was to be a wedding that was certain for loves young dream was taken off the music rack at that moment while believe me if all those endearing young charms was put in its place and the melody came singing out to us on the vox humana stop thou wouldst still be adored as this moment thou art let thy loveliness fade as it will and around the dear ruin each wish of my heart would entwine itself verdantly still francesca joined me just then and a tear was in her eye penny dear when all is said believe me is the dearer song of the two anybody can sing feel live the first which is but a youthful dream after all but the other has in it the proved fidelity of the years the first song belongs to me i know and it is all i am fit for now but i want to grow toward and deserve the second you are right but while loves young dream is yours and ronalds dear take all the joy that it holds for you the other song is for salemina and dr gerald and i only hope they are realising it at this moment secretive provoking creatures that they are the old organist left his pupil just then and disappeared through a little door in the rear have you the wedding march there i asked the pupil who had been practising the lovesongs oh yes madam though i am afraid i cannot do it justice he replied modestly are you interested in organ music i am very much interested in yours and i am still more interested in a romance that has been dragging its weary length along for twenty years and is trying to bring itself to a crisis just on the other side of that screen you can help me precipitate it if you only will well he was young and he was an irishman which is equivalent to being a born lover and he had been brought up on tommy moore and music all of which i had known from the moment i saw him else i should not have made the proposition i peeped from behind the screen ronald and himself were walking toward us salemina and dr gerald were sitting together in one of the front pews i beckoned to my husband will you and ronald go quietly out one of the side doors i asked take your own car and go back to the hotel allowing us to follow you a little later it takes more than one year of marriage for even the cleverest benedict to uproot those weeds of stupidity denseness and noncomprehension that seem to grow so riotously in the mental garden of the bachelor so said himself we came all together why shouldnt we go home all together so like a man always reasoning from analogy always so to speak lugging in logic desperate situations demand desperate remedies i replied mysteriously though i hope patiently if you go home at once without any questions you will be virtuous and it is more than likely that you will also be happy and if you are not somebody else will be having seen the backs of our two cavaliers disappearing meekly into the rain i stationed francesca at a point of vantage and went out to my victims in the front pew the others went on ahead i explained with elaborate carelessness they wanted to drive by dublin castle and we are going to follow as we like for my part i am tired and you are looking pale salemina i am sure your ankle is painful help her dr gerald please she is so proud and selfreliant that she wont even lean on any ones arm if she can avoid it take her down the middle aisle for ive sent your car to that door this was the last of a series of happy thoughts on my part ill go and tell francesca who is flirting with the organist she has an appointment at the tailors so i will drop her there and join you at the hotel in a few minutes the refractory pair of innocent middleaged lovers started arm in arm on what i ardently hoped would be an eventful walk together it was from instead of toward the altar to be sure but i was certain it would finally lead them to it notwithstanding the unusual method of approach i gave francesca the signal and then disappearing behind the screen i held her hand in a palpitation of nervous apprehension that i had scarcely felt when himself first asked me to be his the young organist blushing to the roots of his hair trembling with responsibility smiling at the humour of the thing pulled out all the stops and the wedding march pealed through the cathedral the splendid joy and swing and triumph of it echoing through the vaulted aisles in a way that positively incited one to bigamy we may regard the matter as settled now whispered francesca comfortably anybody would ask anybody else to marry him whether he was in love with her or not if it werent so beautiful and so touching wouldnt it be amusing isnt the organist a darling and doesnt he enter into the spirit of it see him shaking with sympathetic laughter and yet he never lets a smile creep into the music it is all earnestness and majesty may i peep now and see how they are getting on certainly not what are you thinking of francesca our only justification in this whole matter is that we are absolutely serious about it we shall say goodbye to the organist wring his hand gratefully and steal with him through the little door then in a halfhour we shall know the worst or the best and we must remember to send him cards and a marked copy of the newspaper containing the marriage notice salemina told me all about it that night but she never suspected the interference of any deus ex machina save that of the traditional god of love who it seems to me has not kept up with the requirements of the age in all respects and leaves a good deal for us women to do nowadays would that you had come up this aisle to meet me salemina and that you were walking down again as my wife this was what dr gerald had surprised her by saying when the wedding music had finally entered into his soul driving away for the moment his doubt and fear and selfdistrust and i can well believe that the hopelessness of his tone stirred her tender heart to its very depths what did you answer i asked breathlessly on the impulse of the moment we were talking by the light of a single candle salemina turned her head a little aside but there was a look on her face that repaid me for all my labour and anxiety a look in which her forty years melted away and became as twenty a look that was the outward and visible expression of the inward and spiritual youth that has always been hers then she replied simply i told him what is true that my life had been one long coming to meet him and that i was quite ready to walk with him to the end of the world i left her to her thoughts which i well knew were more precious than my words and went across the hall where benella was packing francescas last purchases ordinarily one of us manages to superintend such operations as the derelicts principal aim is to make two garments go where only one went before nature in her wildest moments never abhorred a vacuum in her dominion as miss dusenberry resents it in a trunk benella i said in that mysterious whisper which one uses for such communications dr la touche has asked miss peabody to marry him and she has consented it was full time the derelict responded with a deep sigh of relief but better late than never men folks are so queer i dont hardly know how a merciful providence ever came to invent em either theyre so bold theyd propose to the queen o sheba without mindin it a mite or else theyre such scarecats you bout have to ask em yourself and then lug em to the ministers afterwards there dont seem to be no halfway with em well im glad youre all settled it must be nice to have folks it was a pathetic little phrase and i fancied i detected a tear in her usually cheerful and decided voice acting on the suspicion i said hurriedly you have already had a share of miss monroes folks and mine offered you and now miss peabody will be sure to add hers to the number your only difficulty will be to attend to them all impartially and keep them from quarrelling as to which shall have you next she brightened visibly yes she assented without any superfluous modesty squeezing as she spoke a pair of bronze slippers into the crown of francescas favourite hat yes that partll be hard on all of us but i want you to know that i belong to you this winter any way miss peabody can get along without me bettern you can her glance was freighted with a kind of evasive halfembarrassed affection shy unobtrusive respectful it was but altogether friendly and helpful that the relations between us have ever quite been those of mistress and maid i cannot affirm we have tried to persuade ourselves that they were at least an imitation of the proper thing just to maintain our selfrespect while travelling in a country of monarchical institutions but we have always tacitly understood the real situation and accepted its piquant incongruities so when i met benella dusenberrys wistful sympathetic eye my republican head reckless of british conventions found the maternal hollow in her spinster shoulder as i said dear old derelict it was a good day for us when you drifted into our harbour
