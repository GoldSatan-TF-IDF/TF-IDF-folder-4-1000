the theft of the thirtynine girdles clark ashton smith let it be said as a foreword to this tale that i have robbed no man who was not in some way a robber of others in all my long and arduous career i satampra zeiros of uzuldaroum sometimes known as the masterthief have endeavored to serve merely as an agent in the rightful redistribution of wealth the adventure i have now to relate was no exception though as it happened in the outcome my own pecuniary profits were indeed meager not to say trifling age is upon me now and sitting at that leisure which i have earned through many hazards i drink the wines that are heartening to age to me as i sip return memories of splendid loot and brave nefarious enterprise before me shine the outpoured sackfuls of djals or pazoors removed so dexterously from the coffers of iniquitous merchants and moneylenders i dream of rubies redder than the blood that was shed for them of sapphires bluer than depths of glacial ice of emeralds greener than the jungle in spring i recall the escalade of pronged balconies the climbing of terraces and towers guarded by monsters the sacking of altars beneath the eyes of malign idols or sentinel serpents often i think of vixeela my one true love and the most adroit and courageous of my companions in burglary she has long since gone to the bourn of all good thieves and comrades and i have mourned her sincerely these many years but still dear is the memory of our amorous or adventurous nights and the feats we performed together of such feats perhaps the most signal and audacious was the theft of the thirtynine girdles these were the golden and jeweled chastity girdles worn by the virgins vowed to the moon god leniqua whose temple had stood from immemorial time in the suburbs of uzuldaroum capital of hyperborea the virgins were always thirtynine in number they were chosen for their youth and beauty and retired from service to the god at the age of thirtyone the girdles were padlocked with the toughest bronze and their keys retained by the highpriest who on certain nights rented them at a high price to the richer gallants of the city it will thus be seen that the virginity of the priestesses was nominal but its frequent and repeated sale was regarded as a meritorious act of sacrifice to the god vixeela herself had at one time been numbered among the virgins but had fled from the temple and from uzuldaroum several years before the sacerdotal age of release from her bondage she would tell me little of her life in the temple and i surmised that she had found small pleasure in the religious prostitution and had chafed at the confinement entailed by it after her flight she had suffered many hardships in the cities of the south of these too she spoke but sparingly as one who dreads the reviving of painful recollections she had returned to uzuldaroum a few months prior to our first meeting being now a little over age and having dyed her russetblonde hair to a raven black she had no great fear of recognition by leniquas priests as was their custom they had promptly replaced her loss with another and younger virgin and would have small interest now in one so long delinquent at the time of our foregathering vixeela had already committed various petty larcenies but being unskilled she had failed to finish any but the easier and simpler ones and had grown quite thin from starvation she was still attractive and her keenness of wit and quickness in learning soon endeared her to me she was small and agile and could climb like a lemur i soon found her help invaluable since she could climb through windows and other apertures impassable to my greater bulk we had consummated several lucrative burglaries when the idea of entering leniquas temple and making away with the costly girdles occurred to me the problems offered and the difficulties to be overcome appeared at first sight little less than fantastic but such obstacles have always challenged my acumen and have never daunted me firstly there was the problem of entrance without detection and serious mayhem at the hands of the sicklearmed priests who guarded leniquas fane with baleful and incorruptible vigilance luckily during her term of temple service vixeela had learned of a subterranean adit long disused but she believed still passable this entrance was through a tunnel the continuation of a natural cavern located somewhere in the woods behind uzuldaroum it had been used almost universally by the virgins visitors in former ages but the visitors now entered openly by the temples main doors or by posterns little less public a sign perhaps that religious sentiment had deepened or that modesty had declined vixeela had never seen the cavern herself but she knew its approximate location the temples inner adit was closed only by a flagstone easily levitated from below or above behind the image of leniqua in the great nave secondly there was the selection of a proper time when the womens girdles had been unlocked and laid aside here again vixeela was invaluable since she knew the nights on which the rented keys were most in demand these were known as nights of sacrifice greater or lesser the chief one being at the moons full all the women were then in repeated request since however the fane on such occasions would be crowded with people the priests the virgins and their clients a seemingly insurmountable difficulty remained how were we to collect and make away with the girdles in the presence of so many persons this i must admit baffled me plainly we must find some way in which the temple could be evacuated or its occupants rendered unconscious or otherwise incapable during the period needed for our operations i thought of a certain soporific drug easily and quickly vaporized which i had used on more than one occasion to put the inmates of a house asleep unfortunately the drug was limited in its range and would not penetrate to all the chambers and alcoves of a large edifice like the temple moreover it was necessary to wait for a full half hour with doors or windows opened till the fumes were dissipated otherwise the robbers would be overcome together with their victims there was also the pollen of a rare jungle lily which if cast in a mans face would induce a temporary paralysis this too i rejected there were too many persons to be dealt with and the pollen could hardly be obtained in sufficient quantities at last i decided to consult the magician and alchemist veezi phenquor who possessing furnaces and meltingpots had often served me by converting stolen gold and silver into ingots or other safely unrecognizable forms though skeptical of his powers as a magician i regarded veezi phenquor as a skilled pharmacist and toxicologist having always on hand a supply of strange and deadly medicaments he might well be able to provide something that would facilitate our project we found veezi phenquor decanting one of his more noisome concoctions from a still bubbling and steaming kettle into vials of stout stoneware by the smell i judged that it must be something of special potency the exudations of a polecat would have been innocuous in comparison in his absorption he did not notice our presence until the entire contents of the kettle had been decanted and the vials tightly stoppered and sealed with a blackish gum that he observed with unctuous complacency is a lovephilter that would inflame a nursing infant or resurrect the powers of a dying nonagenarian do you no i said emphatically we require nothing of the sort what we need at the moment is something quite different in a few terse words i went on to outline the problem adding if you can help us i am sure you will find the meltingdown of the golden girdles a congenial task as usual you will receive a third of the profits veezi phenquor creased his bearded face into a halflubricious halfsardonic smile the proposition is a pleasant one from all angles we will free the templegirls from incumbrances which they must find uncomfortable not to say burdensome and will turn the irksome gems and metal to a worthier purpose notably our own enrichment as if by way of afterthought he added it happens that i can supply you with a most unusual preparation warranted to empty the temple of all its occupants in a very short time going to a cobwebbed corner he took down from a high shelf an abdominous jar of uncolored glass filled with a fine grey powder and brought it to the light i will now he said explain to you the singular properties of this powder and the way in which it must be used it is truly a triumph of chemistry and more devastating than a plague we were astounded by what he told us then we began to laugh it is to be hoped i said that none of your spells and cantrips are involved veezi phenquor assumed the expression of one whose feelings have been deeply injured i assure you he protested that the effects of the powder though extraordinary are not beyond nature after a moments meditation he continued i believe that i can further your plan in other ways after the abstraction of the girdles there will be the problem of transporting undetected such heavy merchandise across a city which by that time may well have been aroused by the horrendous crime and busily patrolled by constabulary i have a plan we hailed with approval the ingenious scheme outlined by veezi phenquor after we had discussed and settled to our satisfaction the various details the alchemist brought out certain liquors that proved more palatable than anything of his we had yet sampled we then returned to our lodgings i carrying in my cloak the jar of powder for which veezi phenquor generously refused to accept payment we were filled with the rosiest anticipations of success together with a modicum of distilled palmwine discreetly we refrained from our usual activities during the nights that intervened before the next full moon and we kept closely to our lodgings hoping that the police who had long suspected us of numerous peccadilloes would believe that we had either quitted the city or retired from burglary a little before midnight on the evening of the full moon veezi phenquor knocked discreetly at our door a triple knock as had been agreed like ourselves he was heavily cloaked in peasants homespun i have procured the cart of a vegetable seller from the country he said it is loaded with seasonable produce and drawn by two small asses i have concealed it in the woods as near to the caveadit of leniquas temple as the overgrown road will permit also i have reconnoitered the cave itself our success will depend on the utter confusion created if we are not seen to enter or depart by the rear adit in all likelihood no one will remember its existence the priests will be searching elsewhere having removed the girdles and concealed them under our load of farm produce we will then wait till the hour before dawn when with other vegetable and fruit dealers we will enter the city keeping as far as we could from the public places where most of the police were gathered around taverns and the cheaper lupanars we circled across uzuldaroum and found at some distance from leniquas fane a road that ran countryward the jungle soon grew denser and the houses fewer no one saw us when we turned into a sideroad overhung with leaning palms and closed in by thickening brush after many devious turnings we came to the assdrawn cart so cleverly screened from view that even i could detect its presence only by the pungent aroma of certain rootvegetables and the smell of freshfallen dung those asses were welltrained for the use of thieves there was no braying to betray their presence we groped on over hunching roots and between clustered boles that made the rest of the way impassable for a cart i should have missed the cave but veezi phenquor pausing stooped before a low hillock to part the matted creepers showing a black and bouldered aperture large enough to admit a man on hands and knees lighting the torches we had brought along we crawled into the cave veezi going first luckily due to the rainless season the cave was dry and our clothing suffered only earthstains such as would be proper to agricultural workers the cave narrowed where piles of debris had fallen from the roof i with my width and girth was hard put to squeeze through in places we had gone an undetermined distance when veezi stopped and stood erect before a wall of smooth masonry in which shadowy steps mounted vixeela slipped past him and went up the steps i followed the fingers of her free hand were gliding over a large flat flagstone that filled the stairhead the stone began to tilt noiselessly upward vixeela blew out her torch and laid it on the top step while the gap widened permitting a dim flickering light to pour down from beyond she peered cautiously over the top of the flag which became fully uptilted by its hidden mechanism and then climbed through motioning us to follow we stood in the shadow of a broad pillar at one side of the back part of leniquas temple no priest woman or visitor was in sight but we heard a confused humming of voices at some vague remove leniquas image presenting its reverend rear sat on a high dais in the center of the nave altarfires golden blue and green flamed spasmodically before the god making his shadow writhe on the floor and against the rear wall like a delirious giant in a dance of copulation with an unseen partner vixeela found and manipulated the spring that caused the flagstone to sink back as part of a level floor then the three of us stole forward keeping in the gods wavering shadow the nave was still vacant but noise came more audibly from open doorways at one side resolving itself into gay cries and hysterical laughters now whispered veezi phenquor i drew from a sidepocket the vial he had given us and pried away the wax with a sharp knife the cork halfrotten with age was easily removed i poured the vials contents on the back bottom step of leniquas dais a pale stream that quivered and undulated with uncanny life and luster as it fell in the gods shadow when the vial was empty i ignited the heap of powder it burned instantly with a clear highleaping flame immediately it seemed the air was full of surging phantoms a soundless multitudinous explosion beating upon us blasting our nostrils with charnel fetors till we reeled before it choking and strangling there was however no sense of material impact from the hideous forms that seemed to melt over and through us rushing in all directions as if every atom of the burning powder had released a separate ghost hastily we covered our noses with squares of thick cloth that veezi had warned us to bring for this purpose something of our usual aplomb returned and we moved forward through the seething rout lascivious blue cadavers intertwined around us miscegenations of women and tigers arched over us monsters doubleheaded and tripletailed goblins and ghouls rose obliquely to the far ceiling or rolled and melted to other and more nameless apparitions in lower air green seathings like unions of drowned men and octopi coiled and dribbled with dank slime along the floor then we heard the cries of fright from the temples inmates and visitors and began to meet naked men and women who rushed frantically through that army of beleaguering phantoms toward the exits those who encountered us face to face recoiled as if we too were shapes of intolerable horror the naked men were mostly young after them came middleaged merchants and aldermen bald and potbellied some clad in undergarments some in snatchedup cloaks too short to cover them below the hips women lean fat or buxom tumbled screaming for the outer doors none of them we saw with approbation had retained her chastity girdle lastly came the templeguards and priests with mouths like gaping squares of terror emitting shrill cries all of the guards had dropped their sickles they passed us blindly disregarding our presence and ran after the rest the host of powderborn specters soon shrouded them from view satisfied that the temple was now empty of its inmates and clients we turned our attention to the first corridor the doors of the separate rooms were all open we divided our labors taking each a room and removing from disordered beds and garmentlittered floors the castoff girdles of gold and gems we met at the corridors end where our collected loot was thrust into the strong thin sack i had carried under my cloak many of the phantoms still lingered achieving new and ghastlier fusions dropping their members upon us as they began to diswreathe soon we had searched all the rooms apportioned to the women my sack was full and i had counted thirtyeight girdles at the end of the third corridor one girdle was still missing but vixeelas sharp eyes caught the gleam of an emeraldstudded buckle protruding from under the dissolving legs of a hairy satyrlike ghost on a pile of male garments in the corner she snatched up the girdle and carried it in her hand henceforward we hurried back to leniquas nave believing it to be vacant of all human occupants by now to our disconcertion the highpriest whose name vixeela knew as marquanos was standing before the altar striking blows with a long phallic rod of bronze his insignia of office at certain apparitions that remained floating in the air marquanos rushed toward us with a harsh cry as we neared him dealing a blow at vixeela that would have brained her if she had not slipped agilely to one side the highpriest staggered nearly losing his balance before he could turn upon her again vixeela brought down on his tonsured head the heavy chastity girdle she bore in her right hand marquanos toppled like a slaughtered ox beneath the poleax of the butcher and lay prostrate writhing a little blood ran in rills from the serrated imprint of the great jewels on his scalp whether he was dead or still living we did not pause to ascertain we made our exit without delay after the fright they had received there was small likelihood that any of the temples denizens would venture to return for some hours the movable slab fell smoothly back into place behind us we hurried along the underground passage i carrying the sack and the others preceding me in order to drag it through straitened places and over piles of rubble when i was forced to set it down we reached the creeperhung entrance without incident there we paused awhile before emerging into the moonstreaked woods and listened cautiously to cries that diminished with distance apparently no one had thought of the rear adit or had even realized that there was any such human motive as robbery behind the invasion of terrifying specters reassured we came forth from the cavern and found our way back to the hidden cart and its drowsing asses we threw enough of the fruits and vegetables into the brush to make a deep cavity in the carts center in which our sackful of loot was then deposited and covered over from sight then settling ourselves on the grassy ground we waited for the hour before dawn around us after awhile we heard the furtive slithering and scampering of small animals that devoured the comestibles we had cast away if any of us slept it was so to speak with one eye and one ear we rose in the horizontal sifting of the last moonbeams and long eastwardrunning shadows of early twilight leading our asses we approached the highway and stopped behind the brush while an early cart creaked by silence ensued and we broke from the wood and resumed our journey cityward before other carts came in sight in our return through outlying streets we met only a few early passers who gave us no second glance reaching the neighborhood of veezi phenquors house we consigned the cart to his care and watched him turn into the courtyard unchallenged and seemingly unobserved by others than ourselves he was i reflected well supplied with roots and fruits we kept closely to our lodgings for two days it seemed unwise to remind the police of our presence in uzuldaroum by any public appearance on the evening of the second day our foodsupply ran short and we sallied out in our rural costumes to a nearby market which we had never before patronized returning we found evidence that veezi phenquor had paid us a visit during our absence in spite of the fact that all the doors and windows had been and still were carefully locked a small cube of gold reposed on the table serving as paperweight for a scribbled note the note read my esteemed friends and companions after removing the various gems i have melted down all the gold into ingots and am leaving one of them as a token of my great regard unfortunately i have learned that i am being watched by the police and am leaving uzuldaroum under circumstances of haste and secrecy taking the other ingots and all the jewels in the assdrawn cart covered up by the vegetables i have providentially kept even though they are slightly stale by now i expect to make a long journey in a direction which i cannot specify a journey well beyond the jurisdiction of our local police and one on which i trust you will not be perspicacious enough to follow me i shall need the remainder of our loot for my expenses et cetera good luck in all your future ventures respectfully veezi phenquor postscript you too are being watched and i advise you to quit the city with all feasible expedition marquanos in spite of a wellcracked mazzard from vixeelas blow recovered full consciousness late yesterday he recognized in vixeela a former templegirl through the trained dexterity of her movements he has not been able to identify her but a thorough and secret search is being made and other girls have already been put to the thumbscrew and toescrew by leniquas priests you and i my dear satampra have already been listed though not yet identified as possible accomplices of the girl a man of your conspicuous height and bulk is being sought the powder of the fetid apparitions some traces of which were found on leniquas dais has already been analyzed unluckily it has been used before both by myself and other alchemists i hope you will escape on other paths than the one i am planning to follow
