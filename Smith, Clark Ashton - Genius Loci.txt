genius loci clark ashton smith it is a very strange place said amberville but i scarcely know how to convey the impression it made upon me it will all sound so simple and ordinary there is nothing but a sedgy meadow surrounded on three sides by slopes of yellow pine a dreary little stream flows in from the open end to lose itself in a culdesac of cattails and boggy ground the stream running slowly and more slowly forms a stagnant pool of some extent from which several sicklylooking alders seem to fling themselves backwards as if unwilling to approach it a dead willow leans above the pool tangling its wan skeletonlike reflection with the green scum that mottles the water there are no blackbirds no kildees no dragonflies even such as one usually finds in a place of that sort it is all silent and desolate the spot is evil it is unholy in a way that i simply cant describe i was compelled to make a drawing of it almost against my will since anything so outr–π is hardly in my line in fact i made two drawings ill show them to you if you like since i had a high opinion of ambervilles artistic abilities and had long considered him one of the foremost landscape painters of his generation i was naturally eager to see the drawings he however did not even pause to await my avowal of interest but began at once to open his portfolio his facial expression the very movements of his hands were somehow eloquent of a strange mixture of compulsion and repugnance as he brought out and displayed the two watercolour sketches he had mentioned i could not recognize the scene depicted from either of them plainly it was one that i had missed in my desultory rambling about the foothill environs of the tiny hamlet of bowman where two years before i had purchased an uncultivated ranch and had retired for the privacy so essential to prolonged literary effort francis amberville in the one fortnight of his visit through his flair for the pictorial potentialities of landscape had doubtless grown more familiar with the neighbourhood than i it had been his habit to roam about in the forenoon armed with sketchingmaterials and in this way he had already found the theme of more than one lovely painting the arrangement was mutually convenient since i in his absence was wont to apply myself assiduously to an antique remington typewriter i examined the drawings attentively both though of hurried execution were highly meritorious and showed the characteristic grace and vigour of ambervilles style and yet even at first glance i found a quality that was more alien to the spirit of his work the elements of the scene were those he had described in one picture the pool was half hidden by a fringe of mace weeds and the dead willow was leaning across it at a prone despondent angle as if mysteriously arrested in its fall towards the stagnant waters beyond the alders seemed to strain away from the pool exposing their knotted roots as if in eternal effort in the other drawing the pool formed the main portion of the foreground with the skeleton tree looming drearily at one side at the waters farther end the cattails seemed to wave andwhisper among themselves in a dying wind and the steeply barring slope of pine at the meadows terminus was indicated as a wall of gloomy green that closed in the picture leaving only a pale of autumnal sky at the top all this as the painter had said was ordinary enough but i was impressed immediately by a profound horror that lurked in these simple elements and was expressed by them as if by the balefully contorted features of some demoniac face in both drawings this sinister character was equally evident as if the same face had been shown in profile and front view i could not trace the separate details that composed the impressions but ever as i looked the abomination of a strange evil a spirit of despair malignity desolation leered from the drawing more openly and hatefully the spot seemed to wear a macabre and satanic grimace one felt that it might speak aloud might utter the imprecations of some gigantic devil or the raucous derision of a thousand birds of ill omen the evil conveyed was something wholly outside of humanity more ancient than man somehow fantastic as this will seem the meadow had the air of a vampire grown old and hideous with unutterable infamies subtly indefinably it thirsted for other things than the sluggish trickle of water by which it was fed where is the place i asked after a minute or two of silent inspection it was incredible that anything of the sort could really exist and equally incredible that a nature so robust as amberville should have been sensitive to its quality its in the bottom of that abandoned ranch a mile or less down the little road towards bear river he replied you must know it theres a small orchard about the house on the upper hillside but the lower portion ending in that meadow is all wild land i began to visualize the vicinity in question guess it must be the old chapman place i decided no other ranch along that road would answer your specifications well whoever it belongs to that meadow is the most horrible spoti have ever encountered ive known other landscapes that had something wrong with them but never anything lihe this maybe its haunted i said half in jest from your description it must be the very meadow where old chapman was found dead one morning by his youngest daughter it happened a few months after i moved here he was supposed to have died of heart failure his body was quite cold and he had probably been lying there all night since the family had missed him at suppertime i dont remember him very clearly but i remember that he had a reputation for eccentricity for some time before his death people thought he was going mad i forget the details anyway his wife and children left not long after he died and no one has occupied the house or cultivated the orchard since it was a commonplace rural tragedy im not much of a believer in spooks observed amberville who seemed to have taken my suggestion of haunting in a literal sense whatever the influence is its hardly of human origin come to think of it though i received a very silly impressiom once or twice the idea that some one was watching me while i did those drawings queer i had almost forgotten that till you brought up the possibility of haunting i seemed to see him out of the tail of my eye just beyond the radius that i was putting into the picture a dilapidated old scoundrel with dirty grey whiskers and an evil scowl its odd too that i should have gotten such a definite conception of him without ever seeing him squarely i thought it was a tramp who had strayed into the meadow bottom but when i turned to give him a level glance he simply wasnt there it was as if he melted into the miry ground the cattails the sedges that isnt a bad description of chapman i said i remember his whiskers they were almost white except for the tobacco juice a battered antique if there ever was one and very unamiable too he had a poisonous glance towards the end which no doubt helped along the legend of his insanity some of the tales about him come back to me now people said that he neglected the care of his orchard more and more visitors used to find him in that lower meadow standing idly about and staring vacantly at the trees and water probably that was one reason they thought he was losing his mind but im sure i never heard that there was anything unusual or queer about the meadow either at the time of chapmans death or since its a lonely spot and i dont imagine that any one ever goes there now i stumbled on it quite by accident said amberville the place isnt visible from the road on account of the thick pines but theres another odd thing i went out this morning with a strong and clear intuition that i might find something of uncommon interest i made a beeline for the meadow so to speak and ill have to admit that the intuition justified itself the place repels me but it fascinates me too ive simply got to solve the mystery if it has a solution he added with a slightly defensive air im going back early tomorrow with my oils to start a real painting of it i was surprised knowing that predilection of amberville for scenic brilliance and gaiety which had caused him to be likened to sorolla the painting will be a novelty for you i commented ill have to come and take a look at the place myself before long it should really be more in my line than yours there ought to be a weird story in it somewhere if it lives up to your drawings and description several days passed i was deeply preoccupied at the time with the toilsome and intricate problems offered by the concluding chapters of a new novel and i put off my proposed visit to the meadow discovered by amberville my friend on his part was evidently engrossed by his new theme he sallied forth each morning with his easel and oilcolours and returned later each day forgetful of the luncheonhour that had formerly brought him back from such expeditions on the third day he did not reappear till sunset contrary to his custom he did not show me what he had done and his answers to my queries regarding the progress of the picture were somewhat vague and evasive for some reason he was unwilling to talk about it also he was apparently loath to discuss the meadow itself and in answer to direct questions merely reiterated in an absent and perfunctory manner the account he had given me following his discovery of the place in some mysterious way that i could not define his attitude seemed to have changed there were other changes too he seemed to have lost his usual bitterness often i caught him frowning intently and surprised the lurking of some equivocal shadow in his frank eyes there was a moodiness a morbidity which as far as our five years friendship enabled me to observe was a new aspect of his temperament perhaps if i had not been so preoccupied with my own difficulties i might have wondered more as to the causatiom of his gloom which i attributed readily enough at first to some technical dilemma that was baffling him he was less and less the amberville that i knew and on the fourth day when he came back at twilight i perceived an actual surliness that was quite foreign to his nature whats wrong i ventured to inquire have you struck a snag or is old chapmans meadow getting on your nerves with its ghostly influences he seemed for once to make an effort to throw off his gloom his taciturnity and ill humour its the infernal mystery of the thing he declared ive simply got to solve it in one way or another the place has an entity of its own an indwelling personality its there like the soul in a human body but i cant pin it down or touch it you know that im not superstitious but on the other hand im not a bigoted materialist either and ive run across some odd phenomena in my time that meadow perhaps is inhabited by what the ancients called a genius loci more than once before this i have suspected that such things might exist might reside inherent in some particular spot but this is the first time that ive had reason to suspect anything of an actively malignant or inimical nature the other influences whose presence i have felt were benign in some large vague impersonal way or were else wholly indifferent to human welfare perhaps oblivious of human existence this thing however is hatefully aware and watchful i feel that the meadow itself or the force embodied in the meadow is scrutinizing me all the time the place has the air of a thirsty vanpire waiting to drink me in somehow if it can it is a culdesac of everything evil in which an unwary soul might well be caught and absorbed but i tell you murray i cant keep away from it it looks as if the place were getting you i said thoroughly astonished by his extraordinary declaration and by the air of fearful and morbid conviction with which he uttered it apparently he had not heard me for he made no reply to my observation theres another angle he went on with a feverish intensity in his voice you remember my impression of an old man lurking in the background and watching me on my first visit well i have seen him again many times out of the corner of my eye and during the last two days he has appeared more directly though in a queer partial way sometimes when i am studying the dead willow very intently i see his scowling filthybearded face as a part of the hole then again it will float among the leafless twigs as if it had been caught there sometimes a knotty hand a tattered coatsleeve will emerge through the mantling in the pool as if a drowned body were rising to the surface then a moment later or simultaneously there will be something of him among the alders or the cattails these apparitions are always brief and when i try to scrutinize them closely they melt like films of vapour into the surrounding scene but the old scoundrel whoever or whatever he may be is a sort of fixture he is no less vile than everything else about the place though i feel that he isnt the main element of the vileness good lord i exclaimed you certainly have been seeing things if you dont mind ill come down and join you for a while tomorrow afternoon the mystery begins to inveigle me of course i dont mind come ahead his manner all at once for no tangible reason had resumed the unnatural taciturnity of the past four days he gave me a furtive look that was sullen and almost unfriendly it was as if an obscure barrier temporarily laid aside had again risen between us the shadows of his strange mood returned upon him visibly and my efforts to continue the conversation were rewarded only by halfsurly half absent monosyllables feeling an aroused concern rather than any offence i began to note for the first time the unwonted pallor of his face and the bright febrile lustre of his eyes he looked vaguely unwell i thought as if something of his exuberant vitality had gone out of him and had left in its place an alien energy of doubtful and less healthy nature tacitly i gave up any attempt to bring him back from the secretive twilight into which he had withdrawn for the rest of the evening i pretended to read a novel while amberville maintained his singular abstraction somewhat inconclusively i puzzled over the matter till bedtime i made up my mind however that i would visit chapmans meadow i did not believe in the supernatural but it seemed apparent that the place was exerting a deleterious influence upon amberville the next morning when i arose my chinese servant informed me that the painter had already breakfasted and had gone out with his easel and colours this further proof of his obsession troubled me but i applied myself rigorously to a forenoon of writing immediately after luncheon i drove down the highway followed the narrow dirt road that branched off towards bear river and left my car on the pinethick hill above the old chapman place though i had never visited the meadow i had a pretty clear idea of its location disregarding the grassy halfobliterated road into the upper portion of the property i struck down through the woods into the little blind valley seeing more than once on the opposite slope the dying orchard of pear and apple trees and the tumbledown shanty that had belonged to the chapmans it was a warm october day and the serene solitude of the forest the autumnal softness of light and air made the idea of anything malign or sinister seem impossible when i came to the meadowbottom i was ready to laugh at ambervilles notions and the place itself at first sight merely impressed me as being rather dreary and dismal the features of the scene were those that he had described so clearly but i could not find the open evil that had leered from the pool the willow the alders and the cattails in his drawings amberville with his back towards me was seated on a folding stool before his easel which he had placed among the plots of dark green wiregrass in the open ground above the pool he did not seem to be working however but was staring intently at the scene beyond him while a loaded brush drooped idly in his fingers the sedges deadened my footfalls and he did not hear me as i drew near with much curiosity i peered over his shoulder at the large canvas on which he had been engaged as far as i could tell the picture had already been carried to a consummate degree of technical perfection it was an almost photographic rendering of the scummy water the whitish skeleton of the leaning willow the unhealthy halfdisrooted alders and the cluster of nodding macereeds but in it i found the macabre and demoniac spirit of the sketches the meadow seemed to wait and watch like an evilly distorted face it was a deadfall of malignity and despair lying from the autumn world around it a plaguespot of nature forever accursed and alone again i looked at the landscape itself and saw that the spot was indeed as amberville had depicted it it wore the grimace of a mad vampire hateful and alert at the same time i became disagreeably conscious of the unnatural silence there were no birds no insects as the painter had said and it seemed that only spent and dying winds could ever enter that depressed valley bottom the thin stream that lost itself in the boggy ground was like a soul that went down to perdition it was part of the mystery too for i could not remember any stream on the lower side of the barring hill that would indicate a subterranean outlet ambervilles intentness and the very posture of his head and shoulders were like those of a man who has been mesmerized i was about to make my presence known to him but at that instant there came to me the apperception that we were not alone in the meadow just beyond the focus of my vision a figure seemed to stand in a furtive attitude as if watching us both i whirled about and there was no one then i heard a startled cry from amberville and turned to find him staring at me his features wore a look of terror and surprise which had not wholly erased a hypnotic absorption my god he said i thought you were the old man i can not be sure whether anything more was said by either of us i have however the impression of a blank silence after his single exclamation of surprise amberville seemed to retreat into an impenetrable abstraction as if he were no longer conscious of my presence as if having identified me he had forgotten me at once on my part i felt a weird and overpowering constraint that infamous eerie scene depressed me beyond measure it seemed that the boggy bottom was trying to drag me down in some intangible way the boughs of the sick alders beckoned the pool over which the bony willow presided like an arboreal death was wooing me foully with its stagnant waters moreover apart from the ominous atmosphere of the scene itself i was painfully aware of a further change in amberville a change that was an actual alienation his recent mood whatever it was had strengthened upon him enormously he had gone deeper into its morbid twilight and was lost to the blithe and sanguine personality i had known it was as if an incipient madness had seized him and the possibility of this terrified me in a slow somnambulistic manner without giving me a second glance he began to work at his painting and i watched him for a while hardly knowing what to do or say for long intervals he would stay and peer with dreamy intentness at some feature of the landscape i conceived the bizarre idea of a growing kinship a mysterious rapport between amberville and the meadow in some intangible way it seemed as if the place had taken some thing from his very soul and had given something of itself in exchange he wore the air of one who participates in some unholy secret who has become the acolyte of an unhuman knowledge in a flash of horrible definitude i saw the place as an actual vampire and amberville as its willing victim how long i remained there i can not say finally i stepped over to him and shook him roughly by the shoulder youre working too hard i said take my advice and lay off for a day or two he turned to me with the dazed look of one who is lost in some narcotic dream this very slowly gave place to a sullen evil anger oh go to hell he snarled cant you see that im busy i left him then for there seemed nothing else to do under the circumstances the mad and spectral nature of the whole affair was enough to make me doubt my own reason my impressions of the meadow and of amberville were tainted with an insidious horror such as i had ever before felt in any moment of waking life and normal consciousness at the bottom of the slope of yellow pine i turned back with repugnant curiosity for a parting glance the painter had not moved he was still confronting the malignant scene like a charmed bird that faces a lethal serpent whether or not the impression was a double optic image i have never been sure but at that instant i seemed to discern a faint unholy aura neither light nor mist that flowed and wavered about the meadow preserving the outlines of the willow the alders the weeds the pool stealthily it appeared to lengthen reaching towards amberville like ghostly arms the whole image was extremely tenuous and may well have been an illusion but it sent me shuddering into the shelter of the tall benignant pines the remainder of that day and the evening that followed were tinged with the shadowy horror i had found in chapmans meadow i believe that i spent most of the time in arguing vainly with myself in trying to convince the rational part of my mind that all i had seen and felt was utterly preposterous i could arrive at no conclusion other than a conviction that ambervilles mental health was endangered by the damnable thing whatever it was that inhered in the meadow the malign personality of the place the impalpable terror mystery and lure were like webs that had been woven upon my brain and which i could not dissipate by any amount of conscious effort i made two resolves however one was that i should write immediately to ambervilles fianc–π miss avis olcott and invite her to visit me as a fellowguest of the artist during the remainder of his stay at bowman her influence i thought might help to counteract whatever was affecting him so perniciously since i knew her fairly well the invitation would not seem out of the way i decided to say nothing about it to amberville the element of surprise i hoped would be especially beneficial my second resolve was that i should not again visit the meadow myself if i could avoid it indirectly for i knew the folly of trying to combat a mental obsession openly i should also try to discourage the painters interest in the place and divert his attention to other themes trips and entertainments too could be devised at the minor cost of delaying my own work the smoky autumn twilight overtook me in such meditations as these but amberville did not return horrible premonitions without coherent shape or name began to torment me as i waited for him the night darkened and dinner grew cold on the table at last about nine oclock when i was nerving myself to go out and hunt for him he came in hurriedly he was pale dishevelled out of breath and his eyes held a painful glare as if everything had frightened him beyond endurance he did not apologize for his lateness nor did he refer to my own visit to the meadowbottom apparently he had forgotten the whole episode had forgotten his rudeness to me im through he cried ill never go back again never take another chance that place is more hellish at night than in the daytime i cant tell you what ive seen and felt i must forget it if i can theres an emanation something that comes out openly in the absence of the sun but is latent by day it lures me it tempted me to remain this evening and it nearly got me god i didnt believe that such things were possible that abhor rent compound of he broke off and did not finish the sentence his eyes dilated as if with the memory of something too awful to be described at that moment i recalled the poisonously haunted eyes of old chapman whom i had sometimes met about the hamlet he had not interested me particularly since i had deemed him a common type of rural character with a tendency to some obscure and unpleasant aberration now when i saw the same look in the eyes of a sensitive artist i began to wonder with a shivering speculation whether chapman too had been aware of the weird evil that dwelt in his meadow perhaps in some way that was beyond human comprehension he had been its victim he had died there and his death had not seemed at all mysterious but perhaps in the light of all that amberville and i had perceived there was more in the matter than any one had suspected tell me what you saw i ventured to suggest at the question a veil seemed to fall between us impalpable but terrific he shook his head morosely and made no reply the human terror which perhaps had driven him back towards his normal self and had made him almost communicative for the nonce fell away from amberville a shadow that was darker than fear an impenetrable alien umbrage again submerged him i felt a sudden chill of the spirit rather than the flesh and once more there came to me the outr–π thought of his growing kinship with the ghoulish meadow beside me in the lamplit room behind the mask of his humanity a thing that was not wholly human seemed to sit and wait of the nightmarish days that followed i shall offer only a summary it would be impossible to convey the eventless fantasmal horror in which we dwelt and moved i wrote immediately to miss olcott pressing her to pay me a visit during ambervilles stay and in order to insure acceptance i hinted obscurely at my concern for his health and my need of her coadjutation in the meanwhile waiting her answer i tried to divert the artist by suggesting trips to sundry points of scenic interest in the neighbourhood these suggestions he declined with an aloof curtness an air that was stony and cryptic rather than deliberately rude virtually he ignored my existence and made it more than plain that he wished me to have him to his own devices this in despair i finally decided to do pending the arrival of miss olcott he went out early each morning as usual with his paints and easel and returned about sunset or a little later he did not tell me where he had been and i refrained from asking miss olcott came on the third day following my letter in the afternoon she was young lissome ultrafeminine and was altogether devoted to amberville in fact i think she was a little in awe of him i told her as much as i dared and warned her of the morbid change in her fianc–π which i attributed to nervousness and overwork i simply could not bring myself to mention chapmans meadow and its baleful influence the whole thing was too unbelievable too fantasmagoric to be offered as an explanation to a modern girl when i saw the somewhat helpless alarm and bewilderment with which she listened to my story i began to wish that she were of a more wilful and determined type and were less submissive towards amberville than i surmised her to be a stronger woman might have saved him but even then i began to doubt whether avis could do anything to combat the imponderable evil that was engulfing him a heavy crescmt moon was hanging like a blooddipped horn in the twilight when he returned to my immense relief the presence of avis appeared to have a highly salutary effect the very moment that he saw her amberville came out of the singular eclipse that had claimed him as i feared beyond redemption and was almost his former affable self perhaps it was all make believe for an ulterior purpose but this at the time i could not suspect i began to congratulate myself on having applied a sovereign remedy the girl on her part was plainly relieved though i saw her eyeing him in a slightly hurt and puzzled way when he sometimes fell for a short interval into moody abstraction as if he had temporarily forgotten her on the whole however there was a transformation that appeared no less than magical in view of his recent gloom and remoteness after a decent interim i left the pair together and retired i rose very late the next morning having overslept avis and amberville i learned had gone out together carrying a lunch which my chinese cook had provided plainly he was taking her along on one of his artistic expeditions and i augured well for his recovery from this somehow it never occurred to me that he had taken her to chapmans meadow the tenuous malignant shadow of the whole affair had begun to lift from my mind i rejoiced in a lightened sense of responsibility and for the first time in a week was able to concentrate clearly on the ending of my novel the two returned at dusk and i saw immediately that i had been mistaken on more points than one amberville had again retired into a sinister saturnine reserve the girl beside his looming height and massive shoulders looked very small forlorn and pitifully bewildered and frightened it was as if she had encountered something altogether beyond her comprehension something with which she was humanly powerless to cope very little was said by either of them they did not tell me where they had been but for that matter it was unnecessary to inquire ambervilles taciturnity as usual seemed due to an absorption in some dark mood or sullen reverie but avis gave me the impression of a dual constraint as if apart from some enthralling terror she had been forbidden to speak of the days events and experiences i knew that they had gone to that accursed meadow but i was far from sure whether avis had been personally conscious of the weird and baneful entity of the place or had merely been frightened by the unwholesome change in her lover beneath its influence in either case it was obvious that she was wholly subservient to him i began to damn myself for a fool in having invited her to bowman though the true bitterness of my regret was still to come a week went by with the same daily excursions of the painter and his fianc–π the same baffling sinister estrangement and secrecy in amberville the same terror helplessness constraint and submissiveness in the girl how it would all end i could not imagine but i feared from the ominous alteration of his character that amberville was heading for some form of mental alienation if nothing worse my offers of entertainment and scenic journeys were rejected by the pair and several blunt efforts to question avis were met by a wall of almost hostile evasion which convinced me that amberville had enjoined her to secrecy and had perhaps in some sleightful manner misrepresented my own attitude towards him you dont understand him she said repeatedly he is very temperamental the whole affair was a maddening mystery but it seemed more and more that the girl herself was being drawn either directly or indirectly into the same fantasmal web that had enmeshed the artist i surmised that amberville had done several new pictures of the meadow but he did not show them to me nor even mention them my own impressions of the place as time went on assumed an unaccountable vividness that was almost hallucinatory the incredible idea of some inherent force or personality malevolent and even vampirish became an unavowed conviction against my will the place haunted me like a fantasm horrible but seductive i felt an impelling morbid curiosity an unwholesome desire to visit it again and fathom if possible its enigma often i thought of ambervilles notion about a genius loci that dwelt in the meadow and the hints of a human apparition that was somehow associated with the spot also i wondered what it was that the artist had seen on the one occasion when he had lingered in the meadow after nightfall and had returned to my house in driven terror it seemed that he had not ventured to repeat the experiment in spite of his obvious subjection to the unknown lure the end cane abruptly and without premonition business had taken me to the county seat one afternoon and i did not return till late in the evening a full moon was high above the pinedark hills i expected to find avis and the painter in my drawingroom but they were not there li sing my factotum told me that they had returned at dinnertime an hour later amberville had gone out quietly while the girl was in her room coming down a few minutes later avis had shown excessive perturbation when she found him absent and had also left the house as if to follow him without telling li sing where she was going or when she might return all this had occurred three hours previously and neither of the pair had yet reappeared a black and subtly chilling intuition of evil seized me as i listened to li sings account all too well i surmised that amberville had yielded to the temptation of a second nocturnal visit to that unholy meadow an occult attraction somehow had overcome the horror of his first experience whatever it had been avis knowing where he was and perhaps fearful of his sanity or safety had gone out to find him more and more i felt an imperative conviction of some peril that threatened them both some hideous and innominable thing to whose power perhaps they had already yielded whatever my previous folly and remissness in the matter i did not delay now a few minutes of driving at precipitate speed through the mellow moonlight brought me to the piny edge of the chapman property there as on my former visit i left the car and plunged headlong through the shadowy forest far down in the hollow as i went i heard a single scream shrill with terror and abruptly terminated i felt sure that the voice was that of avis but i did not hear it again running desperately i emerged in the meadowbottom neither avis nor amberville was in sight and it seemed to me in my hasty scrutiny that the place was full of mysteriously coiling and moving vapours that permitted only a partial view of the dead willow and the other vegetation i ran on towards the scummy pool and nearing it was arrested by a sudden and twofold horror avis and amberville were floating together in the shallow pool with their bodies half hidden by the mantling masses of algae the girl was clasped tightly in the painters arms as if he had carried her with him against her will to that noisome death her face was covered by the evil greenish scum and i could not see the face of amberville which was averted against her shoulder it seemed that there had been a struggle but both were quiet now and had yielded supinely to their doom it was not this spectacle alone however that drove me in mad and shuddering flight from the meadow without making even the most tentative attempt to retrieve the drowned bodies the true horror lay in the thing which from a little distance i had taken for the coils of a slowly moving and rising mist it was not vapour nor anything else that could conceivably exist that malign luminous pallid emanation that enfolded the entire scene before me like a restless and hungrily wavering extension of its outlines a phantom projection of the pale and deathlike willow the dying alders the reeds the stagnant pool and its suicidal victims the landscape was visible through it as through a film but it seemed to curdle and thicken gradually in places with some unholy terrifying activity out of these curdlings as ifdisgorged by the ambient exhalation i saw the emergence of three human faces that partook of the same nebulous matter neither mist nor plasma one of these faces seemed to detach itself from the bole of the ghostly willow the second and third swirled upwards from the seething of the phantom pool with their bodies trailing formlessly among the tenuous boughs the faces were those of old chapman of francis amberville and avis olcott behind this eerie wraithlike projection of itself the actual landscape leered with the same infernal and vampirish air which it had worn by day but it seemed now that the place was no longer still that it seethed with a malignant secret life that it reached out towards me with its scummy waters with the bony fingers of its trees with the spectral faces it had spewed forth from its lethal deadfall even terror was frozen within me for a moment i stood watching while the pale unhallowed exhalation rose higher above the meadow the three human faces through a further agitation of the curdling mass began to approach each other slowly inexpressibly they merged in one becoming an androgynous face neither young nor old that melted finally into the lengthening phantom boughs of the willow the hands of the arboreal death that were reaching out to enfold me then unable to bear the spectacle any longer i started to run there is little more that need be told for nothing that i could add to this narrative would lessen the abomiable mystery of it all in any degree the meadow or the thing that dwells in the meadow has already claimed three victims and i sometimes wonder if it will have a fourth i alone it would seem among the living have guessed the secret of chapmans death and the death of avis and amberville and no one else apparently has felt the malign genius of the meadow i have not returned there since the morning when the bodies of the artist and his fianc–πe were removed from the pool nor have i summoned up the resolution to destroy or otherwise dispose of the four oil paintings and two watercolordrawings of the spot that were made by amberville perhaps in spite of all that deters me i shall visit it again
