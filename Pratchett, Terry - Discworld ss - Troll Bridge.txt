terry pratchett troll bridge terry pratchett troll bridge the air blew off the mountains filling the air with fine ice crystals it was too cold to snow in weather like this wolves came down into villages trees in the heart of the forest exploded when they froze in weather like this rightthinking people were indoors in front of the fire telling stories about heroes it was an old horse it was an old rider the horse looked like a shrinkwrapped toast rack the man looked as though the only reason he wasnt falling off was because he couldnt muster the energy despite the bitterly cold wind he was wearing nothing but a tiny leather kilt and a dirty bandage on one knee he took the soggy remnant of a cigarette out of his mouth and stubbed it out on his hand right he said lets do it thats all very well for you to say said the horse but what if you have one of your dizzy spells and your back is playing up how shall i feel being eaten because your backs played you up at the wrong moment itll never happen said the man he lowered himself on to the chilly stones and blew on his fingers then from the horses pack he took a sword with an edge like a badly maintained saw and gave a few halfhearted thrusts at the air still got the old knackaroony he said he winced and leaned against a tree ill swear this bloody sword gets heavier every day you ought to pack it in you know said the horse call it a day this sort of thing at your time of life its not right the man rolled his eyes blast that damn distress auction this is what comes of buying something that belonged to a wizard he said to the cold world in general i looked at your teeth i looked at your hooves it never occurred to me to listen who did you think was bidding against you said the horse cohen the barbarian stayed leaning against the tree he was not sure that he could pull himself upright again you must have plenty of treasure stashed away said the horse we could go rimwards how about it nice and warm get a nice warm place by a beach somewhere what do you say no treasure said cohen spent it all drank it all gave it all away lost it you should have saved some for your old age never thought id have an old age one day youre going to die said the horse it might be today i know why do you think ive come here the horse turned and looked down towards the gorge the road here was pitted and cracked young trees were pushing up between the stones the forest crowded in on either side in a few years no one would know thered even been a road here by the look of it no one knew now youve come here to die no but theres something ive always been meaning to do ever since i was a lad yeah cohen tried easing himself upright again tendons twanged their redhot messages down his legs my dad he squeaked he got control again my dad he said said to me he fought for breath son said the horse helpfully what son said the horse no father ever calls his boy son unless hes about to impart wisdom wellknown fact its my reminiscence sorry he said son yes ok son when you can face down a troll in single combat then you can do anything the horse blinked at him then it turned and looked down again through the treejostled road to the gloom of the gorge there was a stone bridge down there a horrible feeling stole over it its hooves jiggled nervously on the ruined road rimwards it said nice and warm no whats the good of killing a troll whatve you got when youve killed a troll a dead troll thats the point anyway i dont have to kill it just defeat it one on one mano a troll and if i didnt try my father would turn in his mound you told me he drove you out of the tribe when you were eleven best days work he ever did taught me to stand on other peoples feet come over here will you the horse sidled over cohen got a grip on the saddle and heaved himself fully upright and youre going to fight a troll today said the horse cohen fumbled in the saddlebag and pulled out his tobacco pouch the wind whipped at the shreds as he rolled another skinny cigarette in the cup of his hands yeah he said and youve come all the way out here to do it got to said cohen when did you last see a bridge with a troll under it there were hundreds of em when i was a lad now theres more trolls in the cities than there are in the mountains fat as butter most of em what did we fight all those wars for now cross that bridge it was a lonely bridge across a shallow white and treacherous river in a deep valley the sort of place where you got a grey shape vaulted over the parapet and landed splayfooted in front of the horse it waved a club all right it growled oh the horse began the troll blinked even the cold and cloudy winter skies seriously reduced the conductivity of a trolls silicon brain and it had taken it this long to realize that the saddle was unoccupied it blinked again because it could suddenly feel a knife point resting on the back of its neck hello said a voice by its ear the troll swallowed but very carefully look it said desperately its tradition ok a bridge like this people ort to expect a troll ere it added as another thought crawled past ow come i never eard you creepin up on me because im good at it said the old man thats right said the horse hes crept up on more people than youve had frightened dinners the troll risked a sideways glance bloody hell it whispered you think youre cohen the barbarian do you what do you think said cohen the barbarian listen said the horse if he hadnt wrapped sacks round his knees you could have told by the clicking it took the troll some time to work this out oh wow it breathed on my bridge wow what said cohen the troll ducked out of his grip and waved its hands frantically its all right its all right it shouted as cohen advanced youve got me youve got me im not arguing i just want to call the family up all right otherwise no onell ever believe me cohen the barbarian on my bridge its huge stony chest swelled further my bloody brotherinlaws always swanking about his huge bloody wooden bridge thats all my wife ever talks about hah id like to see the look on his face oh no what can you think of me good question said cohen the troll dropped its club and seized one of cohens hands micas the name it said you dont know what an honour this is he leaned over the parapet beryl get up here bring the kids he turned back to cohen his face glowing with happiness and pride beryls always sayin we ought to move out get something better but i tell her this bridge has been in our family for generations theres always been a troll under death bridge its tradition a huge female troll carrying two babies shuffled up the bank followed by a tail of smaller trolls they lined up behind their father watching cohen owlishly this is beryl said the troll his wife glowered at cohen and this he propelled forward a scowling smaller edition of himself clutching a junior version of his club is my lad scree a real chip off the old block going to take on the bridge when im gone aint you scree look lad this is cohen the barbarian what dyou think o that eh on our bridge we dont just have rich fat soft ole merchants like your uncle pyrites gets said the

what a clossus was and felt beryls stony gaze fixed upon him hes just a little old man she said he dont look very heroic to me if hes so good why aint he rich now you listen to me mica began this is what weve been waiting for is it said his wife sitting under a leaky bridge the whole time waiting for people that never come waiting for little old bandylegged old men i should have listened to my

old men he gets big fat merchants hes someone you should have gone in with him when you had the chance id rather eat worms worms hah since when could we afford to eat worms can we have a word said cohen he strolled towards the far end of the bridge swinging his sword from one hand the troll padded after him cohen fumbled for his tobacco pouch he looked up at the troll and held out the bag smoke he said that stuff can kill you said the troll yes but not today dont you hang about talking to your nogood friends bellowed beryl from her end of the bridge todays your day for going down to the sawmill you know chert said he couldnt go on holding the job open if you werent taking it seriously mica gave cohen a sorrowful little smirk shes very supportive he said im not climbing all the way down to the river to pull you out again beryl roared you tell him about the billy goats mr big troll billy goats said cohen i dont know anything about billy goats said mica shes always going on about billy goats i have no knowledge whatsoever about billy goats he winced they watched beryl usher the young trolls down the bank and into the darkness under the bridge the thing is said cohen when they were alone i wasnt intending to kill you the trolls face fell you werent just throw you over the bridge and steal whatever treasure youve got you were cohen patted him on the back besides he said i like to see people with good memories thats what the land needs good memories the troll stood to attention i try to do my best sir it said my lad wants to go off to work in the city ive tole him theres bin a troll under this bridge for nigh on five hundred years so if you just hand over the treasure said cohen ill be getting along the trolls face creased in sudden panic treasure havent got any it said oh come on said cohen wellsetup bridge like this yeah but no one uses this road any more said mica youre the first one along in months and thats a fact beryl says i ought to have gone in with her brother when they built that new road over his bridge but he raised his voice i said theres been trolls under this bridge yeah said cohen the trouble is the stones keep on falling out said the troll and youd never believe what those masons charge bloody dwarfs you cant trust em he leaned towards cohen to tell you the truth im having to work three days a week down at my brotherinlaws lumber mill just to make ends meet i thought your brotherinlaw had a bridge said cohen one of em has but my wifes got brothers like dogs have fleas said the troll he looked gloomily into the torrent one of ems a lumber merchant down in sour water one of em runs the bridge and the big fat one is a merchant over on bitter pike call that a proper job for a troll one of thems in the bridge business though said cohen bridge business sitting in a box all day charging people a silver piece to walk across half the time he aint even there he just pays some dwarf to take the money and he calls himself a troll you cant tell him from a human till youre right up close cohen nodded understandingly dyou know said the troll i have to go over and have dinner with them every week all three of em and listen to em go on about moving with the times he turned a big sad face to cohen whats wrong with being a troll under a bridge he said i was brought up to be a troll under a bridge i want young scree to be a troll under a bridge after im gone whats wrong with that youve got to have trolls under bridges otherwise whats it all about whats it all for they leaned morosely on the parapet looking down into the white water you know said cohen slowly i can remember when a man could ride all the way from here to the blade mountains and never see another living thing he fingered his sword at least not for very long he threw the butt of his cigarette into the water its all farms now all little farms run by little people and fences everywhere everywhere you look farms and fences and little people shes right of course said the troll continuing some interior conversation theres no future in just jumping out from under a bridge i mean said cohen ive nothing against farms or farmers youve got to have them its just that they used to be a long way off around the edges now this is the edge pushed back all the time said the troll changing all the time like my brotherinlaw chert a lumber mill a troll running a lumber mill and you should see the mess hes making of cutshade forest cohen looked up surprised what the one with the giant spiders in it spiders there aint no spiders now just stumps stumps stumps i used to like that forest it was well it was darksome you dont get proper darksome any more you really knew what terror was in a forest like that you want darksome hes replanting with spruce said mica spruce its not his idea he wouldnt know one tree from another thats all down to clay he put him up to it cohen felt dizzy whos clay i said id got three brothersinlaw right hes the merchant so he said replanting would make the land easier to sell there was a long pause while cohen digested this then he said you cant sell cutshade forest it doesnt belong to anyone yeah he says thats why you can sell it cohen brought his fist down on the parapet a piece of stone detached itself and tumbled down into the gorge sorry he said thats all right bits fall off all the time like i said cohen turned whats happening i remember all the big old wars dont you you must have fought i carried a club yeah it was supposed to be for a bright new future and law and stuff thats what people said well i fought because a big troll with a whip told me to said mica cautiously but i know what you mean i mean it wasnt for farms and spruce trees was it mica hung his head and heres me with this apology for a bridge i feel really bad about it he said you coming all this way and everything and there was some king or other said cohen vaguely looking at the water and i think there were some wizards but there was a king im pretty certain there was a king never met him you know he grinned at the troll i cant remember his name dont think they ever told me his name about half an hour later cohens horse emerged from the gloomy woods on to a bleak windswept moorland it plodded on for a while before saying all right how much did you give him twelve gold pieces said cohen whyd you give him twelve gold pieces i didnt have more than twelve you must be mad when i was just starting out in the barbarian hero business said cohen every bridge had a troll under it and you couldnt go through a forest like weve just gone through without a dozen goblins trying to chop your head off he sighed i wonder what happened to em all you said the horse well yes but i always thought thered be some more i always thought thered be some more edges how old are you said the horse dunno old enough to know better then yeah right cohen lit another cigarette and coughed until his eyes watered going soft in the head yeah giving your last dollar to a troll yeah cohen wheezed a stream of smoke at the sunset why cohen stared at the sky the red glow was as cold as the slopes of hell an icy wind blew across the steppes whipping at what remained of his hair for the sake of the way things should be he said hah for the sake of things that were hah cohen looked down he grinned and for three addresses one day im going to die he said but not i think today the air blew off the mountains filling the air with fine ice crystals it was too cold to snow in weather like this wolves came down into villages trees in the heart of the forest exploded when they froze except there were fewer and fewer wolves these days and less and less forest in weather like this rightthinking people were indoors in front of the fire telling stories about heroes
